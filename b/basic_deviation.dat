40|$|Refractive index (RI) {{matching}} is {{a unique}} way of making clear emulsions to meet market trends. However, RI matching has not been sufficiently investigated in terms of physical principles and methodologies. Snell's law (n 2 sin r 2 = nj sin r•) is applicable to cosmetic emulsions. When oil phase and water phase have equal RI (n 2 = nl) values, light will not bend as it strikes obliquely at the emulsion interface. Instead, light is transmitted through the emulsion without refraction, which produces clarity. Theoretical RI values in solution can be calculated with summation of {{the product of the}} weight percentage and refractive index of each ingredient (RI [...] . [...] [W • x n • + W 2 x n • + W 3 x n 3 + ß ß ß + W, x n,]/W?). Oil-phase RI values are normally at 1. 4 or higher. Glycols are used to adjust the water phase RI, since they typically have larger RI values than water. Noticeable deviations from calculated RI values are seen in experimentally prepared solutions. Three <b>basic</b> <b>deviation</b> types are observed: negative, positive, and slightly negative or positive, which can occur in glycol aqueous olutions at different concentrations. The deviations are attributed to changes in molecular interaction between molecules in solution, which can lead to changes in specific gravity. Negative RI deviation corresponds to a decrease in specific gravity, and positive RI deviation corresponds to an increase in specific gravity. RI values will deviate fom calculated values since an increase or decrease in specific gravity leads to a change in optical density...|$|E
40|$|Often {{features}} {{are presented as}} clean, neat, simple. Indeed it is the contrast with the idiosyncrasies of lexical items which gives the intuitive justification for features. But reality is more complex. There are many instances where it is arguable whether we should postulate a feature (value), as with person in Archi. We must recognize that feature systems vary: (a) according to how well founded they are, and (b) in how they distribute across the lexicon. To analyse this difficult area, the penumbra of feature systems, I start from an idealized view, and then plot the deviations from that ideal. In other words, I take a ‘canonical’ approach. Having justified this approach in general terms, I propose {{a specific set of}} converging criteria for canonical features and values, concentrating on the genuine morphosyntactic features. In brief, the overarching principles are that a canonical morphosyntactic feature is constrained by simple rules of syntax (including the claim that syntax is ‘morphology-free’) and has robust formal marking. These give us a point in the theoretical space from which to calibrate the difficult instances which abound in feature systems. In accounts of particular features, various types of what we may call non-canonical behaviour have been pointed out: e. g., non-autonomous case values (Zaliznjak 1973), minor numbers, inquorate genders. We should ask whether these problems are feature-specific or whether they recur in the different morphosyntactic features. It turns out that, at the right level of abstraction, we find similar instances of non-canonicity with the different features. Let us concentrate on the criteria contributing to ‘robust formal marking’: Criterion 1 : Canonical features and their values have dedicated forms. We find non-autonomous case values (violating criterion 1), in Classical Armenian, for instance (Baerman 2002); similarly we find non-autonomous gender values (as in Romanian). Criterion 2 : Canonical features and their values are uniquely distinguishable across other logically compatible features and their values. Deviations give sub-genders (Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian), sub-cases (Russian) and sub-numbers (Biak). Criterion 3 : Canonical features and their values are distinguished consistently across relevant parts of speech (word classes). In the easy examples, one part of speech has values which represent a collapsing of values available on another. More interesting are systems where combinations give additional values: combined gender systems (Mba), constructed number systems (Mele-Fila) and combined person (Maybrat). Criterion 4 : Canonical features and their values are distinguished consistently across lexemes within relevant parts of speech. The <b>basic</b> <b>deviation</b> gives us a minor value: as in a minor number value (Bezhta), a minor case (Russian), a minor gender (Lelemi). This leads {{to the question of whether}} such deviations can co-exist. I give a striking example: the Russian second genitive exhibits all four types of non-canonical behaviour concurrently. Since it deviates from all four listed criteria this marks the extreme of the typological space. By investigating the penumbra of feature systems, including the possible and impossible interactions within the penumbra (which {{features are}} the context for the deviations of others), we put the theory of morphosyntactic features on a more realistic and hence firmer foundation...|$|E

40|$|A {{constitutive}} model based on rate-independent elastoplasticity concepts is developed {{and used to}} simulate the behavior of geologic materials under arbitrary three-dimensional stress paths. The model accounts for {{various factors such as}} friction, stress path and stress history that influence the behavior of geologic materials. A hierarchical approach is adopted whereby models of progressively increasing sophistication are developed from a basic isotropic-hardening associative model. Nonassociativeness is introduced as correction or perturbation to the <b>basic</b> model. <b>Deviation</b> of normality of the plastic strain increments to the yield surface F is captured through nonassociativeness. The plastic potential Q is obtained by applying a correction to F. This simplified approach restricts the number of extra parameters required to define the plastic potential Q. The material constants associated with the model are identified, and they are evaluated for three different sands (Leighton Buzzard, Munich and McCormick Ranch). The model is then verified by comparing predictions with laboratory tests from which the constants were found, and typical tests not used for finding the constants. The effect of varying initial density of a material on the stress-strain and volumetric response is investigated. An empirical relation is proposed, whereby one parameter is modified based on the initial density, such that improved predictions can be obtained without increasing the total number of parameters. Implementation of the nonassociative model in a finite element program to solve boundary value problems leads to a nonsymmetric stiffness matrix. Besides, using a nonsymmetric solver, three numerical schemes are investigated. The idea of the schemes is to modify the stiffness matrix such that a symmetric equation solver can be used. Prediction of stress-strain, volumetric response and CPU time for different schemes are compared with the predictions obtained using the nonsymmetric solver. The nonsymmetric equation solver used less CPU time and the solutions were more accurate. Based on the above findings, a soil-footing system is analyzed using the finite element techniques. The associative and nonassociative models are used to predict the behavior. For the nonassociative model, solution is obtained by using a nonsymmetric solver.

40|$|Microcalorimetry and {{simultaneous}} TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) and TGA (thermogravimetric-analysis) measurements {{have been}} used to study the adsorption of a variety of bases on addic molecular sieves. The effects of molecular-sieve structure, aluminum content, crystallite size, and adsorbate functional group were investigated. ^ First, microcalorimetry was used to measure heats of formation (Δ Hads) for the 1 : 1 complexes formed by a series of amines and pyridines in H-ZSM- 5 and H-Mordenite. An excellent correlation was found between the Δ Hads and the gas-phase proton affinities (PA) of the <b>basic</b> adsorbates. <b>Deviations</b> from the straight line correlations are related to specific interactions in the adsorption complexes. Furthermore this data set demonstrated that one cannot obtain a Bronsted-acidity scale for solid acids from Δ Hads of ammonia or pyridine or any other single reference base. ^ A series of weaker bases, including alcohols, nitriles, water, and diethyl ether were also examined on H-ZSM- 5 and silicalite. For the nitriles and diethyl ether, Δ Hads in H-ZSM- 5 also correlates with PA; however, the slope of the correlation was no longer unity with amines and pyridines. The 1 : 1 complexes for alcohols and water were not easily observable in microcalorimetry, probably due to their hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor capabilities, which resulted in cluster formation. ^ A combination of microcalorimetry measurements for ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile, along with reactivity measurements for several hydrocarbon reactions, were used to examine the effect of trivalent ions (i. e. Fe and Ga) incorporated into the ZSM- 5 framework. Δ Hads for all three bases were constant up to a coverage of 1 /site for all three molecular sieves and were essentially independent of trivalent cation. However, the results of reactivity of the Bronsted sites in H- (Fe) ZSM- 5 were much lower than H- (Al) ZSM- 5 and H- (Ga) ZSM- 5. This implies that Δ Hads of ammonia, pyridine and acetonitrile cannot predict catalytic activities of these materials. ^ Finally TPD-TGA studies of various amines were used to determine the total and external acid site densities of 8 -membered ring zeolites. ...|$|R

The most popular solo {{instrument of the}} Renaissance was the lute. Much as with the piano of today, the lute was a common feature in most cultured households. Grout???s History of Western Music writes that the lute was an extremely versatile instrument often used in ensembles, to accompany singing, and {{could be used by}} a skilled performer to produce a great variety of musical effects. A considerable part of the instrumental music of the sixteenth century consisted of dance pieces for lute, keyboard and ensembles. The guitar transcriptions of these lute pieces by Oscar Chilesotti captures the dance and improvisational textures of the time period. The lute pieces in the program consist of three main types of dance; the Saltarello, Gagliarda and Canzona. A Saltarello is a gay, sprightly dance very popular in Renaissance Western Europe, especially Italy. Saltarellos were commonly relegated to royal court balls. The Saltarello dance is related to the Gagliarda dance in style, rhythm and step. The main difference between the two is that the Gagliarda is a more vigorously performed dance.

40|$|The {{theory of}} large {{deviations}} {{is concerned with}} the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the <b>basics</b> of large <b>deviation</b> theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.

40|$|Applied {{navigation}} tasks, such as {{driving a}} car, present unique opportunities {{to study the}} human perception/action system. Traditionally, research into the control of locomotion has assumed that humans choose a destination and then generally look where they go. However, evidence from motorcycle and equitation manuals, for instance, suggests that the reciprocal behavior is also important. That is, even with a distinct goal in the environment, people tend to navigate in the direction they are looking, only occasionally checking on their progress toward a destination and making adjustments as necessary. Considering the implications for the performance and safety of drivers, {{the present study is}} designed to investigate effects of gaze-eccentricity on basic steering abilities. Using a 180 -degree horizontal FoV projection theater, we simulated a car moving through a textured environment while participants used a forced-feedback steering-wheel to control direction of travel. During each trial, participants (n= 12) were asked to fixate a Landolt-C figure which was displayed in one of 7 positions (0, +/- 15, 30, or 45 degrees from center) anchored on the screen, and drive down the center of a straight road. In order to ensure fixation, the orientation of the Landolt-C varied randomly between 4 positions (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) and participants were required to respond to particular orientations by pressing a button on the steering-wheel. The lateral position of the driver was measured during the trial. In this <b>basic</b> condition, significant <b>deviations</b> from straight ahead were found when conditions of eccentric gaze were compared to fixation at 0 degrees (p< 0. 001). Specifically, fixation {{to one side of the}} street systematically lead the driver to steer in that direction.

40|$|Chapter 1 is a non {{technical}} {{introduction to}} the thesis. In chapter 2, <b>Basics</b> of Large <b>Deviation</b> Theory, we illustrate the basic idea of large devi- ation theory and brie‡y review the history of its development. As a preparation, some of the important theorems which we will employ in the following chapters are also introduced. In chapter 3, Asymptotic Optimality of Empirical Likelihood Tests With Weakly Dependent Data, we extend the result of Kitamura (2001) to stationary mixing data. The key thing in proving the large deviation optimality is that the empirical measure of the independently and identically distributed data will obey the large deviation principal (LDP) with rate function equal to the relative entropy, but in general the large deviation performance of empirical measure of dependent data is complicated. In this chapter we add S-mixing condition to the stationary process and we show that the rate function of the LDP of S-mixing process is indeed equal to the relative entropy, and then asymptotic optimality follows from the large deviation inequality. In chapter 4, Large Deviations of Empirical Likelihood with Nuisance Parameters, we discuss the asymptotic e¢ ciency of empirical likelihood {{in the presence of}} nuisance parameters combined with augmented moment conditions. We show that in the presence of nuisance parameters, the asymptotic e¢ ciency of the empirical likelihood estimator of the parameter of interest will increase by adding more moment conditions, {{in the sense of the}} positive semide…niteness of the di¤erence of information matrices. As a by-product, we point out a necessary condition for the asymptotic e¢ ciency to be increased when more moment condition are added. We also derive asymptotic lower bounds of the minimax risk functions for the estimator of the parameter of interest, and we show that the empirical likelihood estimator can achieve this bound. In chapter 5, Empirical Likelihood Estimation of Auction Models via Simulated Moment Conditions, we apply empirical likelihood estimation to the simplest …rst-price sealed bid auc- tion model with independent private values. Through estimation of the parameter in the distri- bution function of bidders’private values we consider a potential problem in the EL inference when the moment condition is not in an explicit form and hard to compute, or even not con- tinuous in the parameter of interest. We deal with this issue following the method of simulated moment through importance sampling. We demonstrate the convergence of the empirical likeli- hood estimator from the simulated moment condition, and found that the asymptotic variance is larger than usual which is disturbed by simulatio...|$|R
40|$|Japanese carp or carp koi (Cyprinus carpio koi) – is a freshwater, {{partially}} {{saltwater fish}} {{which is a}} decorative subspecies of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) namely a primary black form of carp koi that has its domestic name Magoi. Constant complex activity of abiotic and biotic factors together with husbandry and selectional activity of human caused significant changes in water ecosystems that impacted on the biology of carp koi subspecies (Cyprinus carpio koi) {{and as a result}} caused the species-specific morphological adaptations in fish.   Collection of materials was conducted from ornamental water ponds at the territory of Nemishaievo state agrotechnical college in the spring 2012. Author selected 3000 units of this year fish offsprings of carp koi with different colors. All the studied fish was divided into groups according to external indexes (among them color) in the following way: group I (sample) – grey and white form (Hikarimuji which is the most similar to Magoi), group II – black and white form (Kumonryu), group III – black and yellow form (Utsurimono), group IV – red and white form (Kohaku). For further researches scientists selected 25 exemplars of carp koi for each group. It is necessary to have a starting point (sample) for statistical research of differences in carp koi forms. Sample or optimal form was determined by distances of deviations of scalar sums of form vectors of carp koi from nyvkivskyi carp. Morphometric study of carp koi was conducted according to 30 plastic attributes, in accordance with method proposed by I. F. Pravdin. In contrast with generally accepted relative magnitudes of indexes of plastic attributes of carp koi body were calculated from zoological (not standard) length of the body of the fish that is connected with using koi as an object of decorative aquaculture. Statistic processing was conducted with using of average arithmetical discrepancy, root-mean-square error and variability index. Actuality of variances of morphometric indexes of fish from different groups is mathematically approved by Student’s index-criterion. Variances were considered to be valid if Student’s criterion exceeded 2, 68 at insurance level of magnitude α = 0, 01 that is accepted as an ample for majority of biological objects. By comparison of different carp koi (Cyprinus carpio koi) forms researchers used Mayr’s coefficient of resolution. (CD). It is evident that the less curves of two compared populations are lapped over, the more difference is between middle М 1 and М 2 divided by sum of middle quadric deviations σ 1 і σ 2. Coefficient of directive deviation (Кdv) characterizes percentage deviation of two compared indexes of particular attribute. For deviation determination (Кdv) between the index, the difference between an attribute A and the same attribute of sample index E is necessary to divide by index of attribute E and multiply by 100 %. Estimation criterion is the same as in variability index – low level of deviation Кdv ≤ 5 %, middle Кdv  = 10 - 30 %, large Кdv > 30 - 50 %. At conducting the morphological analysis of groups №I-IV of carp koi different forms authors researched 30 plastic attributes. Plastic attributes were grouped according to indexes which were determined by percents from zoological length of the body (standard length, trunk length, the biggest and smallest heights, antidorsal and postdorsal distances, length of tail-stem, antipectoral, antiventral, antianal pectroventral, ventroanal distances and length of a head); were determined by percents from length of a head (length of a fish snout, eye diameter, sight unseen distance, height and width of forehead, lengths of lower and upper jaw, height of the head near the nape and through the middle of the eye) but the measuring of all the fins were held separately so as for koi they are the criterion for estimation of form quality, which also were determined by percents from body length (the biggest height and length of dorsal fin, the biggest height and length of anal fin, length of chest and ventral fin, lower and upper flippers of tail fin). Taking research into account we determined the sample form (group № 1) which according to indexes of growth potential was proved to be the best, it means that difference from Amur carp in group № 1 was the lowest. The majority of researched plastic attributes expressed in nominal average data of compared forms (groups) of Japanese carp koi (№I-IV) were on quite low level of variation (pic. 1.) : variability index did not exceed 10 %, approximately third part of indexes were on middle level of variation, variability index was in boundaries of 10 - 25 % and only one index (forehead height) was on high level of variation (more than 25 %). Trustworthiness of variances of Japanese carp koi different forms between sample group (№I) and every group from research colorful forms was mathematically approved  by indexes of Student’s criterion (tst), Mayr’s variability index (CD) and by coefficient of directed deviation (Кdv). Emerging from these estimation criteria of trustworthiness of variances between attributes of different carp koi forms it may be concluded that from 30 different attributes only 5 are approved at least by two coefficients (table). Large difference at once by 3 coefficients is approved between sample and group №IV according to “forehead height (ho) ” which estimates tst  = 9, 8 ≥ tcr = 2, 68; CD = 1, 46; Кdv = 32, 1 %, thus achieving the level of subspecies according to Mayr’s coefficient. But the indexes of this attribute are impossible to be adequately estimated because of difficulties in the process of its measuring, indexes of this attribute should better be considered among with other attributes. But there are attributes that point at trustworthy variance according to index of Student’s criterion (tst) and are approved by coefficient of directed deviation (Kdv). As you can see the <b>basic</b> level of <b>deviations</b> is concentrated on the attributes which were determined from head length (ho, mx, mn). These attributes may characterize the adjustment of carp koi to more active catching of food items, so as brighter colorful indexes scare them, especially when the water in water pond is highly limpid. It is also interesting to note the high density of fish planting (3000 exemplars per 0, 2 ha), it tells us about high level of contest between different colorful  koi forms for food organisms. Among other things, increased indexes of attributes like “tail-stem length” (pl) and “basis of anal fin length” (lA) in three the brightest groups may point at increase of reoration power in these fish. It is possible to make an assumption that increase of indexes of these attributes was not caused by other factors of water environment, except bright color of fish (it means that this attribute may characterize connection of colorful carp koi forms with difficulties at gaining food organisms. Author conducted morpho-metric study of basic forms of Japanese carp koi. Study showed the specificity of variational changes of plastic attributes of different forms of carp koi upon condition of keeping them in the same conditions. Author researched the variance between forms of carps koi, which is proved by indexes of Student coefficients, Mayr resolution and by directional deviation.
