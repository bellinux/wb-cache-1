25|$|In contrast, photosystem I and ATP synthase {{are large}} protein {{complexes}} which jut {{out into the}} stroma. They can't fit in the appressed granal membranes, and so {{are found in the}} stromal thylakoid membrane—the edges of the granal thylakoid disks and the stromal thylakoids. These large protein complexes may act as spacers <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> of stromal thylakoids.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> in {{the spiral}} channels is maintained by using spacer studs that were welded prior to rolling. Once the main spiral pack has been rolled, alternate {{top and bottom}} edges are welded and each end closed by a gasketed flat or conical cover bolted to the body. This ensures no mixing of the two fluids occurs. Any leakage is from the periphery cover to the atmosphere, or to a passage that contains the same fluid.|$|E
40|$|Processes and apparati for shaping {{sheet glass}} or {{thermoplastic}} materials use force from {{a layer of}} a flowing fluid, such as air, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> and a mandrel at close to the softening temperature of the thermoplastic. The shape is preserved by cooling. The shape of the air bearing mandrel and the pressure distribution of the fluid contribute to the final shape. A process can be conducted {{on one or two}} surfaces such that the force from the air layer is on one or two surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>The</b> gap size <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> and mandrel determines the pressure profile in the gap, which also determines <b>the</b> final <b>sheet</b> shape. In general, smaller gaps lead to larger viscous forces. The pressure profile depends on the shape of the mandrel, the size of the fluid gap and <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> and <b>the</b> fluid supply pressure...|$|R
30|$|In {{the drawing}} process, <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and punch are {{in close contact}} with each other when {{entering}} the die cavity. During this process, <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal slides through the blank holder and lower die surface. Therefore, friction must be increased <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and punch or decreased <b>between</b> <b>the</b> metal <b>sheet</b> and blank-holder or lower die to improve formability (Gong et al. 2011). Gong et al. (2011) used a diamond-like carbon coated blank holder and lower die in a cylindrical cup microforming experiment to reduce friction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> metal <b>sheet</b> and lower die and the blank holder, thereby enhancing formability. Additionally, the micro-features can be used to change the physical properties of the contact surface of the material (Segu and Kim 2014). Steinhoff et al. (1996) investigated the use of deterministic and stochastic surface structures in strip drawing processes. The experimental result shows that the hydrostatic lubrication pockets results in a considerable improvement of the tribological behaviour. Costa and Hutchings (2009) studied the friction effects of controlled surface patterning in tribological situations by using the strip drawing test. The result shows that <b>the</b> relative orientation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> pattern and the drawing direction strongly influenced the friction performance. Moreover, Lin et al. (2015) adopted a microridge punch design that increased not only <b>the</b> friction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and <b>the</b> punch but also the pulling force of the microridges on <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, distributing <b>the</b> pulling force of the punch on <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal to <b>the</b> microridges. This dispersed the pulling force at the nasal fillet of the punch on <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and substantially increased drawability.|$|R
50|$|Due to Ampere's circuital law each {{of these}} {{circular}} currents creates a counter magnetic field (blue arrows), which due to Lenz's law opposes the change in magnetic field which caused it, exerting a drag force on <b>the</b> <b>sheet.</b> At <b>the</b> {{leading edge of the}} magnet (left side) by the right hand rule the counterclockwise current creates a magnetic field pointed up, opposing the magnet's field, causing a repulsive force <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> and <b>the</b> leading edge of the magnet.

Such panels have been commercialized for purposes of daylighting, {{to be used as a}} window or a canopy such that sunlight descending from the sky is directed to the ceiling or into the room rather than to the floor. This can lead to a higher illumination of the back part of a room, in particular when combined with a white ceiling, while having a slight impact on the view to the outside compared to normal glazing.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{have pointed}} out that the Thomas Haley {{character}} shares many traits and biographical details with the author. Like Haley, McEwan studied at the University of Sussex (later also at the University of East Anglia), and not at one of the more prestigious Oxbridge universities. Haley's stories, summarised briefly in the novel, are in several cases strikingly similar to some of McEwan's earlier work. This goes particularly for Haley's dystopian début novel, which closely follows the plot of [...] "Two Fragments", a short story from McEwan's 1978 In <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sheets.</b> The novel wins Haley the fictional Jane Austen Prize for Fiction, just as McEwan's debut First Love, Last Rites was rewarded with the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976. Several of McEwan's acquaintances from this period also make cameo appearances in the novel, including his friend Martin Amis, his first publisher Tom Maschler, and his mentor Ian Hamilton.|$|E
5000|$|Due to Amperes circuital law, each {{of these}} {{circular}} currents creates a counter magnetic field (blue arrows), which due to Lenzs law opposes the change in magnetic field, causing a drag force on <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> which is <b>the</b> braking force exerted by the brake.

J.R. had swindled {{most of the}} other oilmen that he knows to salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization. Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide {{as a result of the}} dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization. The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone, whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil. Marilee's calls to J.R. are refused. Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution. All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings. [...] The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information. J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. [...] Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor/boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information. [...] Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> and learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells. Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R.'s secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. [...] Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her. He is not worried. She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful. When he leaves for another woman she gets upset, but finds a gun lying around, which gives her pause.|$|E

2500|$|As2S3 occurs both in {{crystalline}} and amorphous forms. [...] Both forms feature polymeric structures {{consisting of}} [...] trigonal pyramidal As(III) centres linked by sulfide centres.
