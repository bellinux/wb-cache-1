40|$|Abstract — In large {{multiplexers}} {{with many}} TCP flows, the aggregate traffic flow behaves predictably; {{this is a}} basis for the fluid model of Misra, Gong and Towsley [1] and for a growing literature on fluid models of congestion control. In this paper we argue that different fluid models arise from different buffer-sizing regimes. We consider the large buffer regime (buffer size is bandwidth-delay product), an intermediate regime (divide the large buffer size by the square root of the number of flows), and the small buffer regime (buffer size does not depend on number of flows). Our arguments use various techniques from queueing theory. We study the behaviour of these fluid models (on a single bottleneck link, for a collection of identical longlived flows). For what parameter regimes is the fluid model stable, and when it is unstable what is the size of oscillations and the impact on goodput? Our analysis uses an extension of the Poincaré-Linstedt method to delaydifferential equations. We find that large <b>buffers</b> <b>with</b> drop-tail have much the same performance as intermediate <b>buffers</b> <b>with</b> either drop-tail or AQM; that large <b>buffers</b> <b>with</b> RED are better at least for window sizes less than 20 packets; and that small <b>buffers</b> <b>with</b> either drop-tail or AQM are best over a wide range of window sizes, though the buffer size must be chosen carefully. This suggests that buffer sizes should be much much smaller than is currently recommended...|$|R
40|$|Majority of the proteomic {{studies on}} tissue samples involve {{the use of}} gel-based {{approach}} for profiling and digestion. The laborious gel-based approach is slowly being replaced by the advancing in-solution digestion approach. However, there are still several difficulties such as difficult-to-solubilize proteins, poor proteomic analysis in complex tissue samples, {{and the presence of}} sample impurities. Henceforth, there is a great demand to formulate a highly efficient protein extraction <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> high protein extraction efficiency from tissue samples, high compatibility with in-solution digestion, reduced number of sample handling steps to reduce sample loss, low time consumption, low cost, and ease of usage. Here, we evaluated various existing protein extraction <b>buffers</b> <b>with</b> zebrafish liver tumor samples and found that sodium deoxycholate- (DOC-) based extraction <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> heat denaturation was the most effective approach for highly efficient extraction of proteins from complex tissues such as the zebrafish liver tumor. A total of 4, 790 proteins have been identified using shotgun proteomics approach with 2 D LC, which to our knowledge is the most comprehensive study for zebrafish liver tumor proteome...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2003. BiologyIncludes bibliographical referencesThe {{effectiveness}} of managed buffer zones in protecting an aquatic ecosystem during forest harvesting was studied for a two year period {{on a small}} headwater stream in northeastern Newfoundland, Canada. The study consisted of examining several components including abiotic (water temperature and sedimentation) and biotic (macroinvertebrates and salmonids). These components were studied pre- and post-harvest to determine {{the impact of the}} following riparian management schemes: 20 m no harvest buffer; 20 m <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> 30 % of the basal area harvested; 30 - 50 m <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> 30 % of the basal area harvested; and a no harvest 'control' site. [...] Sedimentation significantly increased for the 20 m <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> selective harvesting. Water temperature was slightly impacted within the optimum temperature class for brook trout (Salvelinus foniinalis) only with a significant decrease for the 30 - 50 m <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> selective harvesting and the 20 m <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> selective harvesting. The stress and lethal temperature classes were not significantly different between pre- and post-harvest observations. The water temperature significantly increased within the upper and lethal temperature classes for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) within the 30 - 50 m <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> selective harvesting. [...] The effects of selective harvesting on aquatic macroinvertebrates varied depending on the index and taxon. The number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) divided by the number of Diptera index was not significantly affected by site and year. However, the number of total EPT? Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Diptera (excluding Chironomidae) and Chironomidae were all significantly affected by site and year. The most notable difference between pre- and post-harvest occurred within the 20 m buffer, where a large increase in Oxythira sp., an algal consumer, was observed. The number of species observed for each of the sites was slightly greater post-harvest, however the differences were not significant. [...] Brook trout and Atlantic salmon populations significantly increased for all three experimental sites except for brook trout within the 20 m buffer site. The biomass of brook trout significantly increased within the 20 m <b>buffer</b> <b>with</b> selective harvesting, while all other differences for brook trout and Atlantic salmon biomass were not significant. Young-of-the-year salmonid populations increased for all three experimental sites, with the exception of brook trout within the 20 m buffer.
