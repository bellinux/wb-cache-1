Safety analysis utilizes two common approaches to evaluate treatment effectiveness: before-and-after study and cross-sectional study. This research performed paired sample t-test statistical analysis to estimate changes in total of crash frequency, crash rates, EPDO crash frequency, and EPDO crash rates at intersections, {{three to five years}} after adding a <b>by-pass</b> <b>lane</b> compared to identical time period before the <b>by-pass</b> <b>lane</b> was added. Crash data between 1990 and 2011 were obtained from Kansas Crash and Analysis Record System (KCARS) maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). In order to perform a cross-sectional study, intersections with by-pass lanes were compared to intersections with no countermeasures; crash data were obtained for more than 1, 100 intersections in the state of Kansas. According to before-and-after study, addition of by-pass lanes improves safety at unsignalized rural intersections; crashes and their severities are reduced after adding by-pass lanes. But, these reductions are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. However, when considering intersection related crashes, a statistically significant reduction in crash rates is happened after adding by-pass lanes at 3 -legged intersections. In cross-sectional study, crashes and their severities are lower at 3 -legged intersections with the by-pass lanes versus 3 -legged intersections without the by-pass lanes. However, these reductions are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. When considering 300 feet intersection crash box, statistically significant reductions are happened at 4 -legged intersection. In contrast, crashes and their severities increased at 4 -legged intersections with the by-pass lanes, but these changes are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. The Crash Modification Factors were calculated to evaluate safety effectiveness of adding by-pass lanes at unsignalized rural intersections. The calculated CMFs less than 1. 0, indicate a reduction in crashes after implementation of by-pass lanes. Finally, this study concluded that expected crashes at intersections with by-pass lanes are lower than intersections without by-pass lanes...|$|E

40|$|A micro-simulation {{approach}} is presented {{for evaluating the}} effectiveness of a transition zone connecting the rural to the urban environment by using speeds computed in simulation for showing whether drivers slow down far enough below the imposed speed limit before entering the small urbanized area. The proposed approach was also applied to prove whether both within the transition zone {{as well as on the}} rural roads approaching this zone, acceptable values of the traffic performance measures expressed in terms of travel time, delay time, mean and maximum queue length, and stop time, were ensured. Five design alternatives based on the horizontal deflection obtained by means of engineering measures associated with different combinations of a T-type intersection and/or roundabouts were tested. The results showed that the simulated mean speeds were lower than the 50 km/h speed limit imposed at the start of the urbanized area for all transition zone schemes investigated. However, the scenario with a roundabout and a T-type intersection to which two auxiliary lanes for right-turns were added was also identified as having better values of the traffic performance measures both within the transition zone and on rural roads entering this zone. The transition zone that was built, in accordance with the experts’ judgments, was found to confirm the effectiveness of the simulated solution in the field both in reducing vehicle speeds and in ensuring acceptable conditions of traffic flow. The design alternative implemented in simulation with the two roundabouts (one of which with two <b>by-pass</b> <b>lanes</b> for right-turns) may represent a future reference for further improvement in the built transition zone. In fact on a roundabout as an alternative to a T-type intersection a reduction in the number of traffic conflicts due to vehicles trajectories is generally expected, and consequently even fewer crashes are also expected to occur at this intersection. Additionally, the present paper introduces also a speed-delay time model based on the results of micro-simulation analysis...|$|R

Although the N2 {{is not included in}} Transport 21 and the recently opened Monaghan and Carrickmacross <b>by-passes</b> are single <b>lane</b> national primary roads, a recent feasibility report completed on the N2 Ashbourne to Ardee section recommends a dual carriageway cross section (this includes the Slane By-pass).
