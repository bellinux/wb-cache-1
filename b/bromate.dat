25|$|The largest use {{of ozone}} {{is in the}} {{preparation}} of pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and many other commercially useful organic compounds, where it is used to sever carbon-carbon bonds. It can also be used for bleaching substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources. Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common chlorine. Ozone has a very high oxidation potential. Ozone does not form organochlorine compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen <b>bromate</b> in source water with high bromide concentrations. The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual free chlorine in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where electrical power is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.|$|E

2500|$|Ozone is an {{unstable}} molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms.

Some {{of the advantages of}} ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems (in comparison to chlorination). Another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water. Ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in Nice, France. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted ozone as being safe; and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment, storage, and processing of foods.

40|$|The {{interest}} in this thesis is the thermodynamic approach to the elucidation of the structures of dilute ionic solutions. Solvation enthalpies of group Ia,IIa and VIIb ions in water, forraamide and the two N-methyl derivatives of forraamide are derived from recently published heat of solution data and from heat of solution measurements made by the author, and are compared with theoretical values calculated using an extended form of Buckingham's theory. The interpretation of solvation entropies suggests that certain structural effects occur {{in the process of}} ion solvation. By including these in the theoretical calculations, good agreement between experiment and theory is obtained. The experimental results presented include: (a) the standard enthalpies of formation and solution in water of magnesium bromide, magnesium iodide, and all of the group IIa fluorides; (b) the standard enthalpies of solution in water of the group II <b>bromates,</b> and of a number of tetra-alkylammonium salts; (c) the standard enthalpies of solution in formamide, N-methylformamide and N,N-dimethylforraamide of a number of group IIa halides and halates.

40|$|This {{report of}} a study {{conducted}} by the Institue for European Environmental Policy, Bonn, for the German Federal Environmental Agency constitutes an international comparative overview of measures adopted {{for the protection of the}} Earth's atmosphere, specifically legislative measures taken in selected industrialised countries in order to avoid and reduce the emissions of ozone depleting substances. The analysis focusses on those laws and regulations which implement the international obligations under the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol. The regulated substances are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs and HCFCs), <b>bromated</b> hydrocarbons (halons) and two chlorinated hydrocarbons, carbontetrachloride and 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane. The legislative measures are analysed using a standard matrix in order to facilitate comparison. On the basis of assessments made country by country, tables of phase-out schedules and lists of regulations pertaining to specific uses are compiled. As a result, it is shown that a large number of the countries surveyed in this study have already adopted legilsation going beyond international commitments. So far, the dynamic technical process in the substitution of ozone depleting substances has allowed for the reduction of the production and use of ozone depleting substances to be accelerated. This acceleration is described in the survey. The international declarations and legislative measures adopted at national level indicate that an agreement concerning a tightening of the phase-out schedules is not only possible, but could also be likely. The report describes the state of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol at the end of 1991. Whilst care was taken, it is not certain that all relevant measures could be included.
