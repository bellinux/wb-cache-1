2500|$|The 30th October 2013, Cubicle 7 {{announces the}} {{development}} of a new roleplaying game, called Lone Wolf Adventure Game, as [...] "a development of the previous Multiplayer Game". A crowdfunding was launched on Kickstarter and collected £68,000. On 26 August 2014, C7 publishes the character sheet with a summary of rules. The core rules were released in 2015 as a boxed set consisting of three books: Book of Kai Training, allowing players to create their own characters for the game, Book of Kai Wisdom, containing the rules to play the game, and the Book of Kai Legends which consists of two adventures and advice on creating future adventures. In addition to the books pre-generated characters and <b>blank</b> <b>character</b> sheets were included. The boxed set was designed to be played straight from the box, with the first adventure in the Book of Kai Legends allowing new players to start with the pre-generated characters and play immediately.|$|E

5000|$|The manuals {{have a lot}} of quotes {{and extra}} {{information}} in the margins, many of which are darkly humorous.

5000|$|MSD radix sorts use lexicographic order, {{which is}} {{suitable}} for sorting strings, such as words, or fixed-length integer representations. A sequence such as [...] "b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, ba" [...] would be lexicographically sorted as [...] "b, ba, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j". If lexicographic ordering is used to sort variable-length integer representations, then the representations of the numbers from 1 to 10 would be output as 1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, as if the shorter keys were left-justified and padded on the right with <b>blank</b> <b>characters</b> to make the shorter keys {{as long as the}} longest key for the purpose of determining sorted order.|$|R

5000|$|In text mode, font bitmap data {{comes from}} the {{character}} ROM on the card, which is only available to the card itself. In graphics modes, text output by the BIOS uses two separate tables. The {{first half of the}} character set (characters numbered 0 through 127, corresponding to 7-bit ASCII with some added graphical symbols) is supplied by a table in the BIOS ROM chip on the computer's mainboard at the fixed address F000:FA6E (the table is still present at this location even in modern PC BIOSes; unlike the font ROM on the CGA card itself that is used for the text modes, this table provides only the [...] "thick" [...] font shapes, not the [...] "thin" [...] ones). The second half of the set (characters numbered 128 through 255, corresponding to the international, block-graphics and mathematics characters) is supplied by the location pointed to by interrupt vector 1F (the vector itself is found at memory address 0000:007C; this is not in fact a real interrupt vector, since the vector does not point to executable machine code, as real interrupt vectors on the PC's Intel 8086 CPU do). The second half of the character set is ordinarily absent (the vector 1F does not point to actual font data), and trying to display it will result in garbage or <b>blank</b> <b>characters.</b> The character data may be placed into memory manually by the user, or by a utility such as GRAFTABL.|$|R

50|$|The printer {{mechanism}} used {{an eight}} sided, seven position (56 character) print slug in a horizontal orientation. The X, O, and 2 {{bits of the}} character code rotate the slug and the 1, 4, and 8 bits selected the position. The platen hammer then struck the paper from behind, causing the selected character to print. Of the 56 characters on the print slug, only 47 were printable with the standard valid character set of the IBM 305 computer—the complete alphabet, numbers 0-9, and eleven special characters (48 characters, including the <b>blank</b> <b>character).</b>|$|E
5000|$|BioWare wanted {{players to}} feel special and {{empowered}} {{from the start}} of the game.

5000|$|The typical {{text file}} format used a zero-byte {{terminator}} to signify {{the end of}} each record. The zero-byte terminator was indicated by, at least, the final twelve bits of a 60-bit word being set to zero. [...] The terminator could actually be anywhere from 12- to 66-bits long - depending on the length of the record. This caused an ambiguity in the 64-character character set, when a colon character needed to be the final character in a record. In such cases a <b>blank</b> <b>character</b> was typically appended to the record after the trailing colon.|$|E

40|$|Rather than a forward-looking lesbian representation, Todd Haynes 2 ̆ 7 s Carol, an {{adaptation}} by Phyllis Nagy of Patricia Highsmith 2 ̆ 7 s 1952 novel, The Price of Salt, looks to images and affective investments {{of the past}} to explore lesbian representability, the historical discourses and aesthetic codes through which desire between women can be recognized.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{contribution}} is to present a program that allows the composition of variablesized curved symbols such as those occurring in mathematics. This application, called CurExt, extends {{the capabilities of the}} well-known TEX system designed by D. E. Knuth for typesetting. Big delimiters, such as brackets, or special curved symbols, such as the Arabic mathematical summation symbol, can be built automatically according to the size and the shape of the concerned mathematical expression. CurExt will make it possible to stretch Arabic letters according to calligraphic rules in order to draw the kashida. It follows a useful tool for justifying texts written with the Arabic alphabet. Unlike in Latin alphabet based writing, where the justification is done through inserting small <b>blanks</b> among <b>characters,</b> cursive writing fills in the space between characters with the kashida.

5000|$|Canadians {{have contributed}} {{greatly to the}} {{technology}} and practices used to create animated television shows, movies and special effects. Starting in 1912, Canadian cartoonist and painter Raoul Barre introduced standard perforations in the drawing paper and [...] "peg bars" [...] to hold them in place which eliminated jerkiness when going from one image to the next. He also introduced the slash system, a method of drawing the background only once (instead of with each frame as had been done previously) on a separate sheet, leaving <b>blank</b> spaces for <b>character</b> movement. In 1913, Barre organized a systematic method of producing animated cartoons in an assembly line fashion. The assembly line method is essentially how all commercial animations (television, film etc.) are created to this day.|$|R
