Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Inaction chafed Ball, and {{he began}} {{agitating}} {{for a return to}} combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No.56 Squadron RFC, considered to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No.56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn's {{interest}} in baroque music {{was not limited}} to the Bach St Matthew Passion which he had revived in 1829. He was concerned in preparing and editing such music, whether for performance or for publication, to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible to the original intentions of the composers, including wherever possible a close study of early editions and manuscripts. This could lead him into conflict with publishers; for instance, his edition of Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt for the London Handel Society (1845) evoked an often contentious correspondence, with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add dynamics where not given by Handel, or to add parts for trombones. Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach's works for organ, and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to the fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals {{for the treatment of}} wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, {{and one of}} the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended to be part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E

25|$|Since 2009 an {{extensive}} upgrade of the avionics and major {{overhaul of the}} airframes {{has been carried out}} by the FAA and FAdeA, creating the IA-58D Pucará Delta.

The overhaul will keep Argentinian Pucarás active until 2045. Bureaucratic and economic issues are delaying the conversion of the entire fleet. The Uruguayan Air Force also showed interest on the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program and installation of new engines offered by FAdeA.|$|E

However, Viking's Turbo Beavers are currently only produced as rebuilds from existing air frames, and have not been manufactured as new-builds, unlike Viking's own DHC-6 Series 400 Twin Otter, which is manufactured using a completely new airframe.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{philosophy}} of Courtney stroke {{is to keep}} the oars (sculls or sweep) in the water as long as possible and in the air as short as possible. To do this, Courtney taught his rowers to sharply lower the hands to the lap when the preceding stroke is finished. This forced the blade of the oar out of the water perpendicular to the surface. Then he required his rowers to quickly shoot their arms forward moving the blade back to start another stroke. He emphasized that the blade should <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible to the water. He wanted the blade to enter the water at slight inclined {{to the surface of the}} water to allow it to enter cleanly. Once the blade entered the water, he taught his rowers to immediately start the stroke. During the stroke he wanted the blade to always be covered but not sunk too deep.|$|E
