[...] Only seven units were sold outside of Canada, to Ferrocarriles del Estado in Venezuela and Providence and Worcester Railroad in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The <b>B-unit</b> (bread {{and dessert}} portion) {{contained}} several calorie-dense Crackers, 3 sugar tablets, 3 dextrose energy tablets, and a packet or small can of beverage mix (instant coffee, powdered synthetic lemon drink, containing the rations' {{main source of}} vitamin C; or bouillon soup powder). Later revisions added orange drink powder (1944), sweetened cocoa powder (1944), and grape drink powder (1945), all enriched with Vitamin C, {{to the list of}} beverages. In 1941, the energy tablets were replaced with loose candy, such as candy-coated peanuts or raisins, Charms hard candy, or Brachs Chocolate Caramels. Due to spoilage, the loose candy was replaced in 1944 with a chocolate disk (e.g. Brach's Fudge disk) or a cookie sandwich (e.g., Jim Dandee) and the number of biscuits was reduced to 4.|$|E
50|$|Some B units {{cannot be}} moved without a {{controlling}} unit attached, but most have some simple controls inside, {{and often a}} side window at that control station. For example, B unit versions of the EMD FT with conventional couplers had a fifth porthole-style window added {{on the right side}} only for the control station. Other models used existing windows. These controls enable a hostler to move the <b>B-unit</b> locomotive by itself in a yard or shops. (A hostler is an employee permitted to move locomotives within the confines of a yard or shops complex, but not on the main railroad.) B units without controls are generally semi-permanently coupled to controlling units. Sometimes, there is a terminology distinction between the types: a booster is a B unit with hostler controls, and a slave is a B unit without hostler controls.|$|E
50|$|Multiple EMD FT units survive today. They {{include the}} lead A-unit from {{demonstrator}} No. 103 {{displayed at the}} Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri. The original A unit {{was presented to the}} museum in a June 27, 1961 ceremony. It is currently paired with one FT <b>B-unit.</b> (The B Unit is on loan from the Virginia Museum of Transportation). Both units are cosmetically restored and painted in the original GM demonstrator paint however, only the A unit is from the original demonstrator set which eventually went to work for Southern Railway. The two B units and the other A were eventually scrapped after years of service. The B unit now on display at St. Louis, originally just a random FT B unit, was later stripped of its engine and other locomotive parts and converted to a boiler car. It later went to the museum in Virginia. In 1989, this former FT B unit as well as the genuine demonstrator A unit from St. Louis were repainted in the original demonstrator colors for a celebration at EMD (McCook, Illinois, often described by mailing address LaGrange) for the 50th anniversary of the FT. They toured together and then were returned to their respective museum owners.|$|E
50|$|With steam {{operations}} on North American Railroads being converted to diesel operations, Electro-Motive, {{along with other}} locomotive builders, began building demonstrator units to be tested by various railroads. Electro-Motive built a set of three FP7 units, 7001 (A-unit) and 7002 & 7003 (<b>B-units).</b> In November 1949, Canadian Pacific Railway tested these units. Canadian Pacific owned most of the Soo Line, and after testing the three demonstrator units, they {{were sent to the}} Soo Line.|$|R

IBM allowed field upgrades among Models 1. 2 and 3. Directors can attach up to four intermixed 3330 or 3350 A-units or four 3340 A-units or two 3380 A-units ...|$|R
50|$|Ten further DG {{class engines}} - nine built by Vulcan Foundry {{and one by}} RS&H - were given 'A'-grade {{overhauls}} to work as trailing <b>B-units</b> for the rebuilt locomotives. These locomotives did not receive new cabs, and as such {{were not to be}} driven in regular service although photographs from this time show these locomotives were sometimes driven in regular service rather than turn a re-cabbed locomotive around. A number of other locomotives of this type also received the updated Westinghouse 26L brake system and NZR designed push-button control stand.|$|R
5000|$|SP 9113 when being rebuilt {{carried the}} {{unofficial}} identity 'SPMW #1'. The railroad's traffic computer required 4 digits, {{and so it}} emerged from the shop bearing a small SPMW 1166 stencil. In June 1969 it was renumbered to SP 8799, in standard Southern Pacific locomotive lettering configuration. The most drastic change in appearance was the locomotive's short hood (or [...] "nose"), which had been removed. In its place, a custom structure was fabricated to house twin Mitchell 35-millimeter film cameras and Nagra III timecode magnetic recording equipment, with stand-up headroom and two seats salvaged from another KM for operators. Heavy, thick steel was used for collision protection and to replace lost weight. The front Voith L830rU transmission was removed to create space for the camera enclosure, while the Number 1 radiator compartment was emptied of radiators and ancillary equipment to house an Onan skid-mount generator to power the camera equipment. The two engines and rear transmission were simply disabled, principally being retained for weight. All gearboxes and Cardan (universal) shafts were removed; gears were left in place on the six axles. All of the controls remained in the cab {{so that it could}} control a locomotive pushing behind it, much like a cab car is used on a commuter train. The camera car could be put on the lead of any train, but it primarily operated as special trips with just one locomotive behind it for power. Known locomotives used for power are a single EMD F7 <b>B-unit,</b> an EMD GP-9, an EMD GP35, and a Cotton Belt (St. Louis Southwestern) SD45T-2.|$|E
40|$|Powder {{diffraction}} {{patterns of}} the zeolites natrolite (Na(16) Al(16) Si(24) O(80) - 16 H(2) O), mesolite (Na(5. 33) -Ca(5. 33) Al(16) Si(24) O(80). 21. 33 H(2) O), scolecite (Ca(8) Al(16) Si(24) O(80) - 24 H(2) O), and a gallosilicate analogue of natrolite (K(16) -Ga(16) Si(24) O(80). 12 H(2) O), all crystallizing with a natrolite framework topology, were measured {{as a function of}} pressure up to 5. 0 GPa with use of a diamond-anvil cell and a 200 mum focused monochromatic synchrotron X-ray beam. Under the hydrostatic conditions mediated by an alcohol and water mixture, all these materials showed an abrupt volume expansion (ca. 2. 5 % in natrolite) between 0. 8 and 1. 5 GPa without altering the framework topology. Rietveld refinements using the data collected on natrolite show that the anomalous swelling is due to the selective sorption of water from the pressure-transmission fluid expanding the channels along the a- and <b>b-unit</b> cell axes, This gives rise to a "superhydrated" phase of natrolite with an approximate formula of Na(16) Al(16) Si(24) O(80). 32 H(2) O, which contains hydrogen-bonded helical water nanotubes along the channels. In mesolite, which at ambient pressure is composed of ordered layers of sodium- and calcium-containing channels in a 1 : 2 ratio along the b-axis, this anomalous swelling is accompanied by a loss of the superlattice reflections (b(mesoite) = 3 b(natrolite)). This suggests a pressure-induced order-disorder transition involving the motions of sodium and calcium cations either through cross-channel diffusion or within the respective channels. The powder diffraction data of scolecite, a monoclinic analogue of natrolite where all sodium cations are substituted by calcium and water molecules, reveal a reversible pressure-induced partial amorphization under hydrostatic conditions. Unlike the 2 -dimensional swelling observed in natrolite and mesolite, the volume expansion of the potassium gallosilicate natrolite is 3 -dimensional and includes the lengthening of the channel axis. In addition, the expanded phase, stable at high pressure, is retained at ambient conditions after pressure is released. The unprecedented and intriguing high-pressure crystal chemistry of zeolites with the natrolite framework topology is discussed here relating the different types of volume expansion to superhydration...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficiency}} of new candidate lighting-technologies (50 W ‘blue’ light-emitting-diode (B, λmax = 465 nm); 232 W ‘green’ hot cathode, (G, λmax = 546 nm); 400 W ‘red’ tungsten-halogen, (R, λmax = 667 to 740 nm)) against a standard 400 W ‘white’ metal-halide used as control technology (C, broad spectrum) at suppressing sexual maturation of 1 + Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in sea-cages. A total of seven experimental set-ups were tested on a commercial-scale in three trials using a standardised photoperiod regime in the form of continuous artificial-light (LL) applied from winter to summer solstice during the second year at sea. The experimental stocks were raised under an ambient thermal regime that was similar across all trials. Technical performances (spectral output, light-attenuation and irradiance distance) of the individual light-units were measured and light-perception was assessed by quantifying plasma melatonin levels. Body-size parameters (BW, FL, K) were measured at the switch-on and turn-off of the photoperiod regimes. Maturation rates were estimated at the end of the light-treatments and at harvest. The <b>B-unit</b> provided the shortest effective irradiance distance (distance from the light-bulb to the minimum irradiance suppressing plasma melatonin to basal day-time level = 0. 016 W m- 2) but the longest relative to its energy consumption; while the G- and R-units did not offer a comparative advantage over the C-unit in that regard (B>C>G>R). Nocturnal plasma-melatonin and maturation rate decreased proportionally to the light-intensity provided using a range of technologies emitting distinct spectral profiles. Light-intensity rather than light-spectral composition appeared to be the prime parameter negatively affecting sexual maturation. Maximal suppression of maturation was observed in treatments depressing nocturnal plasma melatonin to a 1. 2 -fold but not to a 1. 7 -fold increase compared to daytime levels, confirming that a threshold level of light-irradiance is necessary to obtain the desired effect. Results suggest that this can be achieved under standard commercial practices by applying, over the photoperiod regime presently used, continuous artificial-illumination with an (electrical) energy consumption of 0. 28 Wh m- 3 generating a mean-irradiance of 0. 012 W m- 2 and providing a minimum volume of effective irradiance equivalent to 12 % of the rearing-environment. Such a low volume of biologically effective irradiance was likely sufficient due to the strong photic attraction already reported in Atlantic salmon. Maximal suppression of pre-harvest sexual maturation can be achieved in the Atlantic salmon on-growing industry using alternative light-technologies. Present data provides methods and threshold values favouring the implementation of photoperiod-manipulation to suppress pre-harvest maturation at the most advantageous scale and cost...|$|E
50|$|While EMD's E-units were {{successful}} passenger engines, their A1A-A1A wheel arrangement made them less useful in mountainous terrain. Several railroads had tried EMD's F3 in passenger service, {{but there was}} insufficient water capacity in an A-unit fitted with dynamic brakes. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's solution was to replace the steam generators in A-units with a water tank, and so only fitted steam generators into the <b>B-units.</b> The Northern Pacific Railway's solution was to fit extra water tanks into the first baggage car, and to pipe the water to the engines. The real breakthrough came when EMD recognized the problem and added the stretched FP7 to its catalog.|$|R
