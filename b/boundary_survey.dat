25|$|The International <b>Boundary</b> <b>Survey,</b> {{called the}} Northern <b>Boundary</b> <b>Survey</b> in the United States, began in 1872. Its mandate was to {{establish}} the border as agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. Archibald Campbell led {{the way for the}} United States. Donald Cameron headed the British team. This survey focused on the border from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Banneker {{left the}} <b>boundary</b> <b>survey</b> in April 1791 {{within three months}} of its {{initiation}} due to illness and difficulties completing the survey at age 59. In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, Benjamin and Joseph Ellicott, who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time. Banneker therefore returned to his home at Ellicott's Mills. Andrew Ellicott then completed the <b>boundary</b> <b>survey</b> {{with the aid of}} his brothers and other team members during the remainder of 1791 and in 1792.|$|E
25|$|The Northwest <b>Boundary</b> <b>Survey</b> (1857–61) {{laid out}} the land {{boundary}}, but the water boundary was not settled for some time. After the Pig War in 1859, arbitration in 1872 established {{the border between the}} Gulf Islands and the San Juan Islands.|$|E
40|$|This {{guide to}} <b>boundary</b> <b>surveying</b> {{provides}} landowners, land surveyors, students {{and others with}} the necessary foundation to understand <b>boundary</b> <b>surveying</b> techniques and the common legal issues that govern boundary establishment.   <b>Boundary</b> <b>surveying</b> is sometimes mistakenly considered a strictly technical discipline with simple and straightforward technical solutions.   In reality, boundary establishment is often a difficult and complex matter, requiring years of experience and {{a thorough understanding of}} boundary law.   This book helps readers to understand the challenges often encountered by boundary surveyors and some of the available solutions. Using only simple and logically explained mathematics, the principles and practice of <b>boundary</b> <b>surveying</b> are demystified for those without prior experience, and the focused coverage of pivotal issues such as easements and setting lot corners will aid even licensed practitioners in untangling thorny cases. Practical advice on using both basic and advanced instruments is included, alongside clear explanations of the legal elements that impact boundary establishment. Because many modern surveys are resurveys of existing boundaries, which may have been created a century or more ago, this book discusses the historical techniques of <b>boundary</b> <b>surveying</b> so the modern surveyor will understand how to {{follow in the footsteps of}} the original surveyor.   For those who desire a more in-depth treatment of the mathematical aspects of <b>boundary</b> <b>surveying,</b> the Appendix includes the underlying theory and many examples of typical calculations performed by boundary surveyors...|$|R

In turn, the International <b>Boundary</b> <b>Survey</b> Commission began in 1857 to set {{the boundary between the}} United States and British North America, roughly along the 49th parallel, which runs through Semiahmoo Bay and Boundary Bay to Point Roberts, Washington.|$|E

25|$|Senior {{forestry}} officials cooperate {{on mutual}} issues concerning conservation {{and protection of}} forests and wildlife of the region. A regular conference of the forest ministers and forest officials of the southern states is held once a year, in rotation in each State. The Forest Ministers of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, senior officials of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, Forest Secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Special Secretary for Forests, Andhra Pradesh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, together with the senior forest officials of these states and the Union Territory of Pondicherry, met at Thiruvananthapuram on November 3 and 4, 2006 and resolved several mutual issues concerning conservation and protection of forests and wildlife of the region. This formalization of interstate cooperation on protected areas administration improves effectiveness in the areas of: daily staff communication including common wireless frequencies, joint enforcement action, <b>boundary</b> <b>survey</b> and demarcation, management of cross border resources like Biosphere Reserves, National Parks, Tiger reserves and Wildlife Sanctuaries, technology, staff and intelligence sharing and coordinated communication with the Govt. of India, especially allotting more funds for conservation and forestation activities of State Forest Departments by the Union Government. The second meeting was held at Bangalore on September 21 and 22, 2007.|$|E
