40|$|FLASH (free {{electron}} laser in Hamburg) is a unique, ultra-brilliant soft x-ray source providing highly coherent femtosecond pulses, currently ina {{wavelength range}} of 6. 8 – 47 nm. Up to several 1012 coherent photons within a 10 – 70 fs pulse allow {{the study of}} dynamical changes in nanometer-sized structures. This is a big step towards {{the ultimate goal of}} observing femtosecond dynamics on the atomic length scale, for example ‘watching <b>bio-machines</b> at work’. In this review, the properties of FLASH are summarized with a focus on coherence, and the potential of FLASH for structural investigations is illustrated with an overview of the recently performed coherent imaging experiments...|$|R
40|$|Self-assembly is {{a common}} and {{important}} phenomenon in biology, physics and chemistry. Biological organisms have evolved large self-assembling organelles (i. e. bioenergetic apparatus and compartments), which play essential roles in enhancing cellular metabolic activities. The projects will apply bioinformatics, molecular genetics, biochemistry, proteomics, synthetic biology and high-resolution Nano-Imaging techniques to investigate the molecular basis that underlies the self-assembly, dynamics and physiological regulation of metabolic organelles in bacteria. We will elucidate comprehensively how cells create these functional machineries and how their roles are dynamically regulated within the cells {{in response to the}} changing environment. Advanced understanding will facilitate the engineering of artificial <b>bio-machines,</b> and provide scientific solutions to grand challenges such as global food and energy security. The Institute of Integrative Biology at the University of Liverpool (United Kingdom) provides a unique combination of facilities and expertise for research, including the Centre for Cel...|$|R
5|$|In 2015, {{fifteen years}} after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, {{teenager}} Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion <b>bio-machines,</b> synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.|$|R

50|$|The Russian civilization {{survived the}} horror {{but at the}} cost of extreme changes. Giant metal cities, immense mazes of towers and {{corridors}} extend from the depth of the earth to the sky, while, from the untiring factories, the first bio-machines were born, the monstrous forefront of a new humanity.This is Soviet, the realm of the sentient machine Z.A.R., an inhuman dictator of a technocracy that had decreed the end of concepts like family, religion, peace and rest. Not even sunlight is granted to the slave citizens of the Calculator, and the days have lost their value and changed their length to submit to the rigid and precise rhythms of the <b>bio-machine</b> factories.|$|E
50|$|The term reploid, or replicate-android, {{is used in}} the Capcom {{video game}} series Mega Man X. Much like Blade Runner's replicants, these beings are more human in {{thinking}} and emotional awareness than previous generations, despite some being made into animal shapes to purposely distinguish them from humans. Another further future form of these robots, seen in Mega Man Zero, have them being so close to humans that they can actually eat, sleep, and reproduce. The only thing setting them apart is their semi-inorganic skeletal systems. In another farther flung future version and evolution of these <b>bio-machines</b> in the series Mega Man ZX humans and robots have merged seemingly so closely they are no longer a separate race but in-fact two parts to a whole new race. The final future of the game series is Mega Man Legends where humans and robots are one being to the point they can actually get together and reproduce offspring without effort.|$|R
40|$|Extremophiles are organisms able {{to thrive}} in extreme {{environmental}} conditions {{and some of them}} show the ability to survive high doses of heavy metals thanks to defensive mechanisms provided by primary and secondary metabolic products, i. e., extremolytes, lipids, and extremozymes. This is why there is a growing scientific and industrial interest in the use of thermophilic bacteria in a host of tasks, from the environmental detoxification of heavy metal to industrial activities, such as <b>bio-machining</b> and bio-metallurgy. In this work Thermus thermophilus was challenged against increasing Pb 2 + concentrations spanning from 0 to 300 ppm in order to ascertain the sensitiveness of this bacteria to the Pb environmental pollution and to give an insight on its heavy metal resistance mechanisms. Analysis of growth parameters, enzyme activities, protein profiles, and lipid membrane modifications were carried out. In addition, genotyping analysis of bacteria grown in the presence of Pb 2 +, using random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR and DNA melting evaluation, were also performed. A better knowledge of the response of thermophilic bacteria to the different pollutants, as heavy metals, is necessary for optimizing their use in remediation or decontamination processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProteins are {{essential}} compositions {{of the living}} organisms and involved in the processes of different life events. Basically proteins are like amazing tiny <b>bio-machines</b> performing the functions in a stable and predictable manner and understanding the underline mechanisms can facilitate the pharmaceutical development. However, protein functions are not carried in a static style, so experimental observations of these dynamic movements of the drugs inside the proteins are difficult, so computational methods have an important and irreplaceable role. We developed a software tool called LigandPath for mapping the ligand migration channels in a constantly moving protein and this software can function with CADD (Computer aided drug design) software to map the possible migration pathways of candidate drugs inside a protein. Traditionally, biologists use MD (Molecular Dynamics) simulation to locate the ligand migration channels, but it takes long {{time for them to}} observe the complete migration paths. In order to overcome the limitations of the trajectory-based MD simulation, we adopt a computational method inspired from robotic motion planning called DyME (Dynamic Map Ensemble) and we develop the software tool LigandPath based on DyME. The software tool has already been successfully applied to map the potential migration channels of drugs candidates of three proteins, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), UROD (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase) and Sirt 1 (silent information regulator 1) complexes in three publications...|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of biorobotics, intense {{research}} work is being done based on plant intelligence. Any living cell continuously receives information from the environment. In this paper, research is conducted on the plant named descoingsii x haworthioides (Pepe) obtaining the action potential signals and its responses to stimulations of different light modes. The plant electrical signal is the reaction of plant’s stimulation owing to various environmental conditions. Action potentials are responsible for signaling between plant cells and communication from the plants can be achieved through modulation of various parameters of the electrical signal in the plant tissue. The modulated signals are used for providing information to the microcontroller’s algorithm for working of the <b>bio-machine.</b> The changes of frequency of action potentials in plant are studied. Electromyography (EMG) electrodes and needle-type conductive electrodes along with electronic modules are used to collect and transform {{the information from the}} plant. Inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is used to convert signal in frequency domain into voltage signal for real-time analysis. The changes in frequency of the plant action potentials to different light modes are used for the control of the <b>bio-machine.</b> This work has paved the way for an extensive research towards plant intelligence...|$|E

We implemented an experimental system by which an insect brain was connected to a robot body. We observed th neural responses to external disturbances and transitions at changes in the motor gain of the robot body. Based on the results of the experiments, we identified a simple control model for the angular velocity of the behavior. We subsequently investigated the effect of the rotational velocity by using information entropy in computer simulations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In sociology, {{there has}} been a {{controversy}} about whether there is any essential difference between a human being and a tool, or if the tool–user relationship can be defined by co-actor symmetry. This issue becomes more complex when we consider examples of AI and robots, and even more so following progress in the development of various <b>bio-machine</b> hybrid technologies, such as robots that include organic parts, human brain implants, and adaptive prosthetics. It is argued that a concept of autonomous agency based on organismic embodiment helps to clarify the situation. On this view, agency consists of an asymmetrical relationship between an organism and its environment, because the continuous metabolic and regulatory activity of the organism gives rise to its own existence, and hence its specific behavioral domain. Accordingly, most (if not all) of current technologies are excluded from the class of autonomous agents. Instead, they are better conceptualized as interfaces that mediate our interactions with the world. This has important implications for design: Rather than trying to help humans to achieve their goals by duplicating their agency in artificial systems, {{it would be better to}} empower humans directly by enhancing their existing agency and lived experience with technological interfaces that can be incorporated into their embodiment. This incorporation might be especially facilitated by <b>bio-machine</b> hybrid technology that is designed according the principles of biological autonomy and multi-agent coordination dynamics...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} soft <b>bio-machine</b> {{constructed}} from biological motors (actin/myosin). We {{have found that}} chemically cross-linked polymer-actin complex gel filaments can move on myosin coated surfaces with a velocity as high as that of native Factin, by coupling to ATP hydrolysis. Additionally, it is shown that the velocity of polymer-actin complex gel depends on the species of polycations binding to the F-actins. Since the design of functional actuators of well-defined size and morphology is important, the structural behavior of polymer-actin complexes has been investigated. Our {{results show that the}} morphology and growth size of polymer-actin complex can be controlled by changes in the electrostatic interactions between F-actins and polycations. Our results indicate that bio actuators with desired shapes can be created by using a polymer-actin complex...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} extend {{cellular}} automata for defining {{a new class}} of machines, that are a super-class of them and also of Turing machines. On the basis of a kind of fusion between Turing machines and cellular automata, a new family of parallel machines called bio-machines is described. A <b>bio-machine</b> is able to synthesize some biological-like phenomena including evolution and lifetime individual adaptation of simple organisms, such as unicellulars (free-living and colonial ones) and simple multicellulars. 1 Introduction Life is extremely complex and, as a consequence, biology is an extremely difficult science. One of the reasons of that complexity is that the "basis" of life, its underlying physics, is very rich. Our aim is therefore to offer an Artificial Life model that simplifies this basis to a minimum set of fundamental physical laws supporting certain biological-like processes and allowing to study a synthetic approximation of life. These laws include material and energet [...] ...|$|E
30|$|The {{main task}} of a {{prosthetic}} hand is to to help physically disabled people restore hand functions in living environment (ADLs). General APHs should have three main features, as human-like appearance (size, weight, textures, compliance, etc.), mobility, and perception. Besides, state-of-the-art APHs request even more dexterous operations, given very limited choice on the actuation styles and DOF configurations. How to realize {{a large portion}} of human hand functions in very low actuation cost is very ambitious in APH research. Besides, high-precision position control (such as, to nip a needle) and accurate force control (such as, to grasp a fragile cup) are both frequently required in the daily use of APHs. How to devise a smart control strategy properly working on different conditions is another question. For controlling the prosthetic hands, the surface myoelectric signals (sEMG) collected from the residual neuromuscular system (stump) are widely accepted. Traditional mode-switching methods established on EMG amplitude only give very limited functions, discrete robot-like finger movements, and unintuitive control feelings. By introducing the pattern recognition method [64], a large progress has been made; however, there is still a big gap between the research and its real application [65, 66]. Intrinsic timing-varying characters of the EMG signals, environmental change (electromechanical status, temperature, moisture, sweating, etc.) of the <b>bio-machine</b> interface, and confounding factors (body postures, contraction strength variations, involuntary EMG activations) largely affect the long-term usage of clinical APHs. In this case, the control of APHs should consider other alternative peripheral nervous signals, such as ultrasonic signal [67], mechanomyography [68], near-infrared spectroscopy [69] and electrocorticography [70], {{to be used in the}} control channel, and multi-sensory means [71], such as vision [72, 73] and tactile sense [74, 75], to be used in the feedback channel. With the big progress of the worldwide scientific research on artificial cognition and brain-computer interface, a fully-embodied hand avatar controlled by our brain with utmost ease will come soon.|$|E
