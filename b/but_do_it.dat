25|$|Despite being {{banned from}} {{politics}} for five years, Thaksin Shinawatra was popular in his former support {{bases in the}} Central, North and North-Eastern Thailand and attempted to maintain {{an active role in}} Thai politics by supporting the People's Power Party, which had become the successor party of the banned TRT. Abhisit promoted populist policies in his party's campaign as the Democrat Party's platform in the 2007 parliamentary election. He claimed that while his platform was categorically considered to be populist, it sought to curb inflation while maintaining fiscal soundness, to apply the village-based microcredit development funds used in the Thaksin-led government <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as part of promoting royalist sufficiency economy policies in rural areas, and to strengthen the country's long-term competitiveness through universal education through high school.|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{continued}} {{to serve on}} the NACA through 1948 and expressed annoyance with aircraft companies for delaying development of a turbojet engine because of the huge expense of research and development as well as retooling from older piston engines. He was similarly disappointed with the automobile industry, which showed no interest in his proposals for more fuel-efficient engines. General Motors told him that [...] "even if it were a better engine, [...] would not be interested in it." [...] Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising. [...] "Madison Avenue believes," [...] he said, [...] "that if you tell the public something absurd, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> enough times, the public will ultimately register it in its stock of accepted verities." ...|$|E

500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{was known}} as [...] "a coach's AD." [...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty. [...] If not, then that person could leave any time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Santer, {{desiring}} a quotable slogan for his administration, stated his Commissions aim {{would be}} [...] "to do less, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> better" [...] (a slogan adopted and adapted by many since). Although just a sound bite, it touched a chord for some thinking the Community needed a rest {{after the new}} treaties and the euro, even if {{the nature of the}} Community itself requires movements and new projects to keep it busy. However, during 1998 the Commission began to lose authority due to management criticisms from the Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|Touring {{with the}} popular McDowell bought Petra {{credibility}} with youth leaders and church pastors, who were impressed by the speaker's forceful defense of Christian rock music. Seeking to build on that growing influence, Hartman and Schlitt turned to youth ministers directly {{at a conference in}} California, asking them how Petra could better aid their ministries. The response: Produce some music that could be better replicated in a church setting. [...] "So we thought, ‘What if we do a CD with worship songs that we think are cool, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> Petra style and then provide an accompaniment track for the youth groups?'" [...] Schlitt said.|$|E

Megee left the United States in late April on board the USS Hoggatt Bay (CVE-75). He remained with the 3d Marine Aircraft Wing as they got established at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa in May 1944. In October 1944, Colonel Magee was named as the commanding officer of Provisional Air Support Command whose role was to organize, train and equip Marine units to duplicate the air control function of the Navy <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> ashore.
