We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a <b>base</b> <b>paint,</b> which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E

The artisan’s work has become distinguished for the painting of fine, intricate designs over the <b>base</b> <b>paint,</b> often inspired by Zapotec and other indigenous designs. He works with his wife María del Carmen Mendoza, at the couple’s home and workshop in their hometown. While Angeles continues to create alebrijes, much of the production of the workshop is done by younger members of the Angeles family, which is a tourist attraction in the town. Angeles travels frequently to promote alebrijes and Zapotec culture, especially in the United States, and his work has been shown in major venues in Mexico and abroad, as well as featured in two books. In 2014, he was invited to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis and set alebrije nativity scenes and Christmas tree ornaments.|$|E

5000|$|Scenically the production, {{designed}} by Harry Horner, was extremely involved with velour covered hard wall sets instead of typical muslin flats. The raised stage platform floor concealed tracks {{for the various}} platform wagon sets to be winched on and off stage. The village set, included left and right store facades with false perspective awnings, were stored, hanging in the off stage loft areas, allowing wing storage for the hard wall throne room (painted deep maroon color); a pink boudoir set; a garden set; and a Cathedral Rose stained glass window-wall with a central enlarged double Gothic arched doorway mounted on a six foot deep by thirty foot wide wagon platform. Staging the wedding scene, the couple began their walk {{at the rear of}} the stage on the Cathedral steps into the set. As the couple proceeded walking forward down to the foot-light apron, this massive Cathedral wall followed, moving with the couple to the middle of the stage. Interesting is fact the audience never realized that the set was moving downstage with the performers. When the couple turned around, returning upstage, the cathedral wall slowly returned to the back wall position ending the wedding scene. This set wagon wall flew out and was stored against the Curran's stage back wall; a spectacular visual transition, which was never seen by the audience! In Los Angeles, this set piece was replaced with a painted velour framed backing. Harry Horner matched Miles White's costume color, for Princess Flavia's dressing gown robe, spraying the velour boudoir walls the identical costume's pink color. During rehearsals, Miles was jump'n mad with Harry because all you could see was the actress' head bobbing in the identical pink background! The production required a large staff of stage technicians, flymen, and property crew for the major set changes. During the construction of the stage sets, the shop's minimum construction floor space limited and hindered by space for constructing all the wagon sets. The Light Opera rented film stages at the nearby (closed) Allied Artist Studios, located off Sunset Boulevard (KCET TV purchased the property afterwards). Only six blocks travel, carpenters and scenic artists assembled the scenery in two stages at the old film lot. Preparing the dry tint powder <b>base</b> <b>paint</b> for the throne room set, the Scenic charge man did not calculate the correct amount of [...] "horse glue" [...] binder for the dark maroon paint. Spraying the cream velour covered flats, after drying, the paint did not properly adhere to the velour flats. The result, the paint flaked and stained the stage technicians' hands. Each piece of scenery had to have a muslin case for shipping, keeping the finish from marking and affecting the other pieces of scenery. When this set was handled, each stage technician had to wear gloves when the set was moved into place, or shifted off stage for storage. This set remained a problem throughout the tour. Another folding deminsional scenic arch unit, which had been intended to fold open, and collapse when flown into grid storage position returning into the loft storage areas, became an engineering nightmare. The scenic element, abandoned after two weeks, was replaced by a flat profile garden arch. Harry Horner's scenery and Miles White's costumes provided an intricate, beautiful, handsome detailed production. Film sets and costumes as a stage musical! ...|$|E

Pandawa Agung is being in a warehouse of finished goods. It’s known that the location of the nearest placement of the input or output point is occupied by finished goods P. Lite. However it’s known that the displacement frequency of P. Lite is very small when compared to the frequency of the finished goods P. Standard and WS (Weather Shield). This kind of layout becomes the cause of distant travel distances, the location of fast moving goods placement far from the entrance or exit that causes the operational costs of material handling to be high and the time of the transfer of the old. The purpose of the study this final project is to define and design a layout proposal (Re-layout) in resolving the problems being faced by CV. Pandawa Agung. By improving the layout of the finished goods warehouse in CV. Pandawa Agung so it can produce a layout that has a distance criteria and material handling tools are optimal and in accordance with the conditions in the warehouse of finished goods. Processing of the data that will be used is by using Class Based Storage Policy. Class Method Based Storage Policy is the retention policy by dividing into three classes: class A, B, and C. The policy is also based on Pareto Law. Class-Based Storage Policy is a method that makes setting up and arrangement of storage become more flexible. Designing the layout of the proposed method Class Storage Based Policy starts from the comparing material handling tools used are trolley and hand pallet, then from both tools selected one {{to be used in the}} warehouse of finished goods. Then grouping types of finished goods into three classes can be conducted with respect to the percentage of absorption of funds, create a layout design taking into account the closeness of the finished goods with the entrance and exit in accordance with the class, calculates the distance between the blocks of rectilinear and calculates total material handling cost. With the preparation of the draft storage methods Storage Policy-Based Class is expected to finished goods storage space will occupy more serious with finished goods shortest distance moving and material handling costs are small. So in this study we can conclude that the distance moved by the finished goods become 394 m in 2 weeks and the cost of material handling every meter becomes Rp. 1, 288. 25 with total material handling cost becomes Rp. 507, 570. 5 in 2 weeks.

40|$|Figure 1 : Based on {{analytical}} reflectance {{modeling and}} image-based rendering our technique accurately reproduces complex effects of modern car paint like specular reflection, spatially varying glitter with depth impression and color shifts. State-of-the-art car paint shows not only interesting and subtle angular dependency but also significant spatial variation. Especially in sunlight these variations remain visible even for distances up {{to a few}} meters and give the coating a strong impression of depth which cannot be reproduced by a single BRDF model {{and the kind of}} procedural noise textures typically used. Instead of explicitly modeling the responsible effect particles we propose to use image-based reflectance measurements of real paint samples and represent their spatial varying part by Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). We use classical BRDF models like Cook-Torrance to represent the reflection behavior of the <b>base</b> <b>paint</b> and the highly specular finish and demonstrate how the parameters of these models can be derived from the BTF measurements. For rendering, the image-based spatially varying part is compressed and efficiently synthesized.

30|$|The basic mixing {{scheme that}} we used was to have {{mixtures}} with zinc white <b>base</b> <b>paint</b> in 90 : 10 and 50 : 50 ratios, and with bone black paint in 99 : 1 and 90 : 10 ratios. However, depending on the pigment in some cases other ratios {{were found to be}} more suitable. For example, for deeply colored paints the amount of black pigment needed to be reduced to prevent mixtures to become completely black, which would eliminate any added value to the determination of optical parameters. For the intense colored Prussian blue, which is very dark blue—almost black—in oil paint, we found that mixing with black was not meaningful at all. On the other hand, for all white pigments and fillers in this study, a different scheme of mixtures had to be used. These were mixed in 90 : 10 ratios with cochineal, viridian and cobalt blue paints, and with bone black in several ratios (Fig.  3 b). All mixtures were applied on a standardized black–white chart from BYK-Gardner, using a block operator to create a relatively uniform layer of 100  µm thickness. We let the paints dry in air. Finally, we measured the reflectance spectrum for each mixture on both black and white substrate using a Konica-Minolta 2600 D diffuse sphere (d/ 8) spectrophotometer. We used this instrument in Specular Component Included mode, to ensure good alignment with other d/ 8 spectrophotometers.
