40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} from fatigue and static loading tests performed on both epoxy and <b>braze-welded</b> FBG strain sensors. Most FBG attachment methods are relatively understudied, with epoxy {{the most commonly}} used.

This work shows that a bespoke <b>braze-welded</b> attachment design is able to achieve a higher static failure limit of 22 kN when compared to strain gauge epoxies, which fail at 20 kN. Both methods demonstrate high fatigue life, with no significant deterioration after two million cycles.

40|$|Laser welding of {{dissimilar}} metals such as Aluminum and Copper, {{which is}} required for Li-ion battery joining, is challenging due to the inevitable formation of the brittle and high electrical-resistant intermetallic compounds. Recent {{research has shown that}} by using a novel technology, called laser <b>braze-welding,</b> the Al-Cu intermetallics can be minimized to achieve superior mechanical and electrical joint performance. This paper investigates the robustness of the laser <b>braze-welding</b> process. Three product and process categories, i. e. choice of materials, joint configurations, and process conditions, are studied. It is found that in-process effects such as sample cleanness and shielding gas fluctuations have a minor influence on the process robustness. Furthermore, many pre-process effects, e. g. design changes such as multiple layers or anodized base material can be successfully welded by process adaption. The minimization of the interface gap is identified as the most significant influence of process stability.

40|$|Beryllium is an {{interesting}} metal that has a strength to weight ratio six times that of steel. Because of its unique mechanical properties, beryllium is used in aerospace applications such as satellites. In addition, beryllium is also used in x-ray windows because it is nearly transparent to x-rays. Joining of beryllium has been studied for decades (Ref. l). Typically joining processes include <b>braze-welding</b> (either with gas tungsten arc or gas metal arc), soldering, brazing, and electron beam welding. Cracking which resulted from electron beam welding was recently studied to provide structure/property relationships in autogenous welds (Ref. 2). <b>Braze-welding</b> utilizes a welding arc to melt filler, and {{only a small amount}} of base metal is melted and incorporated into the weld pool. Very little has been done to characterize the braze-weld in terms of the structure/property relationships, especially with reference to multipass welding.

40|$|International audienceThe Cold Metal Transfer {{process is}} {{investigated}} to join zinc coated steel with aluminium alloy by <b>braze-welding.</b> A 4043 filler metal is deposited {{on the surface}} of the coated steel, and the effect of the current waveform on the metal transfer and the heat transferred to the base metal is investigated. The reduction in the 'boost phase' duration of the current waveform decreases the volume of liquid drops at the wire tip and allows to increase the short-circuit frequency, inducing a similar or higher deposit rate. Regular deposits are obtained when the linear energy remains below, 500 J mm 21. The heat transferred to the base metal, and thus the thickness of the intermetallic layer formed at the Al/steel interface, is lower for an equivalent deposit rate when the short-circuit frequency is high...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum and Copper {{were joined}} using the {{laser-based}} <b>braze-welding</b> process.

This results in a tough, ductile connection with reduced electric resistance. This paper describes a method, {{which is based on}} the 4 -wire method, to measure the resistance of the weld seam. The arrangement of the conductive electrodes directly on top and bottom of the weld seam significantly increases the accuracy of the measured resistances, thus offers a direct estimation of the inter-metallic layer thickness. The electric measuring of the layer thickness is a non-destructive method, which assists in the reduction of the post-process effort (cross sections, pull tests, hardness measurements) and decreases the lead-time by reducing the time needed for the identification of suitable laser process parameters...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of joining Co by <b>braze-welding</b> {{it with an}} AgCu filler was {{developed}} {{in order to better}} understand the residual stresses in Be-AlSi weldments. The constituents of this new welding system were selected to replicate the physical properties, crystal structures, and chemical behaviors of the Be-AlSi welds; "welding surrogacy" is used to describe this process. Final welds are five pass manual tungsten inert gas (TIG), with He top -gas and Ar back-gas. Final welds exhibit full penetration melting of the cobalt base, while microscopy indicates that cracking is minimal and not through thickness. Welds are composed of five separate regions consisting of the unaffected Co base, the heat affected zone, the melted Co base, the AgCu filler, and the CoCu peritectic. Failure tests of the surrogate welds show that residual stresses have little or no effect on strength, whereas weld quality and geometry are extremely important. Crack compliance measurements show that the largest residual stresses are located along the Co-AgCu interface, as is expected. Residual stresses in the weld root are too small to observably effect failure, whereas stresses in the CoCu region cannot influence failure due to their location and direction. The strength of Co-AgCu welds depends strongly on geometry, penetration, and defects, but little on residual stresses, and this conclusion is tentatively extended to Be-AlSi weld...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of joining cobalt by <b>braze-welding</b> {{it with a}} silver–copper filler was {{developed}} {{in order to better}} understand the residual stresses in beryllium–aluminum/silicon weldments which are problematic to investigate because of the high toxicity of Be. The base and filler metals of this new welding system were selected to replicate the physical properties, crystal structures, and chemical behavior of the Be–AlSi welds. Welding parameters of this surrogate Co–AgCu system were determined by experimentation combining 4 -point bending tests and microscopy. Final welds are 5 pass manual TIG (tungsten inert gas), with He top gas and Ar back gas. Control of the welding process produces welds with full penetration melting of the cobalt base. Microscopy indicates that cracking is minimal, and not through thickness, whereas 4 -point bending shows failure is not by base-filler delamination. These welds improve upon the original Be–AlSi welds, which do not possess full penetration, and have considerable porosity. We propose that utilization of our welding methods will increase the strength of the Be–AlSi weldments. The specialized welding techniques developed for this study may be applicable not only for the parent Be–AlSi welds, but to braze welds and welds utilizing brittle materials in general. This concept of surrogacy may prove useful in the study of many different types of exotic welds...|$|E
40|$|Non-galvanized and 10 µm {{zinc-coated}} 1. 2 mm thick DC 04 steel {{was joined}} to 6016 -T 4 aluminium alloy by using three different laser processses : a key-hole welding mode, with a precise {{control of the}} aluminium – steel dilution, a reactive wetting mode where solid steel – liquid aluminium reaction occurred driving to a uniform Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic layer between the two overlapped sheets and a <b>braze-welding</b> mode involving direct fusion of aluminium and an Al- 12 Si filler wire on solid steel. For liquid aluminium to liquid steel interactions obtained by key-hole mode, rather sound and resistant assemblies were realized either on non-galvanized or galvanized steel provided steel was placed upon aluminium with penetration in aluminium limited to 0. 5 mm. The influence of galvanized layer was only detectable on the fusion zone of aluminium where occluded zinc bubbles were observed. Mechanical resistances of 150 N/mm were obtained for one joint assemblies and could be increased up to 250 N/mm making two joints per assembly. For liquid aluminium to solid steel interactions carried out by defocused laser, 180 N/mm transverse tensile strengths were obtained on non-galvanized steels by using a brazing flux. Due to a better wetting on non-galvanized steels, good assemblies could be obtained without using flux leading to lower mechanical resistances of up to 140 N/mm. However, using flux conduced to 220 N/mm maximal mechanical resistance. For this kind of interaction solid/liquid), using an Al- 12 Si filler wire allows to obtained also 180 N/mm mechanical strengths on non-galvanized steels using a brazing flux. Same characteristics are obtained in the reaction layers composition with a decrease in maximal layer thickness under 1 µm compared to the 2 - 40 µm thickness obtained without filler wire. Finally, comparisons are made between the three processes investigated focusing on the mechanical properties and the robustness of each process...|$|E
