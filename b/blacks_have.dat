5|$|The {{national}} rugby union {{teams of}} France and New Zealand (the All <b>Blacks)</b> <b>have</b> been playing {{each other for}} over a century; as of 19 October 2015, they have played 56 Test matches against each other. The first encounter, which was also France's first Test, took place in Paris in January 1906 and was won by New Zealand 388. It was not until 1954 that France secured their first win over New Zealand (30).|$|E
5|$|As {{of the end}} of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, New Zealand and France {{have played}} 56 Tests. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>have</b> won 43, France 12, and one has been drawn. Only four matches have been played at neutral venues; the 1999 World Cup semi-final at Twickenham, London, the 2003 World Cup third/fourth {{play-off}} match at Stadium Australia in Sydney, and the 2007 and 2015 World Cup quarter-finals at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. New Zealand have scored considerably more points than France both in France and New Zealand, and at neutral venues - although at neutral venues France have won two of the four matches.

5|$|New Zealand {{have won}} the World Cup three times, the only team to have done so. They beat France in {{the final of the}} 1987 inaugural {{competition}} held in New Zealand and Australia, defeated France again in the final of the 2011 tournament, also hosted in New Zealand, and most recently defeated Australia in England in 2015, making them the first and only team to win the World Cup in consecutive tournaments. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they reached the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa. They finished in fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003, New Zealand were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. The 2007 World Cup saw their worst tournament, being knocked out in the quarterfinals by the host nation France; until this they were the only team to have reached the semifinals of every tournament. As a result of the poor performance in the 2007 World Cup the NZRU commissioned a 47-page report to detail the causes of the failure. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>have</b> never lost a World Cup pool match, and have finished top of their pool in all seven tournaments.|$|E

25|$|Oakland's black {{population}} decreased by nearly 25 percent between 2000 and 2010.

25|$|Many <b>blacks</b> <b>have</b> {{supported}} {{government and}} business affirmative action, while many Jews have not, preferring merit-based systems. Historians believe that this difference contributed to {{the decline of the}} black-Jewish alliance in the 1970s, when blacks began seeking ways to build on the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. As blacks continued to face widespread discrimination and struggled to make progress in society, they began to develop an increasing militancy. Greenberg believes that this increased resentment and fear among Jews.|$|E
25|$|The book {{contains}} no references whatsoever, based alternately on alleged conversations with present-day cannibals, the eating of ape brain {{by the author}} and direct insight from deep meditation. Many parts have been deemed by some as being outright racist, particularly the photographic plates comparing various ethnic faces (primarily Arab and African) to apes. He says that <b>blacks</b> <b>have</b> smaller brains than whites and that contemporary cannibal tribes are seeking to remedy this discrepancy by consuming brains in a frantic attempt to catch up, though he estimates {{that it would take}} them roughly 100,000 years to do so.|$|E
25|$|In a large {{study from}} the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the {{reference}} interval (as defined by the 1st and 99th percentile) was between 0.57 and 1.12mg/L. This interval was 0.55 - 1.18 for women and 0.60 - 1.11 for men. Non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans had lower normal cystatin C levels. Other {{studies have found that}} in patients with an impaired renal function, women have lower and <b>blacks</b> <b>have</b> higher cystatin C levels for the same GFR. For example, the cut-off values of cystatin C for chronic kidney disease for a 60-year-old white women would be 1.12mg/L and 1.27mg/L in a black man (a 13% increase). For serum creatinine values adjusted with the MDRD equation, these values would be 0.95mg/dL to 1.46mg/dL (a 54% increase).|$|E

25|$|Though Brazilians of {{at least}} partial African {{heritage}} make up {{a large percentage of}} the population, few <b>blacks</b> <b>have</b> been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, <b>blacks</b> <b>have</b> been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. {{side of the}} region, Latinos make up a {{large portion}} of the {{agricultural}} labor force east of the Cascade Range, and are an increasing presence in the general labor force west of the Cascades. African Americans are less numerous in the Pacific Northwest; however, the overall African American population has been growing in other smaller urban areas throughout the region, such as Spokane and Eugene. African Americans tend to concentrate in western urban areas such as Tacoma, south Seattle, and Portland. Nonetheless, <b>blacks</b> <b>have</b> a very large presence in Tacoma's Hilltop and South Tacoma neighborhoods, Seattle's Central District and Rainier Valley neighborhoods, and in Portland's Northeast Quadrant. There are growing numbers in Vancouver as well, particularly Africans, Jamaicans and blacks from the United States. As of the first decade of the 21st century, many Asians were moving out and into middle class suburbs, though some would voice concern about preserving historical communities particularly in Vancouver. British Columbia has the largest Asian presence per-capita in North America, with 10% of the population being of Chinese ancestry and also large numbers of South Asians, Filipinos, and others. The Asian presence in the U.S. section of the Pacific Northwest is comparably smaller, with all Asian groups together comprising about 8% of Washington state's population, and smaller figures in Oregon and Idaho. This is due to immigration quotas at the federal level, as while Canada has one-tenth the population of the United States, it takes in one-quarter as many immigrants.|$|E
