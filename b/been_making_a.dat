There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} store Dickins and Jones was established at No.54 Oxford Street as Dickins and Smith {{before moving to}} Nos.232–234 Regent Street in 1835. It was renamed to Dickins and Jones in the 1890s after John Pritchard Jones became a business partner, and {{by the turn of}} the 20th century employed over 200 people. It became part of the Harrods group in 1914, and expanded to cover Nos.224–244 in 1922, in a new building designed by Sir Henry Tanner. In 1959, House of Fraser took over the store by buying the Harrods group. In 2005, House of Fraser announced that the store would close the following year, after it had <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> loss for several years and not kept up with more fashion-conscious {{department store}}s elsewhere. The building has been redeveloped with small shop units on the lower floors and flats and offices above.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E

Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as {{he was afraid to}} enter hospitals and see doctors.

The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} Antipas' {{involvement}} has been debated. Theodor Mommsen {{argued that the}} normal legal procedure of the early Roman empire was for defendants to be tried by the authorities of their home provinces. A. N. Sherwin-White re-examined the relevant legal texts and concluded that trials were generally based on {{the location of the}} alleged crimes, but that there was a possibility of referral to a province of origin in special cases. If Pilate was not required to send Jesus to Antipas, he may have <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> show of courtesy to the tetrarch and trying to avoid the need to deal with the Jewish authorities himself. When Jesus was sent back, Pilate could still have represented Antipas' failure to convict as support for his own view (according to Luke) that Jesus was not guilty of a capital offence, thus allowing him to avoid responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion.|$|E
25|$|This, {{according}} to the oaths taken, made Margaret the heir at three years of age, but that same year Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale had rebelled {{with the aid of}} his son the Earl of Carrick. The Bruces captured strongholds in Galloway, and as well as bolstering their position in the south-west where their rivals the Balliols also had influence, may have <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> bid for the Crown. However, Robert Bruce seems to have overestimated his chances of successfully pressing his claim, as further support {{does not appear to have}} been forthcoming, and it is difficult to prove that even Bruce allies such as the Stewarts decided to back them, in spite of what some historians have inferred from the Turnberry Band of September 1286. The rebellion thus quickly fizzled out, though no drastic action was taken against the Bruces after they had handed back the castles they had seized. In this way, the Guardians possibly hoped to maintain the peace in Scotland between the competing claims of Robert Bruce and John Balliol, without jeopardising their ultimate loyalty to the realm, and probably to Margaret as the more generally accepted heir.|$|E

500|$|Constantine Doukas {{was the son}} of Andronikos Doukas, a {{prominent}} general under Emperor Leo VI the Wise (reigned 886–912) and the first prominent member of the Doukas family. Constantine first appears in the sources in 904, during the attempted flight of the Arab-born eunuch Samonas, one of the emperor's most trusted aides, to Syria. Constantine captured Samonas at the Monastery of the Holy Cross at Siricha, near the river Halys, and escorted him back to Constantinople, where an enquiry into the matter was held before the Senate. Leo, who was still attached to his servant, enjoined Constantine to maintain that Samonas had in fact <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage to the shrine of Siricha, and not the Arab frontier. When the senators however asked Constantine to verify the truth of this claim by swearing on [...] "God and the emperor's head", he refused to hide the truth. Samonas was punished by house arrest, and although he was pardoned by Leo after only four months and restored to his offices, he had conceived a deep enmity towards the Doukai.|$|E
500|$|The defence called Brownlee, who recounted {{his version}} of events. [...] He testified {{that he had been}} {{otherwise}} occupied on many of the days that he and MacMillan had supposedly had sex; in one case, he produced newspaper stories showing that he had <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> speech in Stettler at a time that MacMillan had claimed he was forcing himself upon her in Edmonton. [...] In another, he testified that he was meeting with O. H. Snow, the mayor of Raymond. [...] MacLean on cross-examination tried to paint Brownlee as a man of tremendous persuasive powers, recalling his time as a lawyer in Calgary, only to have Brownlee retort that he had only ever tried two cases, spending most of his time drafting commercial documents. [...] MacLean also emphasized the $1,400 that Lymburn as Attorney General had spent investigating the case, suggesting that this amounted to government funds being spent to vindicate Brownlee personally; outside of the courtroom, Lymburn responded that his office had received a complaint that an [...] "Edmonton lawyer"—taken by all involved to be MacLean—had approached a young woman offering money to place Brownlee in a compromising position, and that, as a criminal allegation, it had been the obligation of his office to investigate. [...] He further emphasized that, against his protestations, Brownlee had insisted on reimbursing the government for the full cost of the investigation.|$|E

500|$|American Beauty was {{edited by}} Christopher Greenbury and Tariq Anwar; Greenbury {{began in the}} position, but had to leave halfway through {{post-production}} because of a scheduling conflict with Me, Myself and Irene(2000) (in which Chris Cooper also starred). Mendes and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments. Mendes realized during editing that the film {{was different from the}} one he had envisioned. He believed he had <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> [...] "much more whimsical, kaleidoscopic" [...] film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines. In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit. The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against bluescreen, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical—"like a Coen brothers movie"—and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set. The opening in the final cut reused a scene {{from the middle of the}} film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father. This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening—and when the full scene plays out later—Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt. The subsequent shot—an aerial view of the neighborhood—was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} against South Australia in Sydney. New South Wales had {{declared}} at 8/215 and the visitors were 0/2 at stumps {{on the first}} day. Miller's wife gave birth to their fourth child, and Miller was drinking into the next morning. He then arrived at the SCG, having forgotten to pick up teammate Peter Philpott as arranged, {{so he had to}} rush back and the pair arrived late for the day's play. Miller was still in a tuxedo as play was about to start. Miller completed the unfinished over from the previous night and felt that the pitch did not offer any assistance. He then told Alan Davidson to bowl the next over from his end. However, as Davidson was about to bowl, Miller changed his mind and took over. Miller bowled Les Favell in the over. He kept on bowling and finished with 7/12 from 7.3 overs, clean bowling five of his victims. The visitors had been levelled for 27, the lowest score {{in the history of the}} Sheffield Shield. Miller then asked South Australia to follow-on, but showed little interest in bowling again, delivering only six overs despite the bowler-friendly conditions. Philpott said that [...] "this was typical Miller. He was never an accumulator of records, not particularly concerned with figures." [...] In another incident, Miller had <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> speech at a civic reception for the New South Wales team in the town of Maitland. In front of the mayor at the town hall, he praised the hospitality, before turning around to his players and asking what the name of the town was. Miller then turned up late to a coaching clinic the next day and instead of teaching, he made a speech, advising the children to play tennis as there was more money on offer.|$|E
500|$|The 1970s work of ex-Roxy Music member {{musician}} Brian Eno {{is cited}} by Leigh Landy as an archetypal {{example of a}} pop musician who [...] "applied developments from the experimental sector while creating their own experimental pop sector." [...] Following his departure from Roxy Music in 1973, Eno began releasing a series of solo albums where he simultaneously developed his ambient, pop, and electronic styles. In the belief of pop musician Scott Miller, they were the era's [...] "most successful" [...] experimental pop artists, explaining {{that the key to}} Eno's success [...] "appears to have <b>been</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> science out of decision points (see 'Oblique Strategies') rather than being willfully weird or different at the usual unexamined decision points" [...] Joshua Pickard of publication Nooga profiled Eno's album Before and After Science (1977) as a record of [...] "experimental pop lucidity the culmination of sound that Eno had been working on since the release of Here Come the Warm Jets in 1973." [...] Members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster feature on the record as session musicians in addition to Phil Collins, who performs drums on one track. Collins' own debut solo single [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] (1981) has been described by Gary Mills of The Quietus as being [...] "at the vanguard of experimental pop" [...] when it was released. He further called it [...] "a rock oddity classic" [...] which was influenced by [...] "the unconventional studio predilections of Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel". Landy noted the tendency of experimental pop artists such as Eno and David Byrne to build tracks around existing recordings, effectively fusing different styles, a technique used on the duo's 1981 album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts.|$|E
