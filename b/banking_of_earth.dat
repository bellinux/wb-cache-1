60|$|Helen {{seized a}} tuft of heather, and sliding down, reached a narrow shelf {{four or five}} feet below.

50|$|The {{monument}} {{consists of}} fifty-six stones {{arranged in a}} rectangle with a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> around them and measures approximately 20m by 47m. The interior fills with water and a contemporary ground level has not been established. It has suffered damage by cattle {{in the past and}} is now protected by a gated fence. It can be reached by footpaths east of St Breward.|$|R
60|$|After three days' battering, {{breaches}} of from {{thirty to}} fifty feet wide were effected in the walls. The Saxons {{had not been}} idle. Behind each of the threatened points they raised <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> ten feet high, and cut away the bank perpendicularly behind the shattered wall, so that the assailants as they poured in at the gaps would have to leap ten feet down.|$|R
60|$|Having now great {{confidence}} in Harry's judgment, the rajah at once ordered a horn to be sounded and, {{in a short}} time, {{the whole of the}} men were assembled in their stronghold; and the entrance closed by bamboos, for which holes had been already dug, close together. Then short lengths were lashed across them, and they were further strengthened by a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> piled against them.|$|R
50|$|At a {{very early}} date, {{probably}} dating to the original Roman settlements, <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> were erected along {{the south side of}} the Thames in order to keep out the tidal waters and to hold them in check. One of them near the river was called Narrow Wall whilst another binding the marsh to the east was called Broad Wall, an ancient raised road which followed the line of Lambeth Marsh.|$|R
50|$|Pardalotes are {{seasonal}} breeders in temperate {{areas of}} Australia but may breed year round in warmer areas. They are monogamous breeders, and both partners share nest construction, incubation and chick-rearing duties. All four species nest in deep horizontal tunnels drilled into <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> Externally {{about the size}} of a mouse-hole, they can be very deep, at a metre or more. Some species also nest in tree hollows.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, Hubert de Byes {{took him}} into his house, gave him some refreshment, and {{provided}} him with a fresh horse, sending his three sons with him as guides, whilst he himself remained to misdirect the pursuers, William safely arrived at Falaise, and, in memory of his escape, {{is said to have}} caused his path to be traced out by a raised <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> part <b>of</b> which is still in existence.|$|R
60|$|Down {{and down}} the fugitives toiled. And now the stream-bed was bare of boulders, and the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> The floods that had rolled down that cañon had here borne away every loose thing. All the floor was bare red and white stone, polished, glistening, slippery, affording treacherous foothold. And the time came when Nas Ta Bega {{abandoned}} the stream-bed {{to take to the}} rock-strewn and cactus-covered ledges above.|$|R
60|$|So they stinted their {{fighting}} for that while and they sat {{them down to}} rest, each upon a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> And a page came to the Red Knight of the Red Lands and unlaced his helm and the dwarf Axatalese did the same for Sir Gareth, and the page and the dwarf took each the helm from off {{the head of his}} master, and so they two sat where the wind might blow cold upon their faces.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} small and dark, as the window was closed by a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> built against it on the outside. It was some {{fourteen}} feet by eight, and here, including the newcomers, eight men lived and slept. Here the Warreners, after a few words with those who were in future to be their comrades, threw themselves down on the ground, and, {{in spite of the}} din which raged around them, were soon fast asleep.|$|R
50|$|From {{the line}} of the walls, there may have been another {{entrance}} on the west side, but this is uncertain. A <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> appears to have been erected {{to the north of the}} castle, either as a form of defence, or to obscure the castle from a road that ran past it from that direction. Despite being visually impressive, the castle was not particularly functional, as the gatehouse was poorly designed and the towers had no usable rooms on the upper stories.|$|R
500|$|The {{walls were}} {{typically}} [...] inches thick and built of flint and mortar, with some limited use of larger sandstone blocks. The height of these walls is uncertain, but sections have survived that {{are up to}} [...] high. The walls stood on a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> between [...] and [...] wide and at least [...] high, protected by a ditch, typically [...] wide and [...] deep, but in places up to [...] wide. A [...] wide cobbled berm ran between the ditch and the wall.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} often {{necessary}} to widen and deepen the ditch outside {{the walls to}} create a more effective barrier to frontal assault and mining. Engineers from the 1520s were also building massive, gently sloping <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> called glacis in front of ditches so that the walls were almost totally hidden from horizontal artillery fire. The main benefit of the glaces was to deny enemy artillery the ability to fire point blank. The lower the angle of elevation, the higher the stopping power.|$|R

25|$|Built {{either by}} Guðfrið or by Harald Bluetooth (if {{it is the}} work {{mentioned}} as newly made in the Frankish royal annals in 808, then Harald did not build it) it stretched from the RheideÅ about 7km to a southern extension of the Schlei bay which is now a lake called Selker Noor. Its palisade was about 3m high, and {{was a little more}} solid than that on the first ramparts. The <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> behind the palisade was about 2m high and 7m wide. It had a V-shaped moat, 4m wide and 3m deep.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls were}} {{typically}} 7.5 ft inches thick and built of flint and mortar, with some limited use of larger sandstone blocks. The height of these walls is uncertain, but sections have survived that {{are up to}} 20 ft high. The walls stood on a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> between 20 ft and 30 ft wide and at least 7 ft high, protected by a ditch, typically 59 ft wide and 16.5 ft deep, but in places up to 82 ft wide. A 10 ft wide cobbled berm ran between the ditch and the wall.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} Brangwens were {{astonished}} {{by all this}} commotion around them. The building of a canal across their land made them strangers in their own place, this raw <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> shutting them off disconcerted them. As they worked in the fields, from beyond the now familiar embankment came the rhythmic run of the winding engines, startling at first, but afterwards a narcotic to the brain. Then the shrill whistle of the trains re-echoed through the heart, with fearsome pleasure, announcing the far-off come near and imminent.|$|R
60|$|On the Boulevard des Italiens, in Paris, is the manufactory of Devisme, {{who makes}} these carabines for the lion-hunters of Algiers. Promenaders, in passing by his windows, stop {{to look at}} {{specimens}} of these bullets exhibited there. They are of various sizes, adapted to barrels of different bores. Some are entire; others are rent and torn in pieces, having been fired into a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> that they might burst there as they would do {{in the body of}} a wild beast, and then be recovered and preserved to show the effect of the explosion.|$|R
60|$|Harry now set {{his men to}} work to make loopholes in the cottages and {{inclosure}} walls, and {{to connect}} the latter by <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> having thorn branches set on the top. Just at the ford itself stood a large water-mill, worked by a stream which here ran into the river. Harry placed sacks before all the windows, leaving only loopholes through which to fire. Some of the troop carried pistols only; others had carbines; and some, short, wide-mouthed guns, which carried large charges of buckshot. Pickets were sent forward a mile toward Reading.|$|R
5000|$|In a field {{just south}} of the village are the remains of a turf {{labyrinth}} or [...] "Miz Maze", an earthwork of uncertain origin that, centuries ago, may have been used for rituals and as a meeting place. The labyrinth was laid out on banks and in the 17th century was re-cut every year by the young men of the village. It was described in 1815 in the second edition of Hutchins' History of Dorset: [...] "On an eminence in the common, {{about a quarter of a}} mile south from the village, is a maze of circular form, surrounded by a bank and ditch, and occupying an eighth part of an acre. The <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> <b>of</b> which it is composed are set almost close together, and are somewhat more than one foot in width and about half a foot in height." ...|$|R
25|$|From {{the line}} of the walls, there may have been another {{entrance}} on the west side, but this is uncertain. A <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> appears to have been erected some distance away {{to the north of the}} castle, either as a form of defence, or perhaps to obscure the castle from a former road that ran past it from that direction. The towers seem not to have had ground-floor entrances. Putlog holes suggest that they had upper floors. Putlog holes in the curtain walls suggest the presence of hoardings to protect defenders. This large, lime-washed, stone, moated castle would have been visually impressive.|$|R
50|$|Skill {{and heavy}} labour were {{required}} to bring the siege artillery ashore, which included twelve 24 pounders, six 12 pounders, four 32 pounders and a further two 24 pounder guns from the Royal Navy. It was necessary to devise a means of getting the guns across the marsh, which lay {{to the west of}} the fortress. 500 men were tasked to build a road made of brushwood fascines. However, part of the new road was in view of the enemy and came under regular fire. As a result, a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> nine feet high had to be built to cover the road.|$|R
6000|$|Hereward and Martin came {{at last to}} {{a narrow}} gully, a murderous place enough. Huge fir-trees roofed it in, and made a night <b>of</b> noon. High <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and great {{boulders}} walled it in right and left for twenty feet above. The track, what with pack-horses' feet, and what with {{the wear and tear}} of five hundred years' rain-fall, was a rut three feet deep and two feet broad, in which no horse could turn. Any other day Hereward would have cantered down it with merely a tightened rein. Today he turned to Martin and said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Edmund and Egbert had debated {{much on the}} {{previous}} days whether they would pile stones behind the gate, but had finally agreed not to do so. They argued that although for a time the stones would impede {{the progress of the}} Danes, these would, if they shattered the door, sooner or later pull down the stones or climb over them; and it was better to have a smooth and level place for defence inside. They had, however, raised a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> ten feet high in a semicircle at a distance of twenty yards within the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{ceremony}} of flooding {{was to be}} performed by the woman, her husband's position entitling her to this distinction. Between {{the river and the}} head of the cutting had been left a strong <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> pierced some distance down by a hole, which hole was kept closed by means of a closely- fitting steel plate. The woman drew the lever releasing this plate, and the water rushed through and began to press against the lock gates. When it had attained a certain depth, the sluices were raised, and the water poured down into the deep basin of the lock.|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} five o'clock {{when he told}} her. They {{were sitting on the}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> a stream, where the lip of turf hung over a hollow <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> yellow <b>earth,</b> and he was hacking away with a stick, as he did when he was perturbed and cruel.|$|R
50|$|Early modern European fortresses were so {{constructed}} as to keep any potential assailant under {{the fire of}} the defenders until the last possible moment. On natural, level ground, troops attacking any high work have a degree of shelter from its fire when close up to it; the glacis consists of a slope with a low grade inclined towards {{the top of the}} wall. This gave defenders a direct line of sight into the assaulting force, allowing them to efficiently sweep the field with fire from the parapet. Additionally, but secondarily, the <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> would shield the walls from being hit directly by cannon fire.|$|R
50|$|The {{very hot}} temperatures, large class sizes {{and lack of}} {{air-conditioning}} in Burkina Faso {{make it very difficult}} for pupils to concentrate. Therefore, we developed an innovative air-cooling system only using natural ventilation. The school is surrounded by a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth,</b> on which trees are planted. The trees provide shade, and rainwater is gathered to provide them with water. Perforated pipes are laid underneath the earth banks, and gather moisture. Wind cools down as it blows through the pipes, and emerges in the classrooms through holes in the floor, providing a zero emissions under-floor cooling system. This design won the 2012 Global Holcim Award Gold.|$|R
