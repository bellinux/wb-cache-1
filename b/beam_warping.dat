50|$|In 1792, Dr Cartwright {{obtained}} {{his last}} patent for weaving machinery; this provided his loom with multiple shuttle boxes for weaving checks and cross stripes.However all his efforts were unavailing; {{it became apparent}} that no mechanism, however perfect, could succeed so long as warps continued to be sized while a loom was stationary. His plans for sizing them while a loom was in operation, and before being placed in a loom, failed. These problems were resolved in 1803, by William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson, by their inventions of the <b>beam</b> <b>warper,</b> and the dressing sizing machine.|$|R

40|$|Yarns of <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> to knit on warp {{knitting}} machines {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension variations lead to produce valleys and ridges of warp yarns on the beam and hence different lengths of individual warp yarns. These length variations lead to loop length variations in warp knitted fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp length variations caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted. Tension variations of individual warp yarns on <b>warp</b> <b>beams</b> for <b>warp</b> knitting were examined. 16 % of warp yarns were outside the permissible tension range in practical environment. The length measurements of 1128 individual yarns of a <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> show that 0 - 1. 7 % length variations exist among the yarns. The fabrics knitted at different tension values ranging from 4 cN to 20 cN show 6. 6 % increase in wale density. Although the fabric weight variation is below 5 %, the microscopic view of the fabrics shows significant change in the size of loops and rupture of filaments. This has caused visual colour difference in the fabric...|$|R

40|$|New exact {{solutions}} for isotropic Kirchhoff plates, with no kinematic boundary constraints, are inferred by an analogy with the cross-section warping of orthotropic, homogeneous Saint-Venant beams bent and twisted by a shear force. The procedure {{is based on}} a formal equivalence between the elastic equilibrium conditions, respectively, for the tangential stresses in terms of a warping function in a Saint-Venant beam and for the bending-twisting moment in a Kirchhoff plate. The analysis refers to simply or multiply connected plates with an isotropic elastic stiffness proportional to the <b>beams</b> <b>warping</b> function. The result extends the one provided by the author for the special case of simple torsion (Barretta, Acta Mech 224 (12) : 2955 - 2964, 2013).

50|$|All weavers are {{self-employed}} and {{can work}} as a 'mill weaver' commissioned {{by any of the}} three mills or as an 'independent weaver' making and selling their own cloth, sometimes on private commission. Mill weavers are supplied with <b>beamed</b> <b>warps</b> and yarn directly from the mills along with instructions on how the cloth must be woven. Once the tweed is woven, it is collected by the mill for finishing and stamping, and is then sold by the mill. Independent weavers on the other hand must purchase yarn from the mills and warp it themselves, often to their own design. The independent weaver then sends their woven cloth to the mill for finishing and stamping (which they pay for as a service) before it is returned to the weaver to sell for themselves. A weaver can work both as a mill weaver and an independent weaver.|$|R

40|$|Seersucker is a {{thin and}} {{puckered}} fabric used to make clothing for spring. Due to its specific structure, this fabric is held away from the skin when worn, facilitating heat dissipation and air circulation.

Additional twin beams arrangement was required for such weaving. The objective of the current study is to produce seersucker fabric on conventional looms using a single <b>warp</b> <b>beam.</b> For achieving this objective, two types of weft yarn: 100 % cotton yarns and blended yarns of cotton and elastane (95. 67 % cotton and 4. 33 % Lycra) are used in groups.

50|$|The warp {{passes from}} the <b>warp</b> <b>beam,</b> passes over a {{friction}} guide roller, where it horizontally {{passes through the}} loom to a breastbeam. Here it turns vertically to the cloth beam. Even tension is essential as any variation will lead to broken threads. As the <b>warp</b> <b>beam</b> empties its effective diameter changes making the warp slacker- tension is maintained by adding a wooden pulley to the beam, around which are two turns of rope that are attached to mill weights- thus retarding the beam through friction. The cloth beam bears a toothed wheel which works a pinion. A ratchet wheel is attached with a click level {{to take up the}} slack in the cloth. This was Roberts invention.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{modeling and}} dynamic properties of a spinning beam with an unsymmetrical cross section are studied. Due to the eccentricity and spinning, transverse deflections along the two principal directions and the torsional motion about the longitudinal axis are coupled. The structural {{model of the}} beam is established based on the Hamilton principle and by incorporating the torsional inertia. Moreover, because of its significant influence on characteristics for the non-circular cross-sectional <b>beam,</b> the <b>warping</b> effect is considered in the formulation. The proposed model is effectively validated in two cases: the spinning beam with a symmetric cross section and the cantilevered beam with an unsymmetrical cross section. Then {{the effects of the}} spinning speed on natural frequencies and mode shapes are investigated. Numerical results reveal that the critical speed is altered with respect to noncoincidence of the centroid and the shear center. For the <b>beams</b> with strong <b>warping</b> rigidities, the warping effect cannot be neglected due to significant influence on natural frequencies...|$|R

This is {{an analysis}} of the stress distribution in the side members of commercial vehicle chassis frames under the effects of the previously little studied longitudinal loads which may act on a truck chassis through spring hanger brackets. The structure analysed is a model chassis frame consisting of channel section side members and four cross members with different joint connections. The developed theories are incorporated into a special purpose finite element program which may be used in the preliminary stages of chassis frame design. Although the program is only used for the longitudinal load case in this thesis, it is generally applicable for other chassis load cases, including torsion, bending,. [...] etc and combination of these. The theoretical results obtained from the program and the finite element analysis on complete chassis frame models are validated against experiments performed on a strain-gauged chassis frame model constructed with the same dimensions and constructional details as the finite element models with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions. Suggestions for the optimum design and attachment positions for components such as spring hanger bracket which may apply longitudinal loads to the side members of the chassis frame are discussed {{from the point of view}} of longitudinal loadings...|$|R

Fabrics up to 15 mm in thickness were constructed with varying amounts of through-the-thickness reinforcement. Tapered T and I sections were also woven, with the shaping produced by progressive removal of ends during construction.
