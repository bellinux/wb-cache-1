5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported Shehri as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat, who was still alive and well. The Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media, denying those early reports, saying that the Shehri brothers had disappeared and have not <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> from since.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1995, Martin {{announced}} he would appeal the sentence. He later dropped the appeal without giving an explanation on 4January 1996, four days before {{it was to have}} <b>been</b> <b>heard.</b> He turned down a subsequent chance to petition the President of Singapore for clemency, saying that he was impatient to be executed.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two servants {{to hear a}} case that should have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> by the justice. The litigants charged that the two servants had wrongly decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E
5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels; Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English. It {{has been reported that}} during the series these fictional languages have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> by more people than the Welsh, Irish, and Scots Gaelic languages combined.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum {{to each other}} above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 605 (I-605) is {{the common}} {{designation}} given by local media outlets to several proposals for a new auxiliary Interstate Highway bypassing I-5 and I-405 in the U.S. state of Washington. Proposals have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> from since the 1960s, including highways connecting from I-5 {{all the way to}} the Canada–US border, and some just between I-5 and I-90. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has no projects designated I-605 at this time. However, a project to convert State Route 18 (SR18) to a limited-access freeway is under construction currently.|$|E
5|$|This {{homophonic}} choral {{passage is}} followed by the first of three short four-bar orchestral ritornellos, with a texture that has already <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> very briefly in the bar when the chorus pause between the fugato and homophonic passages. As in the opening sinfonia, the instruments play in four distinct groups—alto recorders, oboes, upper strings and continuo—but the sparseness there is now replaced by a jubilant canzona-style flourish.|$|E
5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the {{humpback}} whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales only have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E

5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|A 20-day study held by BirdLife International {{discovered}} 265 {{species of}} birds in the park. Of these, the yellow-bellied form of forest robin is widespread. In the study, a pair of Ja River scrub warblers was discovered in a 1 hectare patch of Rhynchospora marsh; its population must be small as there are few such marshes in Nki. Three species of forest nightjar have been observed in the park; Bate's and brown nightjars are common in southeastern Cameroon, while a rarer and unidentified third species' call has <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> twice. It is likely that this is Prigogine's nightjar, as its voice is identical {{to that of the}} only known specimen of this species which was found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two small owls, Sjostedt's and African barred owlets coexist in Nki, due to similar habitat requirements.|$|E
5|$|Beginning work in 2011, the TIRC has {{referred}} 17 cases to {{the circuit court}} for judicial review for potential relief. Three convicts have been freed based on review of their cases. Individuals may initiate claims to the commission. As of April 2016, another 130 cases have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> of torture that was not committed by Burge or his subordinates. The city and state are struggling {{to determine how to}} treat this high number of torture victims in a just way. The sponsors of the bill tried to amend it in 2014 to expand its scope to all claims of torture by police in Chicago, but were unable to get support in the state house. They will try again.|$|E

5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as a boy and had last <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
5|$|Mahler {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{from the start}} of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared—by Deryck Cooke—to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.9 as a defining human statement for its century.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that {{in the minds of the}} authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E
50|$|The Doctor <b>is</b> <b>heard</b> {{in several}} scenes {{that take place}} at other points in time. He <b>is</b> <b>heard</b> obtaining the Black TARDIS, just after the events in Alaska in Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge. He <b>is</b> then <b>heard</b> taking it on its first three trips, (Robophobia, The Doomsday Quatrain and House of Blue Fire). He <b>is</b> also <b>heard</b> {{recruiting}} Sally, in a scene taken {{from the end of}} House of Blue Fire.
