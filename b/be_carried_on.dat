5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E

5|$|The Army {{wanted the}} vehicle to feature a commander’s weapons station, autocannon, coaxial weapon, and an {{anti-tank}} guided missile system. The weapons suite had to be manually operable when damaged and the commander's weapon station had to incorporate a shield.

The Army also stated that the weapon suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} rest of the 1894–95 winter {{preparing}} clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. Kayaks were built, to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water. Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing that the vessel would be crushed, but Fram proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895 the ship's position was 83°34′N, above Greely's previous Farthest North record of 83°24.|$|E
5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount Hope at 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow blindness and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, he had to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others {{to the limits of}} their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E

5|$|Yorks {{design was}} based on the earlier County classes but was {{intended}} to be smaller and cheaper, although better armoured.

5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could <b>be</b> <b>carried.</b> <b>On</b> both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the main deck further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E

5|$|Following the C-5 crash, {{and with}} the cause still unknown, the C-5 fleet was {{grounded}} and the MAC airlift was reduced to using C-141s and C-130s; rather than loading as many evacuees as possible, each evacuee required a seat and a seatbelt, {{reducing the number of}} passengers that could <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> each flight. Each C-141 would carry 94 passengers while each C-130 would carry 75, although these restrictions were relaxed, and then ignored altogether as the pace of the evacuation quickened. Armed guards were also present on each flight to prevent the possibility of hijacking. American commercial and contract carriers continued to fly out of Tan Son Nhut, but with decreasing frequency. In addition, military aircraft from Australia, Indonesia, Iran, Poland, UK, France, and other countries flew in to evacuate their embassy personnel.|$|E
5|$|However, for the Kriegsmarine, Operation Cerberus {{had been}} {{operational}} success, but a strategic reverse. The present situation had forced {{them into an}} operation which was in effect, a strategic withdrawal from the Atlantic. From that point onwards, the German campaign in the Atlantic was to be carried by the U-Boats, unsupported by a surface fleet. With the German ships removed from the French Atlantic ports, the British fleets could contain them much more effectively in Norway and the North Sea. Moreover, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had been damaged by mines and required extensive repairs. Prinz Eugen was torpedoed and her stern collapsed just weeks after Cerberus. All three ships were out of action for extended periods. More bad luck followed, with Gneisenau being knocked out for good in February 1942 and {{the sinking of the}} Scharnhorst in December 1943. None of the ships sailed in the Atlantic again in the intervening period, leaving the Battle of the Atlantic to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> by U-Boat forces.|$|E
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E

5|$|PedroII {{began his}} rule as a figurehead who held {{together}} a realm {{on the verge}} of disintegration. He quickly matured and successfully navigated the empire through repeated and serious crises. By the time of Afonso's death, the nation was entering an unprecedented era of prosperity, development and tranquility. Even as the emperor's political successes and policies began to bear fruit, the lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation to promote the imperial office as a position to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> by his descendants. The emperor turned away from personal and family ties, and focused on upholding the constitution while directing Brazil toward policies that furthered modernization and social advancement. The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer mattered to him, and in 1889, he was deposed in a coup, marking the end of the Empire of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks can also <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used}} to secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E
