5|$|The Orange Bike {{program began}} in 2008 {{as part of}} an {{increase}} in campus sustainability. The program operates a community bikeshare system to reduce the carbon footprint of students' commutes across campus. Riders register once and have the option to ride an Orange Bike anywhere on-campus, lock it up at any university <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> for other riders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bike</b> <b>rack</b> plates: fitted {{onto the}} rear of {{vehicles}} (naturally having bicycles obstructing the registration plate) can have smaller numerical plates (black-on-white design) with Victoria – <b>Bike</b> <b>Rack</b> as the insert, fixed {{on the end of}} the rack and clearly visible. The <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> plates has been updated as of December 2013 with screen printed bottom legend Vic – Stay Alert Stay Alive and <b>Bike</b> <b>Rack</b> legend at top and the ink was changed from black to blue. The slogan was later replaced with the current slogan Victoria – The Education State.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the race, {{before the}} start of competition, athletes will {{generally}} be provided with a <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> to hold their bicycle and a small section of ground space for shoes, clothing, etc. in the transition area. In some triathlons, there are two transition areas, one for the swim/bike change, then one for the bike/run change at a different location.|$|E
50|$|In May 2001 {{the fleet}} {{installed}} its first <b>bike</b> <b>racks,</b> with 75 buses installing 2 <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> on 8 routes on May 17, 2001. In September 2011, {{the last remaining}} buses received <b>bike</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As of 25 June 2016, {{the active}} bus fleet {{consists}} of 160 buses owned by Golden Gate Transit and 17 buses owned by Marin Transit. All 177 buses are lift equipped (...) and have <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> capable of holding 3 bicycles (front mounted) or 2 bicycles (luggage bay). <b>Bike</b> <b>racks</b> were installed on buses beginning in 1999 {{as part of}} the <b>Bike</b> <b>Racks</b> on Buses program.|$|R
50|$|In addition, many arterials and {{collectors}} in Bakersfield contain a bike lane. The {{distance from the}} curb varies depending on whether there is on street parking. GET buses contain <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> {{on the front of}} their buses and Amtrak has <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> on the trains.|$|R
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 6,500 <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> spaces and 224 secure bike lockers {{available}} on campus; 57% of students and 33% of faculty/staff live within 5 miles of the Cal Poly campus, an easy bike commute. The city's SLO Transit bus system provides service to and from campus. Cal Poly financially supports SLO Transit with funding from parking citation revenue (not from state general funds nor from student tuition), so faculty, staff, and students ride for free. Bus service throughout the county is provided by SLO Regional Transit Authority. Discounted passes are available to the Cal Poly community.|$|E
25|$|DA·000 QLD-DEALER TRADE It {{is a new}} Dealer Trade {{plate in}} a <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> size {{introduced}} in October 2015 replacing the two lined square QLD - Limited Use that has a top label space, introduced in January 2000 starting in green then later in maroon. From 1976 to 1999 the format was in annual colours as D92 1000 being {{the year after the}} D prefix. Between 1962 and 1976 dealers were in D1-234 and E1-234 blocks. 1958 to 1962 was in N-123 and P-123 on a square base with large QLD embossing at top. Prior to 1958 it has QD-1234 blocks.|$|E
25|$|Other trains {{serving the}} {{metropolitan}} area, including the metro, also accept bikes. Bicycles are permitted on the city's water buses, {{known as the}} Copenhagen Harbour Buses, and since 2011 {{it has also been}} possible to bring bicycles on the city's network of commuter express buses, labelled S-Buses, but unlike the s-train they levy a fee of DKK 12 (approx. USD 2), and only commuter trains — along with the s-trains — are exempt from a rush hour curfew. In addition 15% of train passengers in the metropolitan region cycle to the station. Taxis are required by law to carry a <b>bike</b> <b>rack,</b> and passengers can bring a bicycle for a small fee.|$|E
50|$|All NRT buses are {{equipped}} with <b>bike</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 2017, it was {{announced}} that <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> would be installed on the fronts of Bx23 and Q50 buses by spring 2018. Each rack, mounted on the front of each bus, would be able to carry two bicycles. This was part of the MTA's ongoing pilot program to mount <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> on several bus routes. In September 2015, the [...] and [...] routes in Staten Island had been the first routes to receive the racks. The expanded program restored <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> on the Flushing to Co-op City bus corridor {{for the first time since}} 2005.|$|R
50|$|All buses are {{wheelchair}} accessible and have <b>bike</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bike racks {{were tested}} at Wilson garage during 2005 and 2006 using the Orion V, VI and later VII bus models. TTC staff {{concluded}} that the pilot project was not a success and {{that it should be}} discontinued, but the Commission disagreed, and voted to not only continue it, but to direct that bike racks would be installed on all new buses starting in 2007. The Commission then directed staff to look into the cost of retrofitting the entire bus fleet with bike racks. The original <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> model will not be used on newer buses, due to it blocking the high beams on the Orion VII, and a different model from the same manufacturer will be used starting on 2007 deliveries. None of this was included in the five-year capital budget.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{as part of}} a $130 {{million and}} an {{estimated}} 18-month project, the MTA began installing new subway grates in September 2008 in an attempt to prevent rain from overflowing into the subway system. The metallic structures, designed with the help of architectural firms and meant as a piece of public art, are placed atop existing grates but with a [...] sleeve to prevent debris and rain from flooding the subway. The racks will at first be installed in the three most flood-prone areas as determined by hydrologists: Jamaica, Tribeca, and the Upper West Side. Each neighborhood has its own distinct design, some featuring a wave-like deck which increases in height and features seating (as in Jamaica), others with a flatter deck that includes seating and a <b>bike</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} is {{adjacent to a}} rail trail, {{and there is a}} [...] <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> by the building's northern end. The village of New Paltz purchased its section of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor from Conrail in 1991, formally opening it on October9, 1993 as a public walkway, the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. The permit allowing La Stazione to operate as a restaurant also required the placement of a sign in the building's parking lot to indicate the presence of the trail. The village allowed La Stazione to place a public picnic table under an overhang by the rail trail, on the condition that the restaurant did not provide outdoor food service. In August 1999, the restaurant was forced to remove a gas tank and gas line that were placed under the trail; failure to do so could have resulted in the revocation of La Stazione's certificate of occupancy, preventing the building from being operated as a restaurant.|$|E
25|$|After {{the removal}} of the {{sidewalks}} starting in 1943, bicyclists were able to use QBx1 buses of the Queens Surface Corporation, which could carry bicycles on the front-mounted <b>bike</b> <b>racks.</b> However, since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority absorbed the bus routes formerly operated by Queens Surface, the <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> have been eliminated, though the MTA will reintroduce <b>bike</b> <b>racks</b> on Q50 Limited (the successor route to the QBx1) buses in spring 2018. For the time being, bicyclists are now forced to detour to the Triborough Bridge. Whether a new bikeway or walkway will be reconstructed on the bridge in the future is uncertain.|$|R

2500|$|NSW Auxiliary A {{supplementary}} {{plate to}} be {{displayed on a}} <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> or other kind of racks displaying the duplicate number/alpha combination was introduced in October 1995, initially in black on off white non reflective and screen printed legend as 'NSW - BIKE RACK" [...] In 1998 it changed to black on reflective white, again on screen printed legend. In 1999 the legend changed to embossed. In 2006 the legend reverted to screen printed. In 2012 the name was changed to [...] "NSW- AUXILIARY" [...] again in screen printed. in 2016, the arrangements extended to tow trucks and other vehicles covered in this scheme and in December the legend was revised to add embossed NSW and the rest screen printed.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} factor {{to consider is}} weather protection. If bike racks are being used for long-term parking, the <b>bike</b> <b>rack</b> should be placed under some form of weather protection.
