40|$|Web-based digital {{libraries}} have sped {{up the process}} that scholars use to find new, important research papers. With powerful searching capabilities and rich <b>bibliographic</b> meta <b>data,</b> a digital library is a great resource. Unfortunately, current {{digital libraries}} are limited by their inadequate webpage-based paradigm, and {{it is easy for}} even the most experienced scholar to get lost in the vast quantity of published material available. A paper and its immediate references are shown on a webpage, but it is not obvious where that paper belongs in the larger context of a field of research. The main goal of our research was two-fold. First, to develop and test the effectiveness of an application that can augment a scholar’s interaction with a digital library and explore <b>bibliographic</b> meta <b>data</b> using a defined set of visualizations. These visualizations needed to provide different levels of visibility into a paper’s citation network without losing focus of the currently viewed paper. The application, called PaperCube, needed to support navigation between papers and, to a limited extent, the authors of those papers. The application needed to be able to provide insight into author to author citation networks as well as collaboration relationships. The hypothesis was that by replacing the traditional webpage-based paradigm with a suite of visualization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Keyword {{search is}} a {{user-friendly}} way to query text, HTML, XML documents and even relational databases. The previous well-known semantic of LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) {{is used for}} XML keyword search based on tree model. However, LCA cannot exploit the information in ID references, thus may return a large tree containing irrelevant results. Another keyword search approach based on general digraph model of XML captures ID references, but it is computationally expensive. In this paper, we first discuss new LCRA semantics based on special directed graph model that distinguishes tree edges and reference edges in XML to overcome the problems of tree model and general digraph model. In particular, LCRA = LCA + LRA + ELRA, where LRA stands for Lowest Referred Ancestors and ELRA is Extended LRA. Then, we explore the semantics of existing <b>bibliographic</b> XML <b>data</b> to further simplify the LCRA semantics. We argue that keyword search based on simplified LCRA semantics for <b>bibliographic</b> XML <b>data</b> are effective and efficient as they not only elegantly capture the semantic information in ID references but also can be computed as efficiently as LCA for a large XML database. A demo of our LCRA system on the updated 363 M DBLP data is available a...|$|R
