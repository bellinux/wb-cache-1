5|$|Currently {{the only}} <b>barge</b> in use, the Vernon C. Bain Center {{is the third}} prison <b>barge</b> that the New York Department of Corrections has used. In its history, the prison has served {{traditional}} inmates, juvenile inmates and is currently used as a holding and temporary processing center. The added security of the prison being on water has prevented at least four attempted escapes. The <b>barge</b> is named in memorial for warden Vernon C. Bain who died in an automobile accident.

5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the <b>barge</b> with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a <b>barge</b> through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the <b>barge</b> {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E

5|$|After the {{exposition}} {{ended the}} Columbus entered passenger service, {{and an additional}} deck (third superstructure, fifth total) was added during the 18991900 winter season. Despite the Columbus success at the exposition, and McDougall's promotional efforts, the whaleback design never caught on. By 1900, the last whalebacks had been built in Superior: the Alexander McDougall in 1899 (the last powered ship), and the John Smeaton, the last whaleback <b>barge.</b> The American Steel <b>Barge</b> Company was sold to the American Ship Building Company, becoming their Superior Works, and switched to more conventional laker designs.|$|E
5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the <b>barge</b> industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} <b>barge</b> industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the <b>barge</b> industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Finn has enough, {{and knocks}} the king's clock from the wall. It crashes into the kingdom's huge stove, {{knocking}} over {{a pot of}} water. The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm updraft going into the chimney to cease; this updraft was actually holding Seven's <b>barge</b> in stasis all of this time. The <b>barge</b> comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E

5|$|On July 28, 1928 William S. Grattan {{responded to}} the oil <b>barge</b> James F. Cahill, loaded with 5,000 barrels of crude oil, that was aflame. After burning 17 hours, the barge's mooring lines gave way and the <b>barge</b> began to drift. William S. Grattans crew {{attempted}} to attach tow lines to the drifting <b>barge</b> but it struck a dock at an oil company where the empty oil tanker B.B. McColl was moored. The fumes on the B.B. McColl ignited causing an explosion and fire that engulfed William S. Grattan. Captain Thomas Hylant along with his crew abandoned ship and swam through the flames to shore. Chief Engineer Thomas Lynch of William S. Grattan lost his life and seven other crew members were injured. The unattended boilers on William S. Grattan soon ran dry and exploded, leaving the ship burned out and heavily damaged.|$|E

50|$|Marine {{oil tanker}} and <b>barges</b> can {{transport}} this petroleum {{all around the}} world. These vessels are used because they can carry a lot of fuel, so the amount it costs per barrel to move this oil is very cheap. These tankers are also really {{the only way to}} move crude oil across the oceans. Usually the larger tankers are used to transport this fuel on a global scale, taking fuel from one continent to the other. <b>Barges</b> are a lot like tankers, however <b>barges</b> are a lot smaller and do not have any method of propulsion to move them. <b>Barges</b> are often pushed or towed by tugs. This makes <b>barges</b> very poor for transporting this oil for long distances. <b>Barges</b> are very poor for traveling across rough seas, so they are used in calmer waters. However, these <b>barges</b> are usually used for transporting the fuel shorter distances.|$|R
