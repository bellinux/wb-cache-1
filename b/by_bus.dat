5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided <b>by</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} of Toronto in the east, in the 19th century, {{led to the}} development of housing stock along the Kingston Road and Danforth Road corridors in Scarborough.
