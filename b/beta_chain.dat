25|$|The {{serotyping}} {{efficiency of}} DQ1 recognition relative to DQ5 and DQ6 is listed below. Since DQ1 recognizes alpha, the DQ5 and DQ6 recognition are to <b>beta</b> <b>chain.</b> Meaning that DQ1 is corecognized with DQ5 and DQ6.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} a double {{immunofluorescence}} technique to identify newly formed cells expressing cytoplasmic and/or surface T-cell receptor <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> in mouse embryo thymus. In addition, we have localized these cells to the developing thymic cortex by immunoperoxidase labelling of frozen sections. The first positive cells appear in small numbers in the thymus at Day 15 of gestation and express cytoplasmic but not surface <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> (C beta+). At Day 16 of gestation, cells appear that express small capped areas of surface <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> as well as cytoplasmic <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> (C beta+S beta+ cells). Just prior to birth, a cohort of cells appears that express surface <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> but no cytoplasmic <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> detectable by the methods employed (S beta+ cells). These results and vincristine mitosis-blocking studies suggest that a proliferating population of cortical thymocytes accumulate cytoplasmic <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> before giving rise to T cells that express surface <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> (presumably in association with alpha chains). When a monoclonal antibody to <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> is present in organ cultures of embryonic thymus, C beta+ thymocytes continue to be generated {{but there is an}} absence of S beta+ cells. The latter appear after the cultures are transferred to fresh medium not containing the antibody...|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of beta-phase chains in PFO can be formed through dip-pen nanolithography, to represent wavelength changes in metamaterials. The dip-pen technique allows {{a scale of}} 500 nm > to be visible. The <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> can be converted into the glassy films by adding extra stress to the main fluorine backbone unit, whether <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> are formed is determined by peaks in wavelength absorption. <b>Beta</b> <b>chains</b> can also be confirmed to be present by using solvent to non-solvent mixtures. If the molecule were to be dipped into this mixture for ten seconds, the chains with no dissolution of films are able to produce these said <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the association-dissociation {{kinetics}} of <b>beta</b> <b>chains,</b> analytical molecular sieve measurements were made to determine the stoichiometries and equilibrium constants. At pH 7. 0 in phosphate buffer, the assembly of human (beta) CO, (beta) O(, 2), deoxy (beta) and cyanomet (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains</b> can be presented as: tetramer-dimer-monomer. In contrast to human hemoglobin, liganded (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains</b> are less dissociated than deoxy (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains.</b> Rapid deoxygenation of (beta) O(, 2) leads to increased dissociation of (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains,</b> while rapid CO binding to deoxy (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains</b> leads to increased association. Both light-scattering and absorbance changes are associated with these relaxation processes. Dual-beam light-scattering and absorbance stopped-flow devices {{were used to determine}} two dissociation rate constants, k(, 42) and k(, 21), for both (beta) CO and deoxy (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains.</b> The association rate constants, k(, 24) and k(, 12), were then obtained from the equilibrium constants. The k(, 42) rate constants for (beta) CO and deoxy (beta) were very sensitive to phosphate concentration. ^ An experiment in which deoxy (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains</b> at pH 9. 0 were quickly converted to (beta) CO at pH 7. 0 and the subsequent light-scattering changes followed, showed that the conformation of the (beta) dimer at pH 9. 0 is different from that at pH 7. 0. The rate of the conformational change appears to be slow (t(, 1 / 2) (TURNEQ) 3 min). ^ The reaction of p-mercurybenzoate with sulfhydryls on the (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains</b> is complex. The triphasic absorbance changes at 254 nm associated with PMB binding showed that both SH 2 ̆ 7 s on the (beta) monomer and one (or 2) on the dimer react rapidly with PMB. The observed light-scattering changes show that (beta) (2 ̆ 7 PMB) chains dissociate in the course of PMB binding. These kinetic results allowed us to suggest a reasonable mechanism for PMB binding to (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains.</b> ^ The self-assemblies of the isolated carp (alpha) and (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains</b> were studied by large-zone gel-filtration. Carp (beta) CO at pH 7. 0 was found to be more dissociated than deoxy (beta). At pH 9. 0, both (beta) CO and deoxy (<b>beta)</b> <b>chains</b> are tightly associated. Carp (alpha) CO and deoxy (alpha) chains show a D (DBLHARR) 2 M stoichiometry, similar to human (alpha) CO at pH 7. 0. ...|$|R
25|$|Glycation of {{proteins}} {{is a frequent}} occurrence, {{but in the case}} of hemoglobin, a nonenzymatic reaction occurs between glucose and the N-end of the <b>beta</b> <b>chain.</b> This forms a Schiff base which is itself converted to 1-deoxyfructose. This rearrangement is an example of an Amadori rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin E {{is due to}} {{a single}} point {{mutation}} in the gene for the <b>beta</b> <b>chain</b> with a glutamate-to-lysine substitution at position 26. It {{is one of the most}} prevalent hemoglobinopathies with 30 million people affected. Hemoglobin E is very common in parts of Southeast Asia. HbE erythrocytes have an unidentified membrane abnormality that renders the majority of the RBC population relatively resistant to invasion by P falciparum.|$|E
25|$|TCR {{rearrangement}} {{occurs in}} two steps. First the TCRβ chain is rearranged at the DN3 stage of T cell development. The TCRβ chain is paired with the pre-Tα {{to generate the}} pre-TCR. The cellular disadvantage in the rearrangement process {{is that many of}} the combinations of the T cell receptor gene fragments are non-functional. To eliminate thymocytes which have made a non-functional T cell receptor, only cells that have successfully rearranged the <b>beta</b> <b>chain</b> to produce a functional pre-TCR are allowed to develop beyond the DN3 stage. Cells that fail to produce a functional pre-TCR are eliminated by apoptosis. This process is referred to as the beta-selection checkpoint. Successful beta-selection requires that TCRβ is produced, TCRβ is capable of pairing with pre-Tα to generate the pre-TCR, and that the pre-TCR can interact on the cell surface with the TCR signalling proteins.|$|E
40|$|I-A beta-chain cDNA clones from mice of the q, k, u, s, and f haplotypes {{have been}} {{isolated}} and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence comparisons among these five A <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> show considerable allelic {{variation in the}} region encoding the first external (beta 1) domain of the mature A beta protein. The beta 1 domain variability is clustered into three discrete regions, two of which divide the A <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> into subgroups, suggesting an evolutionary history for the separation of alleles in inbred strains of mice. The amino acid sequences of these five chains are compared {{to each other and}} to previously published I-A <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> Correlations are made between the primary structural differences and the serologic and immune response characteristics mapping to the I-A subregion...|$|R
40|$|Isolated alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> from Xenopus laevis {{hemoglobin}} {{have been}} purified. The isolation procedure yields native alpha chains whose functional behavior {{has been characterized}} and {{compared with that of}} human alpha <b>chains.</b> Isolated <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> in the presence of oxygen are characterized by low stability, and hence their functional characterization was limited to the CO binding kinetics. When stoichiometric amounts of the isolated alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> are mixed, a tetramer characterized by heme-heme interactions and oxygen affinity comparable to that of the native molecule is readily reconstituted. Moreover, both chains, under appropriate conditions, form stable hybrid tetramers with the partner subunits from human hemoglobin; results on the functional properties of these hybrid hemoglobins are presented and discussed in relation to the stereochemical model of the Root effect...|$|R

25|$|Research {{has been}} able to show the {{function}} of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and Lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) Directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis; (2) It has the ability to bind to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for triglyceride synthesis; and (3) increased apoB catabolism. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways. (4) Niacin decreases CETP mass and activity, and this synergistic effect with the decrease in triglyceride levels, can indirectly raise HDL cholesterol levels. The study has also been able to show direct effects on the <b>beta</b> <b>chain</b> of ATP synthase (5) and on production (6) and hepatic uptake (7) of apoA-I also increase HDL cholesterol levels. Thus by affecting the pathway reducing lipid levels help in reducing CVD.|$|E

2500|$|In summary, β-selection is {{the first}} checkpoint, where the T cells {{that are able to}} form a {{functional}} pre-TCR with an invariant alpha chain and a functional <b>beta</b> <b>chain</b> are allowed to continue development in the thymus. [...] Next, positive selection checks that T cells have successfully rearranged their TCRα locus and are capable of recognizing peptide-MHC complexes with appropriate affinity. [...] Negative selection in the medulla then obliterates T cells that bind too strongly to self-antigens expressed on MHC molecules. [...] These selection processes allow for tolerance of self by the immune system. [...] Typical T cells that leave the thymus (via the corticomedullarly junction) are self-restricted, self-tolerant, and singly positive.|$|E
5000|$|Alpha-thalassemia. Normal adult {{hemoglobin}} {{is composed}} of two alpha and two <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> Alpha thalassemia patients have partial or complete defects in alpha globin production, leading to a relative abundance of <b>beta</b> globin <b>chains</b> in the cell. These excess <b>beta</b> globin <b>chains</b> aggregate to form HbH, which has decreased solubility and precipitates in the red blood cell cytoplasm. This is not direct damage to hemoglobin per se, but rather a perturbation in the quaternary structure of hemoglobin.|$|R
40|$|Two {{haemoglobin}} components {{have been}} identified and purified from fallow-deer (Dama dama) erythrocytes. They are present in similar amounts and the two tetrameric molecules share the same alpha chain, while two different <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> are detected in the two components. The <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> differ by 14 residues, even though they both have 145 amino-acid residues, which account for a molecular mass of 16, 023 and 16, 064 Da, respectively, while alpha chain has 141 residues, yielding a molecular mass of 15, 142 Da. Compared with human Hb, the N-terminal region of both <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> shows deletion of Val beta 1 and the replacement of His beta 2 by a methionyl residue, a modification which is common to most ruminant haemoglobins. Although both isolated components show a low intrinsic affinity for oxygen, meaningful {{differences between the two}} haemoglobins have been found with respect to the effect of heterotropic effectors, such as 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate and chloride ions. In view of the high sequence homology between the two components, the different effect of heterotropic ligands has been tentatively correlated to possible localized structural variations between <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> of the two haemoglobin components...|$|R
40|$|Two {{proteins}} that specifically bind the T-cell growth factor interleukin 2 (IL- 2) {{have been identified}} previously {{on the surface of}} T cells; these proteins have been designated IL- 2 R alpha and IL- 2 R beta for the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> of the IL- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R). The association of these independent binding proteins with each other on the surface of activated T cells correlates with the generation of high-affinity binding sites. These high-affinity sites transduce the major mitogenic signal of IL- 2, yet the mechanisms of association of the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> with each other as well as signal transduction in response to IL- 2 are unknown. Cotransfection experiments of cDNAs encoding the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> in T cells and fibroblasts have suggested functional requirements for other T cell-specific factor(s). We now provide biochemical evidence for a distinct 100 -kDa protein that interacts with the alpha or <b>beta</b> <b>chains,</b> or both, {{on the surface of the}} IL- 2 -dependent cell line CTLL- 2 as well as activated murine splenocytes. This same 100 -kDa protein is capable of being chemically cross-linked to 125 I-labeled IL- 2...|$|R
2500|$|The {{classification}} of the [...] "A4" [...] antigens was complicated. The [...] "A4" [...] subset evolved to become D-region antigens, {{which was a}} large cluster of genes that encoded MHC class II. Several renamings occurred. The D-region has 8 major coding loci that combine to form 3 different protein groups; DP, DQ, and DR. DRw antigens {{were the first to}} be split, a process made easy by the virtue of having an invariant alpha chain, but complicated by 4 <b>beta</b> <b>chain</b> loci (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5). Serotypes to DQ reacted with alpha and beta chains, or both of certain isoforms. The proper classification was greatly aided by gene sequencing and PCR. Classification and description of DP antigens is ongoing.|$|E
2500|$|The gene defect is a known {{mutation}} of {{a single}} nucleotide (see single-nucleotide polymorphism – SNP) (A to T) of the β-globin gene, which results in glutamic acid (E/Glu) being substituted by valine (V/Val) at position 6. Haemoglobin S with this mutation {{is referred to as}} HbS, as opposed to the normal adult HbA. This is normally a benign mutation, causing no apparent effects on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of haemoglobin in conditions of normal oxygen concentration. What it does allow for, under conditions of low oxygen concentration, is the polymerization of the HbS itself. The deoxy form of haemoglobin exposes a hydrophobic patch on the protein between the E and F helices. [...] The hydrophobic side chain of the valine residue at position 6 of the <b>beta</b> <b>chain</b> in haemoglobin is able to associate with the hydrophobic patch, causing HbS molecules to aggregate and form fibrous precipitates.|$|E
2500|$|T-cell binding {{region of}} the SAg interacts with the Variable region on the <b>Beta</b> <b>chain</b> of the T-cell Receptor. [...] A given SAg can {{activate}} {{a large proportion of}} the T-cell population because the human T-cell repertoire comprises only about 50 types of Vβ elements and some SAgs are capable of binding to multiple types of Vβ regions. [...] This interaction varies slightly among the different groups of SAgs. [...] Variability among different people in the types of T-cell regions that are prevalent explains why some people respond more strongly to certain SAgs. [...] Group I SAgs contact the Vβ at the CDR2 and framework {{region of the}} molecule. [...] SAgs of Group II interact with the Vβ region using mechanisms that are conformation-dependent. [...] These interactions are for the most part independent of specific Vβ amino acid side-chains. [...] Group IV SAgs have been shown to engage all three CDR loops of certain Vβ forms. [...] The interaction takes place in a cleft between the small and large domains of the SAg and allows the SAg to act as a wedge between the TCR and MHC. [...] This displaces the antigenic peptide away from the TCR and circumvents the normal mechanism for T-cell activation.|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} scanning (SEM), transmission (TS), and freeze-etching (FE) electron microscopic {{studies have}} agreed in confirming that in thalassaemic erythrocytes, previously incubated with brilliant cresyl blue (BCB), the unpaired alpha chains precipitate {{in the central}} portions of the cell whereas excess <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> locate in the submembranous regions. This {{is due to the}} fact that <b>beta</b> <b>chains,</b> possessing two thiols instead of only one (as in alpha chains), are more liable to bind to similar groups contained in the inner red cell leaflet. Less soluble alpha chains tend to form inter-chain bridges and thus precipitate centrally. SEM observations have given evidence that on the surface of the affected red cells denaturated alpha chains give rise to large and shallow invaginations whereas denatured <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> lead to diffuse wrinkled appearance. The causes of the different SEM aspects have been suggested...|$|R
40|$|The clathrin-associated protein complex 2 (AP- 2 complex) is a {{group of}} {{proteins}} associated with clathrin-coated vesicles and believed to interact with cytoplasmic domains of receptors found in the plasma membrane. AP- 2 was purified as an assembly of several polypeptide <b>chains</b> (alpha, <b>beta,</b> AP 50, and AP 17), of which only the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> (100 - 115 kDa) show significant heterogeneity. We have obtained cDNA clones for two distinct rat brain <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> We have also studied the domain organization of bovine brain AP- 2 complexes by selective proteolysis. Results of these studies show that the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> have a similar two-domain organization. Their amino-terminal domains are relatively invariant whereas their carboxyl-terminal domains are variable in both sequence and length.

40|$|Membrane {{fragments}} from electric {{tissue of}} Torpedo californica containing {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} are composed of four different polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 40, 000 (alpha), 48, 000 (beta), 62, 000 (gamma), and 66, 000 (delta). The alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> are still present in all and gamma and delta {{in some of the}} receptor preparations after Triton X- 100 extraction and purification by affinity chromatography. All components of the receptor react covalently with the photoaffinity label 4 -azido- 2 -nitrobenzyltrimethylammonium fluoroborate, the delta chain incorporating less of the reagent as compared to the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> Agonists and antagonists containing a quaternary ammonium group protect all chains against the label; the principal neurotoxin from Naja naja siamensis protects the alpha chain only. We conclude that the alpha chain binds the neurotoxin from Naja naja, the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> are involved in the binding of ligands with quaternary ammonium groups, and the function of the gamma and delta chains remains to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Among DR 4 -associated HLA-D antigens, {{distinct}} and consistent structural variations {{were found for}} the products of two human "Ia-like" loci, DR and DS. Analysis of neuraminidase-treated immunoprecipitated DR molecules from 15 HLA-DR 4 -associated HLA-D homozygous B-lymphoblastoid cell lines by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified five distinct DR <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> In addition, gel analysis of immunoprecipitated DS molecules identified three distinct DS <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> Altogether, five distinct DR 4 haplotypes were defined according to the observed structural diversity of the DR and DS <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> These gene products presumably contribute the dominant polymorphisms recognized by T cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Thus, these studies indicate that the serologic specificity known as HLA-DR 4 {{is not a single}} haplotype, but a determinant present on products of individual loci arrayed into distinctly different haplotypes. These findings suggest that distinct products of individual loci, rather than conventional HLA specificities defined by alloimmune sera, may represent the genetic markers relevant to HLA-D/DR associated diseases...|$|R

40|$|Hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding heme protein {{of blood}} is {{composed}} of four subunits of two types, alpha and beta. Although the protein when isolated is diamagnetic, by oxidation it {{can be converted to}} various paramagnetic ferric forms exhibiting specific electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we have shown that the symmetry of the heme of isolated ferric alpha chains is {{different from that of the}} heme of these same subunits when associated with ferric <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> in the parent tetramer. The high-spin form of the isolated ferric alpha chains shows a clearly resolved departure from tetragonal symmetry in contrast to ferrihemoglobin A, where the environment of the iron of all four chains is nearly tetragonal. This difference in heme symmetry suggests that the maintenance of tetragonal symmetry in the hemoglobin tetramer must be brought about by the configuration the alpha chains assume due to their contact with the <b>beta</b> <b>chains.</b> When isolated from the tetramer, some parts of the alpha chain must undergo physical displacement from a configuration that had been stabilized by the <b>beta</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{photosynthetic}} purple bacteria {{the antenna}} complexes function as light-harvesting systems that absorb light radiation and transfer the excitation {{energy to the}} photosynthetic reaction centres. The antenna complexes are generally composed of two types of polypeptides (alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>chains)</b> which are arranged in a ring-like fashion creating a cylinder that spans the membrane; the proteins bind two or three types of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules and different types of carotenoids depending on the species. Both the alpha and the <b>beta</b> <b>chains</b> of antenna complexes are small proteins of 42 to 68 [...] residues which share a three-domain organization. They are composed of a N-terminal hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain followed by a transmembrane region and a C-terminal hydrophilic periplasmic domain. In the transmembrane region of both chains there is a conserved histidine which is most probably involved in the binding of the magnesium atom of a bacteriochlorophyll group.
