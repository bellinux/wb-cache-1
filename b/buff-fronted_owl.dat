40|$|We {{present the}} second {{record of the}} <b>Buff-fronted</b> <b>Owl</b> (Aegolius harrisii) in the Pampa Biome, South Brazil. On 17 January 2010 an adult male was found dead at the {{roadside}} along the BR- 290, São Gabriel municipality, center-east of Rio Grande do Sul state. The specimen probably collided with a car when using the area for foraging. The record reported here agrees with the suggestion that A. harrisii can use disturbed and open areas...|$|E
