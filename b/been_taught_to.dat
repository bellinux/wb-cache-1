In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low.

In a subsequent interview with the ABC, Doris recalled her removal in 1931 from her mother at age three or four, and subsequent rearing at the settlement. She was not reunited with her mother until she was 25; all those years, she believed that her mother had given her away.
