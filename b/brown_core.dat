40|$|The {{nature and}} mode of origin of quartz-cored tourmalines (QCT) are studied from {{hydrothermal}} quartz veins within massive quartz-tourmaline (MQT) rocks at Roche, SW England. The QCT are annular, have blue maximum absorption colour and occur together with tourmalines with <b>brown</b> <b>cores</b> rimmed by blue tourmaline. Where the quartz core is not continuous throughout {{the length of}} the QCT crystals, the tourmaline <b>core</b> has <b>brown</b> maximum absorption colour, similar to tourmalines without quartz cores. Both the blue and brown tourmalines are schorl, but are compositionally distinct showing different Fe/(Mg + Ti) ratios and Ca concentrations. Fluid inclusion data indicate quartz precipitation from a moderate salinity (~ 20 – 25 wt. % NaCl eq.) brine which periodically boiled following pressure drops within the vein system. The QCT show rheomorphic and lobate textures on their inner margins indicating selective dissolution of their brown, relative Mg-, Ti- and Ca-rich tourmaline cores and replacement with quartz. This presents a problem in terms {{of the nature of the}} fluid responsible for such selective dissolution because tourmaline is generally highly resistant under the normal range of hydrothermal fluid conditions. It is proposed that the relatively high concentrations of Ti, Mg and Ca in the brown tourmaline caused significant lattice strain, which together with an increase in pH, and probably Al, in the boiling hydrothermal fluid caused the <b>brown</b> <b>cores</b> to become unstable compared with the Fe-rich blue tourmaline rims...|$|R

In two of the occurrences the copper is associated with carbonate ooze host sediment: nannofossil ooze in Sam-ple 550 - 29 - 2, 66. 5 - 67. 5 cm and somewhat coarser grained turbiditic siltstone laminae in Sample 550 - 29 - 4, 138 - 140 cm.

30|$|T 2 -distribution {{response}} of Bandera Brown sandstone on water and HCl injection is shown Fig.  9 a, b. Injection {{of fresh water}} can cause swelling of illite and fine migration of kaolinite. However, the incremental porosity and cumulative porosity was not changed much on injection of fresh water. Kaolinite was in minor fraction (0.7 %) in the Bandera brown, and therefore, fine migration was not severe. The illite was highest in the Bandera <b>Brown</b> <b>core</b> (5.2 %) compared to Berea and Bandera Grey. However, the formation damage in Bandera Brown (Kf/Ki[*]=[*] 0.85) was much less compared to Berea (Kf/Ki[*]=[*] 0.16) and Bandera Grey (Kf/Ki[*]=[*] 0.34). In the presence of dispersed clay, the formation damage should be more in Bandera Brown owing to the high concentration of illite. The lowest damage to Bandera Brown suggests that the illite was partially dispersed and the rest was structural clay. Injection of HCl caused a similar damage to the permeability that was observed for fresh water (Kf/Ki[*]=[*] 0.85). On injection of HCl, the cumulative porosity increased while incremental porosity shifts towards smaller relaxation time. This shifting {{is an indication of}} the creation of micropores by the reaction of HCl with chlorite. As discussed previously, the reaction of HCl with chlorite can result in dissolution or precipitation. For precipitation, the pH should be approached to 2. However, in this case, we used 15 % HCl and the pH was less than 1. Therefore, the only dissolution occurs without any precipitation. The reaction of HCl with illite can cause fine migration that can settle in macropores. Therefore, the T 2 -relaxation response shifted towards smaller relaxation time.|$|E

40|$|The Devonian–early Carboniferous (354. 1 ± 3. 5 Ma: {{conventional}} zircon U–Pb age) Sázava intrusion (biotite-amphibole quartz diorite, tonalite and granodiorite) of the Central Bohemian Pluton (CBP) {{associated with}} bodies of (olivine, pyroxene-) amphibole gabbro, gabbrodiorite, (quartz) diorite and rare hornblendite, gives {{an opportunity for}} a comparative study of a rather shallow, calc-alkaline magma-mixing zone at two levels, separated by a vertical difference of approximately 1 km. The deeper section (Příbram) displays the direct evidence for the existence of a long-lived, periodically tapped and replenished, floored magma chamber (MASLI). The contacts between the subhorizontal sheet-like basic bodies and the surrounding, commonly cumulus-rich, Sázava granitoid, are arcuate, and cut by a series of veins and ascending pipes. Shallow-dipping swarms of strongly elongated and flow-aligned mafic microgranular enclaves (MME), concordant with the contacts of the basic bodies, are commonplace. The higher level (Teletín) section shows relatively independent basic intrusions, some of them distinctly hybrid in character and mainly of quartz dioritic composition, surrounded by relatively homogeneous, nearly cumulus-free Sázava tonalite rich in texturally variable MME. Larger quartz microdiorite bodies and the MME, both interpreted as hybrids, contain varying proportions of highly heterogeneous plagioclase megacrysts with complex zoning, particularly well shown by cathodoluminescence (CL). Most often the megacrysts have cores of labradorite-anorthite, partly resorbed and overgrown by andesine rims but some are strongly brecciated and fragments have been annealed by rim growth. Also characteristic are long prisms of apatite, oikocrysts of quartz and K-feldspar and zoned amphibole. The latter has brown pargasite and magnesiohastingsite cores, resorbed and overgrown by magnesiohornblende, compositionally similar to the amphibole in the Sázava tonalite. The <b>brown</b> <b>cores</b> are probably relics of a higher P–T stage, with temperature exceeding 900 °C.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Sea ice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in ocean–atmosphere heat exchange, global albedo and the marine ecosystem. Knowledge of variation in sea-ice extent is essential in order to understand past climates, and to model possible future climate scenarios. This paper presents results from a short firn core spanning 15 years collected from near Mount Brown, Wilhelm II Land, East Antarctica. Variations of methanesulphonic acid (MSA) at Mount Brown were positively correlated with sea-ice extent from the coastal region surrounding Mount Brown (60 – 1208 E) and from around the entire Antarctic coast (0 – 3608 E). Previous results from Law Dome identified this MSA–sea-ice relationship and proposed it as an Antarctic sea-ice proxy (Curran and others, 2003), with the strongest results found for the local Law Dome region. Our data provide supporting evidence for the Law Dome proxy (at another site in East Antarctica), but a deeper Mount <b>Brown</b> ice <b>core</b> is required to confirm the sea-ice decline suggested by Curran and others (2003).

Storage in 50 pm thick low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags at 0 °C considerably delayed yellowing in all experiments, even after fruit was removed to 20 °C for 1 {{week at the}} end of storage. The addition of an ethylene absorbent made from potassium permanganate on aluminium oxide (Purafil II) further delayed yellowing. Carbon dioxide levels in both treatments varied, but were generally in the range 2 - 3 %. Oxygen levels remained high, generally 16 - 19 %. In bags without Purafil, ethylene levels rose slightly during storage and were generally about 0. 15 pi I 1. When Purafil was included in the bags, the ethylene level was reduced 10 -fold or more. A sensory test indicated that the use of LDPE bags and ethylene absorbent resulted in fruit with better eating quality than fruit stored in air. Disorders over the 3 -year investigation were low even after long-term storage. The use of polyethylene bags reduced the severity of flesh browning, and flesh spot decay was virtually absent.

40|$|<b>Brown</b> clay <b>cores</b> {{from the}} Madagascar and Crozet basins show the {{following}} evidence of excess pore pressures: {{large amounts of}} flow-in, increasing average sedimentation rate with age, and nonlinear temperature gradients. Additionally, many hilltops in these basins have no visible sediment cover. The bare hilltops may result from periodic slumping caused by excess pore pressures. Calculated excess pore pressures which equal or exceed the overburden pressure were inferred from water fluxes predicted by nonlinear temperature gradients and laboratory permeability measurements by using Darcy's law. Since pore pressures which exceed the overburden pressure are unreasonable, we attribute this discrepancy to laboratory measurements which underestimate the in situ permeability. The widespread presence of overpressured sediments in areas of irregular topography provides a process for resuspension of clay-sized particles. This mechanism does not require high current velocities for the erosion of clay and therefore {{can be applied to}} many areas where no strong currents are evident. Carbonate-rich sediments from the Madagascar Ridge, the Mozambique Ridge, and the Agulhas Plateau had almost no flow-in and occurred in areas where all topography was thickly draped with sediment. Since the age and tectonic location of the ridges and plateaus preclude water circulation in the basement, we attribute these differences between the brown clay and the carbonate-rich material to an absence of significant excess pore pressures in the plateau and ridge sediments...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{statistical}} analysis of recent numerical simulations exploring {{the correlation between the}} core mass function obtained from the fragmentation of a molecular cloud and the stellar mass function which forms from these collapsing cores. Our analysis shows that the distributions of bound cores and sink particles obtained in the simulations are consistent with the sinks being formed predominantly from their parent core mass reservoir, with a statistical dispersion of the order of one third of the core mass. Such a characteristic dispersion suggests that the stellar initial mass function is relatively tightly correlated to the parent core mass function, leading to two similar distributions, as observed. This in turn argues in favor of the IMF being essentially determined at the early stages of core formation and being only weakly affected by the various environmental factors beyond the initial core mass reservoir, at least in the mass range explored in the present study. Accordingly, the final IMF of a star forming region should be determined reasonably accurately, statistically speaking, from the initial core mass function, provided some uniform efficiency factor. The calculations also show that these statistical fluctuations, due e. g. to variations among the core properties, broaden the low-mass tail of the IMF compared with the parent CMF, providing an explanation for the fact that this latter appears to underestimate the number of "pre <b>brown</b> dwarf" <b>cores</b> compared with the observationally-derived brown dwarf IMF.

40|$|Abstract. The compact {{elliptical}} galaxy M 32 offers a unique testing ground for theories of stellar evolution. Because of its proximity, solarblind UV observations can resolve the hot evolved stars in its center. Some of these late evolutionary phases are too rapid to study adequately in globular clusters, and their {{study in the}} Galactic field is often complicated by uncertainties in distance and reddening. Using the UV cameras on the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, we have obtained a deep color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the M 32 center. Although the hot horizontal branch is well-detected, our CMD shows a striking scarcity of the brighter post-asymptotic giant branch (PAGB) and post-early AGB stars expected for a population of this size. This dearth suggests that the evolution to the white dwarf phase may be much more rapid than that predicted by canonical evolutionary tracks for low-mass stars.

40|$|Using new {{infrared}} data we have reassessed {{the membership}} status of candidate low-mass Pleiads unearthed by the International Telescope Project IZ survey. Those with I–K colours consistent with {{membership of the}} Pleiades have been compiled with candidate brown dwarfs identified by three other large, deep far-red CCD surveys of the cluster to yield the biggest magnitude-limited sample of substellar members to date. We fit King profiles to their spatial distribution to determine the Pleiades <b>brown</b> dwarf <b>core</b> radius to be rc= 2. 22 + 1. 36 − 0. 67 degrees (or 5. 0 + 3. 0 − 1. 5 pc). This {{is consistent with a}} continuation of the rc∝ m− 0. 5 relationship found previously for the higher-mass stellar members and suggests that the brown dwarf members are also dynamically relaxed. Using our spatial model we derive the Pleiades mass function in the substellar regime and are able to place stringent limits on its shape. We find that it is well represented by a power law with index α= 0. 41 ± 0. 08 (0. 035 M⊙≲ M ≲ 0. 3 M⊙). This result is largely insensitive to our choice of evolutionary model and uncertainties in the cluster age and distance. It is only marginally sensitive to the brown dwarf binary fraction. By assuming that the cluster mass function continues to rise down to the deuterium-burning limit, we estimate that the total brown dwarf mass of the Pleiades is 13 + 4 − 3 M⊙. This only represents ∼ 2 per cent of the total cluster mass. Given that the present-day cluster mass function should be a good representation of the initial mass function, we conclude that brown dwarfs do not contribute significantly to disc dark matter...|$|R

Over the years, both areas developed completely separated. Control over both areas was obtained by different companies and advisory boards, with mostly not too good means of communication between them. This decision hampered seriously the consistent and integral development of knowledge on food production and usage. Bridging the gap between all the knowledge and expertise available in the preharvest area of growing food and the postharvest area of storing and processing food, has become and is still {{becoming more and more}} important {{over the last couple of}} years. In this paper, based on theoretical considerations, on plausible (but unproven) mechanisms and applying the fundamental rules of chemical kinetics, a pathway to deduce general and generic models is developed towards a possible approach to integrate all available knowledge. Still the validity of this approach is not proven. However, a number of examples from both the applied as well as the fundamental point of view are elaborated to indicate such an interaction exists, and to indicate how to tackle the modelling problem. The examples range from physiological disorders like <b>core</b> <b>brown,</b> internal brown, chilling injury and the biological age of individual tomatoes in truss tomatoes as related to the maturity at harves...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports a}} {{petrographic}} and crystal chemical analysis of {{three types of}} micas (yangzhumingite, light brown phlogopite and dark brown phlogopite) found in a lamproitic dyke at the Kvaløya Island (North Norway). The study was carried out integrating different analytical techniques: electron microprobe, single crystal X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, Mössbauer and micro-Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. Kvaløya yangzhumingite (second occurrence in nature) was characterized {{for the first time}} in detail via single crystal X-ray diffraction. The different mica types are distinguishable on the basis of the VIFe and Mg versus Si content. Yangzhumingite composition is intermediate between those of KMg 2. 75 (Si 3. 5 Al 0. 5) O 10 F 2 and KMg 2. 50 Si 4 O 10 F 2 synthetic compounds reported in the literature. Light and possibly dark brown phlogopite is a Mg-rich fluorotetraferriphlogopite, the latter having a greater Fe content. The infrared spectra of yangzhumingite and the light brown phlogopite show the occurrence of OH- absorption bands respectively at: 3586 cm- 1 which correlates well with the measured F content; 3707 cm- 1 and 3686 cm- 1 assigned mainly to 3 Mg 2 +-K+-OH- (phlogopitic) environment. Structural analyses, performed only on yangzhumingite and light brown phlogopite show that both samples are 1 M polytypes with the expected space group C 2 /m. Crystal chemical details are compatible with the following major substitution mechanisms: 2 XIIK+ + VI[] ↔ 2 XII[] + VIR 2 + (where R 2 + = Mg, Fe), OH- ↔ F- for yangzhumingite and 2 VIR 2 + ↔ VITi 4 + + VI[] (Ti-vacancy), OH- ↔ F- for light brown phlogopite. All three types of micas formed at relatively constant low pressure, but over a large temperature range in equilibrium with a grain boundary fluid that underwent significant changes in composition during reaction progress. Light <b>brown</b> phlogopite <b>cores</b> and dark <b>brown</b> phlogopite rims formed during crystallization from the lamproitic magma, while yangzhumingite formed as a result of reactions between the already formed phlogopite and the highly reactive fluid that was derived from the volatile-rich lamproite magma...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{clouds are}} {{observed}} to be turbulent, but {{the origin of}} this turbulence is not well understood. As a result, there are two different approaches to simulating molecular clouds, one in which the turbulence is allowed to decay after it is initialized, and one in which it is driven. We use the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, Orion, to perform high-resolution simulations of molecular cloud cores and protostars in environments with both driven and decaying turbulence. We include self-gravity, use a barotropic equation of state, and represent regions exceeding the maximum grid resolution with sink particles. We analyze the properties of bound cores such as size, shape, linewidth, and rotational energy, and we find reasonable agreement with observation. At high resolution, the different rates of core accretion in the two cases {{have a significant effect on}} protostellar system development. Clumps forming in a decaying turbulence environment produce high-multiplicity protostellar systems with Toomre-Q unstable disks that exhibit characteristics of the competitive accretion model for star formation. In contrast, cores forming in the context of continuously driven turbulence and virial equilibrium form smaller protostellar systems with fewer low-mass members. Our simulations of driven and decaying turbulence show some statistically significant differences, particularly in the production of <b>brown</b> dwarfs and <b>core</b> rotation, but the uncertainties are large enough that we are not able to conclude whether observations favor one or the other.
