5|$|The Beaufort was {{too fast}} for the torpedoes available, so new tactics had to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> the {{aircraft}} was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried out more trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. The cost was a single Beaufort.|$|E

5|$|The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent {{examples}} of Warriors original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which {{were used as}} moulds for fibreglass replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; they, and the muzzles of all the guns, had to be sealed to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> tested before they could be built.|$|E
5|$|The {{electronics}} {{of the new}} ENIAC ran at one-sixth the speed, {{but this}} in no way degraded the ENIAC's performance, since it was still entirely I/O bound. Complicated programs could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> debugged in days rather than the weeks required for plugboarding the old ENIAC. Some of von Neumann's early computer programs have been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E
40|$|New {{virtual reality}} (VR) {{technology}} has <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> reaching a broader consumer-base than ever before. However, no consumer operating system (OS) {{has been released}} optimized for VR. In this project, a concept VR OS user interface (UI) <b>was</b> <b>developed,</b> <b>and</b> different interaction patterns <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> evaluated. Several concept applications <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> evaluated in user tests. The project resulted in a concept VR UI application with basic OS features such as viewing files and opening programs. The tests conducted suggest that some interactions, such as throwing away programs to close them and opening programs through a hand menu with 3 D icons, are efficient. The tests also suggest that new interaction patterns for interacting with legacy 2 D applications in VR should be researched...|$|R

5|$|Mask of the Lunar Eclipse {{was first}} {{revealed}} in January 2008 at a Tecmo press conference. It {{was the first}} series title to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> released for a Nintendo console. It was released on July 31, 2008. Its release was timed to coincide with a traditional time in Japan for people to tell each other ghost stories. Upon release, the game featured several bugs affecting player progress through the game, as revealed in a message to fans from Nintendo. While no North American release was planned, a European release was in the works and was briefly outed by a French gaming magazine. After the leak, Nintendo stated that a European release had been planned, but since then the localization had been cancelled. In addition to Nintendo, no other third-party publisher would publish the game overseas, leaving Mask of the Lunar Eclipse as a Japan-exclusive title.|$|E
5|$|In May 1991, {{following}} an unsuccessful attempt with Sony {{to develop a}} CD-ROM-based add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo signed a deal with Philips to develop the aforementioned add-on. However, witnessing the poor reception of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo no longer considered the add-on profitable, and the project was scrapped entirely. As part of dissolving the deal, Nintendo gave Philips the license to use five of their characters, including Mario, Luigi and Princess Toadstool, to be featured in their games for the CD-i. The games were given little time to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> little funding, and Nintendo only gave cursory input. Philips used the characters to create games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on {{the look of the}} characters. Apart from Hotel Mario, the Mario characters were intended to be used in Super Mario's Wacky Worlds, but the game was cancelled with only some prototype versions being programmed. While Wacky Worlds was planned as a CD-i adaptation of the side-scrolling platformer Super Mario World, Hotel Mario was made into a puzzle game in which stage areas were restricted to a single screen. Unlike the Legend of Zelda-related games, the game was not developed by a third-party company, but by Philips' development team Fantasy Factory.|$|E
