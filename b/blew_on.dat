5|$|Jamie McMurray {{took the}} lead by the 53rd lap, when a third caution was {{deployed}} after Reutimann's right-rear tire <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> the backstretch, causing Gordon to take evasive action by turning right and heavily damaged the nose of his car when he collided with the outside wall. Reutimann's tire broke Johnson's front splitter brace. All drivers, including McMurray, chose to make pit stops. Vickers elected {{to stay on the}} track and led the field at the restart on lap 58, ahead of Kvapil and Skinner. Two laps later, Hamlin used the draft to take over the lead, with Labonte moving into second. Kahne used the outside lane to claim first position, before Reed Sorenson also drove on the outside lane to claim first place on the next lap. The pack drove three abreast on lap 63, as Truex moved into first place on the 64th lap. McMurray reclaimed the first position when he got ahead of Truex at the start-finish line on lap 65, and Kahne dropped to 26th position by the same lap. Truex re{{took the lead}} from McMurray {{at the start of the}} following lap, and Harvick moved into first on lap 67.|$|E

25|$|The Company forces reached Cawnpore on 16 July, and {{captured}} the city. A group of British officers and soldiers {{set out to}} the Bibighar, to rescue the captives, assuming {{that they were still}} alive. However, when they reached the site, they found it empty and blood-splattered, with the bodies of most of the 200 women and children having already been dismembered and thrown down the courtyard well or into the Ganges river. Piles of children's clothing and severed women's hair <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> the wind and lodged in tree branches around the compound; the tree in the courtyard nearest the well was smeared with the brains of numerous children and infants who had been dashed headfirst against the trunk and thrown down the well.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 June 632, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad {{died of a}} fever. However, the {{religion}} he left behind would transform the Middle East. In 633, the armies of Islam marched out of Arabia, their goal {{to spread the word}} of the prophet, with force if needed. In 634, the Arabs defeated a Byzantine force sent into Syria and captured Damascus. The arrival of another large Byzantine army outside Antioch forced the Arabs to retreat. The Byzantines advanced in May 636. However, a sandstorm <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> 20 August 636 against the Byzantines and when the Arabs charged against them they were utterly annihilated: ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} day of racing, 35,000 spectators showed up to watch the grand finale [...] race. At [...] into the race, the right front tire <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> Charlie Merz's car. His car mowed down five fence posts and toppled dozens of spectators. Two spectators and his mechanic, Claude Kellum, were killed in the crash. Ten laps later, driver Bruce Keen struck a pothole and crashed into a bridge support. The race was then halted and the {{remaining}} drivers given engraved certificates instead of trophies. The race resulted in the AAA boycotting any future events at the speedway until significant improvements were made.|$|E

Prost's engine <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> lap 28, reducing the battle [...] at the front to three. The pit stops changed nothing but after them Mansell began to hound his teammate Patrese for second. Patrese let him get past to see what Mansell can do about Senna but he realised that the answer was nothing. Senna was continuing to slowly edge away. A dull race was won by Senna ahead of Mansell, Patrese, Berger, Alesi and Capelli.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{southern}} Chinese histories, during the 480s, {{a man named}} Gong Xuanxuan styled himself Gong the Sage and 'said that a supernatural being {{had given him a}} [...] "jade seal jade block writing," [...] which did not require a brush: one <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> the paper and characters formed.' He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong. Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a printing device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first printer. The semi-mythical record of him therefore describes his usage of the printing process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.|$|E
2500|$|In the , Lewis Hamilton {{ran into}} the back of Alonso's Renault, heavily {{damaging}} the rear wing of Alonso's car, as well as his own nosecone. Stewards did not seek to investigate the incident but critics alleged he braked (or did not accelerate as expected) in front of Hamilton causing Hamilton to crash into him. The telemetry data from Alonso's car proved these accusations to be wrong. Hamilton himself stated [...] "I was behind him, and I moved to the right, and he moved to the right and that was it– a racing incident I guess". It was later revealed by McLaren that Hamilton's front wing, which was damaged when he hit Alonso earlier in the race, had broken seconds before the impact and has been identified as the cause of the crash. Alonso started the [...] with promising pace, qualifying on the front row in second place behind Kimi Räikkönen even though he had a light fuel load. He was running in fifth place when his engine <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> lap 35. He praised his team after finishing sixth in the , as he was behind the more competitive BMW cars at the end, and said that the result [...] "confirms the progress we have made, and is thanks to the hard work of everyone in the team".|$|E

2500|$|Data is {{vulnerable}} to technological hazards such as computer viruses, certain levels of energy discharges, ship malfunctions (when connected to the Enterprise main computer for experiments), and shutdowns whether through remote control shutdown devices or through use of his [...] "off switch", located on his lower back near where a human kidney would be. Besides Data, very few members of the Enterprise crew are aware of this switch's existence for reasons of security, including Captain Picard, Commander Riker and Chief Engineer LaForge. Dr. Crusher, who is bound by her Hippocratic Oath forbidding her from divulging this to anyone without Data's express permission, was {{the first member of}} the crew to be made aware of its existence in the first season episode [...] "". Data has also been [...] "possessed" [...] through technological means such as: Ira Graves's transfer of consciousness into his neural net; Dr. Soong's [...] "calling" [...] him; and an alien library that placed several different personalities into him. Data cannot swim unless aided by his built in flotation device, yet he can perform tasks underwater without the need to surface. Data is also impervious to sensory tactile emotion such as pain or pleasure. In [...] the Borg Queen grafted artificial skin to his forearm. Data was then able to feel pain when a Borg drone slashed at his arm, and pleasure when the Borg Queen <b>blew</b> <b>on</b> the skin's hair follicles. Despite being mechanical in nature, Data is treated as an equal member of the Enterprise crew in every regard. Being a mechanical construct, technicians such as Chief Engineer LaForge prove to be more appropriate to treat his mechanical or cognitive function failures than the ship's doctor. His positronic brain becomes deactivated, repaired, and reactivated by Geordi on several occasions.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{spanwise}} <b>blowing</b> <b>on</b> the surface pressures of a 44 deg swept trapezoidal wing-strake configuration were measured. Wind tunnel {{data were obtained}} at a free stream Mach number of 0. 26 {{for a range of}} model angle of attack, jet thrust coefficient, and nozzle chordwise location. Results showed that spanwise blowing delayed the leading edge vortex breakdown to larger span distances and increased the lifting pressures. Vortex lift was achieved at span stations immediately outboard of the strake-wing junction with no blowing, but spanwise blowing was necessary to achieve vortex lift at increased span distances. <b>Blowing</b> <b>on</b> the wing {{in the presence of the}} strake was not as effective as <b>blowing</b> <b>on</b> the wing alone. Spanwise blowing increased lift throughout the angle-of-attack range, improved the drag polars, and extended the linear pitching moment to higher values of lift. The leading edge suction analogy can be used to estimate the effects of spanwise <b>blowing</b> <b>on</b> the aerodynamic characteristics...|$|R
