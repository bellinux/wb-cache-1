40|$|Tropospheric {{scintillation}} {{is referred}} to rapid fluctuation of received signal amplitude. It can cause propagation impairments that affect satellite communication systems operating at above 10 GHz of frequency. In this work, we have exploited 1 year of measured <b>broadcasting</b> <b>signal</b> data collected in Johor, Malaysia to investigate the effects of scintillation intensity on a SatCom system operating at 11. 075 GHz with its links pointed towards the MEASAT- 1 satellite (an elevation angle of 75. 61 °). We have investigated the behavior of this scintillation amplitude through the classification and analysis of a timeseries satellite <b>broadcasting</b> <b>signal</b> and have then compared the statistical results with existing scintillation prediction models. The comparison results indicate {{that there is a}} significant discrepancy between measured data and those models and that the performance of these prediction models {{does not appear to be}} satisfactory, with the exception of the ITU-R and the Ortgies Refractivity model. In addition, we have investigated the diurnal behavior of the scintillation intensity at four different periods of the day and proposed a modified Marzano model to accommodate local meteorological input parameters. The models performances are assessed against the available measurement dataset. The proposed models provide system operators and radio communication engineers with critical information on the fluctuations of tropospheric scintillation variance on the satellite signal during a typical day taken into the account of local meteorological peculiarities...|$|E

30|$|The other {{challenge}} {{is due to}} the <b>broadcasting</b> <b>signal</b> frequencies for passive radars and the type of receivers, the angle information is of realistically poor quality and target tracking using only the range and range rate without angle information inevitably generates ghost tracks. A bistatic range measurement can locate a target at an ellipsoid in 3 -D Cartesian coordinates, but for the intersection of two ellipsoids, which is an ellipse, a third bistatic range measurement is necessary to possibly locate the target, resulting in the generation of multiple ghosts. Furthermore, in the presence of measurement noise and the clutter measurement, the situation is even more severe.|$|E
