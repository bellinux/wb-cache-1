5000|$|The {{vehicles}} were operated {{in a dark}} green camouflage, probably used by the original Warsaw Pact user, and retained this camouflage afterwards, though during combat, {{there is evidence that}} the tanks were streaked with paint or mud to break up the colour. Cypriot National Guard T-34's were entirely unique from all Soviet and Warsaw Pact countries in that they mounted the US M2 Browning [...]50cal machine gun, originally on the rear of the turret roof, on top of the ventilator domes. Some time before 1974, the armament was then moved forward {{to the front of the}} turret, in front of the commanders cupola. The standard identifying marking was a dark blue square overlaid with a white cross, identical to that used by the Hellenic Army, and intended to show the obvious affinity of the indigenous population majority towards Hellenism, and to some extent, unionism with Greece. All of the tanks carried a number plate painted onto the front glacis plate. Following the 1974 invasion by Turkey, numbers in service were drastically reduced through attrition, and the last remaining operational examples were painted in sand yellow and green camouflage, with a yellow bridging class disk applied centrally to their lower <b>bow</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. In this study, the two-dimensional steady bow flow in water of arbitrary finite depth has been investigated. The two-dimensional bow {{is assumed to}} consist of an inclined flat plate connected downstream to a horizontal semi-infinite draft plate. The bottom of the channel {{is assumed to be}} a horizontal plate; the fluid is assumed to be invicid, incompressible; and the flow irrotational. For the angle of incidence [alpha] (held by the <b>bow</b> <b>plate)</b> lying between 0 ° and 60 °, the local flow analysis near the stagnation point shows that the angle lying between the free surface and the inclined plate, [beta], must always be equal to 120 °, otherwise no solution can exist. Moreover, we further find that the local flow solution does not exist if [alpha] > 60 °, and that on the inclined plate there exists a negative pressure region adjacent to the stagnation point for [alpha] < 30 °. Singularities at the stagnation point and the upstream infinity are found to have multiple branch-point singularities of irrational orders. A fully nonlinear theoretical model has been developed in this study for evaluating the incompressible irrotational flow satisfying the free-surface conditions and two constraint equations. To solve the bow flow problem, successive conformal mappings are first used to transform the flow domain into the interior of a unit semi-circle in which the unknowns can be represented as the coefficients of an infinite series. A total error function equivalent to satisfying the Bernoulli equation is defined and solved by minimizing the error function and applying the method of Lagrange's multiplier. Smooth solutions with monotonic free surface profiles have been found and presented here for the range of 35 ° < [alpha] < 60 °, a draft Froude number [ [...] . ] less then 0. 5, and a water-depth Froude number [ [...] . ] less than 0. 4. The dependence of the solution on these key parameters is examined. As [alpha] decreases for fixed [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], the free surface falls off more steeply from the stagnation point. Similarly, as [ [...] . ] increases, the free surface falls off quickly from the stagnation point, but for decreasing [ [...] . ] it descends rather slowly towards the upstream level. As [ [...] . ] decreases further, difficulties cannot be surmounted in finding an exact asymptotic water level at upstream infinity, which may imply difficulties in finding solutions for water of infinite depth. Our results may be useful in designing the optimum bow shape...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{work has}} been carried out in recent years to ensure that ice-capable ships are both safe and economical. The present {{analysis}} provides a methodology which can be employed by the designer to calculate the optimum <b>bow</b> <b>plating</b> thickness for operation in ice. To this end, a local ice load model is re-evaluated using a probabilistic analysis of full scale data, probabilities of failure for plating are calculated and plate thickness is optimised. [...] Full scale data for the MV Canmar Kigoriak and USCGC Polar Sea were ranked; curves were fitted through the tail of each data set; and Type-I extreme probability, distributions were derived for the three panel sizes. The Canmar Kigoriak data were then subdivided based on contact area and a simulation was performed to derive the load distributions on subregions of the instrumented panel. Finally, a local ice load model which accounts for annual number of impacts and exposure was confirmed. [...] To evaluate the strength of <b>bow</b> <b>plating,</b> three limit states (three-hinge collapse, permanent set and membrane collapse) were selected. Statistical distributions for each of the input parameters were established. The probability of failure was calculated, for each limit state using a range of plate thicknesses, frame spacings and annual numbers of impacts, using First Onler Reliability Method software. The probability of failure was approximated as a plane for each limit state and frame spacing. [...] Plate thickness was optimised for minimum cost. Minimum safety levels for permanent set and membrane collapse were also specified. The objective function considered costs due to construction, aesthetics, repair and replacement. Cost due to lost use of the ship and increased weight can also be specified. These costs were considered to be specific to the vessel under consideration and hence, were considered outside the scope of the present analysis. Optimum plate thicknesses are presented and compared with those specified by the Proposals for the Revision of the Arctic Shipping Pollution Prevention Regulations...|$|R

30|$|The {{material}} being welded experiences {{very hot}} processing conditions as the tool pin rotates {{at very high}} speeds. Therefore, excessive heat generated, thermally softens the material near the boundary of the tool-shoulder and expels large volumes of material {{in the form of}} surface flash. Excessive tool-shoulder frictional heat softening of the material is the reason for the formation of the flash, and high tool-shoulder pressure leads to the ejection of an excessive amount of flash (Bo et al. 2011). Incorrect tool pin length relative to workpiece thickness and change in penetration depth due to variation in plate thickness along the weld line or due to a <b>bowed</b> <b>plate</b> can lead to a lack of penetration. When the pin plug depth is high, the plastic material near the pin is extruded, which results in weld flash. When the pin depth is very high, extruded flash can occur at the roots of the weld, near the pin. At larger tool tilt angles, insufficient plasticised material remains to fill the cavity left in the weld nugget and weld flash appears on the retreating side (Keivani et al. 2013).|$|R
