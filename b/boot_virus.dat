50|$|AntiCMOS is a <b>boot</b> <b>virus.</b> Its first {{discovery}} was at Lenart, Slovenia, {{which led to}} its alias of Lenart. It was isolated in Hong Kong several times {{at the beginning of}} 1994, but did not become common until it spread to North America in the Spring of 1995. AntiCMOS is a fairly standard <b>boot</b> <b>virus,</b> and is primarily notable for being one of the few DOS viruses to remain in the wild as of 2005.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{descriptions}} note multipartite function in Ontario.2048. This is incorrect. Ontario.2048 does contain a boot sector within {{it with a}} <b>boot</b> <b>virus.</b> If inserted into the boot sector, {{it would be a}} functioning <b>boot</b> <b>virus</b> (although it would not spread the file infection portion of Ontario.2048). However, Ontario.2048 never performs the injection; the code is functionally useless. Based on the virus author's documentation for the virus http://www.textfiles.com/virus/DOCUMENTATION/ontario3.txt, this appears to be intentional (reasons unknown).|$|E
50|$|Additionally, AntiCMOS.B {{attempts}} {{to play a}} tune, but this fails due to coding errors http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/anticmos.shtml. AntiCMOS.B is otherwise a typical <b>boot</b> <b>virus,</b> much like its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} <b>boot</b> <b>viruses,</b> a Form {{infection}} {{is a rare}} find in modern times. Since the advent of Windows, <b>boot</b> <b>viruses</b> have become increasingly uncommon, including Form. Generally, Form infections are due {{to the use of}} floppy disks infected during the original pandemic that have since been taken out of storage.|$|R
50|$|Alcon {{was listed}} as being {{spreading}} by the WildList http://www.parc.xerox.com/about/history/default.html from April 1998 to July 1999. F-Secure lists it as having been common in Europe throughout 1997. Like most <b>boot</b> <b>viruses,</b> it is near extinct, although it was certainly in the last wave of <b>boot</b> <b>viruses,</b> so cases involving Alcon may be false positives, but may also be due to older, unused infected disks resurfacing.|$|R
50|$|The Ping-Pong <b>virus</b> (also called <b>Boot,</b> Bouncing Ball, Bouncing Dot, Italian, Italian-A or VeraCruz) is a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus</b> {{discovered}} on March 1, 1988 at the Politecnico di Torino Turin Polytechnic University in Italy. It was likely {{the most common}} and best known <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus</b> until outnumbered by the Stoned virus.|$|R
50|$|AntiCMOS.C is a <b>boot</b> <b>virus</b> {{and very}} minor {{variant of the}} AntiCMOS family. Unlike AntiCMOS and AntiCMOS.B, AntiCMOS.C {{remained}} {{in the field for}} {{a very short period of}} time, and is now considered entirely obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Alcon, or RSY (which {{is more or}} less as {{commonly}} used of a name as Alcon), is a computer virus that was discovered to be spreading in Europe in 1997. It is a <b>boot</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|AntiCMOS.B is a <b>boot</b> <b>virus.</b> It was {{isolated}} in mid-1995. Like AntiCMOS.A, AntiCMOS.B became common worldwide. However, this variant never reached the success {{level of the}} original, and is now considered obsolete.Infected floppy disks contain the following text: ...|$|E

50|$|VGA-Copy had {{the ability}} to {{compress}} images with the ARJ packer. It was able to scan floppies for <b>boot</b> sector <b>viruses</b> with an internal heuristic and could also scan the full floppy with F-Prot.|$|R
50|$|Lamer Exterminator is a {{computer}} virus created for the Commodore Amiga. It was first detected in Germany in October 1989. It is a <b>boot</b> block <b>virus</b> contained in the first 1024 bytes of the disk.|$|R
25|$|To start {{itself at}} system <b>boot,</b> the <b>virus</b> saves {{a copy of}} its DLL form to a random {{filename}} in the Windows system folder, then adds registry keys to have svchost.exe invoke that DLL as an invisible network service.|$|R
50|$|They were {{originally}} deployed {{in response to}} the problem of <b>boot</b> sector <b>viruses</b> on floppy discs. Subsequently, their scope has been expanded to include USB flash drives, portable hard discs, memory cards, CD-ROMs and other removable devices, all of which can potentially carry malware.|$|R
5000|$|The SCA {{virus is}} the first {{computer}} virus created for the Commodore Amiga {{and one of the}} first to gain public notoriety. It appeared in November 1987. The SCA <b>virus</b> is a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus.</b> It features a line of text that appears at every 15th copy after a warm reboot: ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a neural network for generic detection of a particular class of computer viruses-the so called <b>boot</b> sector <b>viruses</b> that infect the boot sector of a floppy disk or a hard drive. This is an important and relatively tractable subproblem of generic virus detection. Only about 5 % of all known <b>viruses</b> are <b>boot</b> sector <b>viruses,</b> yet they account for nearly 90 % of all virus incidents. We have successfully deployed our neural network as a commercial product, distributing it to millions of PC users worldwide {{as part of the}} IBM AntiVirus software package. We faced several challenges in taking our neural network from a research idea to a commercial product. These included designing an appropriate input representation scheme; dealing with the scarcity of available training data; finding an appropriate trade off point between false positives and false negatives to conform to user expectations; and making the software conform to strict constraints on memory and speed of computation needed to run on PCs. The article discusses our methods for handling these challenges...|$|R
25|$|A <b>boot</b> sector {{computer}} <b>virus</b> dubbed (c)Brain, one of {{the first}} computer viruses in history, was created in 1986 by the Farooq Alvi Brothers in Lahore, Pakistan, reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written.|$|R
5000|$|This {{attack was}} {{originally}} presented in , {{which was a}} United States Air Force security analysis of Multics, where they described such {{an attack on a}} PL/I compiler, and call it a [...] "compiler trap door"; they also mention a variant where the system initialization code is modified to insert a backdoor during booting, as this is complex and poorly understood, and call it an [...] "initialization trapdoor"; this is now known as a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{multipartite}} virus {{is a computer}} virus that infects and spreads in multiple ways. The term was coined to describe the first viruses that included DOS executable files and PC BIOS <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus</b> code, where both parts are viral themselves. Prior {{to the discovery of}} the first of these, viruses were categorized as either file infectors or boot infectors. Because of the multiple vectors for the spread of infection, these viruses could spread faster than a boot or file infector alone.|$|R
50|$|Form was a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus</b> {{isolated}} in Switzerland {{in the summer}} of 1990 which became very common worldwide. The origin of Form is widely listed as Switzerland, but this may be an assumption based on its isolation locale. The only notable characteristics of Form are that it infects the boot sector instead of the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the clicking noises associated with some infections. Infections under Form can result in severe data damage if operating system characteristics are not identical to those Form assumes.|$|R
50|$|Stoned is {{the name}} of a <b>boot</b> sector {{computer}} <b>virus</b> created in 1987. It is one of the very first viruses and is thought to have been written by a student in Wellington, New Zealand. By 1989 it had spread widely in New Zealand and Australia, and variants became very common worldwide in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The Michelangelo {{virus is}} a {{computer}} virus first discovered on 4 February 1991 in Australia. The virus was designed to infect DOS systems, but did not engage the operating system or make any OS calls. Michelangelo, like all <b>boot</b> sector <b>viruses,</b> basically operated at the BIOS level. Each year, the virus remained dormant until March 6, the birthday of Renaissance artist Michelangelo. There is no reference to the artist in the virus, but due to the name and date of activation {{it is very likely}} that the virus writer intended Michelangelo to be referenced to the virus. Michelangelo is a variant of the already endemic Stoned virus.|$|R
50|$|Multipartite viruses {{increase}} {{their chances of}} spreading within the computer by combining features from both the file infector and the <b>boot</b> infector. These <b>viruses</b> {{have the ability to}} infect both files and boot sectors. Because of this, the chance of the virus spreading is increased, but the virus also becomes more vulnerable to detection due to the increased number of locations the virus can be found by an antivirus software.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{whatever}} {{is stored in}} the first sector of a floppy diskette, USB device, hard disk or any other bootable storage device, {{is not required to}} immediately load any bootstrap code for an OS, if ever. The BIOS merely passes control to whatever exists there, as long as the sector meets the very simple qualification of having the boot record signature of 0x55, 0xAA in its last two bytes. This is why it's easy to replace the usual bootstrap code found in an MBR with more complex loaders, even large multi-functional boot managers (programs stored elsewhere on the device which can run without an operating system), allowing users a number of choices in what occurs next. With this kind of freedom, abuse often occurs in the form of <b>boot</b> sector <b>viruses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even home {{computers}} {{were affected by}} viruses. The first one {{to appear on the}} Commodore Amiga was a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus</b> called SCA virus, which was detected in November 1987. The first social networking virus, Win32.5-0-1, was created by Matt Larose on August 15, 2001. The virus specifically targeted users of MSN Messenger and online bulletin boards. Users would be required to click on a link to activate the virus, which would then send an email containing user data to an anonymous email address, which was later found to be owned by Larose. Data sent would contain items such as user IP address and email addresses, contacts, website browsing history, and commonly used phrases. In 2008, larger websites used part of the Win32.5-0-1 code to track web users advertising-related interests.|$|R
5000|$|Elk Cloner {{was created}} by Skrenta as a prank in 1982. Skrenta already had a {{reputation}} for pranks among his friends because, in sharing computer games and software, he would often alter the floppy disks to shut down or display taunting on-screen messages. Due to this reputation, many of his friends simply stopped accepting floppy disks from him. Skrenta thought of methods to alter floppy disks without physically touching or harming them. During a winter break from Mt. Lebanon High School in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, Skrenta discovered how to launch the messages automatically on his Apple II computer. He developed what is now known as a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus,</b> and began circulating it in early 1982 among high school friends and a local computer club. Twenty-five years later in 2007, Skrenta called it [...] "some dumb little practical joke." ...|$|R
5000|$|The virus {{infected}} Macintosh computers, and {{the intention}} was that on 2 March 1988 all infected computers would show the message [...] "RICHARD BRANDOW, publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff {{would like to}} take this opportunity to convey their UNIVERSAL MESSAGE OF PEACE to all Macintosh users around the world", and the virus would then delete itself. According to the virus itself, it was written by Drew Davidson. The <b>virus</b> was a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus,</b> which was spread {{in the form of a}} HyperCard stack called [...] "New Apple Products," [...] which contained very poor pictures of the then-new Apple scanner. It copied a resource into the System folder on a Mac, as an [...] "initial" [...] program, which would run automatically every time the system started up. The program then copied itself onto any bootable disk which was opened.|$|R
50|$|Elk Cloner {{spread by}} infecting the Apple DOS 3.3 {{operating}} system using a technique {{now known as}} a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus.</b> It was attached to a game, the game was then set to play. The 50th time the game was started, the virus was released, but instead of playing the game, it would change to a blank screen that displayed a poem about the virus named Elk Cloner. If a computer booted from an infected floppy disk, {{a copy of the}} virus was placed in the computer's memory. When an uninfected disk was inserted into the computer, the entire DOS (including Elk Cloner) would be copied to the disk, allowing it to spread from disk to disk. To prevent the DOS from being continually re-written each time the disk was accessed, Elk Cloner also wrote a signature byte to the disk's directory, indicating that it had already been infected.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} {{classification}} approach of cyber attack which uses characteristics metrics and game theoretic approach to classify the attacks to their closest category. The standard weights of the metrics {{are used as}} the base line to classify the cyber attacks in the proper category. The approach is simple and extendible; as new characters of the newly identified attacks {{can be added to}} the attack characteristic metrics and the corresponding unique weight to the character are assigned by the proposed formula. Besides this, the proposed approach clearly represents the cause effect relationship for all possible attacks which helps us to find the appropriate solution to restrict them in the Internet. A case study is also provided in the paper to classify Nimda worm, Slammer worm, W 32 /HLLP. Philips. jn Trojan, Stealth <b>virus</b> and <b>Boot</b> sector <b>virus.</b> Key words: Cyber attacks • cyber attack classification • characteristic metrics • malicious objects • game theoretic approac...|$|R
50|$|Before Internet access became widespread, viruses {{spread on}} {{personal}} computers by infecting the executable boot sectors of floppy disks. By inserting {{a copy of}} itself into the machine code instructions in these executables, a virus causes itself to be run whenever a program is run or the disk is <b>booted.</b> Early computer <b>viruses</b> were written for the Apple II and Macintosh, but they became more widespread with {{the dominance of the}} IBM PC and MS-DOS system. Executable-infecting viruses are dependent on users exchanging software or boot-able floppies and thumb drives so they spread rapidly in computer hobbyist circles.|$|R
5000|$|An {{article that}} {{describes}} [...] "useful virus functionalities" [...] {{was published by}} J. B. Gunn under the title [...] "Use of virus functions to provide a virtual APL interpreter under user control" [...] in 1984. The first IBM PC virus in the [...] "wild" [...] was a <b>boot</b> sector <b>virus</b> dubbed (c)Brain, created in 1986 by the Farooq Alvi Brothers in Lahore, Pakistan, reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written. The first virus to specifically target Microsoft Windows, WinVir was discovered in April 1992, {{two years after the}} release of Windows 3.0. The virus did not contain any Windows API calls, instead relying on DOS interrupts. A few years later, in February 1996, Australian hackers from the virus-writing crew VLAD created the Bizatch virus (also known as [...] "Boza" [...] virus), which was the first known virus to target Windows 95. In late 1997 the encrypted, memory-resident stealth virus Win32.Cabanas was released—the first known virus that targeted Windows NT (it was also able to infect Windows 3.0 and Windows 9x hosts).|$|R
5000|$|Before {{computer}} networks became widespread, most viruses spread on removable media, particularly floppy disks. In {{the early days}} of the personal computer, many users regularly exchanged information and programs on floppies. Some viruses spread by infecting programs stored on these disks, while others installed themselves into the disk boot sector, ensuring that they would be run when the user booted the computer from the disk, usually inadvertently. Personal computers of the era would attempt to boot first from a floppy if one had been left in the drive. Until floppy disks fell out of use, this was the most successful infection strategy and <b>boot</b> sector <b>viruses</b> were the most common in the [...] "wild" [...] for many years. Traditional computer viruses emerged in the 1980s, driven by the spread of personal computers and the resultant increase in bulletin board system (BBS), modem use, and software sharing. Bulletin board-driven software sharing contributed directly to the spread of Trojan horse programs, and viruses were written to infect popularly traded software. Shareware and bootleg software were equally common vectors for viruses on BBSs. Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by other computers.|$|R
