Volume increment of 4. 5 m 3 ha– 1 is approximate to the average increment of high <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in Serbia, and it amounts to 75 % of the optimal value. The average volume of coppice <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> of 150 m 3 ha– 1 is 60 % of the optimal volume of <b>beech</b> <b>forests</b> in Serbia The age structure is unfavourable, because the percentage of well conserved mature stands is only about 8 %.

25|$|The primary {{traffic was}} sawn timber and firewood, with many sawmills located {{adjacent}} to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and <b>Beech</b> <b>Forest,</b> and a third train each way to Gellibrand.

Prior to the arrival of humans in New Zealand (about 1280 AD), they had a widespread distribution across the North and South Islands and on Stewart Island/Rakiura. The range of the rifleman and bushwren included southern <b>beech</b> <b>forest</b> and podocarp-broadleaf forest, with the range of the bushwren also including coastal forest and scrub, particularly the Stewart Island subspecies. The New Zealand rock wren is specialised for the alpine environment, in areas of low scrub and scree from 900 m up to 2,400 m. Contrary to its other common name (the South Island wren), fossil evidence shows it was more widespread in the past and once lived on the North Island. Lyall's wren was once thought to have been {{restricted to the}} tiny Stephens Island in Cook Strait, but fossil evidence has shown the species was once widespread on both the North and South Islands. The stout-legged wren was similarly found on both islands, but fossils of the long-billed wren have only been found on the South Island. Fossils of the long-billed wren are far less common than those of the other species, in fact, its bones are the rarest fossil finds in New Zealand.|$|E
