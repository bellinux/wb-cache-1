5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cuff</b> at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cuff {{inflation}} at the arm {{is known}} to cause an instantaneous rise in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> which {{might be due to}} the discomfort of the procedure and might interfere with the precision of the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement. In this study, we compared the reactive rise in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> induced by <b>cuff</b> inflation when the cuff was placed at the upper arm level and at the wrist. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The reactive rise in systolic and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> to <b>cuff</b> inflation was measured in 34 normotensive participants and 34 hypertensive patients. Each participant was equipped with two cuffs, one around the right upper arm (OMRON HEM-CR 19, 22 - 32 cm) and one around the right wrist (OMRON HEM-CS 19, 17 - 22 cm; Omron Health Care Europe BV, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands). The cuffs were inflated in a double random order (maximal <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> and position of the cuff) with two maximal cuff pressures: 180 and 240 mmHg. The cuffs were linked to an oscillometric device (OMRON HEM 907; Omron Health Care). Simultaneously, <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured continuously at the middle finger of the left hand using photoplethysmography. Three measurements were made at each level of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at the arm and at the wrist, and the sequence of measurements was randomized. RESULTS: In normotensive participants, no significant difference was observed in the reactive rise in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> when the <b>cuff</b> was inflated either at the arm or at the wrist irrespective of the level of cuff inflation. Inflating a cuff at the arm, however, induced a significantly greater rise in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> than inflating it at the wrist in hypertensive participants for both systolic and diastolic pressures (P< 0. 01), and at both levels of <b>cuff</b> inflation. The <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> response to <b>cuff</b> inflation was independent of baseline <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The results show that in hypertensive patients, cuff inflation at the wrist produces a smaller reactive rise in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> The difference between the arm and the wrist is independent of the patient's level of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of mild hypertension {{and the treatment}} of hypertension require accurate measurement of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> readings are altered by various factors that influence the patient, the techniques used and {{the accuracy of the}} sphygmomanometer. The variability of readings can be reduced if informed patients prepare in advance by emptying their bladder and bowel, by avoiding over-the-counter vasoactive drugs the day of measurement and by avoiding exposure to cold, caffeine consumption, smoking and physical exertion within half an hour before measurement. The use of standardized techniques to measure <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> will help to avoid large systematic errors.
