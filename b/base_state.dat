Recently, other varieties of stated choice methods, including forms of conjoint analysis and attribute <b>based</b> <b>stated</b> choice methods, have become popular in environmental valuation. This paper reviews the progress of attribute <b>based</b> <b>stated</b> choice methods in environmental valuation and outlines a number of issues that are at the forefront of the application of these methods to valuation, and to environmental economic modeling. Topics of discussion include heterogeneity, social interaction, complexity / context, and data fusion. Empirical examples of research on these topics accompany the discussion.

Stations in other capital cities followed: ABQ-2 (Brisbane, Queensland) (1959), ABS-2 (Adelaide, South Australia) (1960), ABW-2 (Perth, Western Australia) (1960), and ABT-2 (Hobart, Tasmania) (1960).

2500|$|The {{effect of}} Ross Perot's {{candidacy}} {{has been a}} contentious point of debate for many years. In the ensuing months after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a spoiler, enough {{to the detriment of}} Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important" [...] (25%) [...] voted for Bill Clinton. The voting numbers reveal that to win the electoral vote Bush would have had to win 10 of the 11 states Clinton won by less than five percentage points. For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support <b>base.</b> <b>State</b> exit polls suggested that Perot did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot-button social issues.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state assignment algorithm {{with the objective}} of lower energy along with area comparable to the area-targeting state assignments such as JEDI. The underlying framework is MUSTANG's complete weighted graph with weights representing state affinity. The weight computation phase estimates the computation energy of potential common cubes using steady state probabilities for transitions. The weight computation phase also identifies a large set of potential state cliques, which are incorporated into a recursive bipartitioning <b>based</b> <b>state</b> assignment procedure. Reuse of cliques identified by the weight computation phase results in a faster and efficient state assignment. The energy targeting weights result in ≈ 9 % lower area and 18 % lower power than area targeting weights in JEDI over 29 MCNC Logic Synthesis 93 benchmarks. The clique <b>based</b> <b>state</b> assignment performs almost as well as the annealing <b>based</b> <b>state</b> assignment in JEDI, and takes only about half as much time...|$|R

Unmanned vehicles have applications in both surveillance and structural inspection, but require robust, location independent behaviour recognition. Previous research has used GPS or location <b>based</b> <b>states</b> that tie model parameters to specific locations, and have rarely considered performance under specific levels of noise. We use location independent action <b>based</b> <b>states</b> to recognise high level behaviour using flat Hidden Markov Models.

40|$|This work {{presents}} an energy <b>based</b> <b>state</b> estimation formalism {{for a class}} of dynamical systems with inaccessible/unknown outputs and systems at which sensor utilization is costly, impractical or measurements can not be taken. The physical interactions among most of the dynamical subsystems represented mathematically in terms of Dirac structures allow power exchange through the power ports of these subsystems. Power exchange is conceptually considered as information exchange among the dynamical subsystems and further utilized to develop a natural feedback-like information from a class of dynamical systems with inaccessible/unknown outputs. The feedback-like information is utilized in realizing state observers for this class of dynamical systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for observability are studied. In addition, estimation error asymptotic convergence stability of the proposed energy <b>based</b> <b>state</b> variable observer is proved for systems with linear and nonlinear dynamics. Robustness of the asymptotic convergence stability is analyzed over a range of parameter deviations, model uncertainties and unknown initial conditions. The proposed energy <b>based</b> <b>state</b> estimation formalism allows realization of the motion and force control from measurements taken from a single subsystem within the entire dynamical system. This in turn allows measurements to be taken from this single subsystem, whereas {{the rest of the}} dynamical system is kept free from measurements. Experiments are conducted on dynamical systems with single input and multiple inaccessible outputs in order to verify the validity of the proposed energy <b>based</b> <b>state</b> estimation and control formalism...|$|R

The performance comparison has been done for the power system network comprising of two thermal power plants which are tie line connected. For using the optimal control based method such as LQR PI controller and computationally intelligent method such as PSO <b>based</b> <b>state</b> feedback gain controller, the state space modeling of the system has been done. Transfer function model for the system is used for finding the response of Integral controller.

50|$|The {{information}} transfer that occurs {{during a game}} {{can be viewed as}} a physical process.In the simplest case of a classical game between two players with two strategies each, both the players can use a bit (a '0' or a '1') to convey their choice of strategy. A popular example of such a game is the Prisoners' Dilemma, where each of the convicts can either cooperate or defect: withholding knowledge or revealing that the other committed the crime. In the quantum version of the game, the bit is replaced by the qubit, which is a quantum superposition of two or more <b>base</b> <b>states.</b> In the case of a two-strategy game this can be physically implemented by the use of an entity like the electron which has a superposed spin <b>state,</b> with the <b>base</b> <b>states</b> being +1/2 (plus half) and &minus;1/2 (minus half). Each of the spin states can be used to represent each of the two strategies available to the players. When a measurement is made on the electron, it collapses to one of the <b>base</b> <b>states,</b> thus conveying the strategy used by the player.|$|R
