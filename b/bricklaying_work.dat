2500|$|As the regatta committee's minutes also note, it was rejecting Kelly {{because he}} was deemed ineligible because of his <b>bricklaying</b> <b>work.</b> The regatta's rules on amateurism {{excluded}} anyone ... who is or ever has been ... by trade or employment for wages a mechanic, artisan or labourer. Two days before he was due to sail to the UK, with his passage booked and his boat boxed, Kelly received a telegram which said: [...] "Entry rejected; letter follows." [...] He never received the letter. The Henley Stewards later declared that they had informed the governing board for U.S. rowing as soon as Kelly's entry was processed, {{and that it was}} not their fault if the information was not passed on.|$|E
40|$|In [5] B. Finel and M. C. Portmann {{studied a}} {{stochastic}} scheduling problem with resource constraints arising in {{iron and steel}} industry. They had to minimize an aggregate criterion which was a sum of <b>bricklaying</b> <b>work</b> costs and production loss. Simulations were used in order to schedule the moves and works of bricklaying systems. Modifications of the converter states were used in order to decrease the production loss, but only when a production loss was known in immediate future. We discuss here the possibility of decreasing the production costs by systematic maintenance policies assuming {{that the number of}} bricklaying systems is sufficiently large so that the production loss is not due to a bad schedule or a lack of these systems. We use stochastic control techniques and a Markov decision procedure called valueiteration algorithm in order to find the best policy (i. e. which minimizes the average production cost) for controlling each site containing several converters. This algorithm has [...] ...|$|E

Compressed Earth Interlocking Block (CEIB) {{is one of}} the part of block system that will reduce the time and cost construction for housing because it do not required mortar in <b>bricklaying</b> <b>work.</b> The aim of this research is to determine the suitable curing method and the compressive strength of the laterite interlocking block using different ratio of cement content. The different ratios of cement were used in producing the interlocking block (1 : 5, 1 : 6, 1 : 7, 1 : 8 and 1 : 9). In this experimental, there are 4 different curing methods to be conducted. The result from the curing sets experimental shows that Set 3 # which is dry in sun curing method that give the highest compressive strength value (7. 01 MPa) for 7 days of curing. The curing method of Set 3 # will be used in the different ratio of cement content experimental and different type of cement which is comparing between YTL cement and Lafarge cement. The result from the different ratio of cement content shows that interlocking block with ratio of 1 : 5 cement give highest compressive strength value which is 8. 60 MPa meanwhile for interlocking block using Lafarge cement give value of 4. 30 Mpa...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that the absolute number of completed behavioural change phases (ABP) and the sequentially ordered number of completed behavioural change phases (SBP) are positively associated with the use of ergonomic measures by two groups of stakeholders in bricklaying companies (employers/planners, foremen/bricklayers). The measures, consisting of trestles, <b>bricklaying</b> scaffolds, mast-climbing <b>work</b> platforms and cranes, reduce the physical work demands made upon bricklayers and bricklayers' assistants. Structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders of 27 companies. Ordinal regression of behavioural change phases on the use of ergonomic measures showed a significant increase in both ABP and SBP in relation to increased use of three of the four ergonomic measures (i. e. trestles, <b>bricklaying</b> scaffolds, mast-climbing <b>work</b> platforms) by employers/planners and increased use of one ergonomic measure (i. e. trestles) by foremen/bricklayers. In conclusion, the positive and significant associations between the completed behavioural change phases (ABP and SBP) and use of ergonomic measures differ for the stakeholder groups and between the ergonomic measures. The data suggest that there is a higher chance of increasing the use of ergonomic measures by means of a higher ABP than a higher SBP. It is recommended for activities to be carried out-primarily by employers/planners-to facilitate as many behavioural change phases as possible in order to stimulate actual use of ergonomic measures at worksite...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{waste is}} {{becoming}} a serious environmental problem in many large cities in the world including Malaysia. Thus, the minimisation of construction wastes has become a pressing issue. Compressed earth interlocking block (CEIB) {{is a part of}} Block Work Systems in Industrialised Building Systems (IBS). Using the CEIB will reduce the construction time and cost in houses construction as it does not required mortal in <b>bricklaying</b> <b>work.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the suitable curing method and to determine the characteristic of the interlocking block using recycled fine aggregate in terms of compressive strength, durability and water absorption. The different percentages of natural fine aggregate and recycled fine aggregate were used in producing the interlocking block (50 : 50 %, and 33. 33 : 66. 67 %). The curing sets experimental have 4 different type of curing method. The results from the curing sets experimental shows that Set 3 # give the highest compressive strength value (7. 01 MPa) for 7 days of curing. The curing method of Set 3 # will be used in the recycled set experimental. The test result for the interlocking block using recycled fine aggregate show a lower value of compressive strength than interlocking block in curing set 3 # (3. 78 MPa from interlocking block with 50 % replacement of recycled fine aggregate) with 13. 33 % of water absorption percentage...|$|E
40|$|In {{the border}} of the {{municipality}} towards Kosovo, Kuršumlija preserved the St. Cemetery's church of Peter and Paul in village Lukovo near the famous rehabilitation center Lukovo's spa. Church is one nave with a semicircular apse at the east vaults with semicircular arch reinforced with cross sec­tion curve, which relies on a few strong pilasters placed inside long walls. According to folk tradition the church was built in the middle ages and served to diggers and foundries of lead ores of King Milutin. Upon termination of exploitation ore the church neglected and in the 19 th century it suffered its first renewal 1871 st and another 1895 th year. Saved epigraphic inscription with carved year of renewal (1895 th), icons and wall decor of the church provide information about reliably judging its recent history and artistic value. Soon after the <b>bricklaying</b> <b>work</b> 1895 th Church has received from the altar wall of icons, and after that, and mural painting small artistic value. The crown of the vault is painted Pantocrator, about whose performances are painted scenes of the Transfiguration, Ascension of Christ, Vavedenje and Entry into Jerusalem. On the western wall are shown the Dormition of the Mother of God and in the first zone are shown standing figures of Sts. Constantine and Helena, St. Simon Mir refills and St. Prince Lazar - kefaloforos. On the triumphal arch are Old. Testament scenes of hospitality and sacrifice of Abraham and in the apse bust of God Savaot. In the zone of standing figures are shown Sts. Druid, St. Czar Uroš and St. King Stephen, St. Sunday, St. Petka, St. Procopius, and St. George. From the figures standing at the altar of bishops are shown St. John Chrysostom, St. Sava Serbian, St. Basil the Great and St. Athanasius. There was saved the altar compartments with icons. At the czar's gate are shown Blagovesti and in the order of main icons: Christ Almighty, Mother of God with Christ, St. John the Forerunner, icons of patron St. Peter and St. Paul. In the association line there are five icons scenes: Birth, Baptism, Resurrection of Lazarus, Resurrection of Christ and the Last Supper and so the icons of St. Trinity, Archangel Michael, the prophet Elijah in the wilderness and Ascension of St. Elijah. The crown of the iconostasis is a cross with the notion of Christ's crucifixion. In the church is located a few more icons: Celivajuća icons from the 1899, mutually painted flag with scenes of Christ's Birth and patron of St. Apostles Peter and Paul, naively painted the clerical throne, and a copy of the harp. Who were zografs of these paintings units, we still can not exactly say, but some details lead to the conclusion that these paintings, originally, are works of the painters from the south, from western Macedonia, those, who in the late 19 th and early 20 th century acted on the territory of Kosovo and Metohija, in Peć and in the Old Vlaho. Maybe the works might be of the brothers Dičić from Debra, masters who based theirs paintings of models and solutions known master Hristifor Žefarović or on the part of his followers in church painting with us...|$|E

50|$|Watford {{was born}} in the town of Ahoskie in 1924, and {{remained}} in the area of Hertford County most of his life, with his shop located just six miles from his birthplace. He grew up with fourteen siblings, and first began to experiment with woodcarving as a child throughout the 1920s. He only began to profit off his works, however, when he opened his shop in the early 1980s. Prior to his professional woodcarving career, Watford worked in a variety of industries, including <b>bricklaying,</b> carpentry, shipyard <b>work,</b> farming, factory work, as well as a stint in the military. Today, many of his family, including his grandchildren, live in the area of Hertford County. Watford died in 1998.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Education)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1989. There {{is growing}} {{need for more}} {{technically}} skilled manpower in the Republic of South Africa. This implies, inter alia, that more pupils should be trained at school level in technical subjects such as Technical Drawing, Electrician Work, Radiotrician <b>Work,</b> Cabinetmaking, <b>Bricklaying</b> and Masonry <b>Work,</b> Plumbing and Sheet-metal Work, Motor Mechanics, Welding and Metalwork, Panel Beating, and Fitting and Turning. These subjects are taught at technical high schools, ordinary high schools, special secondary schools and schools of industry. In order to provide the necessary training in technical subjects to {{a growing number of}} pupils, a large corps of qualified technical teachers is needed. A shortage of qualified technical teachers has, however, developed over the years. This study has endeavoured to determine the causes for this shortage {{and at the same time}} to establish at which institutions in the RSA these teachers are trained, and what the entrance requirements and curricula are. Apart from studying the development and the practical application of the training of technical teachers in countries abroad such as England and Wales, Scotland, the Netherlands, West Germany, Israel and Taiwan, the corresponding historical development in the RSA was investigated and compared to the above. Particular attention was given to the entrance requirements and curricula used for the training of technical teachers. Five models for the training of technical teachers in the RSA were derived from this information...|$|R
