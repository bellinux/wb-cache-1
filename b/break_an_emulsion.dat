40|$|Homogenous acid {{catalysts}} are prevalent {{throughout the}} chemical industry but all have the drawback of requiring post reaction neutralization and subsequent downstream removal of the product salt. The use of a base to neutralize the acid and the processing of the salt are ancillary to {{the process and the}} disposal of the salt is an environmental concern. The work presented here shows the use of alkylcarbonic acids, which form in situ with CO₂ pressure and neutralize on loss of CO₂ pressure rather than requiring a base. Thus CO₂ can be used to "switch" the acid on and off. The properties of alkylcarbonic acids are explored to gain understanding of the mechanisms by which they act. The acids are also used to catalyze the synthesis of α-pinene, methyl yellow, and benzyl iodide. These reactions are examples of common acid catalyzed reactions where this technology could be implemented. The second half of the work explores two other "switches". The first is using temperature to <b>break</b> <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> with a novel thermally cleavable surfactant. This technology has potential applications {{in a wide range of}} fields where surfactants are used including polymerization, oil recovery, and biosynthesis. The second is using CO₂ to liquefy a solid ionic compound to allow its use as a solvent. This would greatly increase the number of ionic species available for use in ionic liquid-CO₂ biphasic systems. Ph. D.

50|$|Emulsion {{inversion}} {{differs from}} <b>emulsion</b> <b>breaking</b> in that <b>a</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>emulsion</b> tends {{to separate the}} two phases into un-emulsified continuous phases. Inversion of <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{may or may not}} be difficult to invert, but generally more difficult than creaming.|$|R
5000|$|Creaming {{is usually}} seen as {{undesirable}} because it causes difficulties in storage and handling, {{but it can}} be useful in special cases, especially where it is desirable to concentrate <b>an</b> <b>emulsion.</b> <b>A</b> particular example is in the separation of dairy cream, either to achieve a desired concentration of butterfat, or to make butter. Depending on whether the dispersed particles are less dense or more dense than the continuous phase, they may move either {{to the top of a}} sample, or to the bottom. As already stated, the process of migration is called creaming while the particles of the substance remain separated. In this it differs ideally from flocculation (where particles clump) or emulsion breaking (where particles coalesce). One important difference between creaming and the other two processes; unlike flocculation and <b>breaking,</b> creaming of <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> is largely <b>a</b> simple process to reverse.|$|R
5000|$|In cookery, {{curdling}} is the <b>breaking</b> of <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> or colloid {{into large}} parts of different composition through the physico-chemical processes of flocculation, creaming, and coalescence. Curdling is intentional and desirable in making cheese and tofu; unintentional and undesirable in making sauces and custards. Curdling occurs naturally in milk if the milk is not used by the expiration date, or if the milk stays out in warm temperature. Milk is composed of several compounds, primarily fat, protein, and sugar. The protein in milk is normally suspended in a colloidal solution, {{which means that the}} small protein molecules float around freely and independently. These floating protein molecules refract light and contribute (with the suspended fat) to the white appearance of milk. Normally these protein molecules repel each other, allowing them to float about without clumping, but when the pH of their solution changes, they can attract one another and form clumps. This is what happens when milk curdles, as the pH drops and becomes more acidic, the protein (casein and others) molecules attract one another and become [...] "curdles" [...] floating in a solution of translucent whey. This clumping reaction happens more swiftly at warmer temperatures than it does at cold temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Another early {{practical}} system {{for measuring the}} sensitivity of <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> was that of Hurter and Driffield (H&D), originally described in 1890, by the Swiss-born Ferdinand Hurter (1844-1898) and British Vero Charles Driffield (1848-1915). In their system, speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required. For example, <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> rated at 250 H&D would require ten times the exposure of <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> rated at 2500 H&D.|$|R

5000|$|Creaming of <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> also {{increases}} {{the tendency of}} <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> to inversion.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{proposes a}} novel method for the {{determination}} of trace concentrations of Cu, Mn and Ni in biodiesel samples by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. In order to overcome problems related to the organic matrix in the direct introduction of the samples, a new extraction approach was investigated. The method {{was based on the}} extraction induced by emulsion breaking, in which metals were transferred from the biodiesel to an acid aqueous phase after formation and <b>breaking</b> of <b>a</b> water-in-oil <b>emulsion</b> prepared by mixing the biodiesel sample with an aqueous solution containing surfactant and nitric acid. Several parameters that could influence the performance of the system were evaluated. Quantitative extractions of the analytes were obtained when the extraction was performed using an emulsifier solution containing 2. 1 molL− 1 of HNO 3 and 7 % m/v of Triton X- 100. The extraction time had remarkable influence on the efficiency of the process, being necessary an agitation time of 60 min to achieve maximum extraction. The limits of quantification were below 1 µgL− 1 for the three analytes under study. The accuracy of the method was tested by application of a recovery test (recovery percentages between 89 % and 109 % were observed) and by comparison with a well-established method, taken as reference...|$|R
