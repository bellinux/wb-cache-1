5|$|In 1957, the {{animation}} company Belvision Studios produced {{a string of}} colour adaptations based upon Hergé's original comics, adapting eight of the Adventures into a series (named Hergé's Adventures of Tintin) of daily five-minute episodes. The Calculus Affair (renamed The Calculus Case) was the eighth such story in the second series, being directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, himself a well-known cartoonist who in later years would become editor-in-chief of Tintin magazine. It was originally intended to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> but because the rights to do so lay with the director of Tintin and the Golden Fleece and Tintin and the Blue Oranges, they had to split it into episodes and therefore into a series.|$|E
5|$|The second movie Cagney's company {{produced}} was Blood on the Sun. Insisting {{on doing}} his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys {{had hoped that}} an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse {{at the box office}} than Johnny Come Lately. At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia.

So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on Being John Malkovich, in 1999." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking.
