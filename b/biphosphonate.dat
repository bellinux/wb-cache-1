40|$|Abstract: Since osteonecrosis of the jaw {{was related}} to <b>biphosphonate</b> {{administration}} by Marx, studies showing clinical symptoms, drug and surgical therapies overwhelmed the literature. Furthermore, the literature demonstrated the correlation between chronic <b>biphosphonate</b> adsumption and osteonecrosis of the jaw onset. Nitrogen-containing biphosphonates are widely used {{for the management of}} metastatic cancer, for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, for the treatment of Paget’s disease, and for the management of acute hypercalcemia. According to our experience, the treatment of BRON-J’s lesions is difficult and prolonged. For this reason, in order to avoid these complications it is mandatory to perform a risk staging in patients who must undergo <b>biphosphonate</b> administration. When pharmacologic treatments with antibiotics and local antiseptics are not able to control the development of BRON-J’s complications, the clinicians should perform radical surgical treatments such as the resection of the bone involved...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE/AIM To {{describe}} the CT and MRI findings {{in patients with}} <b>biphosphonate</b> osteonecrosis of the mandible and maxilla, and emphasize their role in driving the correct therapeutic approach (conservative vs surgical). CONTENT ORGANIZATION The exhibit will show multiple cases, collected from the electronic database of the University of Pisa (n= 70), and will be organized as follows: Section 1 - Pathophysiology of <b>biphosphonate</b> osteonecrosis. Section 2 - Multirow CT and MRI imaging protocol. Section 3 - Cases presentation of pre-operative CT/MRI imaging with surgical correlation. Section 4 - Cases presentation of post-operative follow-up. Section 5 - Evaluation test SUMMARY <b>Biphosphonate</b> osteonecrosis of the maxilla and mandible is an increasingly disease in oncologic patients. CT and MRI {{have the potential to}} identify patients at preclinical or early stages of the disease, with the possibility to accurately depict the extent of bone involvement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Several {{studies found}} that <b>biphosphonates</b> {{counteract}} locally increased bone resorption and associated pain in patients with complex regional pain syndrome I (CRPS I). We performed a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials to assess the benefit of <b>biphosphonates</b> {{in the treatment of}} CRPS I patients with bone loss. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase (April 2007) and the Cochrane Library and screened bibliographies of included studies. REVIEW METHODS: We selected randomised trials comparing <b>biphosphonates</b> with placebo, with the goal of improving pain, function and quality of life in patients with CRPS I. Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Where data were incomplete or unclear, conflicts were resolved with discussion and/or trial authors were contacted for further details. We calculated the study size weighted pooled mean reduction of pain intensity (measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS)). RESULTS: Four trials of moderate quality fulfilled our inclusion criteria. In respect to function and quality of life there was a trend in favour of <b>biphosphonates</b> but differences in outcome assessment impeded pooling of results. Two trials provided sufficient data to pool pain outcomes. <b>Biphosphonates</b> reduced pain intensity by 22. 4 and 21. 6 mm on a VAS after 4 and 12 weeks of follow-up. Data on adverse effects were scarce. CONCLUSIONS: The very limited data reviewed showed that bisphosphonates have the potential to reduce pain associated with bone loss in patients with CRPS I. However, at present there is not sufficient evidence to recommend their use in practice...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Biphosphonates</b> {{are used}} in the {{treatment}} of bone metastatic tumors and osteoporosis. The most adverse effect of bisphosphonates is osteonecrosis of jaws, which is difficult to control. The aim of this review was to evaluate articles published on the effect of these medications on jaws and methods to control and prevent its side effects in comparison with complications of radiotherapy {{in the head and neck}} region. Review report: A Pubmed/Medline search was run using the key words <b>biphosphonates,</b> osteonecrosis and jaws from 1980 to 2010. Of the 160 articles in the search results 44 were case reports. Results: Osteonecrosis of the jaws, with signs and symptoms similar to osteoradionecrosis, is a complication of biphosponate use, especially when used intravenously. Oral use of these medications is not absolutely contraindicated in dentistry. Conclusion: The best way to treat jaw necrosis is its prevention. There is a low risk for the incidence of osteonecrosis during the first 6 months of treatment with <b>biphosphonates.</b> Use of chlorhexidine mouthwash might be useful in these patients.

40|$|AbstractWe studied {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) in 79 {{long-term}} survivors of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) (median follow-up: 78 months; range: 38 - 160). Seventy patients received a {{total body irradiation}} (TBI) -based myeloablative SCT and 9 patients received a non-TBI, reduced-intensity SCT. Fourteen (18 %) patients were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) beyond 3 years from SCT. Fifty-eight (73. 4 %) of patients had bone loss (BL) : 33 (41. 8 %) with osteopenia and 25 (31. 6 %) with osteoporosis. Factors associated with a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis were age and prolonged IST and for overall BL prolonged IST.

40|$|The {{osteoclast}} cellular {{process is}} essential for bone growth, remodeling, and repair, and is, under normal conditions, tightly coupled {{to the process of}} bone formation by the osteoblast. It is the balance that determines skeletal mass and shape at any point in time. Some drugs effect the osteoclast formation and differentiation. <b>Biphosphonate</b> and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs_ are known to reduce the resorption process of the bone in vitro. We worked on those two different drugs to see their effects and influences on bone remodeling, especially bone resoprtion using a bone marrow culture system.

The improvement of our means of therapeutic intervention with antiresorptive agents will depend on our better understanding of the molecular basis of bone resorption. </p...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a influência das combinações: bifosfonato (alendronato de sódio) + estatina (atorvastatina cálcica), bifosfonato (alendronato de sódio) + flavonóide (ipriflavona) e estatina (atorvastatina cálcica) + flavonóide (ipriflavona) em ratas com osteoporose induzida pelo glicocorticóide dexametasona. As influências das associações dessas substâncias foram pesquisadas pela análise de testes dos marcadores bioquímicos de remodelação óssea, tais como, cálcio e fósforo sérico, fosfatase alcalina óssea e por exames histomorfométricos, caracterizando a densidade trabecular óssea. Através da avaliação da densidade trabecular óssea foi possível verificar o aumento da mesma em todos os tratamentos efetuados. Ressaltando-se, ainda, que as associações contendo alendronato de sódio apresentaram elevadas taxas de restauração tecidual óssea, alcançando valores superiores aos do grupo dos animais normais. Os marcadores bioquímicos não apresentaram resultados estatisticamente significativos, não fornecendo subsídios para o diagnóstico e acompanhamento da osteoporose. No entanto, a avaliação histomorfométrica permitiu a análise estática e dinâmica, bem como detecção de alterações teciduais na unidade metabólica óssea, particularmente, no osso trabecular.

40|$|Abstract. Uveitis {{has been}} {{reported}} in association with a variety of topical, intraocular, periocular, and systemic medications. To establish causality of adverse events by drugs, in 1981, Naranjo and associates proposed seven criteria, which are related to the frequency and documentation of the event; circumstances of occurrence, recovery, and recurrence; and coexistence of other factors or medications. Rarely does a drug meet all seven criteria. The authors review reports of drug-associated uveitis, applying the seven criteria and examining possible mechanisms. Only systemically administered <b>biphosphonates</b> and, perhaps, topical metipranolol meet all seven criteria. Systemic sulfonamides, rifabutin, and topical glucocorticoids fulfill at least five criteria. (Surv Ophthalmol 42 : 557 - 570, 1998. © 1998 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.)
