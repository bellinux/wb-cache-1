5|$|By {{the time}} Grace celebrated his 30th {{birthday}} in July 1878, he was {{arguably the most}} famous man in England; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{one of the most}} controversial on account of his gamesmanship and moneymaking. Both of these aspects were subject to serious challenge in the light of events in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Escher's {{interest}} in geometry is well known, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> an avid amateur astronomer, {{and in the}} early 1940s he {{became a member of the}} Dutch Association for Meteorology and Astronomy. He owned a 6cm refracting telescope, and recorded several observations of binary stars.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{grew up in}} a Hindu and Jain {{religious}} {{atmosphere in}} his native Gujarat which were his primary influences, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism, Christianity and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. He, at age 57, declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious pluralism.|$|E
50|$|Big Tim—Tim is a bully to Gracie and Daniel, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> Daniel's brother.|$|R

5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> muscular and bronzed, with {{a finely}} formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} {{which he used}} to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor {{all the details of}} the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a {{softball}} pitcher, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the History means they cannot have been written by the same author.|$|E
50|$|He usually plays as a left defender <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> {{capable of}} playing as a left midfielder.|$|R
50|$|He mainly {{works as}} a {{landscape}} designer <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a writer being {{a correspondent for the}} Financial Times.|$|R

5|$|In 1840, Fr. Antonio Mateo, the Vicar of Tayabas, became {{suspicious}} of the cofradías monthly masses and fees, thus Fr. Manuel Sancho stopped holding Masses for the cofradía. Mateo and Sancho then accused the cofradía of conducting heretical activities. Due to religious persecution and {{the increasing number of}} its members, Pule decided to have the cofradía recognized by the colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church. He first sought recognition and authorization from the Bishop of Camarines but his request was denied. Not discouraged, he then sought the approval of the Real Audiencia <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> ignored.|$|E
5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E

5|$|On 3 December 1939, 24 RAF Vickers Wellington bombers from Marham and Mildenhall bases {{attacked}} Heligoland. These were {{intercepted by}} I./ZG 26 {{along with other}} Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. Specht scored his third victory, shooting down a bomber over the North Sea. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> seriously injured by return fire from the Wellington's tail gunner, seriously wounding him in the face. Ditching into the sea, he {{was picked up by}} rescue craft. Losing the sight in his left eye, he spent the next six months in recovery. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah's {{connections}} {{drew the}} number five post {{position for the}} Belmont on June 3. Pundits immediately noted {{it was the same}} slot from which Seattle Slew had won the 1977 Belmont and the Triple Crown, and that 14 other Belmont winners had started from the position. American Pharoah was the 3–5 morning line favorite in an eight-horse field that included Tale of Verve, as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had skipped the Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like Tonalist the year prior, had instead won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Having {{sold his}} {{personal}} library to Academia Mihăileană, Kogălniceanu was in Paris and other Western European cities from 1845 to 1847, joining the Romanian student association (Societatea Studenților Români) that included Ghica, Bălcescu, and Rosetti and was {{presided over by}} the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine. He also frequented La Bibliothèque roumaine ("The Romanian Library"), while affiliating to the Freemasonry and joining the Lodge known as L'Athénée des étrangers ("Foreigners' Atheneum"), as did most other reform-minded Romanians in Paris. In 1846, he visited Spain, wishing to witness the wedding of Isabella II and the Duke of Cádiz, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> curious to assess developments in Spanish culture. Upon {{the end of his}} trip, he authored Notes sur l'Espagne ("Notes on Spain"), a French-language volume combining memoir, travel writing and historiographic record.|$|E

50|$|Sources most {{frequently}} name him as Bruno Frei, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> sometimes identified as Karl Franz, a pseudonym under {{which some of}} his work was published.|$|R
5|$|The Macedonian {{king was}} an autocratic figure {{at the head}} of both {{government}} and society, with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his hetairoi, the core of the Macedonian aristocracy. These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege, filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military. It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexander the Great's empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found, especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. Although governed by a king and martial aristocracy, Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous Greek states.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E
5|$|From 1918, Burnet {{attended}} the University of Melbourne, {{where he lived}} in Ormond College on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and {{was influenced by the}} ideas of science and society in the writings of H. G. Wells. He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the military, which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted {{by the end of the}} war. In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.|$|E
