Five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to test for the presence of antibodies to the diseases, except Taenia saginata, for which we tested for the presence of Taenia metacestode circulating antigens. The overall highest prevalence was for T. saginata (46. 4 %), with lower prevalence for Q-fever (4 %), leptospirosis (3 %), tuberculosis (1 %), and brucellosis (0. 2 %). Although {{there were no significant differences}} in the proportion of seroprevalence between sex and age of the animals sampled, there were significant differences between the provincial distributions.

40|$|The purpose {{this review}} gathers the {{available}} information for easy acces and identifies where {{further research is}} required. <b>Bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is a zoonosis of socioeconomic and public health importance. Economically important to the meat industry, for losses incurred from condemnation, downgrading and refrigeration of carcasses. Dietary habits and culinary practices affect transmission. Taeniosis {{is more common in}} populations/age groups that consume raw or undercooked beef. The prevalence of <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> shows wide variation between countries, regions and slaughterhouses. High-prevalence in Eastern African countries, moderate prevalence in Asia and Latin America, and low prevalence in USA, Canada and Australia. The anatomical distribution of Cysticercus to the inspection is higher in heart and masseter muscles. While the anatomical distribution of Cysticercus to the total dissection is wide. According to the classification concerning viability, the occurrence of metacestode nonviable (dead) dominates viable (alive). From the Cysticercus alive, most are located in the masseter muscle followed by heart, tongue; whereas from those dead, most are located in the hearts muscles, followed by masseter muscles and tongue. En conclusion the prevalence data on <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> usually come from meat inspection results. Many studies report on the low sensitivity of meat inspection, resulting in an underestimation of the prevalence of <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis.</b> This partly explains the persistence of T. saginata in industrialised countries.

In this paper, emerging zoonotic diseases are newly introduced disease agents or endemic zoonoses whose previous epidemiologic patterns have changed. As of 1996, 15 zoonotic diseases of animals, anthrax, brucellosis, <b>cysticercosis</b> (<b>bovine),</b> erysipelas, leishmaniasis (canine), leptospirosis, listeriosis, malleus (glanders), psittacosis (chlamydiasis), Q fever, rabies, Rift Valley fever (RVF), salmonellosis, trichinosis, and tuberculosis (bovine and avian) (Table 1), have been declared notifiable in Israel. When diagnosed in animals, these diseases are officially reported to the state veterinary officers, who in turn report them to the medical officers. Of these notifiable zoonoses, RVF has never been recorded in Israel, and glanders has not been reported since 1951; ten are notifiable in humans at the national level. This article examines five of the reportable animal diseases whose epidemiologic features have changed in Israel during the last decade: Brucella melitensis in cattle, Salmonella enteritidis in poultry, rabies, canine leishmaniasis, and trichinosis in wild boars. Two nonreportable diseases in animals—botulism in ruminants and echinococcosis—will also be discussed briefly. (Table 1). Recently, the possibility that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) may be a zoonotic disease has been discussed worldwide.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is {{a problem}} {{distributed}} worldwide that result in economic losses mainly due to the condemnation of infected carcasses. One of the difficulties in applying control measures is {{the identification of the}} source of infection, especially because cattle are typically acquired from multiple farms. Here, we tested the utility of an animal movement network constructed with data from a farm that acquires cattle from several other different farms to map the major contributors of cysticercosis propagation. Additionally, {{based on the results of}} the network analysis, we deployed a sanitary management and drug treatment scheme to decrease cysticercosis’ occurrence in the farm. Six farms that had commercial trades were identified by the animal movement network and characterized as the main contributors to the occurrence of cysticercosis in the studied farm. The identification of farms with a putative risk of Taenia saginata infection using the animal movement network along with the proper sanitary management and drug treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in cysticercosis prevalence, from 25 % in 2010 to 3. 7 % in 2011 and 1. 8 % in 2012.

40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} the larval stage (cysticercus) of the human tapeworm Taenia saginata. Infected cattle is an important food safety issue besides an economic concern. Humans get infected by eating raw or undercooked meat containing viable cysticerci. Visual meat inspection of bovines is the only public health measure implemented to control transmission to humans, but it lacks sensitivity and objectivity. It may underestimate the prevalence of the disease by a factor 3 to 10. Furthermore, {{the success of the}} method depends on the expertise of the meat inspector {{as well as on the}} stage of development of the cysticerci. The focus of this study was to develop and explore the usefulness of a PCR assay as an objective alternative to evaluate the meat inspector's visual inspection results. Hereto, a PCR was developed for the detection of T. saginata DNA in muscle lesions. Based on the laboratory classification of lesions, almost 97 % of viable cysts were confirmed by PCR, while for dead cysts, the percentage was approximately 73 %.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 1990 and November 2014. Qualitative and quantitative data on prevalence, risk factors, burden and interventions were extracted and analysed. Results: Reports on prevalence were available for 23 European countries, mostly from western and central Europe; for a few of these only data before 1990 were available. Prevalence based on meat inspection was generally low (below 6. 2 % in 95 % of the records) and varied between and within countries. Serology and detailed meat inspection provided a higher prevalence range (0. 41 – 14 %). Only few studies analysing risk factors were identified. Reported factors related to access to pastures and risky waters, dairy production and uncontrolled human defecation in the proximity of the farm among others. Only one estimate of the economic impact of the disease could be identified. Recommended interventions were focused on increasing diagnostic tests sensitivity or the application of risk based surveillance strategies. Conclusions: There is a lack of complete and updated data on most countries, especially in eastern Europe.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{statutory}} meat inspection at abattoirs, Taenia saginata cysticercus infection in cattle remains an economically important parasitic disease for the livestock industry by affecting food safety. The routinely performed standard meat inspection protocol has a low diagnostic sensitivity {{for the detection of}} T. saginata cysticerci infections. Therefore, an abattoir trial aiming to increase the detection level was undertaken. In three EU-approved abattoirs, several additional heart incisions were performed in a total of 1088 slaughtered cattle originating from 832 farms throughout Switzerland. Cysticerci as putative parasitic lesions were classified by visual examination during meat inspection and confirmed microscopically and/or by molecular analyses.

40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is a {{zoonosis}} that {{is mainly}} of socioeconomic {{and public health}} importance. A survey of this disease {{was carried out in}} Northern Turkana District, Kenya to estimate the prevalence through both serology and meat inspection, to determine the prevalence of the adult tapeworm in the human definitive host, and to determine risk factors for cattle seropositivity. This information is of public health importance and will be of use in assessing economic losses due to downgrading, refrigeration or condemnation of infested carcasses. The study area was stratified into the three livestock grazing regions of Oropoi to the south, Lokichoggio–Mogilla centrally and Kibish in the north {{for the purposes of the}} serological and questionnaire (n = 53 herd owners) data. Five adakaars (grazing units) were selected and 34, 63, 49, 75 and 571 cattle serum samples obtained from these. The slaughter slabs of Lokichoggio and Kakuma were visited and 188 serum samples were obtained from slaughter cattle and compared to results of meat inspection. Human stool samples were collected in each of the three grazing areas and 66, 97 and 78 samples were obtained. The seroprevalence of cysticercosis in cattle was estimated at 16. 7 % (95 % CI 13 – 20. 9 %) using a secretory–excretory antigen detection ELISA. There was poor agreement between meat inspection and serology (k = 0. 025; p = 0. 2797). The prevalence of taeniosis was estimated as 2. 5 % (95 % CI 0. 8 – 5. 6 %) by microscopy. A backwards elimination logistic regression analysis indicated that the grazing unit (Adakaar), the deworming history of household members and the distance (0. 0001 was calculated for <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in this area...|$|E
40|$|Surveys {{were carried}} out in the {{slaughterhouses}} of Abuko and Banjul and on 16 farms involving 391 cattle in the Central River Division of The Gambia. Using conventional meat inspection, 12 (0. 75 %) out of 1595 slaughter cattle were found infected with cysticerci of Taenia saginata. On-farm screening using an antigen detection ELISA revealed an average within herd seroprevalence of 21. 3 % (CI 95 : 13. 6; 29. 0). Although official reports have not mentioned the occurrence of <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in The Gambia for the last 10 years, these data clearly show that this zoonosis is present in the country.

40|$|The bovine taeniasis-cysticercosis complex can {{be defined}} as a set of {{pathological}} changes caused by the adult form of Taenia saginata in humans and their larval form in animals (Cysticercus bovis). Data on the occurrence of <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> comes from the records of veterinary inspection of meat in slaughterhouses under fiscalization, where some positive cases may go unnoticed, especially in moderate infections. So, it is relevant the use of serological tests that have greater sensitivity than the post-mortem routine exams. Studies have shown the possible application of the ELISA test as a tool for epidemiological studies of the parasitosis and in the identification of animals with cysts. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the detection threshold of the indirect ELISA test, using experimentally and naturally infected animals in detecting cases of cysticercosis.

40|$|Taenia saginata {{cysticercosis}} causes financial {{losses to}} the beef industry and farmers, and represents a significant source for human infection in many countries. A case-control {{study was conducted}} to identify risk factors for <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> on farms in Switzerland. The case group (n= 119) consisted of farms with infected cattle identified at slaughter in 2005 and 2006. Infections were confirmed by morphological or molecular diagnosis. The control group (n= 66) comprised randomly selected farms with cattle slaughtered in the same period but with no evidence or history of infection. In personal structured interviews with the farmers, information regarding local surroundings and farm management was collected. Logistic regression revealed the following 5 factors as being positively associated with the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis: the presence of a railway line or a car park close to areas grazed by cattle, leisure activities around these areas, use of purchased roughage and organized public activities on farms attracting visitors. This information is considered useful for government authorities to direct control strategies as well as for farmers to take measures tailored to local situation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is a {{zoonotic}} disease for which cattle are the intermediate hosts {{of the human}} tapeworm Taenia saginata. Routine inspection measures are implemented in Canada by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and similarly elsewhere, for the postmortem detection of larval parasite cysts (cysticerci) in beef destined for human consumption. Detection {{is based on the}} gross examination of traditional carcass predilection sites, although it is recognized that the parasite has no true predilection for a particular tissue or site. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the inspection protocol currently implemented in Canada, a study was undertaken to determine the distribution of T. saginata cysticerci in tissues of experimentally infected cattle. Forty-two cross-bred beef cattle were divided into five groups of 5 - 12 animals each and inoculated orally with either 10000, 5000, 1000, 100 or 10 T. saginata eggs obtained from cases of human taeniosis in Thailand. From 47 to 376 days post-inoculation (DPI), ten animals inoculated with 5000 eggs were killed and the carcasses partitioned into 31 tissue sites. These consisted of the traditionally inspected tissue sites of heart, masseter and pterygoid muscles, tongue, oesophagus, and diaphragm (membranous and crura); as well as non-traditional sites of lung, liver and 20 additional muscles or muscle groups. After the routine inspection for cysticerci of traditional tissue sites, tissues from all sites were each cut into approximately 0. 5 cm thick slices and the total number of parasitic cysts and cyst density (cysts/g of tissue) were determined for each site. Traditional sites were similarly evaluated for the remaining 32 animals that were killed between 117 and 466 DPI. Sites were ranked based on cyst density. In the animals for which non-traditional sites were also evaluated, no sites had higher cyst densities than those traditionally inspected. When only traditional sites for all animals were compared, the heart ranked highest overall, although not significantly different from masseter, and was the most frequently affected site. The traditional site of oesophagus was among the poorest of all sites for detection of cysticerci. The heart was confirmed as the site of choice for detection of <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> based on high cyst density and frequency of infection. There was also enhanced visibility of parasite lesions in the heart due to the relatively early degeneration and resultant gross pathology that occurs in cardiac muscle. More thorough examination of the heart is recommended during post-mortem inspection for this parasite, particularly when examining animals from an infected herd. Currently, confirmation by CFIA of suspect cysticerci recovered during meat inspection relies on gross, stereomicroscopic, or standard histological examination. Although degenerating cysticerci {{are more likely to be}} detected and submitted for diagnosis, they often cannot be definitively identified by these methods. A recently developed monoclonal antibody-based immunohistochemical (IHC) assay for post-mortem diagnosis of this parasite was optimized and standardized. The IHC method was compared to the currently used histological assay using 169 degenerated known-positive T. saginata cysticerci collected from the experimental infections in the first study and from field submissions, and known-negative specimens and lesions of various etiologies from non-infected cattle. The use of the IHC assay identified significantly more known-positive bovine cysticerci (91. 7 %) than the histological method (38. 5 %), and non-specifically reacted only with the other cestode species examined. Since T. saginata is the only larval cestode typically found in the muscle of cattle, this cross-reactivity is not significant and the IHC assay will be a useful tool for the identification of lesions caused by degenerated bovine cysticerci. This research provided evidence to support changes to the current post-mortem inspection, detection and diagnostic procedures and will contribute to more effective and efficient control of <b>bovine</b> <b>cysticercosis...</b>|$|E
