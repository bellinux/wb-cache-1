In addition, the agreement acknowledges the activities of other negotiating groups (such as those on rules, dispute settlement, and intellectual property) and exhorts them to fulfill their Doha round negotiating objectives. The agreement also abandoned the 1 January 2005 deadline for the negotiations and set December 2005 as the date for the 6th ministerial to be held in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{legislative}} {{body of the}} Episcopal Church is the triennial General Convention, consisting of the House of Deputies and the House of Bishops. All active (whether diocesan, coadjutor, suffragan, or assistant) and retired bishops make up the over 300 members of the House of Bishops. Diocesan conventions elect over 800 representatives (each diocese elects four laity and four clergy) to the House of Deputies. The House of Deputies elects a president and vice-president to preside at meetings. General Convention enacts two types of legislation. The first type is the rules by which the church is governed as contained in the Constitution and Canons; the second type are <b>broad</b> <b>guidelines</b> on church policy called resolutions. Either house may propose legislation. The House of Deputies only meets as a full body once every three years; however, the House of Bishops meets regularly throughout the triennium between conventions.|$|E

The system, composed of a feeder cable and a stator winding is modeled and simulated by using multiconductor transmission line theory. A recently developed time-domain equivalent circuit is used to represent the multiconductor line, with losses possibly dependent on frequency, which allows to correctly describe the dielectric losses and the skin-effect in the conductors. The obtained results can offer a <b>broad</b> <b>guideline</b> to design engineers for a suitable dimensioning of the motor insulation...|$|R

50|$|A primary {{explosive}} is an explosive that is extremely sensitive to stimuli such as impact, friction, heat, static electricity, or electromagnetic radiation. Some {{primary explosive}}s are {{also known as}} contact explosives. A relatively small amount of energy is required for initiation. As a very general rule, primary explosives {{are considered to be}} those compounds that are more sensitive than PETN. As a practical measure, primary explosives are sufficiently sensitive that they can be reliably initiated with a blow from a hammer; however, PETN can also usually be initiated in this manner, so this is only a very <b>broad</b> <b>guideline.</b> Additionally, several compounds, such as nitrogen triiodide, are so sensitive that they cannot even be handled without detonating.

40|$|FOREWORD: These {{guidelines}} were developed following {{the publication of}} the Evidence based guidelines for the nutritional management of cancer cachexia. In workshops conducted around the country, many dietitians identified the need for guidelines on the management of malnutrition occurring with anticancer treatments. We have focused on radiation therapy treatment (patients may also be undergoing synchronous or sequential chemotherapy) for these guidelines as there have been several recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which have evaluated nutrition intervention. Studies evaluating the nutritional management of patients receiving chemotherapy alone are not included as there are no recently published RCTs. The older evidence does not demonstrate benefits with respect to survival or tumour response; however, the ability to draw conclusions is difficult due to study design limitations. 1 When published nutrition RCTs in patients receiving chemotherapy become available these can be included in future reviews of these guidelines, and hence they will become <b>broader</b> <b>guidelines</b> for the nutritional management of patients receiving radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy treatment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} a bacteria's ability to bind to human lung tissue was investigated. To {{carry out this}} study Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Eschericia coli and Burkholderia cepacia were used. B. cepacia served as the {{bacterium}} of interest. Isolating the gene which confers upon this bacterium the ability to bind to lung tissue was the main objective of this study. P. aeruginosa {{has been identified as}} being the bacteria most responsible for causing serious lung infections that can result in cystic fibrosis. This bacterium therefore served as the positive control in this study. On the contrary, E. coli does not possess this binding ability and served as the negative control. This paper gives a detailed outline of the different procedures necessary for the successful completion of this project. Firstly, a <b>broad</b> <b>guideline</b> of the important steps involved are explored. This is followed by a discussion on potential problems and possible solutions.

40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} nonmarital sex from a Christian perspective. It {{questioned the}} traditional rule of “no sex before marriage” {{and attempted to}} define a <b>broader</b> <b>guideline</b> for moral sex that is not dependent on one 2 ̆ 7 s marital status. It drew upon five sources for ethical reflection: Scripture, tradition, secular knowledge, experience, and moral discernment. By examining the Biblical commandments concerning sex, this thesis found that the inspiration behind many of the commandments limiting sex to marriage is androcentric and patriarchal. Because of this, the commandments should no longer be accepted with little reflection. Drawing on James Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s work, the importance of mutuality and proportionality in relationships was developed. Proportionality presumes {{that the level of}} sexual activity in a relationship is commensurate with the level of commitment. Mutuality combined with proportionality provide the foundation for an ethic that allows for nonmarital sex so long as these two concepts are present...|$|R
