5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

25|$|The second Turkish {{offensive}} {{began on}} August 14, 1974, as Greek and Turkish Cypriot representatives met in Geneva {{to discuss the}} situation on the island. Turkish pleas for international intervention having failed and very slow diplomatic progress, in addition to being confined to an undefensible and non-viable region in Cyprus, Turkish Armed forces took action again. Despite a UN ceasefire in place (several had already been disregarded), the Turkish Army, massively reinforced from weeks of build-up, launched an all-out surprise attack on ill-prepared Greek Cypriot and Greek units. With little answer to the masses of armour, mechanised units, artillery and air support that the Turks could <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> virtually all Greek Cypriot defences collapsed in a matter of days, and by August 16, 1974, Turkish forces, spearheaded by the 28th and 39th Infantry Divisions, had extended to capture some 37% of the island, including the towns of Famagusta, Varosha and Morphou.|$|E

The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other that at one point a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players (Craig Morton and Fran Tarkenton) and coaches (Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi) who had once been in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere. The team also had passed over future stars for less able players in the annual draft.|$|E

500|$|These new fortifications {{were the}} most {{advanced}} in England at the time, an improvement over earlier medieval designs, and were effective in terms of concentrating firepower on enemy ships. They contained numerous flaws, however, and were primitive in comparison to their counterparts in mainland Europe. The multiple tiers of guns gave the forts a relatively high profile, exposing them to enemy attack, and the curved surfaces of the hollow bastions were vulnerable to artillery. The concentric bastion design prevented overlapping fields of fire {{in the event of}} an attack from the land, and the tiers of guns meant that, as an enemy approached, the number of guns the fort could <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> [...] diminished.|$|E
500|$|Geen was {{commissioned}} second {{lieutenant in the}} 9th Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps on 21 August 1914. He trained in Petworth and {{was sent to the}} Western Front in May 1915. The 9th was assigned to the 14th (Light) Division and served with it during the Second Battle of Ypres. After six weeks' combat, the battalion was withdrawn for rest but two days later was sent back to the front to reinforce the 41st Brigade. Geen was killed in action on 31 July 1915 at Hooge, Belgium. He was last seen leading his men in hand-to-hand fighting as they advanced towards ruined village buildings. Major John Hope wrote: [...] "Geen fought gloriously, and was last seen alive leading his platoon in a charge after being for hours subjected to liquid fire and every device the Germans could <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> to break through. Seventeen officers and 333 other ranks of this battalion were killed in this engagement, in which officers and men showed themselves worthy of the best traditions of their Regiment." ...|$|E

[...] "Their extremes of endurance may sometimes sound masochistic", wrote D. W. Harding (New Statesman), and Richard E. Gross (The Social Studies) added that Neill's [...] "extremes ... go far beyond good sense". Danica Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) concluded that the school's lessons curbed the child's sense of social responsibility and other society-preserving functions. Jacob Hechler (Child Welfare) said that what Neill described as love—a combination of [...] "caring and noninterference"—was very hard to <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> The New Yorker called Neill [...] "a fiery crusader" [...] with [...] "deep understanding of children", and Morris Fritz Mayer (Social Service Review) read Neill as having the [...] "wrath and eloquence of a biblical prophet" [...] with a belief in children and [...] "unyielding attack against pathological and phony values in education" [...] that [...] "one cannot help admiring". Willard W. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) positioned Neill as closer to a psychotherapist than a teacher, especially as the philosophy undergirding Summerhill [...] "derives from Freud". Gene Phillips (The Annals of the American Academy) described Neill as the [...] "essential ingredient of the democratic ethic that ... America needs".|$|E

In three days, the attacking Soviet units broke through the Romanian positions guarding the LVII Panzer Corps flank and threatened the 4th Panzer Army from the south, forcing the Germans to continue withdrawing to the southwest. [...] All the while, the XLVIII Panzer Corps—led mainly by the 11th Panzer Division—strove to maintain its position along the Chir River.
