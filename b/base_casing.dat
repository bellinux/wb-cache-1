40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} reliability <b>based</b> <b>casing</b> design. The method is inspired by the model described by Das et al. (2015) - A model for Well Reliability Analysis throughout the Life of a Well Using Barrier Engineering and Performance (1). The purpose of this model is to show how reliability <b>based</b> <b>casing</b> design, <b>based</b> on statistical data, can be performed in practice. Monte Carlo simulation conducted in MATLAB {{is the basis of}} the approach. Statistical data of load and strength simulate a casing burst scenario for a life cycle period of 20 years. Degradation factors associated with casing wear and corrosion are accounted for. Based on the result from this simulation, the underlying life time distribution was identified using Nelson-estimator. Maximum Likelihood estimation was used to calculate parameters for the identified life time distribution. The results from the simulated data showed that the underlying lifetime distribution could be represented by a Weibull distribution. From this distribution, failure rate, failure function and survival function was found. The presented approach show how it is possible to quantify the reliability of a given design. Some of the identified challenges in using a reliability based design approach in practice, is related to the lack of qualitative statistical input data of load, and proper estimation of degradation factors related to the casing strength. To get an overview of {{the most important aspect of}} well design an introduction to the regulations, well integrity and load cases are given. The different design approaches used in well design is also explained and compared to get a full overview of how reliability based design differs from other design approaches...|$|R

40|$|AbstractResistivity logging through casing {{is a kind}} {{of logging}} {{technique}} obtaining formation resistivity by measuring casing potential and current.

Simulation results have lamination ability for formation of different thickness and the approximate degree between apparent and real formation resistivity decreases as the formation thickness decreases. According to actual measuring limitation, numerical simulation is realized again under approximate conditions. The latter simulation results have the similar lamination ability with the former.

In this paper, based on the borehole condition and field operation data of this well, the borehole pressure field variation initiated by lost circulation in the low-pressure formation was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} dynamics, then, the variation pattern of differential pressure inside and outside the well bore at different time intervals was depicted, and the primary cause of such complication was theoretically revealed, i. e., the pressure wave generated by instant lost circulation in low-pressure formation would result in redistribution of pressure inside the downhole confined space, and then the crush of casing in the vicinity of local low-pressure areas. Pertinent proposals for avoiding these kinds of engineering complexities were put forward: ① when downhole sealing casing operation is conducted in open hole completion, liner completion or perforated hole, the potential damage of lost circulation to casing should be considered; ② the downhole sealing point and sealing mode should be selected cautiously: the sealing point had better be selected in the section with good cementing quality or as close to the casing shoe as possible, and the sealing mode can be either cement plug or mechanical bridge plug.

40|$|In the Ocean Drilling Program's only foray to {{an active}} {{seafloor}} hydrothermal system hosted by felsic volcanic rocks at a convergent plate margin, deep penetrations were achieved at two contrasted sites within the PACMANUS field (Manus backarc basin, Papua New Guinea). Just 1. 0 km apart, these sites are characterized, respectively, by diffuse low-temperature venting at the seabed (Site 1188, Snowcap site; 1650 meters {{below sea level}} [mbsl]) and focused high-temperature venting (Site 1189, Roman Ruins; 1700 mbsl). Shallow holes at a background location remote from known hydrothermal activity (Site 1190) and at a second high-temperature chimney field (Site 1191, Satanic Mills) failed to drill beyond unaltered felsic lavas which at Sites 1188 and 1189 form an impervious cap (as thick as 35 m) to an underlying, pervasively altered lava sequence with occasional volcaniclastic horizons. To the maximum depth drilled (387 meters below seafloor [mbsf]), alteration assemblages are characterized by clay minerals and ubiquitous disseminated pyrite. Hydrothermal K-feldspar at Site 1189 differentiates it from Site 1188 where, by contrast, several intervals of pyrophyllite-bearing acid sulfate alteration suggest input from magmatic volatiles. At both deeply penetrated sites the dominant silica phase in alteration assemblages changes downhole from opal-A at the transition from overlying unaltered lava to cristobalite and then to quartz.

40|$|Turbo-compressors play {{a crucial}} role in the {{operation}} of air-breathing engines and special attention is given to the compressor’s ability to withstand adverse operating conditions. Various methods have been devised in order to enhance compressor stability and increase compressor stall margin, usually with some sacrifice of performance and efficiency. Active methods make use of external devices injecting and/or bleeding air from the compressor duct. Passive methods are primarily <b>based</b> on <b>casing</b> treatments, often involving flow paths into the rotor casing, to affect the behavior of the flow in favorable ways. In either case, it is desirable that the stability enhancing method be as simple as possible and that it keep performance and/or efficiency degradation to a minimum. The present work consists of a CFD analysis performed to evaluate the impact of a novel form of passive stability control on the operation of an axial flow fan stage. The casing treatment consists of “studs,” which are solid structures protruding from the casing into the duct. These structures are located slightly downstream of the fan rotor trailing edge. The stage that is studied in this investigation is the NASA SDT 2 R 4 transonic turbofan. The simulation software used is “Tenasi,” an in-house developed flow solver. Various simulations were conducted of the turbofan operation with and without casing treatment. Measures of performance and efficiency of the turbofan stage with no casing treatment were computed, and the results showed good agreement with available experimental data. The computed results from simulation with casing treatment suggest that protruding studs have the potential to improve the stability of the turbofan. The computed stall margin increase using an initial configuration of protruding studs is about 5. 4 % in terms of mass flow rate, with a decrease in efficiency of about 1. 6 %. The flow-field was investigated through visualizations of flow features in order to understand the mechanisms of flow instabilities and stability enhancement.

30|$|With the {{widespread}} drilling of gas wells in Marcellus shale, there are high potentials for wellbore instability problems when wells {{are located in}} longwall mining areas, which in many areas such as southwest Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and eastern Ohio are being used for extraction of the coal seam overlaying the gas reserves. The ground deformation, caused by coal mining, could generate large horizontal displacement and complex stress change in subsurface rock. This in turn triggers ground movement which can cause casing failure, and thus interruption {{in the operation of}} the well that raises safety and environmental concerns. This could result in shutting down the well for repair, or permanent abandonment. Thus, it is critical to characterize the parameters related to the longwall mining process and to propose a general casing design guideline in such areas.

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} predict the {{durability}} of engineering components and improve performance, it is mandatory to understand residual stresses. The last decade has witnessed a significant increase of residual stress evaluation using diffraction of penetrating radiation, such as neutrons or high energy X-rays. They provide a powerful non-destructive method for determining the level of residual stresses in engineering components through precise characterisation of interplanar crystal lattice spacing. The unique non-destructive nature of these measurement techniques is particularly beneficial {{in the context of}} engineering design, since it allows the evaluation of a variety of structural and deformational parameters inside real components without material removal, or at worst with minimal interference. However, while most real engineering components have complex shape and are often large in size, leading to measurement and interpretation difficulties, since experimental facilities usually have limited space for mounting the sample, limited sample travel range, limited loading capacity of the sample positioning system, etc. Consequently, samples often have to be sectioned, requiring appropriate corrections on measured data; or facilities must be improved. Our research group has contributed to the development of engineering applications of high-energy X-ray diffraction methods for residual stress evaluation, both at synchrotron sources and in the lab setting, including multiple detector setup, large engineering component manipulation and measurement at the UK Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS Daresbury), and in our lab at Oxford.

The material used in this study is the FV 535 martensitic stainless steel, {{which is one of the}} most commonly used materials for turbine <b>casings.</b> <b>Based</b> on material test data, a Modified Johnson‐Cook (MJC) model was calibrated for numerical simulations using the LS‐DYNA explicit finite element code (see Figure 1).

Two fixed meshes with 64 and 128 elements over the 2 mm thick plate and one mesh with 32 elements over the thickness with adaptive remeshing were used in the simulations. The formation of adiabatic shear bands in the perforation process has been found critical in order to achieve good results. Adiabatic shear bands are formed by the temperature rise due to the accumulation of plastic strain during impact (see Figure 2).

40|$|This thesis has {{proposed}} a slender well concept for exploration drilling with 15000 psi pressure rating based on enabling technologies. The main findings relates {{to the use of}} expandable liner hangers to reduce the required radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. Finite element analysis of the liner hanger expansion is performed in Ansys Workbench, a platform for advanced engineering simulations. The background for the thesis relates to the high cost of constructing offshore wells. There is a potential for considerable cost reduction by starting the well with a substantially smaller diameter, without compromising the final pipe size across the zone of interest. The topic builds on ongoing research in SBBU – Centre for drilling and wells for improved recovery, a joint project between NTNU, Sintef, University in Stavanger and IRIS. The slender well concept renders the possibility to use modified 3 rd or 4 th generation semi-submersible rigs. These rigs have significantly lower day-rates compared to new 5 th and 6 th generation rigs. Cost reduction is also expected with respect to consumption of steel for casing, drilling fluids and cement. Additional savings in steel is obtained by <b>basing</b> the <b>casing</b> program mainly on liners. The expandable liner hanger of choice is based on the XPak liner hanger developed by TIW. Finite element analysis indicated that a pressure rating of 15000 psi is feasible with the proposed liner hanger system. To avoid reduction in burst and collapse rating, the expansion mandrel is retained in the liner hanger after expansion. The mandrel is designed such that it creates an internal flush design with the liner string. It is recommended to use metal-to-metal sealing to avoid communication around the liner top. The slender well is constructed with limited radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. The problem of high surge pressures during running in hole is overcome by introducing a surge protection system with an artificial inner annulus to displace drilling fluids. The concept of pre-installing a liner string in the surface casing is introduced to render the possibility of an additional casing section and reduction in riser ID. The concept is untested and further evaluation is recommended. For further work on the topic proper field testing is recommended to validate the reliability of the concept. An assessment of slender well production drilling is also recommended to fully exploit the potential in slender well design. More detailed analysis and testing is necessary to qualify the expandable liner hanger for 15000 psi. </p...|$|R

At the same time the high temperature polymer membranes, when operating in the range 160 to 200 degrees C, are very forgiving regarding CO content in the reformate, end this fact makes it possible to design and build a much simpler and cheaper reformer than I the cast for a conventional low temp PEM fuel cell system. However, until now very few robust designs have seen daylight, and the power density of HT PEM fuel cells has been very low. Metacon has developed a novel design, made to provide very high reliability and long life, at the same time as giving high power density. This novel design is founded in the understanding of the real operating conditions of such a fuel cell. It is easy to see that the conditions of a HT PEM fuel cell are very similar to those of an engine for a modern personal car: The temperature is cycled between ambient temperature and around 200 deg C, there are also pressure changes and stresses due to thermal expansion and temperature gradients during start- up and stop.

However, casing partially substituted with bark or coir retained less water under applied suction (matric potential - 15 kPa), and resulted in a lower mushroom yield than peat + SBL casing. By contrast, casing substituted with 25 % (v/v) CT retained less water than non-amended peat + SBL near saturation, but the effect of partial substitution on water retention under applied suction was either small or not significant. Partial substitution with CT did not affect mushroom yield. These results indicate that water retention near saturation and under applied suction, i. e. desorption curve characteristics, are important in determining the suitability of a casing for mushroom cropping.

40|$|Steel casing {{corrosion}} {{analysis is}} pivotal in well integrity evaluation for ensuring environment-friendly and efficient hydrocarbon production and for well abandonment {{at the end}} of the productive life of the well. Due to their sensitivity to metal loss and depth of investigation, low frequency electromagnetics (EM) based corrosion measurements have long been considered as viable non-destructive diagnostic means. For nested multi-casing evaluation, the quantitative data inversion and analysis requires a thorough understanding and modeling of the underlying measurement physics. We propose a model-based parametric inversion methodology for quantitative evaluation of multiple nested casings using multi-spacing and multi-frequency induction measurements, to determine effective thicknesses of individual pipes and take into account variations in casing conductivity and permeabilities. Axi-symmetric finite-element forward modeling is used in the inversion loop to match the tool responses allowing us to include the sensor details in the model. The presence of casing collars and ubiquitous eccentering of individual casings affects the tool responses and reduce the effectiveness of elementary interpretation schemes (often based on remote field eddy current concept and aimed primarily at providing the total metal loss). To quantify the effect of casing and measurement tool eccentering, we performed comprehensive 3 - D finite-element modeling. The sensitivity and data resolution analysis is used to evaluate individual measurement importance and optimize the inversion based methodology. The workflow is capable of handling arbitrary number of nested casings and raises a QC flag for eccentered <b>casings</b> <b>based</b> on the reconstruction quality of short spacing measurements. Model covariance matrix from the inversion is used to quantify the inverted parameter uncertainty while the extended data resolution matrix concept is applied to extract information about the measurement channel reconstruction. The proposed methodology has been successfully validated on synthetic data and lab measurements...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{durability}} of engineering components and improve performance, it is mandatory to understand residual stresses. The last decade has witnessed a significant increase of residual stress evaluation using diffraction of penetrating radiation, such as neutrons or high energy X-rays. They provide a powerful non-destructive method for determining the level of residual stresses in engineering components through precise characterisation of interplanar crystal lattice spacing. The unique non-destructive nature of these measurement techniques is particularly beneficial {{in the context of}} engineering design, since it allows the evaluation of a variety of structural and deformational parameters inside real components without material removal, or at worst with minimal interference. However, while most real engineering components have complex shape and are often large in size, leading to measurement and interpretation difficulties, since experimental facilities usually have limited space for mounting the sample, limited sample travel range, limited loading capacity of the sample positioning system, etc. Consequently, samples often have to be sectioned, requiring appropriate corrections on measured data; or facilities must be improved. Our research group has contributed to the development of engineering applications of high-energy X-ray diffraction methods for residual stress evaluation, both at synchrotron sources and in the lab setting, including multiple detector setup, large engineering component manipulation and measurement at the UK Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS Daresbury), and in our lab at Oxford.

40|$|International audienceResistivity imaging {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in most {{geothermal exploration}} programs, and particularly in volcanic environment. It is assumed that resistivity variations allow imaging the caprock, but also hydrothermal weathering or preferential water flow. The geothermal fluid is generally brine water which drastically decreases the electrical resistivity and the temperature increase also decreases resistivity. The resistivity signatures for several conceptual geothermal reservoirs {{can be found in}} the literature. Magneto-telluric (MT) is generally used to image resistivity variations down-to a relevant investigation depth of several kilometers. Based on natural source signal, MT prospection efficiency depends on the Sun activity during the survey but moreover depends on the noise conditions. In many cases, because industrial activities have been developed close to the geothermal resource, the noise conditions make it difficult to obtain reliable MT tensors and hence a good resistivity image. Generally, the only way to counter is recording longer time series, to apply robust noise filtering and combining with a remote filtering. The noise issue in MT prospection is even more drastic in Island context. We investigated the substitution of controlled-source EM instead of MT measurements close to urbanized area. The distance constraints to respect the far field conditions are so challenging that they are often logistically not possible. Indeed, when it is possible to measure the receiver stations far enough from the source, the distortion due to the controlled-source disappear. But when the conditions for applying standard processing of CSAMT are not fulfilled, it is necessary to consider the source effect to interpret properly the EM response. We have studied and performed EM imaging in the near field, using a pair of pre-existing boreholes to inject high current into the ground through metallic <b>casings.</b> <b>Based</b> on numerical modeling, we propose a methodology to obtain maps and section of apparent resistivity. The results obtained were confronted to previous geophysical campaign results performed in the 1980 's and recent shallow prospection. This measuring protocol was applied to prospect the Lamentin area (Martinique, Lesser Antilles, France). This survey was performed in 2013 within the framework of a large exploration program founded by the FEDER, ADEME, Regional Council and SMEM designed to explore the geothermal potential of Martinique...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} presents improved {{techniques to}} simulate gearbox vibrations due to faults in gears and bearings. Lumped parameter models (LPMs) {{are widely used}} to study the dynamic behaviour of mechanical systems such as gearboxes. However, LPMs contain limited information about flexible structures such as the casing. This results in poor spectral matching over a wide frequency range, and was found not to properly represent the modulation of gearmesh signals by extended bearing faults, this being affected by interaction with the casing dynamic properties. An alternative approach based on direct finite element analysis (FEA) is not usually viable as the model size and thus computing resource requirements become prohibitive. Hence an improved simulation model was developed by coupling the LPM of the internals (shafts, gears and bearings) with a reduced FE model of the <b>casing</b> <b>based</b> on the Craig-Bampton method of component mode synthesis (CMS) over the frequency range of interest. Prior to model reduction, the FE model of the casing was updated by correlating {{with the results of}} experimental modal analysis (EMA). The combined model was equally capable of simulating bearing faults in the UNSW parallel shaft spur gearbox. The responses due to bearing fault entry and exit were investigated, which can be used to predict the fault size  a vital parameter in bearing diagnostics and prognostics. Simulated results compared well with measurements. The combined model was further improved by making a reduced FE model of the internals, to create a full reduced model of the gearbox. A simplified transverse-torsional LPM was developed to simulate planet gear faults such as tooth cracks and spalls in the UNSW planetary gearbox. The effect of the two simultaneous meshes of the planet gear with the ring and sun gears was investigated since the contact with the two gears is on opposite flanks of each planet gear tooth. The simulated results correlated well with measurements and clearly differentiated the two types of faults with reduction in the stiffness due to a tooth crack visible in both contacts whereas a spall on one flank showed up only in one contact...|$|R
40|$|Natural sausage casings are {{produced}} from the intestines of various species {{and used as}} edible containers for {{many different types of}} sausage around the world. Casings must therefore be fit for human consumption and must meet all food safety and hygiene requirements that apply to food of animal origin. As a hazard analysis of sausages would either focus on the final product or on the meat batter inside the casing, it becomes clear that many studies were done on sausages and only a handful on casings. Salt has been in use for centuries as the main preservative agent of casings and a study was done to determine whether this technique can meet the current microbiological criteria. Results indicate that the antimicrobial properties of salt used for the preservation of casings are sufficient to reduce the bacterial contamination (except for Clostridium spores) well below acceptable levels at a water activity level of 0. 85 or lower during a 30 -day storage period. To prevent the outgrowth of bacterial spores, additional preservation measures should be implemented. In the experiments described the use of the bacteriocin nisin was evaluated to reduce outgrowth of spores in desalinated casings. Additionally, the binding of nisin to casings, using 14 C-labeled nisin Z and subsequent bioavailability of nisin were evaluated. Results demonstrate that nisin is bound to casings but if sufficient nisin was present the outgrowth of Clostridium spores in this model was reduced. Neural and lymphoid tissue can be regarded as marker tissues for the potential presence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) disease-specific prion protein (PrPPScP). These tissue types can also be present in cleaned beef <b>casings.</b> <b>Based</b> on the results from a quantitative histological analysis it was calculated that a standard 200 g sausage produced in beef casings contains 0. 09 g lymphoid and 0. 02 g neural tissue originating from the casing. Using these quantitative histological results a BSE infectivity risk - consumer exposure assessment was made, indicating that the potential risk when consuming a sausage produced in beef casings is far less than consuming a T-bone steak from the same animal. Casings {{are produced}} and shipped {{all over the world and}} this trans-global movement of casings means that restrictive measures, implemented to prevent the spread of contagious animal diseases, are also applicable. Two studies describe the efficacy of FMD and CSF virus inactivation in cleaned casings, either by salt (NaCl) or by using phosphate supplemented salt. After storage at about 20 C for 30 days, no remaining FMDV infectivity was found after either treatment, whereas casings stored at 4 oC still contained infectivity. CSFV infectivity was no longer present after treatment with phosphate supplemented salt and storage for 30 days at either 4 oC or 20 oC. To verify that phosphate supplemented salt was used, a commercially available phosphate assay kit was validated for the qualitative determination of phosphate present in treated casings without interference of naturally occurring phosphate in salt used for brines in which casings are preserved...|$|R
