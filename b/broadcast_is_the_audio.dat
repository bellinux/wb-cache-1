40|$|In this paper, two level discriminative {{learning}} for audio events recognition in sport <b>broadcasts</b> archive <b>is</b> described. <b>The</b> <b>audio</b> events recognition <b>is</b> based on <b>the</b> idea that <b>audio</b> events {{are composed of}} basic units. Basic units are some elementary events. Audio events used for semantic interpretation (mid-level concepts) are presented as {{a combination of the}} basic units. Models for <b>the</b> basic units <b>are</b> GMM models. Each 5 frames of audio data are recognized using models of the basic units. Each mid-level concept <b>is</b> described by <b>the</b> distribution of the basic units. The distribution of the basic units in each class of segment corresponding to mid-level concepts is considered as a macro model of this class. For events recognition the tree based framework is used. In each level of the tree two macro models <b>are</b> compared. <b>The</b> two level discriminative {{learning for}} macro models is applied. First discriminative training level <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> level of basic units, second <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> level of macro models. <b>The</b> suggested approach <b>is</b> compared with maximum likelihood decision and SVM with polynomial kernel. The results of experiments indicate significant improvement in comparison with the conventional approaches in the task of acoustically closely audio events recognition...|$|R
