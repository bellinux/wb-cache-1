5|$|A Byzantine revival {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{occurred in the}} 19th and 20th centuries. An early example of the revival style in Russia was the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (1839–84), which {{was approved by the}} Tsar to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> other churches in the empire. The style's popularity spread through scholarly publications produced after the independence of Greece and the Balkans from the Ottoman Empire. It was used throughout Europe and North America, peaking in popularity between 1890 and 1914. The Greek Orthodox St Sophia's Cathedral (1877–79) and Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral (begun 1895), both in London, are examples. The throne room of Neuschwanstein Castle (1885–86) was built by King Ludwig II in Bavaria. In the late 19th century, the Hagia Sophia became a widespread model for Greek Orthodox churches. In southeastern Europe, monumental national cathedrals built in the capital cities of formerly Ottoman areas used Neo-Classical or Neo-Byzantine styles. Sofia's Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and Belgrade's Church of Saint Sava are examples, and used Hagia Sophia as a model due to their large sizes. Synagogues in the United States were built in a variety of styles, as they had been in Europe (and often with a mixture of elements from different styles), but the Byzantine Revival style was the most popular in the 1920s. Domed examples include The Temple of Cleveland (1924), the synagogue of KAM Isaiah Israel (1924) in Chicago, based upon San Vitale in Ravenna and Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, and the synagogue of Congregation Emanu-El (1926) in San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the colonial}} era, South Carolina's {{politicians}} {{had dreamed of}} an inland waterway system that would not only aid commerce, but also control flooding. By the 1930s, Byrnes took up the cause for a massive dam-building project, Santee Cooper, that would not only accomplish those tasks but also electrify the entire state with hydroelectric power. With South Carolina financially strapped by the Great Depression, Senator Byrnes {{managed to get the}} federal government to authorize a loan for the entire project, which was completed and put into operation in February 1942. The loan was later paid back to the federal government with full interest and at no cost to South Carolina taxpayers. Santee Cooper has continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> public-owned electrical utilities worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, John Big Tree, a Seneca, {{claimed to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> Fraser's coin, and made many public {{appearances}} as the [...] "nickel Indian" [...] until his 1967 {{death at the}} age of 92 (though he sometimes alleged he was over 100years of age). Big Tree was identified as the model for the nickel in wire service reports about his death, and he had appeared in that capacity at the Texas Numismatic Association convention in 1966. [...] After Big Tree's death, the Mint stated that he most likely was not one of the models for the nickel. There have been other claimants: in 1964, Montana Senator Mike Mansfield wrote to Mint Director Eva B. Adams, enquiring if Sam Resurrection, a Choctaw was a model for the nickel. Adams wrote in reply, [...] "According to our records, the portrait is a composite. There have been many claimants for this honor, all of whom are undoubtedly sincere in the belief that theirs is the one that adorns the nickel." ...|$|E

500|$|The Bulldog Drummond {{stories of}} H. C. McNeile follow Captain Hugh [...] "Bulldog" [...] Drummond, DSO, MC. Drummond {{is a member}} of [...] "the Breed", a class of Englishman who were patriotic, loyal and [...] "physically and morally intrepid". Drummond is a wealthy gentleman, {{formerly}} an officer in the fictional [...] "Royal Loamshire Regiment", who, after the First World War, spends his new-found leisure time looking for adventure. McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel Bull-dog Drummond, which was a thriller. The character was an amalgam of McNeile's friend Gerard Fairlie, and his idea of an English gentleman, although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie's claim to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the character, noting that [...] "he was still at school when Sapper created his... hero". Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{claimed that}} Chapman {{was not a}} subtle captain and lacked {{tactical}} astuteness. Even so, his record is better than most others who led England during Chapman's career. Pelham Warner believed that Chapman started well, but that in the later stages of 1930, his tactical sense markedly deteriorated. On the other hand, several of Chapman's contemporaries believed him {{to be one of}} the best captains. Arthur Gilligan, one of Chapman's predecessors, considered him to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the role, and Bert Oldfield, who played against Chapman as Australia's wicket-keeper, thought that Chapman possessed an [...] "aptitude" [...] for leadership. Chapman's teams were usually harmonious and his sympathetic handling of his players often brought out the best in them. Writing in 1943, Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "He knew his men as perhaps no other captain of modern times has known them." [...] Cricket writer E. W. Swanton believes that Chapman's cavalier reputation was misleading in assessing his effectiveness, and that [...] "underlying the boyish facade was both a shrewd cricket brain and the good sense to ask advice from those of greater experience." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1840, George Ripley {{announced}} to the Transcendental Club that {{he was planning to}} form a Utopian community. Brook Farm, as it would be called, was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment was meant to serve as an example {{for the rest of the}} world, based on the principles of [...] "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity". At Brook Farm, as in other communities, physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well-being and health. Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States throughout the 1840s, though it was the first to be secular. Ripley believed his experiment would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the rest of society. He predicted: [...] "If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star." [...] As more interested people began to take part in planning, Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.|$|E

The Peace Forest Project works with local communities to establish a linked constellation of community-based reserves, managed by local and indigenous people.

Albert Einstein (who was born six days after him) wrote that Hahn was [...] "one {{of the very few}} who stood upright and did the best he could in these years of evil". After World War II, Hahn became a passionate campaigner against the use of nuclear energy as a weapon. He served as the last President of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (KWG) in 1946 and as the founding President of the Max Planck Society (MPG) from 1948 to 1960.

Upon her {{appointment}} as foreign minister, she shortened [...] "Meyerson/Myerson" [...] to [...] "Meir", which means [...] "illuminate". As foreign minister, Meir promoted ties with the newly established states in Africa in an effort to gain allies in the international community. But she also believed that Israel had experience in nation-building that could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the Africans. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "Like them, we had shaken off foreign rule; like them, we had to learn for ourselves how to reclaim the land, how to increase the yields of our crops, how to irrigate, how to raise poultry, how to live together, and how to defend ourselves." [...] Israel could be a role model because it [...] "had been forced to find solutions to the kinds of problems that large, wealthy, powerful states had never encountered".|$|E
2500|$|The {{field was}} {{dramatically}} enlarged (and the coastline of the Potomac River altered) in April 1928 when Washington Airport contracted to receive {{tens of thousands}} of cubic yards of earth, dug during the construction of the Federal Triangle complex of buildings in the District of Columbia, and used them to fill in the sides and ends of the field. An airport office was also constructed at Military Road. The expansion and land reclamation increased the size of the airport six times, to [...] The airport's new size was so impressive that in March 1930 President Herbert Hoover proposed that the federal government loan the government of the District of Columbia $2.5 million to take over both Hoover Field and Washington Airport, fill in the Boundary Channel between the Virginia shoreline and Columbia Island, and create a new city-owned municipal airport that would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the nation.

2500|$|In December 2010 Alaskan {{state senator}} Scott Kawasaki {{proposed}} legislation creating the state's first law and medical schools, {{with the law}} school in Anchorage.

In reply, the University of Alaska System noted that [...] "adding graduate programs would require an analysis of student demand and the work force needed to staff" [...] a law school. On January 7, 2011 Kawasaki introduced Alaska House Bill (HB) 38, [...] "University Institutes Of Law And Medicine" [...] at the University of Alaska, to the 2011 legislative session. A day after the bill was introduced, it was opposed by legislators [...] "who question the cost and the need for Alaska to have the schools." [...] A commentator replied that due to the absence of an Alaskan law school, the Alaska Law Review had been published by the UCLA and Duke University Schools of Law. The Juneau Empire opposed an Alaska law school in a January 16 editorial, saying that [...] "the idea of creating Alaska's own JD factory should be quickly dismissed." [...] Asserting that Alaska has had little trouble attracting lawyers and the U.S. has too many attorneys (rather than Alaska having too few), the newspaper proposed: [...] "The seed money required to launch a law school could go to better use to endow scholarships for bright Alaskans to go outside for a fully funded legal education, in the same vein as the WWAMI program for Alaska's medical students. It could also be used to better fund district attorney's offices, Legal Aid, victims' compensation and public defenders programs."

2500|$|From {{the age of}} 9, Tull {{was brought}} up in the (Methodist) Children's Home and Orphanage (now known as Action for Children) in Bethnal Green, London, along with his brother, Edward, {{following}} the death of their parents. He joined Tottenham in the summer of 1909. His first senior games were in Argentina and Uruguay on the club's close season tour to South America. He made his home Football League debut against FA Cup holders, Manchester United, in front of over 30,000. His excellent form in this opening part of the season promised a great future. However, at a match away to Bristol City in October 1909 Tull was the target of vicious racist abuse. So incensed was the 'Football Star' reporter, DD, that his match report was headlined 'Football and the Colour Prejudice'. This is possibly the first time racial abuse was headlined in a football report. DD was keen to emphasis how Tull remained professional and composed despite the intense provocation. 'He is Hotspur's most brainy forward ... so clean in mind and method as to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> all white men who play football ... Tull was the best forward on the field'. However, soon after he was soon dropped from the first team and found it difficult to get a sustained run back in the side in which he started so well. He played most of his subsequent games for the reserves and was eventually transferred to Herbert Chapman's Northampton Town in 1911, where he made 111first-team appearances. Interestingly, Chapman – also a Methodist – was a former Spurs player and had played as a young man with Arthur Wharton at Stalybridge Rovers. He went on to manage both Huddersfield Town and Arsenal to FA Cup wins and League championships and is recognised {{as one of the great}} managers in the history of the Football League.|$|E
