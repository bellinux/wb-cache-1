Since some Nikon bellows allow for a front rise, they allow a limited variety of lenses to be used similarly to a PC lens (see Optical design above).|$|E

Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of muscle relaxants during anesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyze the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon, but also paralyze the respiratory musclesIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples, the latter using an automotive wiper motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs. [...] Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anesthetics such as ether and cyclopropane. In 1952, Roger Manley of the Westminster Hospital, London, {{developed a}} ventilator which was entirely gas driven, and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power, and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, who manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted <b>bellows</b> <b>unit,</b> which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.|$|E

To evaluate the longterm performance of insulators, properties such as hydrophobicity, surface roughness, and chemical composition are often studied. In this paper, evaluation of hydrophobicity based on the Dynamic Dropping Test (DDT) method is proposed. Using a high-speed camera (Vision Research Phantom v 1610) with 65 mm f/ 4. 5 Macro-Nikkor lens and Nikon PB- 6 <b>bellows</b> <b>unit,</b> which is fixed in a level 45 ° to the specimen surface, the full sequence of the water droplet making contact with the composite surface was recorded and analyzed. The DDT was performed on specimens of different ageing levels. Further investigation on hydrophobicity using the optical contact angle device (OCAH 200) is performed to study the relationship between DDT over the surface and the contact angle. Our results show that more time is needed for the water droplet to settle over the surface when the hydrophobicity is decreased due to aging. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images showing the level of degradation on the surface of the specimens are included. The results obtained in this work indicate that the DDT method is sensitive to the hydrophobic properties, which can be applied as a new method for hydrophobicity evaluation of polymeric insulators...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{details the}} design {{implications}} of a site strain gauge test carried out on the 6 ft 6 in diameter reactor outlet ducting of a nuclear power station. The test subjected {{a portion of the}} ducting to a horizontal load of 10 ton, and the strain gauge survey was taken on a smooth bend of the ducting which was inherently flexible and did not incorporate the usual <b>bellows</b> <b>units</b> to absorb thermal expansions. Theoretical stresses in the bend of the test portion were calculated under the horizontal load, and comparison made between experimental and theoretical values. At the design stage of the station a detailed analysis was carried out for the complete system under thermal expansions, and this analysis is briefly described. Using the comparison obtained from the test portion, an estimate is made of the probable stress levels that will exist in the complete duct system under reactor operating conditions. During fabrication of the smooth bends a dimensional survey was carried out on a complete component, and the tolerances achieved are discussed and compared with tolerances obtained on the more usual smaller diameter welding elbow. The effect of end restraints on the flexibility of smooth bends is also discussed, and the lack of design information on this aspect is emphasized. It is concluded that the stresses in the bends may be accurately predicted, but a larger error is likely to occur in the prediction of end reactions and the stresses induced in vessels subjected to these reactions...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{potential}} distributions in ultra-thin (0. 8 - 3. 9 nm) LaAlO 3 layers {{deposited on}} SrTiO 3 substrates are studied. It is {{found that the}} potential distribution evolves from island-like to a homogeneous one with increasing LaAlO 3 thickness. It is suggested that the observed islands are caused by a locally enhanced concentration of {{mobile charge carriers at}} the interface that is, in turn, related to non-stoichiometry of the layers with thickness <b>bellow</b> 4 <b>unit</b> cells. Transition to a homogeneous potential distribution with increasing LAO thickness (≥ 4 unit cells) corresponds to the formation of a quasi- 2 -dimensional electron gas. The results agree with a percolation model explaining the insulator-to-metal transition that occurs at the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 heterointerface...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the breakup}} of the former Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the 18 class members, and the TEŽ itself, were owned and {{operated}} by the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD). In service, their well proven three section articulated configuration allowed successful operation on the TEŽ's tight radius curves. Additionally, their all axle drive system enabled rapid acceleration and good traction, especially on uphill sections. On the other hand, the class did suffer from occasional derailments, leading to service interruptions. There were also problems with torn coupling <b>bellows</b> between the <b>units,</b> and the rubber insulating roof mats. In July 1981, due to delays in the delivery of replacements for worn tyres, all but four of the units had to be temporarily taken out of service, and replaced by road buses.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe first {{successful}} {{application of the}} high precision pneumatic loading system for advanced material testing was developed at VTT in 1995. The pneumatic servo-controlled loading system is capable of operating {{in a range of}} extreme conditions such as high temperature, pressurised water or steam, Super Critical Water (SCW) and irradiation environments. The main benefit of the pneumatic loading system {{is that there is no}} moving parts (loading lead-throughs) required for loading a specimen inside a pressure vessel or otherwise demanding containment (water, gas, radioactive), only pressure lines and electrical feedback connections together with the pneumatic loading <b>unit,</b> <b>bellows</b> are required. Also, the pneumatically powered testing device itself can be far away from the control units and regulating servo valves. The HIPS, previously used for tensile testing, stress corrosion cracking, fatigue, in-pile creep fatigue (copper), and other test variants with combined environmental impact, has now been modified to perform load and strain controlled testing at temperatures in the creep range for steels. For the high temperature applications where creep is an active damage mechanism, the HIPS technology opens new applications for creep and fatigue related testing types such as standard creep-fatigue (with and without hold time), relaxation and slow strain rate tensile testing. The main focus of this paper is to present the current status of the development work of the HIPS technology for high temperature applications, presently conducted in air atmosphere. Also some initial creep-fatigue results and creep-fatigue behavior comparisons are presented for some austenitic stainless steels (316 L, 347 H, 321) ...|$|R
