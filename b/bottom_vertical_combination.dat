5000|$|Arom Simha {{proceeds}} to note [...] "We have already remarked that specific <b>vertical</b> <b>combinations</b> in each formula act as temporal reference points {{by virtue of}} their regular repetition at a given position in the periodic cycle. These combinations are the points at which several superposed melodic lines meet. They are usually based on octaves, fifths, and fourths, precisely the intervals which make up sections 1-4 of Chailley's resonance table (i960: 35), and this is certainly no accident. We may therefore assume that they take on a structural function." [...] These <b>vertical</b> <b>combinations</b> that constitute reference points are chords that, together, form a chord progression. This is similar to the concepts of chords and progressions in cyclical forms in Jazz, Blues and other musics of the African diaspora.|$|R

40|$|The {{simulation}} of deformable objects {{is one of}} the classical disciplines in computer graphics. The main focus of development is the facial animation, the {{simulation of}} clothes, hair, fluids and aeriform objects like clouds and smoke. In addition to these procedures many simulation algorithms for medical applications have been created. The methods can simulate different deformation characteristics and various body structures. Especially in real-time simulation procedures, special objects characteristics like edges and bends are not preserved during the simulation calculation. The simulation of detailed objects is a problem, too. To solve these actual problems the combined simulation procedures are developed. By the combination of different methods diverse deformation characteristics of one object can be simulated. There are three types of combination: - The <b>vertical</b> <b>combination</b> - The horizontal combination - The intern combination Simulation procedures linked with the <b>vertical</b> <b>combination</b> method are relatively autonomous. The used procedures need no special adaptation. The communication between the procedures occurs by the force vectors, by the simulation model or by boundary conditions. To realize the <b>vertical</b> <b>combination</b> two kinematically based simulation procedures for a cable simulation have been developed. The <b>vertical</b> <b>combination</b> does not work in all application areas. The introduction of the horizontal combination provides an expansion of the combination method usability. Here the simulation procedures are more closely linked. The fundamental attribute of this combination is: Procedure i+ 1 controls and affects the simulation results of the procedure i. Thereby special object characteristics like edges or bends can be preserved during the simulation. The principle of the horizontal combination was realized in a simulation procedure for light induced plant movement. The vertical and the horizontal combination can be arranged by an normal user, but the internal combination can not. Here a programmer is required, because significant adaptations in the simulation procedures are needed. The internal combination always produces new simulation methods. An example is the Abalone-Interpolation which is a method for the visual interpolation of flow based datasets. It is used for the calculation of clouds movement based on few meteorological datasets...|$|R
