500|$|During Roy's {{wrong way}} run, Georgia Tech's coach Bill Alexander {{said to his}} excited players who were {{jumping up and down}} near the Tech bench: [...] "Sit down. Sit down. He's just running the wrong way. Every step he takes is to our advantage" [...] Broadcaster Graham McNamee, who was calling the game on the radio, said during Roy's wrong way run: [...] "What am I seeing? What's wrong with me? Am I crazy? Am I crazy? Am I crazy?" [...] After the play, Riegels was so distraught that he had to be talked into {{returning}} to the game by coach Nibs Price for the second half. Roy said [...] "Coach, I can't do it. I've ruined you, I've ruined myself, I've ruined the University of California. I couldn't face that crowd to save my life." [...] Coach Price responded by saying [...] "Roy, get up and go <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> — the game is only half over." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and I respect her. I {{understand}} that she’s going {{in the same direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E

2500|$|On January 19, 2007, Hovind {{was sentenced}} to ten years in prison with three years {{probation}} and ordered to pay the federal government restitution of over $600,000. During the sentencing phase, a tearful Hovind, hoping to avoid prison, told the court, [...] "If it's just money the IRS wants, {{there are thousands of}} people out there who will help pay the money they want so I can go <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and preach." [...] However, Hovind's court room behavior was in stark contrast to phone calls he made while in jail and played by the prosecution. The tapes, posted online by the Pensacola News Journal, included one conversation with Hovind and Eric Hovind, who were planning to hide a motor vehicle title and property deeds to prevent the government from collecting the property to pay for owed debt. At sentencing, he denied being a [...] "tax protester", but the prosecution, an IRS spokesman, and the Pensacola News Journal used the term to describe him.|$|E

60|$|Lord Castlewell {{was puzzled}} in the extreme. If the lady lost {{her voice and}} so became penniless and without a profession; and if he in such case were to throw her over, and leave her unmarried, what would the world say of him? Would it be {{possible}} then {{to make the world}} understand that he had deserted her, not on account of her illness, but because she had not liked to hear her father called an ass. And had not Rachel already begun the battle in a manner intended to show that she meant to be the victor? Could it be possible that she herself was desirous of <b>backing</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> was no knowing the extent of the impudence to which these Americans would not go! No doubt she had, by the use of intemperate language on the occasion when she would not be driven out in the carriage, given him ample cause for a breach. To tell the truth, he had thought then that a breach would be expedient. But she had fallen ill, and it was incumbent on him to be tender and gentle. Then, from her very sick bed, she had sent him this impudent message.|$|R

50|$|Historically, Rescorla {{along with}} other Cornish villages {{including}} Molinnis, Roche, Withiel and St Wenn, continued a custom called “Snail Creep”. This is a dance unique {{to this part of}} Cornwall and involves a long procession of couples following a band, led by two people holding up branches - the eye-stalks of the snail. The dancers form a large circle and then spiral into the middle and <b>back</b> <b>out</b> again. <b>There</b> are references to it in 19th Century antiquarian journals and its origins {{can be traced back to}} medieval dance. The Molinnis Fife and Drum Band provided the accompaniment for Rescorla’s Snail Creep celebrations when they were last performed over sixty years ago.|$|R
5000|$|Kevin Harvick was {{the fastest}} {{in the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 28.834 and a speed of 132.094 mph. In the closing minutes of the session, Clint Bowyer collided with Jeff Gordon just as Gordon was <b>backing</b> <b>out</b> of his garage stall. “You can’t see out of the pit stall,” Bowyer told Motorsport.com. “He just came out and I was a comin’. That poor ol’ boy that was <b>backing</b> him <b>out,</b> I bet he feels like (crap). But you know, it’s a wonder it don’t happen more often. To be honest with you, I was pulling out of my stall, I went to come <b>back</b> <b>out</b> and the guy never moved. I was like, ‘whoa, whoa, whoa.’ But it’s so tight in here. You hate to see that, but damn, especially with the 24 (laughs) and everything we have going on. It didn’t seem to hurt our car too bad. It hurt his bad — it hit in a bad spot. But that’s why we have guys that back us up.” “Hopefully all this hard work and stuff we’re going through will pay off tomorrow," [...] said Gordon, who will start 23rd. [...] "We’ve got a pit cart over there that kind of blocks what you can see of the back of my car <b>backing</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> The guy that <b>backs</b> me <b>out</b> looked over, guess he was just starting to back me out; and I crept <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and he cleared me, but the No. 15 (Bowyer), probably couldn’t really see me because of that pit cart and I don’t know if he kind of glanced away or what, but when he looked back, I was just right there and couldn’t go anywhere. Its kind of a combination of, I guess, both of us could take fault in that. But our team did an amazing job of fixing quite a bit of damage (to the right rear). I love seeing my crew chief (Alan Gustafson) get in there and get dirty, but not for that reason. And, that practice went a little bit better than the other one. So, we’re gaining on it. I don’t want to say it can’t get worse, but I know it can. So, I’m not going to say that. But hopefully this will all pay off for us tomorrow.” ...|$|R

2500|$|If {{the load}} is purely reactive, then the {{voltage and current}} are 90degrees out of phase. For two {{quarters}} of each cycle, the product of voltage and current is positive, but for the other two quarters, the product is negative, indicating that on average, exactly as much energy flows into the load as flows <b>back</b> <b>out.</b> [...] <b>There</b> is no net energy flow over each half cycle. In this case, only reactive power flows: There is no net transfer of energy to the load, however, electrical power does flow along the wires and returns by flowing in reverse along the same wires. During its travels both from the power source to the reactive load {{and back to the}} power source, this purely reactive power flow loses energy in the line resistance.|$|R

There did remain the truth of our friend's striking development, to which I had called her attention. Regretting my rashness didn't make the prodigy less. [...] "You'll lead me to believe, if you <b>back</b> <b>out,</b> that <b>there's</b> suddenly someone you want to protect.

At a distance the bay and the grove of eucalyptus-trees, the green-and-gold slopes, look as they always looked. Avalon has a singular charm outside of its sport of fishing. It is the most delightful and comfortable place I ever visited. The nights are cool. You sleep under blankets even when over in Los Angeles people are suffocating with the heat. At dawn the hills are obscured in fog and sometimes this fog is chilly. But early or late in the morning it breaks up and rolls away. The sun shines.
