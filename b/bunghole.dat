25|$|Detail {{notes from}} {{visitors}} to the Constantia estate in the 18th century give evidence of the Dutch influence on South African winemaking. As they did for the French centuries earlier, the Dutch introduced the technique of adding sulphur to halt fermentation before all the residual sugar has been completely converted into alcohol. This allowed the wine to maintain its sweetness without increasing the alcohol level, similar to adding brandy {{in the production of}} fortified sweet wines; another technique pioneered by the Dutch. To {{keep an eye on the}} ongoing process of fermentation, Cape winemakers would listen near the <b>bunghole</b> of the wine barrel for noise and irritation in the barrel, described as sounding like the barrel was full of crabs. When the barrel was completely quiet and no longer making crab-like noises the wine would finally be racked for clarification and stabilization.|$|E
60|$|The sparrow said nothing, but crept {{under the}} cover of the waggon and pecked so long at the <b>bunghole</b> of one of the barrels that at last she got the cork away, and all the wine ran out without the carter's noticing it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bungholes</b> {{were first}} used on wooden barrels, and were {{typically}} bored by the purchaser {{of the barrel}} using a brace and bit. <b>Bungholes</b> can be bored in either head (end) of a barrel or {{in one of the}} staves (side). With the bung removed, a tapered faucet can be attached to aid with dispensing. When barrels full of a commodity were shipped, the recipient would often bore new <b>bungholes</b> of the most suitable size and placement rather than remove the existing bung. Wooden barrels manufactured by specialty firms today usually are bored by the maker with suitable <b>bungholes,</b> since the hobbyists who purchase them for the making of beer, wine, and fermented foods often do not have a suitable brace and bit.|$|R

60|$|An {{incoming}} train clanked heavily {{above his}} head, coach after coach. Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The <b>bungholes</b> sprang {{open and a}} huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.|$|R

60|$|We {{examined}} the cask carefully. At the bottom was a <b>bunghole</b> {{in which a}} bung had been placed; but either the riding of the raft or the shock had loosened the bung, and it had dropped out and allowed the water to run away to the last drop.|$|E

40|$|When the warship Vasa {{was raised}} in 1961, wooden casks were found in nearly every area of the ship. Unfortunately, this {{important}} find category was not subject to detailed recording and study until now. This thesis explains the use and distribution of casks aboard Vasa, and their place in seventeenth-century northern European cooperage. Recording of individual cask attributes {{formed the basis for}} these subsequent analyses. This shows there were at least 145 casks of five main types aboard when the ship sank in 1628. The majority of casks were made of oak timber; the remainder of pine. The most common type of cask could hold between 117 and 146 liters and featured square <b>bungholes.</b> These casks contained salt meat, and likely beer. The dimensions of these casks conform to multiples of the Swedish foot, suggesting they were produced locally or at least according to Swedish specifications. Distribution of the containers shows a clear stowage plan, with the majority of provision casks in the hold and casks of personal possessions on the gundecks above. A study of period art reveals that casks with square <b>bungholes</b> were common across seventeenth-century northwestern Europe, but have hitherto been underrepresented archaeologically. This iconographic evidence also supports the contention that many of the oak casks held beer. The casks from Vasa remain an important tool for understanding shipboard organization and the naval supply process during the seventeenth century.   M. A...|$|R
5000|$|In early 1575, Paolo Gasparotto, a male benandante {{who lived}} in the village of Iassico (modern spelling: Giassìcco), gave a charm to a miller from Brazzano named Pietro Rotaro, in the hope of healing his son, who had fallen sick from some unknown illness. This event came to the {{attention}} of the local priest, Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza, who was intrigued by the use of such folk magic, and called Gasparotto to him to learn more. The benandante told the priest that the sick child had [...] "been possessed by witches" [...] but that he had been saved from certain death by the benandanti, or [...] "vagabonds" [...] as they were also known. He went on to reveal more about his benandanti brethren, relating that [...] "on Thursdays during the Ember Days of the year they were forced to go with these witches to many places, such as Cormons, in front of the church at Giassìcco, and even into the countryside around Verona," [...] where they [...] "fought, played, leaped about, and rode various animals", as well as taking part in an activity during which [...] "the women beat the men who were with them with sorghum stalks, while the men had only bunches of fennel." [...] Sometimes they go out to one country region and sometimes to another, perhaps to Gradisca or even as far away as Verona, and they appear together jousting and playing games; and ... the men and women who are the evil-doers carry and use the sorgham stalks which grow in the fields, and the men and women who are benandanti use fennel storks; and they go now one day and now another, but always on Thursdays, and ... when they make their great displays they go to the biggest farms, and they have days fixed for this; and when the warlocks and witches set out it is to do evil, and they must be pursued by the benandanti to thwart them, and also to stop them entering the houses, because if they do not find clear water in the pails they go into the cellars and spoil the wine with certain things, throwing filth in the <b>bungholes.</b> Sgabarizza's record of what Gasparotto informed him, 1575.|$|R

60|$|October 29th.--On {{a walk to}} Scott's pond, with Ellery Channing, {{we found}} a wild {{strawberry}} in the woods, not quite ripe, but beginning to redden. For a week or two, the cider-mills have been grinding apples. Immense heaps of apples lie piled near them, and the creaking of the press is heard as the horse treads on. Farmers are repairing cider-barrels; and the wayside brook is made to pour itself into the <b>bunghole</b> of a barrel, in order to cleanse it for the new cider.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey Day's {{storehouse}} at {{the back}} of his dwelling was hung with bunches of dried horehound, mint, and sage; brown-paper bags of thyme and lavender; and long ropes of clean onions. On shelves were spread large red and yellow apples, and choice selections of early potatoes for seed next year;--vulgar crowds of commoner kind lying beneath in heaps. A few empty beehives were clustered around a nail in one corner, under which stood two or three barrels of new cider of the first crop, each bubbling and squirting forth from the yet open <b>bunghole.</b>|$|E
60|$|One {{of these}} parties, Rollo found, {{had a very}} {{convenient}} way of getting ale to drink with their dinner. There was a row of barrels lying on the quay near where they had established themselves to dine; {{and two of the}} party went to one of these barrels, and, starting out the bung, they helped themselves to as much ale as they required. They got the ale out of the barrel by means of a long and narrow glass, with a string around the neck of it, and a very thick and heavy bottom. This glass they let down through the <b>bunghole</b> into the barrel, and then drew up the ale with it as you would draw up water with a bucket from a well.|$|E
60|$|The {{people who}} had Elizabeth's passage in charge {{conceived}} {{the idea that the}} safest way to get her on board the vessel, which was waiting at the dock, would be to ship her as freight. So she was put into a large hogshead, and securely fastened up, and then carried on board. She must have been a girl of a good deal of pluck, for the vessel was not to sail for several days, and she must remain in the hogshead all that time, as the officials of the port might come on board at any moment and discover her, if she should get out of her hiding place. I have no doubt that she was supplied with three or four meals a day through the <b>bunghole.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{might have}} been a very good thing if Elizabeth had {{concluded}} to end her voyage as she began it. If she had put her valuables into her hogshead, and then had jumped in herself and had asked some of the sailors to fasten her up, {{there is no doubt that}} she would have floated ashore, if she had known how to keep the open <b>bunghole</b> uppermost,--which no doubt she did,--and would have saved all her possessions. If one must float through stormy waves and great breakers, there is no safer way to do it than in a hogshead, as has been proved by the man who in that way navigated the fierce rapids at Niagara. But Elizabeth did not go back to her hogshead. She took her chances with the rest of the people on board, and with them was cast on the shore of New Jersey.|$|E
60|$|But, {{although}} this element of horror was fortunately wanting, {{to describe the}} awful and hideous grandeur of the spectacle thus presented to us is, I feel, so absolutely beyond my poor powers that I scarcely dare attempt it. To begin with, it appealed to the moral {{as well as the}} physical susceptibilities. There was something very terrible, and yet very fascinating, about the employment of the remote dead to illumine the orgies of the living; in itself the thing was a satire, both on the living and the dead. Cæsar's dust--or is it Alexander's?--may stop a <b>bunghole,</b> but the functions of these dead Cæsars of the past was to light up a savage fetish dance. To such base uses may we come, of so little account may we be {{in the minds of the}} eager multitudes that we shall breed, many of whom, so far from revering our memory, will live to curse us for begetting them into such a world of woe.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{knew just}} one other official, {{and that was}} the gauger, whom they watched at a respectful distance, when they found him {{employed}} with his mysterious instruments gauging the whiskey in the long rows of barrels on the Basin bank. They did not know what the process was, and I own that I do not know to this day what it was. My boy watched him with the rest, and once he ventured upon a bold and reckless act. He had so long heard that it was whiskey which made people drunk that at last the notion came to have an irresistible fascination for him, and he determined to risk everything, even life itself, to know what whiskey was like. As soon as the gauger had left them, he ran up to one of the barrels where he had seen a few drops fall from his instrument when he lifted it from the <b>bunghole,</b> and plunged the tip of his little finger into the whiskey, and then put it to his tongue. He expected to become drunk instantly, if not to end a town-drunkard there on the spot; but the whiskey only tasted very disgusting; {{and he was able to}} get home without help. Still, I would not advise any other boy to run the risk he took in this desperate experiment.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} method from Hocus Pocus Junior was {{a single}} large barrel that is modified with internal baffles to create three sections. A single spigot {{on one of the}} flat ends of the barrel is extended with three pipes, one leading into each of the different partitions. The flow is controlled through a <b>bunghole</b> on the top that is likewise modified to run to three hoses, one into each partition. By turning the stopper in the <b>bunghole</b> to uncover one of the pipes, air can flow into the selected partition. When the spigot is opened, only the liquid from the selected partition can flow out, the partial vacuum in the other chambers prevents the flow.|$|E
