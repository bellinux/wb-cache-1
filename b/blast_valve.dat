50|$|A blast damper is used {{to protect}} {{occupants}} and equipment of a structure against overpressures resultant of an explosion. The blast dampers normally protect air inlets and exhaust penetrations in an otherwise hardened structure. Blast dampers are related or identical to <b>blast</b> <b>valves,</b> the latter name is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices {{as they relate to}} nuclear explosions.|$|R
50|$|One form of <b>blast</b> <b>valve,</b> {{popularized by}} the book Nuclear War Survival Skills and tested by ORNL is worn flat rubber tire treads nailed or bolted to frames strong enough to resist the maximum overpressure, with tested closing times cited as being {{identical}} to commercial grade blast valves, however {{the use of this}} form of <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> design must also take the risk of the flammable rubber catching fire into consideration.|$|E
50|$|In bunkers {{inhabited}} for prolonged periods, {{large amounts}} of ventilation or air conditioning must be provided {{in order to prevent}} ill effects of heat. In bunkers designed for war-time use, manually operated ventilators must be provided because supplies of electricity or gas are unreliable. One of the most efficient manual ventilator designs is the Kearny Air Pump. Ventilation openings in a bunker must be protected by blast valves. A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open. One form of expedient <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is worn flat rubber tire treads nailed or bolted to frames strong enough to resist the maximum overpressure.|$|E
50|$|Another type of <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> employs rounded metal tubes held {{in place}} by springs. As {{pressure}} rises it pushes the tubes against the frame of the valve closing the opening. These valves are typically unidirectional in airflow and are employed in large wall structures where large amounts of airflow is required.|$|E
50|$|The bunker {{is built}} to deflect a 30 megaton nuclear {{explosion}} {{as close as}} 2 km. Within a mountain tunnel are sets of 25-ton blast doors and another for the civil engineering department. The doors were built {{so that they can}} always be opened when needed. Should a nuclear blast hit the building, they are designed to withstand a blast wave. There is a network of <b>blast</b> <b>valves</b> with unique filters to capture air-borne chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contaminants.|$|R
50|$|Improvised {{purpose-built}} blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, {{a narrow}} (1-2 metre-wide) flexible tent of thin wood {{is placed in}} a deep trench (usually {{the apex of the}} tent is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1-2 meters of tamped earth. Shelters of this type are approved field expedient blast shelters of both the U.S. and China. Entrances are constructed from thick wooden frames. <b>Blast</b> <b>valves</b> are to be constructed from tire-treads laid on thick wooden grids.|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} of flight {{depends on the}} wind, but the altitude of the balloon can be controlled by changing {{the temperature of the}} air inside the envelope. The pilot may open one or more burner <b>blast</b> <b>valves</b> to increase the temperature inside the envelope, thereby increasing lift, and thus ascend or slow or stop a descent. The pilot may also open a vent, if the envelope is so equipped, to let hot air escape, decreasing the temperature inside the envelope, thereby decreasing lift, and thus descend or slow or stop an ascent. Unless the pilot intervenes, the air inside the envelope will slowly cool, by seepage or by contact with cooler outside air, and slowly provide less lift.|$|R
50|$|Ventilation {{openings}} in a bunker {{must be protected}} by blast valves. A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is closed by a shock wave, but otherwise remains open. If the bunker is in a built-up area, it may include water-cooling or an immersion tube and breathing tubes to protect inhabitants from fire storms. In these cases, the secondary exit is also most useful.|$|E
50|$|A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is used {{to protect}} a shelter, such as a fallout shelter or bunker, {{from the effects of}} sudden outside air {{pressure}} changes. A nuclear weapon creates a shock wave, which may produce sudden pressure changes of more than an atmosphere (about 15 pounds per square inch) even several miles or kilometers from the detonation point. After the shock wave passes, a sudden negative pressure follows.|$|E
5000|$|A typical <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> has entries of 6-12" [...] {{diameter}} (150-300 mm), and {{a larger}} center section. Within the center section is a disk mounted on an axle, with weak springs that keep it centered, away from both entries. Pressure displaces the disk along the axle, until it plugs one entry or the other. After the blast, the springs return the disk to the center, re-opening the valve.|$|E
2500|$|Operation Prairie Flat {{was a test}} {{involving}} the detonation of a [...] spherical surface charge of TNT to evaluate airblast, ground shock and thermal effects of nuclear weapons. Since TNT charges produce roughly double the airburst effect of nuclear weapons, it allowed testing {{the equivalent of a}} [...] nuclear weapon surface burst. It was a continuation of the technical co-operation (Canada, United States, Great Britain) series of tests sponsored jointly by the respective governments. Similar to previous tests, a large number of projects were carried out simultaneously due to the infrequent opportunity and cost of large explosives tests – the United States alone conducted 39 projects. The resulting airblast also allowed testing various targets at a range of overpressures to verify how structures resist effects of nuclear weapons. These included troop field shelters, fiberglass manholes, foxhole overhead covers, <b>blast</b> <b>valves</b> and electrical generators. Debris fracturing and transport were also tested as part of the effort to understand nuclear blast effects on Nike-X anti-ballistic missile sites. An additional goal of the test was to compare the blast with the previous Distant Plain Event 6 that used an equivalent but smaller [...] configuration in order to study scaling factors.|$|R
40|$|Master´s thesis {{deals with}} {{hydraulic}} optimisation {{of a hot}} <b>blast</b> gate <b>valve.</b> The valve must be cooled down, because of very high temperature that is exposed to. The existing cooling system is oversized and uneffective. This gave opportunity to create a brand new system, that would lower operating expenses. The {{first part of the}} thesis is dedicated to comparsion between both systems from the point of the total pressure loss.

40|$|Three {{underground}} corrugated-steel arch structures {{covered with}} 5 feet of earth were subjected I to peak overpressures of 60 and 100 psi during Shot Priscilla at the Nevada Test Site. Emsentially, it was desired {{to assure that}} Department of Defenst Class UI (50 -psi overpressure and compara-hie radiations) protection is afforded by two types of 23 -foot diameter, 10 -degr. corrugated-metal arches. Free-field overpressure was measured at the gromnd surface above the structres, aloug with pressure inside each structure, acceleration of the floor slab, arch deflectiam relative to the floor slab, and gamma and neutron radiation dose inside each structure. Vast was meas-ured inside one structure. All arch structures provided adequate Class U protection for the conditiMo cc Oe test. Oneo arch structure, reinforced with steel arch ribs, withstood 100 -pal overpressure (333 -musec positive-phase duration) with no significant damage other than a cracked floor slab. A <b>blast</b> closure <b>valve</b> was tested in the ventilating system of one structure.

50|$|If such {{pressure}} waves enter a shelter, {{they will}} likely do substantial harm to occupants and equipment. A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> {{is placed in}} air intake/exhaust pipes, that remains open normally, but automatically closes when strong pressure is applied in either direction. Blast dampers operate {{in the same fashion}} and are related or identical to blast valves, the former name however is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices, for more, conventional explosive events.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the tricks}} {{involved}} in flying a balloon {{is learning to}} deal with the delayed response. To slow or stop a descent requires the pilot to open a burner <b>blast</b> <b>valve.</b> This sends hot combustion exhaust through the mouth into the envelope where it expands and forces some cooler air out of the mouth. This lightens the total weight of the system and increases its buoyancy, but not immediately. From the time that the burner is lit until the balloon slows or stops its descent can take 30 seconds or more, depending on its rate of descent, how cold it has become, and how powerful the burner. This delay requires a great deal of anticipation {{on the part of the}} pilot.|$|E
50|$|The burner unit gasifies liquid propane, mixes it with air, ignites the mixture, {{and directs}} the flame and exhaust {{into the mouth}} of the envelope. Burners vary in power output; each will {{generally}} produce 2 to 3 MW of heat (7 to 10 million BTUs per hour), with double, triple, or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed. The pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve, known as a <b>blast</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a flint striker or a lighter, or with a built-in piezo electric spark.|$|E
500|$|There are {{different}} ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a [...] "double bell" [...] system where two [...] "bells" [...] are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a [...] "bell-less" [...] system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the <b>blast</b> furnace through <b>valves.</b> These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.|$|R

40|$|In {{two-stroke}} engines {{replacement of}} carburetors with {{direct fuel injection}} systems greatly reduces engine emissions and fuel consumption by eliminating fuel short-circuiting. Air-blast direct fuel injection using a dedicated air pump has been successfully applied to both two- and four-stroke engines. In this study we re-examine {{the design of a}} low cost compression pressurized direct injection system. This system uses gases extracted from the combustion chamber during the compression stroke to supply pressure for the air blast injection, thus eliminating the air pump [1, 2]. Gases, predominantly scavenging air, are transferred to a mixing cavity from the combustion chamber via a small (5 mm diameter) solenoid poppet valve as the piston rises during the compression stroke. Proper functioning of the system requires careful optimization of the mixing cavity size and the <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> timing to ensure adequate mixing cavity pressure and fuel atomization. To assist in the optimization of these design parameters a one-dimensional fluid dynamics model has been developed. Parameter sensitivity studies were carried out using the model to determine the optimum cavity size, <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> timing, and fuel injection duration. These parameters were optimized over a wide range of engine speeds and throttle settings. Results show that a mixing cavity pressure of 500 kPa is attainable over the range of 1000 to 6000 rpm, from closed throttle to wide open throttle (WOT) without cavity pressurization encroaching into the ignition regime. Fuel maps and valve timings are presented and results are contrasted with the carbureted case, showing improved fuel efficiency and emissions for the direct injection system. These data will be used in the design of a physical demonstration engine...|$|E
