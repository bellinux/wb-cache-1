5000|$|Different {{radio set}} models were {{required}} for AC, DC mains, and <b>battery</b> <b>operation.</b> For example a 1933 Murphy radio with {{essentially the same}} circuit had different models for AC supply, DC supply, and <b>battery</b> <b>operation.</b> The introduction of AC/DC circuitry allowed a single model to be used on either AC or DC mains as a selling point, and some such models added [...] "Universal" [...] to their name (such sets usually had user-settable voltage tapping arrangements to cater for {{the wide range of}} voltages).|$|E

The inexperience of the new lighthouse keepers was blamed for the fire. The burner was replaced with an oil-fired light in 1906 and a petroleum burner in 1923.

50|$|I2L is {{relatively}} simple to construct on an integrated circuit, and was commonly used {{before the advent}} of CMOS logic by companies such as Motorola (now Freescale) and Texas Instruments. In 1975, Sinclair Radionics introduced one of the first consumer-grade digital watches, the Black Watch, which used I2L technology.In 1979, HP introduced a frequency measurement instrument based on a HP-made custom LSI chip that uses integrated injection logic (I2L) for low power consumption and high density, enabling portable <b>battery</b> <b>operation,</b> and also some emitter function logic (EFL) circuits where high speed is needed.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of hard sulfation, conventional VRLA batteries should therefore be discharged at specific rates, determined by various charging algorithms. REF Furthermore, they must be frequently refreshed and are most suited to operation toward the top end of the SoC (between 80% and 100% charged). REF While operating in this limited state of charge mitigates permanent sulfation on the negative electrode, <b>battery</b> <b>operation</b> exclusively at or near a full SoC is highly inefficient. REF The inefficiency is largely due to increases the incidence of side reactions (for instance electrolysis) which dissipate energy.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{technical}} challenge toward developing the reading machine {{was how to}} build a [...] "tactile screen" [...] that could create a dynamic tactile image which was perceivable by the user and that had a refresh rate fast enough for useful reading rates. Linvill's initial work with graduate students Alonzo and Hill indicated that a piezoelectric bimorph could be suitable as the transducer to convert an electrical signal into a mechanical motion. The advantages of bimorphs were efficient transduction of electrical to mechanical energy (important for <b>battery</b> <b>operation),</b> small size, fast response, and relatively low cost.|$|E

Later tubes had 1.4 volt filaments to run from dry batteries. With the introduction of mains powered equipment, indirectly heated tubes became more common and usually (though not always) required 4 volts in Europe and 6.3 volts in America. The latter became the standard voltage after the Second world war. One notable exception was that rectifier tubes often had 5 volt filaments or heaters which usually {{had to have a}} separate supply anyway.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a single-engined biplane constructed of wood with sharply-tapered wings and fabric-covered control surfaces. An enclosed cabin with one seat was provided so the Queen Wasp could be flown manually {{with the radio}} control system turned off. The radio control system was complex {{with a number of}} backup safety devices to ensure radio and <b>battery</b> <b>operation</b> was uninterrupted. A trailing receiver aerial was winched out after takeoff and served as an automatic landing device which was activated when the trailing aerial weight hit the runway. The sensitivity of the system in turbulent weather meant that an alternative landing signal was used to initiate a landing procedure.|$|E
5000|$|A Coulomb {{explosion}} is a [...] "cold" [...] {{alternative to}} the dominant laser etching technique of thermal ablation, which depends on local heating, melting, and vaporization of molecules and atoms using less-intense beams. Pulse brevity down only to the nanosecond regime is sufficient to localize thermal ablation [...] - [...] before the heat is conducted far, the energy input (pulse) has ended. Nevertheless, thermally ablated materials may seal pores important in catalysis or <b>battery</b> <b>operation,</b> and recrystallize or even burn the substrate, thus changing the {{physical and chemical properties}} at the etch site. In contrast, even light foams remain unsealed after ablation by Coulomb explosion.|$|E
50|$|Withdrawals {{began in}} July 1968 {{and the final}} {{locomotives}} were withdrawn in December 1971.

Most had been scrapped {{by the end of}} 1975, but at this time the possibility of converting 9 of the remaining locos to <b>battery</b> <b>operation</b> was mooted. This came to nothing, and although D8521 and D8598 enjoyed a brief reprieve by being sent to Derby Research Centre; one as mobile power plant and the other on test trains, both were withdrawn in 1978 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
