5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having {{to make do with}} ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as <b>bed</b> <b>linen.</b>|$|E

25|$|The main {{store for}} <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> on the Plymouth service was at Old Oak Common depot near London Paddington. Used bedding from Plymouth was {{previously}} transported in the guards van of the Plymouth portion, but in 1977 that vehicle {{was removed from}} the formation. Instead, the dirty linen was stacked in plastic bags in the vestibule of W2437, against the heater.|$|E

25|$|The Taunton {{sleeping}} car fire {{occurred in a}} {{sleeping car}} train at Taunton, Somerset, England, {{in the early hours}} of 6 July 1978. It killed 12 people, injured 15 people and had far-reaching effects for British Rail. The fire was caused by an electric heater which had been obstructed by sacks of dirty <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> causing it to overheat. Most deaths were due to smoke inhalation.|$|E
25|$|However one {{physical}} site allowed {{cost savings}} {{with some of}} the facilities shared; St. Bernard's oil burning boilers for instance were enlarged in number from 4 to 6 to provide hot water and radiator heating to both hospitals, and the existing laundry facilities on the St. Bernard's site, near the boilers, provided <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> and towels to both hospitals. But the new Ealing hospital building included a larger mortuary allowing the outdated St. Bernard's mortuary to close. Both hospitals retained separate Kitchens, Maintenance, Pharmacy, Telephone exchange and portering services, whilst separate management require separate Finance, Human Resources, and later IT departments.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the 1966 Flood of the River Arno in Florence the National Spiritual Assembly of Italy appointed an Aid to Flood Victims Committee during the 1966 national conference {{on the progress of}} the religion in November. The members were: Houshyar Achraf, Mohammad Ravanbakhs, Col. Giulio Jacoviello, Sohrab Payment, and Maud Bosio. The first check received for the fund was from the Universal House of Justice. City Hall furnished Letters of introduction to the Aid Centers of the most damaged districts in Florence and Brozzi.

The sum of $735 (1967 dollars) was given as emergency help to twenty families.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939 and 1940, camp living {{conditions}} were acceptable: laundry and <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> were changed regularly {{and the food}} was adequate, although in the first winter of 1939/40, limitations began to be noticeable. The German Communist, Margarete Buber-Neumann, came to Ravensbrück as an inmate after nearly {{two years in a}} Russian Soviet Gulag. She described her first impressions of Ravensbrück in comparison to the Soviet camp in Karaganda: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another Seine {{institution}} was the bateau-lavoir, or floating laundry, where lavandrieres, or laundry women, came to wash {{clothing and}} <b>bed</b> <b>linen.</b> They were mostly {{located on the}} right bank, where they profited from the sunshine for drying the laundry. [...] By the Restoration, they were very large, and generally had two levels the lower deck had benches or tables close to the water, where the washing was done, and then clothes {{were taken to the}} upper deck to dry in the sun. The lavandrieres paid a charge to the owner of the barge for each visit. [...] The last bateau-lavoir closed in 1937.|$|E
50|$|The visit {{will usually}} {{take place in}} {{designated}} rooms or a structure provided for that purpose, such as a trailer or a small cabin. Supplies such as soap, condoms, lubricant, <b>bed</b> <b>linens,</b> and towels may be provided.|$|R

2500|$|Expanding on the {{household}} tasks which the Bible implies a wife should undertake, rabbinic literature requires her to perform all the housework (such as baking, cooking, washing, {{caring for her}} children, etc.), unless her marriage had given the husband a large dowry; in the latter situation, the wife was expected only to tend to supposedly [...] "affectionate" [...] tasks, such as making his bed and serving him his food. Jewish tradition expected the husband to provide the <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> and kitchen utensils. If the wife had young twin children, the Talmud made her husband responsible for caring for one of them.|$|E
60|$|The maids {{were sent}} flying hither and thither, {{one into the}} kitchen to make ready some hot supper, the other to the linen press to find the finest set of <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> all sweetly laid by in rosemary.|$|E

In his nostrils was still the scent with which the <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> was faintly scented--he did not know what it was. But now he wiped his face and his mouth, to wipe it away.|$|E
50|$|The {{collection}} {{consists of}} furniture and home accessories and decorations: from dinnerware to dining tables and from <b>bed</b> <b>linens</b> to sofas.

50|$|During this process, {{the only}} items {{removed from the}} hotel were the <b>bed</b> <b>linens.</b> Everything else {{remained}} in situ, even the bottles in the bar.

60|$|Saxon {{made for}} herself simple house slips of pretty gingham, with neat low collars turned {{back from her}} fresh round throat. She crocheted yards of laces for her underwear, and made Battenberg in {{abundance}} for her table and for the bureau. A great achievement, that aroused Billy's applause, was an Afghan for the bed. She even ventured a rag carpet, which, the women's magazines informed her, had newly returned into fashion. As {{a matter of course}} she hemstitched the best table linen and <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> they could afford.|$|E
60|$|Next--and I {{know now}} that it was because Morrell had spelled his message quite out--I pursued my way among the stars and was not called back. After that, {{and in the course of}} it, I was aware, drowsily, that I was falling asleep, and that it was delicious sleep. From time to time, drowsily, I stirred--please, my reader, don't miss that verb--I STIRRED. I moved my legs, my arms. I was aware of clean, soft <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> against my skin. I was aware of bodily well-being. Oh, it was delicious! As thirsting men on the desert dream of {{splashing}} fountains and flowing wells, so dreamed I of easement from the constriction of the jacket, of cleanliness in the place of filth, of smooth velvety skin of health in place of my poor parchment-crinkled hide. But I dreamed with a difference, as you shall see.|$|E

60|$|It was {{suggested}} to Mrs. Pinworthy {{that she should}} poison the bear; but, after trying about a hundredweight of strychnia, arsenic, and Prussic acid, without any effect other than what might be expected from mild tonics, {{she thought it would}} not be right to go into toxicology. So the poor Widow Pinworthy went on, patiently enduring the consumption of her cattle, sheep, and hogs, the evaporation of her poultry, and the taking off of her <b>bed</b> <b>linen,</b> until there were left only the clothing of herself and children, some curtains, a sickly lamb, and a pet pigeon. When the bear came for these she ventured to expostulate. In this she was perfectly successful: the animal permitted her to expostulate as long as she liked. Then he ate the lamb and pigeon, took in a dish-cloth or two, and went away just as contentedly as if she had not uttered a word.|$|E
60|$|With {{what sense}} of liberty, of exultation, {{we took our}} way down the road on that {{gorgeous}} autumn morning! No more dust, no more grime, no more mud, no more cow milking, no more horse currying! For five months we were to live the lives of scholars, of boarders.--Yes, through some mysterious channel our parents {{had been brought to}} the point of engaging lodgings for us in the home of a townsman named Leete. For two dollars a week it was arranged that we could eat and sleep from Monday night to Friday noon, but we were not expected to remain for supper on Friday; and Sunday supper, was of course, extra. I thought this {{a great deal of money}} then, but I cannot understand at this distance how our landlady was able to provide, for that sum, the raw material of her kitchen, to say nothing of <b>bed</b> <b>linen</b> and soap.|$|E
5000|$|Around 3400 BC Egyptian pharaohs {{had their}} beds moved {{off the ground}} and slept on a raised surface. <b>Bed</b> <b>linen</b> was widely evolved in Egypt.
