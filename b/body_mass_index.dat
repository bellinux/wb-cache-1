5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>index,</b> smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>index.</b> Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

40|$|Obesity is {{frequently}} associated with insulin resistance. Recently {{an important role}} of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a in mediating insulin resistance of obesity through its overexpres-sion in fat tissue has been reported. In order to examine the relation of insulin resistance to obesity and to serum neopterin, as a parameter of immune activation, we studied 1234 otherwise healthy outpatients, who visited the physician’s office for a medical health check-up. 7 % showed elevated glucose concentrations, 34 % elevated <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>indices.</b> There were significant correlations between glucose concentrations and <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> and of the latter with serum neopterin concentrations. Neopterin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with elevated <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> (Mann-Whitney test, U 5 131 358, p 5 0. 0003) and elevated glucose concentrations (Mann-Whitney test, U 5 35 350 p 5 0. 02).

5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases.

A <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>index</b> {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>index</b> (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>index,</b> and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers.

Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E

Hours of outdoor play and television viewing are associated with BMI. Higher maternal perceptions of neighborhood collective efficacy are associated with more hours of outdoor play, fewer hours of television viewing, and more trips to a park or playground. In addition, we find that neighborhood physical disorder is associated with more outdoor play and more television watching.

The main objective {{of this research was}} to determine the socio-economic factors that influence <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> in Rwanda. Inflation rate, <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> (bmi) for males and females (from 1960 to 2009) and food supply indices were obtained mainly from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAOSTAT). A double log multiple regression model was used to assess the relationship between average bmi and several predictor variables. Further tests of autocorrelation, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity and normality were carried out and subsequently corrected. Results showed that obesity is not a problem in Rwanda. However, bmi for men and women have been increasing. Food self sufficiency, fat supply and food aid had a positive and significant impact on average bmi (p< 0. 05) while GDP per capita and inflation rate were insignificant. These results indicate the positive impact of efforts of government of Rwanda through Vision 2020. However, food aid may be contributing to rapid bmi increases in the country...|$|R
