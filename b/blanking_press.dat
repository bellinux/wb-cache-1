5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine <b>blanking</b> <b>press</b> includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E

Three guide plate inserts with different V-ring positions and three die inserts with different die chamfers were machined, and then a fine blanking tool was manufactured for the fine blanking experiments. Nine experiments were conducted on a 650 -ton fine <b>blanking</b> <b>press.</b> Each die roll height was measured and analyzed. It would be noticed that the die roll heights on the corner shapes of the fine blanked parts increased with increasing V-ring distance and die chamfer angle, but it decreased with increasing corner radius and angle.

40|$|Ferrite–ceramic {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in electronics. The most widely used is Mn–Zn ferrite due to its high permeability. However, Mn–Zn ferrites obtained by the standard process flow (ITS) have texture along the pressing axis which significantly reduces their permeability and causes anisotropic properties. The difference in the magnetic permeability along and perpendicular to the pressing axis reaches 10 – 20 % due to the texture. The texture of the raw blanks is caused by lamellar ferrite particles [1] and {{the orientation of the}} [1   1   1] crystallographic axes along the compression axis. During sintering the degree of texture increases due to the preferential growth of pressing-oriented particles at the expense of non-oriented ones. As a result, an easy magnetization axis formed in the sintered ferrite which coincides with the compression axis. Most sizes of ferrite products are manufactured {{in such a way that}} the magnetic field lines in their operation do not coincide with the compression axis (ring, P- and R-core), which significantly reduces their operating parameters. To reduce the texture in this study we used a short process flow diagram including only one heat treatment i. e. sintering of the <b>blanks</b> <b>pressed</b> directly from the mixture of the raw ferrite oxide particles that are oriented but slightly when pressed. We show that isotropic Mn–Zn ferrite with the desired magnetic properties at CCC can be obtained using bismuth oxide additives and a complex composition of binder during compaction instead conventionally used polyvinyl alcohol...|$|R

CAD/CAM milled FDPs and those pressed from PEEK/C-pellets showed spontaneous and brittle fractures near the pontic without deformation of the FDP. In contrast, granulate pressed FDPs showed some plastic deformation without fracture. CAD/CAM fabricated FDPs, and FDPs pressed from PEEK/C pellets showed higher Weibull moduli compared to FDPs pressed in granular form. Industrial pre-pressing of blanks (CAD/CAM/pellet) increased the stability and reliability of PEEK restorations...|$|R
40|$|Aspherical glass lenses are {{increasingly}} being used in consumer products like high power laser generators, digital cameras, projectors and scientific instruments. However, conventional manufacturing processes are not suitable for medium to high volume production of aspherical glass optical elements. Recently, compression molding {{has emerged as a}} promising alternative in which a glass gob or <b>blank</b> is <b>pressed</b> in a single operation into the shape of a finished lens. Annealing of the formed lens is required to achieve optical quality. The process is net shape, environment friendly and suitable for high volume production. Further implementation of this innovative process is hindered by technical challenges associated with curve conformance, tooling cost and mold life. This dissertation research seeks a fundamental understanding of the lens molding process by adopting a combined experimental, analytical and numerical Finite Element Method (FEM) approach. Preliminary experiments were performed involving molding of a test aspherical glass lens on a commercial lens molding machine to study process capability to manufacture an optic component within the desired specifications. Experiments were also performed to determine the effect of different molding parameter...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for the design and construction of simple foil thrust bearings intended for parametric performance testing and low marginal costs, supporting continued development of oil-free turbomachinery. A bearing backing plate is first machined and surface-ground to produce flat and parallel faces. Partial-arc slots needed to retain the foil components are then machined into the plate by wire electrical discharge machining. Slot thicknesses achievable by a single wire pass are appropriate to accommodate the practical range of foil thicknesses, leaving a small clearance in this hinged joint to permit limited motion. The backing plate is constructed from a nickel-based superalloy (Inconel 718) to allow heat treatment of the entire assembled bearing, {{as well as to}} permit hightemperature operation. However, other dimensionally stable materials, such as precipitation-hardened stainless steel, can also be used for this component depending on application. The top and bump foil blanks are cut from stacks of annealed Inconel X- 750 foil by the same EDM process. The bump foil has several azimuthal slits separating it into five individual bump strips. This configuration allows for variable bump spacing, which helps to accommodate the effects of the varying surface velocity, thermal crowning, centrifugal dishing, and misalignment. Rectangular tabs on the foil blanks fit into the backing plate slots. For this application, a rather traditional set of conventionally machined dies is selected, and bump foil <b>blanks</b> are <b>pressed</b> into the dies for forming. This arrangement produces a set of bump foil dies for foil thrust bearings that provide for relatively inexpensive fabrication of various bump configurations, and employing methods and features from the public domain...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} alumina content on the {{mechanical}} strength of electrical porcelain manufactured by green machining of isostatically <b>pressed</b> <b>blanks</b> was examined {{with a view}} to attaining optimal mechanical properties at low sintering temperatures. Porcelain compositions were formulated with four different alumina contents, maintaining the same proportion of the other materials (kaolin, clay and feldspar). Test specimens were isostatically pressed at 70 MPa and machined at high speed into cylindrical test specimens using controlled machining parameters. These specimens were sintered at several temperatures to determine the optimal sintering temperature for each composition, after which their mechanical properties were analyzed by the flexural bend test. The results indicated a correlation between the alumina content and the sintering temperature, and between the flexural strength and its influence on the green machining conditions. An average tensile strength of 786 MPa was attained for the composition with an added content of 30 wt% of commercial alumina sintered at 1250 degrees C, pressed and machined under industrial conditions.

A decrease in light-stimulus duration (1 - 0. 4 s) decreased accuracy, increased the reporting of blank trials and the number of light-alone trial omissions. Scopolamine (0. 03 - 0. 1 mg/kg) and scopolamine methylbromide (0. 1 mg/kg) failed to affect accuracy, but increased light-alone trial omissions and lengthened correct response latency. The results confirm that the novel task is able to distinguish between motivational and attentional manipulations, and imply that scopolamine affected performance via nonattentional mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} {{study of a}} lithic industry can provide significant contribution to reconstruct {{the social and economic}} organization of late-glacial hunters-gatherers, through the recognition of different activities carried out at the sites. Reasoning about the role that variable targets played in the dynamics of the settlement systems, the principal aims of current research in Eastern Italian Alps are the resources exploitation strategies and the logistic organization of epigravettians. From the LGM to the onset of the Holocene many and intense ecological modifications occurred in this region. The main processes - deglaciation and forest expansion - led humans to settle in the Pre-Alpine fringe and in Southern Dolomites. Archaeological and multidisciplinary data extracted from several sites at different locations induced to propose a settlement system model to explain the middle- altitude human occurrences at the end of Upper Palaeolithic. Three types of sites were individuated (Broglio, Lanzinger 1990) : residential locations downslope in the valleys, middle altitude seasonal camps (commonly settled in the open air, in proximity of peat-bogs, sheets of water or under rockshelters) and seasonal hunting places at middle altitude. Most of the mountain camps are in the open air sites. Generally, they underwent to strong post-depositional disturbance, mainly on account of long-term soil formation processes acting on them. Although their archaeological record is rather poor in relation to that one of sites located in a more favourable geomorphological context, their study is equally required in order to fully understand the human ecology in that periods (Angelucci and Peresani, in press). This is the case of one among several middle-altitude seasonal camps occupied during the Allerød, Val Lastari, wich lies in the open air at an altitude of 1. 060 m on the Asiago Plateau. Even if post-depositional processes dramatically reduced the archaeological record (no faunal remains have been found), excavations revealed traces of repeated human occupations mainly related with flint workshops and flint caching (Fig. 1). Due to its own ecological context, to their proximity to flint sources and to the archaeological record, Val Lastari can likely be attributed to that category known as temporary and complex camps at middle-altitude. Lithic technology has well demonstrated that toolmaking of local flint was aimed to obtain straight blades, two morphometric categories of bladelets (destined to be shaped into backed pieces) and laminar flakes (Montoya, Peresani, in <b>press).</b> <b>Blanks</b> and tools were used, exported and also introduced onto the site (Broglio et al., 1992). End-scrapers, burins, backed knives and retouched blades are the most numerous among the retouched tools, whereas backed points, backed and backed truncated bladelets are the most representative types among the microliths. Through a functional approach to the lithic tool-set we would like to verify the reliability of the proposed model in the general perspective of more integrated approaches recently applied on Epigravettian contexts, concerning the reconstruction of raw material provisioning systems, lithic technological procedures, their variability, as well as their evolution and their functional significance. Methodology is based on the study of use-wear traces on flint tools, at different magnifications, from low power approach with a stereoscope (up to 50 X) to high power approach with metallographic microscope (up to 200 - 400 X) (Keeley, 1980; Vaughan 1985). Analysis were supported, as necessary in a functional approach, by experimental reconstruction, with the aims to stress the attitude of different lithic raw materials exploited in the site and to observe the occurrence and evolution of the traces. Furthermore, recurring to experimental archaeology was necessary to answer to specific questions arose during the analysis of specific categories of archaeological artefacts (such as scrapers, backed bladelets…). Even if specimens are affected by variable alteration (very frequent soil sheen affected surfaces and abrasion damaged edges and dorsal ridges) and the observation of diagnostic microtraces is quite rare, results from the {{functional study}} provide some data about the function of the site and open new perspectives about its dynamics. Although the relationship with raw material provisioning is evident and that flint knapping and tool-making were very important targets at this site, neverthless {{it is now clear that}} epigravettian hunters also carried out various tasks. The results of the functional study support the interpretation that there was not only a production of weapons implements, but also their utilization in hunting, that probably occurred in the surroundings. Subsistence activities are represented too: carcass treatment and hide processing seem to be very important, suggesting that the site was related to game acquisition and animal resources exploitation. Finally, some general considerations will be made about the settlement system of the region, even by a comparison with previous functional studies on epigravettian sites (Lemorini Rossetti, 2000 and 2004). Even if the results are not necessarily in contrast with the proposed model (Broglio, Lanzinger 1990), they can contribute to enrich the actual perspectives and discussion on human ecology during the Late Glacial in the Pre-Alpine fringe, suggesting a more complex and various settlement system...|$|R
