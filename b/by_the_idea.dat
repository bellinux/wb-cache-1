5|$|After graduation, Johnson {{purchased}} half-ownership of The Anderson News {{and served}} as the paper's editor and publisher. In 1925, Shelton M. Saufley asked Johnson {{to enter into a}} joint venture to purchase the Richmond Daily Register. Lured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of publishing a daily paper, Johnson accepted. As a result of one of his editorials, Johnson was named executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee in 1932. He continued to hold this position and publish the Register through 1939.|$|E
5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
5|$|After the United Kingdom {{entered the}} First World War, Fortune joined the Women's Land Army. She was {{initially}} stationed {{on a farm}} near to Bishop's Stortford on the borders between Essex and Hertfordshire, before later being relocated to an experimental base for the Food Production Department. There she carried out experiments {{in the production of}} soy milk, subsequently founding the Letchworth-based Garden City Pure Food Company to sell her products and publishing The Soya Bean: An Appeal to Humanitarians in 1925. It was while working at the base that she underwent a spiritual experience and subsequently further immersed herself in theosophical literature. After doing so, she became preoccupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of the 'Ascended Masters' or 'Secret Chiefs', claiming to have had visions of two such entities, the Master Jesus and the Master Rakoczi.|$|E

5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of data compression. For example, {{the value of}} the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the surreal number , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E
5|$|Cross-fertilization between {{board games}} {{and video games}} continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III were drawn from {{the first edition of}} the board game Twilight Imperium. Even Sins of a Solar Empire was {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, completely different from the board game that had inspired the computer game in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification. At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E

5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further {{believed to be the}} center of the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E

5|$|Cerny and Flanagan first {{collaborated on}} a video game based on Michael Jackson's Thriller. The project was {{canceled}} and the two began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became Marble Madness. Development lasted 10months. Following the North American video game crash of 1983, video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience {{through the use of}} a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two-player mode. Cerny designed Marble Madness in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by miniature golf and captivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that a play field's contours influenced the ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to a race against time.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann flew {{his first}} combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann's wingman. When they {{encountered}} 10 enemy aircraft below, Hartmann, obsessed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of scoring his first success, opened full throttle and became separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, {{but failed to}} score any hits and nearly collided with it instead. He then ran for cover in low cloud, and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel. Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days {{of working with the}} ground crew. Twenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first kill, an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment, {{but by the end of}} 1942, he had added only one more victory to his tally. As with many high-scoring aces, it took him some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Press {{reports of}} the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of {{misinformation}} disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the Venus was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there {{made his way back}} to London.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, and in one of its first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, and rejection by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E
