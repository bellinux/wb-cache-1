Based upon bulk mean temperature of the whole flow in the channel, Nusselt numbers and the generalized temperature profiles in the fully developed regions are determined by means of integration of the momentum and energy equations. Three possible combinations of the thermal boundary conditions on the two wall plates of the channel are considered: isothermal-isothermal, isothermal-isoflux, and isoflux-isoflux. Results show that the thermal characteristics of the fully developed flow could be significantly affected by the position of the baffle, the pressure-gradient ratio by the two separate streams, and thermal boundary conditions on the channel walls. ...|$|E

30|$|Fertilizers {{are one of}} {{the major}} inputs into dairy farming, {{accounting}} for approximately 12.5  % of operating farm expenditure (DairyNZ 2013). Fertilizer production, in general, is considered a high, energy-intensive process as, for example, nitrogen-based fertilizers are made primarily from natural gas. This is confirmed by the studies of <b>Baffes</b> (2007) and <b>Baffes</b> (2011), in which high pass-through from energy indices, for example, crude oil to fertilizer indices, is found. In addition, processing milk to butter also requires significant energy input. This suggests that a direct relationship between butter and crude oil is to be expected. In addition, transportation costs for butter and dairy commodities are mainly influenced by oil costs, thus further strengthening the relationship between butter and crude oil. This argument was used to explain correlation effects between crude oil and agricultural commodities, and, in particular, butter, in the study of Huchet-Bourdon (2011).|$|R
30|$|The {{drivers of}} food {{prices have been}} {{variously}} reported as increased reliance on bio-fuels (Ajanovic 2011; Rosegrant 2008; Mitchell 2008), climate induced supply rigidities in some major agricultural countries (<b>Baffes</b> et al. 2015; Fischer et al. 1995; Rosenzweig and Parry 1994); and increasing demand pressure due to an expanding global population (Dyson 1996), among others.

In the analysis of the global food price, the long run pass-through coefficient is estimated to be 0.18 by <b>Baffes</b> (2007). It should be expected that the effect of oil price should be lower as we go down the supply chain. Hence, it is reasonable to observe lower pass-through to the domestic food price. Moreover, in Malaysia, the prices of several essential food items are controlled and administered by the government. This may have shaped the low oil price – food price relation in the long run, in line with the argument forwarded by Jongwanich and Park (2011).|$|R
40|$|Cotton is Uganda’s third-largest {{export crop}} after coffee and tea (<b>Baffes</b> 2009).

30|$|While the {{positive}} link between oil and food prices is well founded, existing empirical evidence {{is far from}} being uniform. Such studies as Zhang and Reed (2008), Zhang et al. (2010), Lambert and Miljkovic (2010), Nazlioglu and Soytas (2011), and more recently Reboredo (2012) have suggested the neutrality or, at best, only marginal reaction of various agricultural or food prices to oil price fluctuations. Evaluating the agricultural price (i.e. corn, soy meal and pork) uptrend in China from January 2000 to October 2007, Zhang and Reed (2008) side-line the oil price as a major underlying factor. By the same token, farm wages and manufacturing wages rather than fuel prices are noted to account for variations in the US food prices from 1970 to 2009 by Lambert and Miljkovic (2010). Further evidence is provided by Nazlioglu and Soytas (2011) for the case of Turkey. More specifically, examining the relations between oil price, lira-dollar exchange rate and individual agricultural prices (wheat, maize, cotton, soybeans and sunflower) using monthly data from January 1994 to March 2010, they provide evidence for the neutrality of these prices to oil price changes. This finding reaffirms earlier results for the global commodity prices by Zhang et al. (2010), who document the absence of long run relations and short run interactions between corn, rice, soybeans, sugar and wheat prices and oil price, and it is in line with the recent finding by Reboredo (2012), who notes that the food price spikes experienced in recent years are not caused by drastic increases in oil price. By contrast, <b>Baffes</b> (2007), Harri et al. (2009), Chen et al. (2010), and most recently <b>Baffes</b> and Dennis (2013) all provide evidence indicating significant contribution of oil price to agricultural pricesb.|$|R
40|$|In Uganda, cotton {{has been}} {{characterized}} as a crop with relatively low profitability, mostly due to low productivity (<b>Baffes</b> 2009), {{but also because it}} is affected by fluctuations in cotton’s world price. Studies done by APSEC (1998, 2001) ranked cotton as the lowest in profitability among the main competing crops on the global market. Despite cotton’s low profitability, farmers continue to plant it. The most-often-cited reason for continued cotton production is a lack of productive alternatives that can generate cash for smallholders and larger farmers during the period cotton is planted. The certainty that cotton producers will have a buyer {{at the end of the}} season is probably another strong argument for cotton cultivation: ginneries usually distribute seed and inputs and in turn demand rights over the seed cotton harvest at the end of the cropping season.

30|$|Cotton plays a {{significant}} economic role for many countries of West Africa. Indeed, {{in addition to}} its contribution to the GDP and to total merchandise exports (from 25 % to 45 %), this sector represents more than half the income for roughly two millions of households in West Africa (<b>Baffes</b> 2007; Moseley and Gray 2008). Despite this economic importance, cotton is a controversial crop, which is at the centre of debates on globalization, structural adjustments, food security, biotechnology, agricultural subsidies, poverty alleviation, and sustainable development (Moseley and Gray 2008). In particular, Benin is among the countries most dependent on cotton (Gergely 2009). In fact, cotton accounts for 40 % of foreign exchange earnings, employs 45 % of rural households, and provides income to more than one third of the population (MAEP 2011). Accordingly, the Government of Benin gave {{a significant}} place to this sector in its development strategy as a tool for poverty alleviation.|$|R

30|$|During {{the period}} under {{investigation}} from 1983 (quarter 1) to 2012 (quarter 4), wheat and rice markets encountered many shocks {{of a permanent}} (structural breaks) as well as transitory (outliers) nature. First of all, there were shocks in the market fundamentals of supply and demand. While improved farming technologies have positively affected production, the continuing de-investment in the agricultural sector has resulted in reduced utilization of {{the capacity of the}} agricultural economic resources. The continuously increasing population and the development of the biofuels market have put pressure on the demand side. These forces have affected the creation and conservation of stocks, leading to cyclicality effects in the prices, even when supply and demand shocks were independent over time. Up to 2002 the grain stocks were kept at satisfactory levels, mainly due to the increased production of China; however, after this point, China reduced its stocks, thus affecting the worldwide stock reserves significantly (<b>Baffes</b> and Haniotis, 2010). Moreover, the regulatory framework for grain has changed globally after the negotiations of the World Trade Organization. The big producer countries, especially the United States and the European Union, were under pressure to open up their markets. Furthermore, during this long period unfavorable weather conditions affected production more than once. Speculation, exchange rates, and energy prices have also played their part {{in the formation of the}} prices. The interaction of these factors resulted in a pattern of prices for both of these commodities that followed a relatively steady trend with cyclical and seasonal effects. However, after 2002, the price of wheat started to exhibit increasing price fluctuations that reached their peak in 2008. Rice reached a price spike in 2008 as well, despite the fact that there was no change in the market fundamentals. Current literature proposes different explanations for this episode. However, there is a converging agreement that this spike was not just the result of market-specific factors. There is a consensus that a generally increasing trend in quite a few major economic variables has led to increased prices beyond the influence of market fundamentals. However, the literature developed up to now has mainly stressed the importance of volatility in the formation of prices rather than the impact of a trend (<b>Baffes</b> and Haniotis, 2010; Gilbert and Morgan, 2010).|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between crude oil, {{as a proxy}} for energy costs, and agricultural commodities (and dairy commodities in particular) has received attention in recent times. As stated by <b>Baffes</b> (2011), “any analysis of non-energy commodity markets cannot be undertaken in isolation to developments in energy markets”. This is underlined by the study of Huchet-Bourdon (2011), who found that butter and whole milk powder agricultural products had prices that most closely correlated with crude oil price over the last decade. In that study, the authors assume that this relationship might be due to the direct effect of crude oil price on agricultural commodity prices, through transportation and production costs. Another reason might be the increasing use of agricultural commodities for the production of biofuel, which provides a new link between oil and agricultural commodities. This points to relationships between crude oil, dairy products and vegetable oils, which are used for biofuel production (e.g. palm oil)—the latter also being considered a substitute for dairy products. In addition to these direct price links, there is the global concern that volatile energy prices may stimulate agricultural price volatility (Gardebroek and Hernandez 2013).|$|R
40|$|Aggregate dual {{models are}} {{specified}} to examine multiple-output production relationships {{in each of}} four major, geographically dispersed, agricultural states (California, Iowa, Texas, and Florida). Three locally-flexible functional forms (translog, generalized Le-ontief, and normalized quadratic) are employed to conduct analytic simplification tests, estimate systems of output supply and input demand equations consistent with nonre-jected hypotheses, derive elasticities, and determine to what extent analytic simplification tests and policy-relevant results are sensitive to functional form and state. Important differences in empirical implications were found due both to functional form and geo-graphic unit, but differences were greater for the latter. Key words: demand, functional form, homothetic separability, nonjointness, produc-tion, supply. Duality theory has been used extensively in recent literature to analyze multiple-output production re-lationships in agriculture. Most previous studies, however, have limited empirical work {{to the use of}} a single functional form. Empirical evidence (<b>Baffes</b> and Vasavada; Berndt, Darrough, and Diewert; Chalfant) shows that parameter estimates and the generalization of policy-relevant results, such as elasticities, are often sensitive to choice of functional form. Crucial simplifying assumptions also have been maintained in the specification of all models. Seldom have these simplifying assumptions been based on explicit hypothesis tests of the data. Further, while considerable empirical attention has been given to national and regional response (e. g., Huffman an...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the studies}} {{described}} above, {{it is evident}} that higher energy prices have an energy saving effect, whereas from a macro perspective, energy prices also have a vital impact on other aspects of the economy. One important aspect is the influence of GDP, which is the focus of many studies. Bashmakov (2007) and Aucott and Hall (2014) examine the percentage of energy costs versus GDP and find that when energy costs increase to over 10 – 12  %, GDP growth declines, and when energy costs are 5 – 6  %, GDP growth increases. Another issue that this paper emphasizes is the influence of energy prices on the general price level. Although some studies show that there is no correlation between energy prices and the general price level (Bohi 1991; Jin et al. 2009), a majority of studies generally confirm that there is a positive relationship between energy prices and the general price level (Parks 1978; Thoresen 1983; Cunado and Perez de Gracia 2005; Cologni and Manera 2008; Irz et al. 2013). Some studies measure the conductive influence of energy prices on the general price level (<b>Baffes</b> 2007; Chen 2009), whereas other studies indicate that the relationship between energy prices and inflation has varied over different time periods (Hooker 2002). These studies support the premise of this study that the effects of relative energy prices can be studied from the perspective of inflation costs.|$|R
40|$|From 2007 through mid- 2008, world {{prices of}} major {{agricultural}} commodities, such as cereals, oilseeds, and their by-products, experienced unprecedented surges since World War II (<b>Baffes</b> and Haniotis 2010). 1 The world food price indexes {{produced by the}} Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations increased by 56 percent between 2006 and 2008, while cereals and vegetable oils price indexes doubled {{during the same period}} (FAO 2010). Although price pressure for these commodities was temporarily relieved in late 2008 and 2009, the world price indexes for food, grains, and vegetable oils have rebounded in 2011 to their former high levels again (Figure 11. 1). The sudden price spikes of agricultural and food commodities in 2007 – 2008 quickly caught worldwide attention because cereal grains such as rice and wheat are staples in many developing economies, while corn is an important feedstock for the growing livestock sector in both developed and developing countries. For some food-deficit developing economies that rely heavily on imports for food consumption, drastic increases in the prices of these crops threatened the nutritional needs and social stability of these economies. Moreover, in major Asian rice-producing and rice-consuming countries, rice availability and affordability is a focus of national food security and policies (Wailes 2005).

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, {{dramatic}} changes in export commodity markets, shocks associated with resulting price declines, and changing views {{on the role of}} the state have ushered in widespread reforms to agricultural commodity markets in Africa. The reforms significantly reduced government participation in the marketing and pricing of commodities. Akiyama, <b>Baffes,</b> Larson, and Varangis examine the background, causes, process, and consequences of these reforms and derive lessons for successful reforms from experiences in markets for four commodities important to Africa-cocoa, coffee, cotton, and sugar. The authors'commodity focus highlights the special features associated with these markets that affect the reform process. They complement the current literature on market reforms in Africa, where grain-market studies are more common. The authors suggest that the types of market interventions prior to reform are more easily classified by crop than by country. Consequently, there are significant commodity-specific differences in the initial conditions and in the outcomes of reforms related to these markets. But there are general lessons as well. The authors find that the key consequences of reform have been significant changes in or emergence of marketing institutions and a significant shift of political and economic power from the public to the private sector. In cases where interventions were greatest and reforms most complete, producers have benefited from receiving a larger share of export prices. Additionally, the authors conclude that the adjustment costs of reform can be reduced in most cases by better understanding the detailed and idiosyncratic relationships between the commodity subsector, private markets, and public services. Finally, while there are significant costs to market-dependent reforms, experiences suggest that they are a necessary step toward a dynamic commodity sector based on private initiative. This is particularly true in countries and sectors where interventions were greatest and market-supporting institutions the weakest.

40|$|Structural {{adjustment}} in {{less developed countries}} has often mandated removal of state-run marketing boards to enhance efficiency in the marketing chain and to raise farm income. Concerns have been mounting about the negative side effects of cocoa market liberalization, including replacement of the parastatal by imperfectly competitive marketing institutions {{and the loss of}} public goods (e. g. research and extension). It is believed that the link of the supply chain closest to the farmgate may be the least competitive, as farmers in remote areas lack good market information and encounter relatively few buying agents. These concerns, especially related to domestic market competitiveness, have prompted governments, foreign donors and NGOs to promote farmer organizations in an effort to protect farmers (Rabobank, 2000; <b>Baffes,</b> et. al., 2003). The objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the degree of market power that exists at the farmgate and determine the efficacy of existing farmer groups to countervail this market power. In the case of cocoa, widely dispersed farmers create a challenge for those who wish to secure supply for export. If the market post-liberalization were characterized by perfect competition then margins should vary across space by differences in transaction costs that are determined by infrastructure conditions, distance to port or buying center, fuel prices, technology, and other costs that are incurred during transport. If private agents who now interface directly with farmers have the ability to exert monopsony power, then margins will also contain rents that allow part of the efficiency gains to accrue to the private intermediaries, and these may vary according to institutional relationships. Cameroon provides an opportunity to examine whether cooperatives provide a competitive yardstick that serves to countervail the market power exerted by local buyers and large traders on farmers since after liberalization farmer organizations have remained active to varying degrees across the country. To examine these issues, price transmission models that estimate the effect institutional forces have on the marketing margins that exist between the internal market (buying center) price and the farmgate price are developed using primary data from a survey performed in 2004. Our price transmission models for various cocoa producing regions in Cameroon attempt to capture intervening policy, institutional factors (e. g. cooperatives as buyers) and transactions costs. Results show that price transmission and so market integration between the port or buying center and the farmgate dissipates as product passes downstream, with significant regional variation. Institutional arrangements have a significant effect on the prices received by farmers. Infrastructure and market distance variables do not significantly affect market outcomes due to the hub-and-spoke nature of procurement at the farmgate and, in some regions, the captive supply nature of doing business. Market information, once provided by the government, is asymmetric in favor of the buyer, resulting in significantly lowers prices being received by farmers. Access to accurate and timely information often comes from membership in a farmer group. In addition, itinerant buyers exert market power against farmers who often do not have another outlet for their product. This power is also rooted in the inability of farmers to measure product quality at the farmgate, previous arrangements for credit and the tendency of itinerant buyers to demand a discount based simply upon the lack of other willing buyers. Institutional innovations of antiquated supply chain links, fostered by farmer organizations, may also reduce transactions costs currently contributing to low farm income. Marketing cocoa via farmer groups does appear to countervail buyer power but the results are sensitive to the transparency of the internal governance and regional institutional structure. Premiums are found for transactions involving farmer organizations in the center region where coops are most active and successful, and depend on how fees collected by the cooperative are treated. Farmer groups receive additional premiums associated with their capacity to aggregate production and control quality allowing buyers to gain from associated scale economies and limit quality-related risk.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the financial integration among four emerging stock markets in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, namely, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan and Morocco. Their interrelationships with three developed markets, the US, UK and Germany, are also examined. The motivation behind this study is that, although a lot of research has been focused on stock market integration, the emphasis has been mostly on developed markets. Stock market integration in the MENA region has not been investigated deeply enough despite the region being of a global economic and political importance. To attain this objective, the study conducts recent econometric techniques on the monthly time series of stock market price indices. It starts with testing for a unit root in the presence of structural change at an unknown time of the break, using the Innovational Outlier (IO) model. To empirically examine the financial integration, the study utilizes the newly proposed autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration. The ARDL approach has been recognized as more preferable in estimating the long-run equilibrium relationship than other cointegration approaches in small samples with mixed order process. Finally, the study explores the short and longrun dynamic relationships among these markets using Granger-causality within a correctly specified vector error correction model (VECM). The empirical results indicate that all variables show evidence of nonstationarity, even in the presence of structural change. The endogenously determined times of the breaks for all markets coincide with observed real events which affected each market. This result is consistence with the efficient market hypothesis as the nonstationarity random walk is associated with the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis. Consequently, this result emphasises that the stock markets in the MENA region are efficient. The cointegration test results show that there are long-run equilibrium relationships among all stock markets in the MENA region. This indicates that stock markets in the MENA region move together in the long-run. So, at the regional level all markets are integrated. At the same time no long-run equilibrium relationship is found between MENA markets and developed markets. This means that the MENA stock markets are segmented from developed markets. However, Egypt was the exceptional case; the study found that the stock market of Egypt has long-run equilibrium relationship with the US and UK markets. The implications of these findings are analysed at two levels, the regional and international. At the regional level, the existence if cointegration among the MENA markets implies the existence of the law of one price (LOOP). This means that the potential of regional investors for obtaining abnormal profits through portfolio diversification is limited in the long-run. The reason for this is that as the MENA stock markets are cointegrated, abnormal profits will be arbitraged away in the long-run. However, despite no arbitrage opportunities in the long-run, investors can still achieve arbitrage profits through portfolio diversification in the short-run. At the international level, the results show that stock markets in Turkey, Jordan and Morocco are not integrated with developed markets. This means that there is no long-run impact from developed stock markets towards these markets. However, a longrun relationship is found between Egypt and both US and UK when Egypt is a dependent variable. Based on these results, there are opportunities for international investors to obtain long-run gains through international portfolio diversification in stock markets of Turkey, Jordan and Morocco. Also at the same time, investors from these three countries have the opportunities to obtain long-run gains through investing in developed markets. The existence of long-run relationships between Egypt and both US and UK implies that the potential for investors from the Egyptian stock market to obtain abnormal profit through portfolio diversification in the US and UK is limited in the long-run. However, there are opportunities for achieving abnormal profit by investing in Germany as it is not cointegrated with the MENA markets. In the short-run, arbitrage opportunities and possible profits may also be achieved from diversification as the LOOP may not hold. In addition to these findings, an important contribution is made by this study. It contradicted Granger’s (1986) theory on the relationship between the existence of cointegration and market efficiency. Granger (1986) asserted that the existence of cointegration between two stock prices implies the ability to predict each price movement, which indicates market inefficiency. Also, this study does not fully agree with another stream of studies, such as Wallace (1992), <b>Baffes</b> (1994), Engle (1996), Ahlgren and Antell (2002) and Masih and Masih (2002) in which they asserted that cointegration does not necessarily imply market inefficiency or efficiency. However, what this study tries to bring out is that if cointegration exists between two stock markets then these markets are efficient in the long-run because the existence of cointegrated vector implies the (LOOP). Therefore, little or no arbitrage opportunities or possible benefit can be achieved from the diversification of a portfolio across markets. However, with the short-run error correction model (ECM), there could exist arbitrage opportunities and possible benefits from diversification. That is, the LOOP may not hold in the short run. The results of Granger-causality test based on the vector error correction model (VECM) reveal the existence of short-run causal relationships among the MENA markets. This means that these markets influence each other. Also, the results show that developed markets influenced stock markets in the MENA region. In the short-run, there is unidirectional Granger-causality running from stock prices in Turkey, Morocco, the US and UK to Egypt. Also, there is unidirectional Granger-causality running from Germany and the US towards Turkey. In addition, The UK and Turkey are found to Granger-cause the stock prices in Jordan. Finally, there is a unidirectional Grangercausality from Germany to Morocco. Finally, despite the empirical results show that there is a possibility of an increase in the portfolio equity flow to the MENA stock markets, the statistics of portfolio equity flow show little portfolio inflow to the region from developed countries over the period of study. Some of the reasons behind this situation are that most of these markets are still from some perspective underdeveloped, vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks and political instability in the region. Based on this, the study suggests that huge efforts should be carried on to improve the institutional reforms in these markets and increase the degree of openness for foreign capital. Also increasing the markets capitalization and adopting new technology are very crucial factors for attracting equity portfolio to the region...|$|R
