50|$|Industrial and {{multiphase}} {{plugs and sockets}} {{provide a}} connection to the electrical mains rated at higher voltages and currents than household plugs and sockets. They are generally used in polyphase systems, with high currents, or when protection from environmental hazards is required. Industrial outlets may have weatherproof covers, waterproofing sleeves, or may <b>be</b> <b>interlocked</b> with a switch to prevent accidental disconnection of an energized plug. Some types of connectors are approved for hazardous areas such as coal mines or petrochemical plants, where flammable gas may be present.|$|E

Because security systems are often deliberately sabotaged, at least some detectors or cameras should have battery backup and wireless connectivity and the ability to trigger alarms when disconnected. Modern systems typically use power-over-Ethernet (which can operate a pan-tilt-zoom camera and other devices up to 30-90 watts) which is capable of charging such batteries and keeps wireless networks free for genuinely wireless applications, such as backup communication in outage.|$|E

5000|$|In 1873 {{a signal}} box was {{opened at the}} west end of the Bristol-bound {{platform}} to control trains through the station; until then signals had been worked independently but they were now all able to <b>be</b> <b>interlocked</b> to prevent conflicting moves. A footbridge was provided from 1880 to allow passengers to cross the tracks, but a road bridge was also available at the east end of the station. [...] June 1874 saw a third rail laid along each track to give a mixed gauge which allowed [...] standard gauge trains to operate through the station, although broad gauge services to Cornwall continued to operate until May 1892.|$|E
5000|$|A metal zipper {{consists}} of two rows of protruding teeth made of metal. The metal teeth may be made of Brass, Aluminium or Nickel, and {{they are designed to}} interlock like clasped hands, linking the rows, thus creating a [...] "Continuous Clothing Closure" [...] as Elias Howe would have referred to it. For this to be possible, the metal zipper is usually fitted with a slider, often made of metal. The slider is operated by hand, and depending on the direction of its movement, the two rows of protruding metal teeth will either <b>be</b> <b>interlocked</b> or separated. This allows for full of partial fastening of the zipper depending on the user's preference.|$|E

The polygons <b>are</b> <b>interlocked</b> if no subset can be separated arbitrarily far from the rest. It is natural to ask the characterization of the subsets that makes the set of interlocked polygons free (not interlocked). This abstracts the essence of a kind of sliding block puzzle. We show that any monotone Boolean function f on n variables can be described by m = O(n) interlocked polygons. We also show that the decision problem that asks if given polygons <b>are</b> <b>interlocked</b> <b>is</b> PSPACE-complete...|$|R

50|$|Finally, {{the awkward}} layout of tablet instruments, signals and points levers at Abermule {{meant that it}} was {{possible}} for conflicting movements to be made. The inquiry recommended that tablet machines be placed in the signal box under the sole control of the signalman, and also that starting signals (which gave trains authority to leave the station) <b>be</b> <b>interlocked</b> with the tablet instruments, so that they could not be cleared until the correct tablet had been released. However, this would involve the rebuilding of the station buildings and signal boxes at Abermule and several other small stations, and it was suggested that alternate single-line sections use the electric tablet system and the older electric staff system; there would be no possibility of mistaking a staff for a tablet. The signalling method continued in use on the line until 1988, when it was replaced by the radio-controlled electronic token block system.|$|E
50|$|The birch bark {{itself does}} not form {{the top layer of}} the roof. Once the main log frame of the {{building}} is constructed, the main horizontal roof poles are laid down; after this comes thin timber slats placed at right-angles to the base roof poles. On top of these then come the layers of birch-bark, each row overlapping the next. The number of layers could vary from 2 to 6 depending on the building. On top of the birch-bark layers were then placed long heavy wooden poles (usually de-barked young trees). The poles {{on either side of the}} pitched roof would <b>be</b> <b>interlocked</b> at the roof ridge. The poles were held in place at the eaves by an eaves board. The poles nearest the end gable would further be fixed with tree-root bindings. Furthermore, rocks were often placed on the roof to further add weight. Alternatively, though less common, turf would be placed above the birch bark.|$|E

5000|$|To {{coordinate}} signals so that {{is impossible}} to give a [...] "clear" [...] signal to a train unless the route is actually clear, the signals could <b>be</b> <b>interlocked.</b> An interlocked yard is a railway yard where semaphore or coloured light signals are controlled {{in such a way}} that the signals will not allow a train to proceed unless the points that operate in conjunction with the signals are correctly set. A mechanical interlocking device, located under a mechanical signal frame, is a system of rods, sliding bars and levers that are configured so that points cannot be changed in conflict, thus preventing movements that may cause a collision or other accident. For example, unless two levers for a section of main line running past a loop siding are set to [...] "stop" [...] (clearing that section of main line), then a third lever controlling the points for the loop siding cannot be moved, and any train on the siding cannot enter the main line.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, major {{crossings}} were normally situated {{within easy}} {{sight of a}} signal box, and usually directly adjacent to the signal box, {{to ensure that the}} signalman could verify that the road was clear before allowing a train onto the crossing by switching the semaphore signals to clear. The traditional form of road crossing on British railways from the mid-19th century consisted of two or four wooden gates (one or two {{on each side of the}} railway). These prevented road traffic from crossing when closed, and when open lay across the railway to prevent horses and livestock inadvertently escaping from the road to the railway. Originally the signalman (or an assistant) had to leave the box in order to open or close the gates but from the late 19th century mechanical systems were developed whereby turning a wheel in the box manually operated the gates. This also allowed the crossing gates to <b>be</b> <b>interlocked</b> with the signal controls, making the crossing quicker in operation and increasing safety. Where a signal box was not nearby but road traffic still warranted a full gated crossing a dedicated crossing keeper would be employed, often living in a railway-owned cottage adjacent to the crossing and in communication with the signal boxes via the telegraph system. Many of these still exist as user-worked crossings, although these are regularly misused and accidents are frequent.|$|E
50|$|Many gated {{crossings}} {{have been}} replaced by lifting barriers, which are easier to mechanise. These consist of barriers each side of the track which block the full width of the road and had two red lights that alternatively flashed, as well as an audible alarm or bell. In 1955 various European automatic crossings were visited and checked by two inspecting officers and two road engineers from the Ministry of Transport, as well as two officers from the British Transport Commission visited 46 crossings in 10 days in three countries. The report was signed on 14 March 1957, and automatic and automated crossings came into use, with the first automatically operated level crossing commencing operation at Spath near Uttoxeter in Staffordshire in May 1961. Automatic half-barrier crossings later came into being after another enquiry abroad in 1963, consisting of a single arm each side of the road, which block only oncoming traffic leaving the exits clear for trapped occupants. Half barriers were considered to have an advantage as they have a lesser closure time and do not require to <b>be</b> <b>interlocked</b> with signals, but cases where impatient motorists have driven around the barriers have raised safety concerns. On lightly-used railways such as the Heart of Wales Line, many crossings are sited next to station stops or other stopping points, and were made to be crew operated. The guard pushes a plunger to operate the crossing, and on completion of the crossing sequence, the train can cross. These trainman operated crossings (TMOs) still exist today.|$|E
