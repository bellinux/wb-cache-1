Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.|$|E

5|$|Coverage of {{this event}} varied {{significantly}} between Nashville's two major newspapers. The Tennessean emphasized the mayor's agreement that lunch counters should be desegregated, while the Nashville Banner emphasized the mayor's statement that {{it was up to}} the city's merchants to decide whether to desegregate. This was largely indicative of the two papers' opposing stances on the issue. Regardless, the mayor's response was later cited as an important turning point by both activists and Nashville <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of <b>business</b> <b>owners)</b> and believed that there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v.

5|$|In the 1870s and 1880s {{there was}} {{considerable}} tension in the region—between the rural residents, who were {{for the most part}} Democrats from the agricultural South, and town residents and <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> who were largely Republicans from the industrial Northeast and Midwest. The tension culminated in what has been called the Cochise County feud, and the Earp-Clanton feud, which ended with the historic Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Ride.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E

He was sentenced to 64months in federal prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} {{profitable}} {{for the first}} time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm.

5|$|The {{implementation}} of SBS on the Woodhaven/Cross Bay corridor {{has been supported}} by transit advocates and bus riders, particularly those in the Rockaways.

Much of the opposition has been due to the {{implementation of}} bus lanes {{down the center of the}} boulevard, which could cause increased traffic congestion. The plan in April 2015 would have prohibited left-turns at twelve intersections.|$|E

5|$|After leaving office, Talbot {{continued}} in public service, {{serving on the}} Health Committee of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, Lunacy, and Charity from 1880–84, holding {{the chair of the}} committee in 1880-82. As governor, Talbot had overseen the merger of the Board of Health, with the Board of Lunacy and Charity. Although this merger had been done ostensibly as a cost-saving measure, health care activists opposed it. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch, in particular, resigned from the merged board, complaining that it was dominated by <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> seeking to minimize discussion of pollution caused by their businesses.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer.

Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.|$|E
