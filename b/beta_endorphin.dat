40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In animal {{models of}} circulatory shock and heart failure {{concentrations}} of the endogenous opioid peptide <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> are raised and opioid receptor blockade improves haemodynamic variables and survival. This study {{was performed to}} identify whether acute myocardial ischaemia provokes the release of <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> in humans. METHODS [...] Observational study in a university cardiology centre. Serial measurements of <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> made by specific radioimmunoassay were correlated with other clinical and neuroendocrine variables that were measured prospectively. Fifty five patients with acute myocardial ischaemia and 26 patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery were studied. RESULTS [...] <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations were raised above the upper limit of normal in 31 / 42 (74 %) patients with confirmed myocardial infarction, 3 / 13 (23 %) patients with unstable angina, and 10 / 24 (42 %) patients after coronary angioplasty. There {{was no evidence of}} myocardial release of <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin.</b> There were significant positive correlations between <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> and the concentrations of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, cortisol, and arginine vasopressin. In patients with acute myocardial ischaemia there was a significant positive correlation between the peak concentrations of creatine kinase and <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> but no correlation with visual analogue scores of the intensity of chest pain. The highest <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations were seen in patients whose clinical course was complicated by the development of heart failure. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> release is a component of the neuroendocrine activation associated with myocardial ischaemia/infarction...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic human <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> shows a biphasic {{effect on}} the {{production}} of specific anti-herpes viral antibodies in vitro. At higher concentrations antibody production is reduced, at lower concentrations it is enhanced. In a proportion of donors whose cells do not produce specific antibody when cultured with antigen alone, the lower concentrations of <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> allow antigen-driven specific antibody production to occur. Specific anti-herpes viral antibodies are also made by natural killer (NK) cell-depleted populations from the same non-producer donors. <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> also exerts biphasic effects on NK, although {{the direction of the}} modulation is a mirror image of the effects on antibody production.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Endogenous opioids have a tonic {{inhibitory}} effect on sympathetic tone {{and have been}} implicated in the pathophysiology of vasodepressor syncope. Plasma <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations increase after vasodepressor syncope induced by exercise or by fasting. AIMS [...] To take frequent samples for plasma <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> estimation during tilt testing, and to determine whether plasma <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> increased {{before the start of}} syncope. PATIENTS [...] 24 patients undergoing tilt testing for investigation of unexplained syncope. SETTING [...] Tertiary referral centre. METHODS [...] Blood samples were obtained during 70 degrees head up tilt testing. Plasma <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations were estimated by radioimmunoassay (mean(SD) pmol/l). RESULTS [...] Patients with a positive test showed a rise in <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations before syncope (baseline 4. 4 (1. 5) v start of syncope 8. 5 (3. 1), p < 0. 002). In contrast, patients with a negative test showed no change in <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations (baseline 3. 4 (1. 0) v end of test 4. 5 (2. 3), NS). After syncope all patients showed a large secondary increase in beta endorphins (32. 3 (18. 6)). CONCLUSION [...] An increase in plasma beta endorphins precedes vasodepressor syncope.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In a canine {{model of}} {{congestive}} heart failure <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations were high and opioid receptor antagonists exerted beneficial haemodynamic effects. In humans previous studies have suggested that opioid peptides may modify the perception of breathlessness and fatigue in heart failure. METHODS [...] Plasma concentrations of <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> were measured in patients with acute and chronic heart failure and cardiogenic shock. A subgroup of eight patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV heart failure was assessed for acute haemodynamic effects of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist. A separate group of 10 patients with class II-III heart failure, was randomised to a double blind placebo controlled study of the effects of intravenous naloxone on cardiopulmonary exercise performance. RESULTS [...] Plasma concentrations of <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> were usually normal in patients with chronic heart failure and did not correlate with severity as assessed by NYHA class. In 29 % of patients with acute heart failure and 71 % of those with cardiogenic shock <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations were high. The median concentration in the cardiogenic shock group was significantly higher than in either of the two heart failure groups and there was some evidence of a relation between <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> concentrations and survival. At the doses tested, naloxone was unable to modify systemic haemodynamics, exercise performance, or symptoms in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{stress hormone}} {{response}} in traumatised patients {{studied at the}} site of injury and on their way to hospital. METHODS: The study was prospective. Blood samples were taken from 77 patients immediately after the arrival of the emergency physician {{at the site of}} the accident (t 1) and shortly before patients' admission to hospital (t 2). Plasma concentrations of <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin,</b> cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, and growth hormone were measured. RESULTS: Trauma in out-of-hospital patients resulted in remarkably increased concentration of growth hormone within minutes. ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin were only moderately increased. No significant correlations were found between hormone levels and blood pressure or heart rate. The plasma ACTH concentration was significantly lower before admission to hospital than immediately after the accident. Plasma cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone concentrations were not significantly different between the two points of observation. In samples taken immediately after the accident (t 1), there was a positive correlation between both <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> and prolactin and the injury severity score, whereas cortisol levels were negatively correlated with injury severity score, suggesting impaired cortisol release from the adrenal cortex after severe injury. At t 1 ACTH was correlated with cortisol and <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin.</b> Patients with head injuries had hormone concentrations similar to those without head injuries but with a similar injury severity score from injuries in other parts of the body.

The patients were catheterised and treated with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on two occasions, double blind and in random order, with a single intravenous dose of saline or with a single intravenous dose of 50 mg naloxone. Treatment with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation increased tolerance to pacing and significantly improved lactate metabolism with placebo and with naloxone. The positive effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation were thus reproducible and not reversed by single intravenous doses of naloxone. The results indicate that the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on the heart are not mediated by <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> but they do not exclude activation of more short-acting opioids such as delta or kappa receptor agonists (met-enkephalin or dynorphin or both) because naloxone has a low affinity for these receptors.

40|$|ACTH, beta lipotropin (beta LPH), <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> (beta EP), Prolactin (PRL) and Cortisol were {{measured}} {{in the first five}} days of puerperium at 9 : 00, before and 30 minutes after suckling, in 7 healthy lactating women. With the exception of PRL plasma levels which decline, although remaining at high concentrations during the observation period, all the other parameters showed a sudden fall from the high levels found at delivery, reaching stable normal levels (beta LPH, beta EP, Cortisol) or concentrations which were 50 % lower than normal (ACTH), from the second day of puerperium. Suckling confirms its capacity to release plasma PRL, while all the other indices remain unmodified. Despite the experimental evidence that serotoninergic neurons are involved both in the PRL response to suckling and the circadian rhythmicity and stress response of proopiocortin-related peptides, the present results suggest that breast feeding is not a stressful situation, as no typical proopiocortin-related peptide response is evident, and that the activation of PRL release is related to stimulation of serotoninergic neurons which differ from those involved in the control of proopiocortin-related peptide secretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is an {{investigation}} {{of the results of the}} studies on the effects of acupuncture application therapy on obesity. It has been reported that acu-puncture application in obesity treatment is effective in procuring weight loss. It can affect appetite, intestinal motility, and metabolism, as well as emotional factors such as stress. Increases in neural activity in the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, in tone in the smooth muscle of the stomach and in levels of enkephalin, <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin,</b> and serotonin in plasma and brain tissue have also been observed with the application of acupuncture. It has been observed that acupuncture application to obese people increases excitability of the satiety center in the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. Acupuncture stimulates the auricular branch of the vagal nerve and raises serotonin levels. Both of these activities have been shown to increase tone in the smooth muscle of the stomach, thus suppressing appetite. Among other things, serotonin enhances intestinal motility. It also controls stress and depression via endorphin an...|$|E
40|$|A mouse {{anterior}} pituitary {{tumor cell}} line (AtT- 20) that secretes adrenocorticotropin and <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> sorts the proteins it transports {{to the surface}} into two exocytotic pathways. AtT- 20 cells also synthesize a secretory granule-specific sulfated molecule and secrete it on stimulation (Moore, H. -P., B. Gumbiner, and R. B. Kelly, 1983, J. Cell Biol., 97 : 810 - 817). We show here that this molecule is sensitive to proteolysis and that the residual sulfated material co-migrates with a chondroitin sulfate standard on thin-layer electrophoresis. Furthermore, this sulfated molecule is completely sensitive to chondroitinase ABC digestion. Thus the secretory granule-specific sulfated molecule is a proteoglycan with chondroitin sulfate side chains. We examined the role of proteoglycans in the sorting and secretion of adrenocorticotropin in AtT- 20 cells by severely decreasing the amount of this vesicle-specific proteoglycan in two ways. First, a xyloside was used to inhibit proteoglycan biosynthesis; second, {{a variant of the}} AtT- 20 cell line was isolated that synthesized little of the sulfated proteoglycan. In neither case was the sorting or secretion of adrenocorticotropin detectably altered, suggesting that the proteoglycan is not required for these processes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> (beta-END) is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} significant endogenous neuropeptides, responsible for a wide range of biological activities in the body. However, within the body beta-END is exposed to hydrolysis by a variety of enzymes. In this study, we investigated the metabolism and fragmentation pattern of beta-END in rat inflamed tissue, in rat serum and in trypsin solution. beta-END (1 - 31) -rat was incubated at 37 A degrees C in each matrix for different incubation times. The resultant fragments were separated using a C 4 column and detected by mass spectrometry using total ion current mode. Structural information for the fragments was elucidated using tandem mass spectrometry. Incubation of beta-END (1 - 31) -rat in trypsin solution and in rat serum resulted in 8 and 13 fragments, respectively. Incubation in inflamed rat paw tissue resulted in 22 fragments at pH 7. 4 and 26 fragments at pH 5. 5. Some of these fragments were common to both pH values. The degradation of beta-END (1 - 31) -rat in inflamed tissue at pH 5. 5 was faster than that at pH 7. 4. Secondary fragmentation of some larger primary fragments was also observed in this study...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} need for, and the {{suitability}} of, alfentanil for pain relief during tracheal suction used in assisted ventilation in newborn infants. METHODS: In a randomised, controlled, double blind, crossover trial, placebo (10 micrograms/kg) and 20 micrograms/kg alfentanil were infused in random order two minutes before three separate endotracheal suctions, {{at least six}} hours apart, to 10 infants. Measurements were made of physiological variables, behaviour, and stress hormones. RESULTS: After placebo infusion heart rate significantly increased (median 14; interquartile range 12 - 16 beats/minute) as did behavioural pain score (5; 3 - 5). Alfentanil (20 micrograms/kg) attenuated the heart rate increase, normalised the pain score, and caused a decrease in plasma adrenaline activity (0. 3; 0. 2 - 0. 7 nmol/l). Noradrenaline concentration showed a nonsignificant decreasing trend with increasing alfentanil dose and <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> was unchanged. Rigidity was noted in the placebo (n = 2), 10 micrograms/kg (n = 2), and 20 micrograms/kg (n = 5) alfentanil groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheal suction is a painful procedure. The dose of alfentanil required for pain relief (20 micrograms/kg) causes {{a high incidence of}} rigidity and thus should be used only with muscle relaxant...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} the influence of breathing exercise to ward IgG, <b>Beta</b> <b>Endorphin</b> and Blood Glucose Secretion In The Elderly. This is experimental research with the pretest–posttest design. The sample used the elderly 10 men aged 35 - 45 years. The unit of analysis {{in this study was}} blood taken from cubity vein, checking the blood glucose levels used glucometer, beta-endorphin and IgG used ELISA method. Data analysis statistics using the SPSS for windows, was conducted the t-tests. The results showed that based on the statistical analysis, IgG significantly (p: 0. 013). The mean increase in IgG was 33. 266 ng/mL, beta-endorphin significantly (p: 0. 000). The mean increase in endorphin was 3. 922 ng/mL, and the decrease of blood glucose showed significant (p: 0. 000). The mean decrease in blood glucose levels was 28. 9 mg/ 100 ml. Blood glucose levels showed a decline after the breathing exercise. Conclusion, It can be concluded that regular, targeted and programmed breathing exercise seven week can increased the secretion of IgG and beta endorphins, as well as decreasing blood glucose levels. Breathing exercise are alternative sports to improve immunity...|$|E
40|$|The intracerebroventricular {{administration}} of prototype nonpeptide opioid receptor (mu, kappa, and sigma) agonists, morphine, ketocyclazocine, and N-allyl normetazocine and an agonist at both kappa and sigma receptors, pentazocine, {{was found to}} induce hyperthermia in guinea pigs. The similar {{administration of}} peptide opioids like <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin,</b> methionine endkephalin, leucine endkephaline, and several of their synthetic analogues was also found to cause hyperthermia. Only the liver-like transport system of the three anion transport systems (iodide, hippurate, and liver-like) present in the choroid plexus {{was determined to be}} important to the central inactivation of beta-endorphin and two synthetic analogues. Prostaglandins and norepinephrine (NE) as well as cAMP were not involved in peptide and nonpeptide opioid-induced hyperthermia. Naloxone-sensitive receptors were found {{to be involved in the}} induction of hyperthermia by morphine and beta-endorphin, while hyperthermic responses to ketocyclazocine, N-allyl normetazocine, pentazocine, Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin, and two of the synthetic analogues were not antagonized by nalozone. The lack of antagonism of naloxone on pyrogen, arachidonic acid, PGE 2, dibutyryl cAMP, and NE-induced hyperthermia shows that endogenous opioid peptides are not likely to be central mediators of the hyperthermia induced by these agents...|$|E

The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate effect of endurance training on plasma <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> (BA) changes in active and sedentary girls. 12 healthy physical education students as active group (n = 12, active group with, 21. 6 ± 0. 6 year age, 162. 25 ± 3. 68 cm in height, and 54. 13 ± 6. 35 kg, weight) and 12 healthy non physical education as sedentary group (n = 12, sedentary group, age 20. 55 ± 0. 69 year, high, 161. 40 ± 3. 14 cm, weight, 59. 25 ± 4. 45 kg) requited. Subjects entered the study on their usual diet and after familiarization with training protocol, Bruce test (treadmill test) as aerobic test applied. The blood sample was collected before and after training in both groups. Beta-endorphin concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay kits. The analyses and data processing showed that there is no significant difference within active (0. 77 ± 0. 1 pmol/l) and sedentary group (0. 82 ± 0. 01 pmol/l) in basal BE at rest. The BE levels after endurance training in active group and sedentary group increase respectively (0. 83 ± 0. 09 pmol/l), (compared with basal) however, significant difference was found between pre and post test group in active group (P > 0. 05). In this research, BE secretion increased in response to endurance exercise both in active and sedentary girls...|$|E
40|$|EEG {{biofeedback}} (neurotherapy) {{has been}} demonstrated as effective {{in the treatment of}} alcoholism, as evidenced by Peniston and Kulkosky's research efforts. These neurotherapy pioneers evaluated the efficacy of alpha-theta brain wave biofeedback as a treatment for chronic alcohol abuse, citing 80 % abstinence rates as measured by improvements in psychopathology, serum <b>beta</b> <b>endorphin</b> levels, and long-term alcohol abstinence. Most research with alpha-theta EEG biofeedback has addressed alcohol addiction. Cocaine is now considered to be the most common drug problem of patients entering treatment for drug abuse. To date, only one controlled study has been published that researched alpha-theta neurofeedback in the treatment of "crack" cocaine addiction. The present study was an extension of a 4 -year EEG-biofeedback treatment outcome project underway at a faith-based homeless mission in Houston, Texas, with male "crack" cocaine addicts. Changes in personality, attention, and impulsivity were measured following 30 sessions of a non-individualized EEG -biofeedback protocol. Experimental subjects received a variant of the Peniston-Kulkosky alpha-theta protocol for 30 sessions while controls received all elements of the experimental protocol except the EEG biofeedback. Assessment measures included the MMPI- 2 and the IVA. Although experimental subjects showed greater mean improvement on most MMPI basic scales and all IVA Attention related measures, results indicated no significant differences between control and experimental groups. The present study did not result in significant differences between control and experimental groups on attentional or personality variables in crack cocaine addicts. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed...|$|E
