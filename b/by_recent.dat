5|$|Victoria {{is roughly}} {{described}} as the area around Victoria station. It includes the conservation areas of Broadway and Christchurch Gardens, Grosvenor Gardens and the environs of Westminster Cathedral. Particularly noteworthy examples of architectural sculpture {{can be found at}} 55 Broadway, where in 1928–1929 sculptors including Eric Gill and Henry Moore were engaged on representations of the Four Winds; two further figures, Night and Day, were carved by Jacob Epstein. A great deal of public art <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> graduates of art schools in London was incorporated into Cardinal Place, a development of 2005.|$|E
5|$|Among the key {{indicators}} of Christianisation are long-cist cemeteries that generally indicate Christian burials {{due to their}} East-West orientation, although this correlation has been challenged <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> research. These burials are found {{between the end of}} the Roman era and the 7th century, after which point they become rarer. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the Tay, in Angus, the Mearns, Lothian and the Borders. It is generally accepted among scholars that place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period, most of which are located in the south-west, south and east. About a dozen inscribed stones of the 5th and 6th centuries, beginning with the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to c. 450, indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E

5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|Formal gardens {{were laid}} out around the house by W. A. Nesfield in around 1840–50 for Hungerford Crewe. Nesfield's design {{included}} statuary, gravelled walks and elaborate parterres realised using low box hedges and coloured minerals. Balustraded terraces were also constructed on {{the north and south}} sides of the hall, probably designed by E. M. Barry, and incorporating statues of lions, griffins and other heraldic beasts, echoing the interior staircase. Military usage during the Second World War, however, destroyed parts of the gardens; army buildings were erected near the house, and the area in front of the hall served as a parade ground and later was ploughed up to grow potatoes. The grounds were further neglected while the house was used as offices, and little has survived except the terraces, gates and statues. In 2009, English Heritage placed the hall on the Heritage at Risk Register as highly vulnerable, considering that the historic character of the gardens and park is compromised <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> developments to the hotel complex, in particular the conference centre, spa and associated parking area.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the Labour {{government}} in Britain, exhausted <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> {{events such as}} World War II and numerous riots, realized that it had neither the mandate at home, the support internationally, nor {{the reliability of the}} British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India. The reliability of the native forces for continuing their control over an increasingly rebellious India diminished, and so the government decided to end the British rule of the Indian Subcontinent. In 1946, the Indian National Congress, being a secular party, demanded a single state. The Muslim majorities, who disagreed with the idea of single state, stressed the idea of a separate Pakistan as an alternative. The 1946 Cabinet Mission to India was sent to try to reach a compromise between Congress and the Muslim League, proposing a decentralized state with much power given to local governments, but it was rejected by both of the parties and resulted in a number of riots in South Asia.|$|E

5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Poland made a {{recovery}} under Mieszko's son, Duke Casimir I (r. 1039–1058), known to {{history as the}} Restorer. After returning from exile in 1039, Casimir rebuilt the Polish monarchy and the country's territorial integrity through several military campaigns: in 1047, Masovia was taken back from Miecław, a Polish noble who tried to detach the region from {{the rule of the}} Polish monarch, and in 1054 Silesia was recovered from the Czechs. Casimir was aided <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland left after the dismemberment of the country beginning in the reign of Mieszko II. Casimir introduced a more mature form of feudalism and relieved the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury by settling his warriors on feudal estates. Faced with the widespread destruction of Greater Poland after the Czech incursion, Casimir moved his court to Kraków and replaced the old Piast capitals of Poznań and Gniezno; Kraków would function as the nation's capital for several centuries.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used <b>by</b> <b>recent</b> {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
