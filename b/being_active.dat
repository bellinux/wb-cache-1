5|$|Crypsis means {{making the}} animal or {{military}} equipment {{hard to see}} (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent). Visual crypsis can be achieved in many different ways, such as by living underground or by <b>being</b> <b>active</b> only at night, {{as well as by}} a variety of methods of camouflage.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Longinus {{sent the}} royal {{treasure}} and Albsuinda to Constantinople, the Empire's capital, together with Helmichis' forces, which {{were to become}} Byzantine mercenaries. This was a common Byzantine strategy, already applied previously to the Ostrogoths, by which large national contingents were relocated {{to be used in}} other theatres. These are believed to be the same 60,000 Lombards that are attested by John of Ephesus as <b>being</b> <b>active</b> in Syria in 575 against the Persians. As for Albsuinda, the Byzantine diplomacy probably aimed to use her as a political tool to impose a pro-Byzantine king on the Lombards. According to Agnellus, once Longinus' actions {{came to the attention of}} emperor Justin II they were greatly praised, and the emperor gave lavish gifts to his official.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of pterosaurs. The pterosaur genera Pterodactylus, Scaphognathus, and Tupuxuara have been inferred to be diurnal, Ctenochasma, Pterodaustro, and Rhamphorhynchus have been inferred to be nocturnal, and Tapejara has been inferred to be cathemeral, <b>being</b> <b>active</b> throughout the day for short intervals. As a result, the possibly fish-eating Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus may have had similar activity patterns to modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding Pterodaustro may have had similar activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs Ctenochasma, Rhamphorhynchus, Scaphognathus, and Pterodactylus may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.|$|E
5|$|Neither the origins, ethnic makeup, nor {{early history}} of the Khitans are well {{documented}} in historical records. The earliest reference to a Khitan state {{is found in the}} Book of Wei, a history of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386–534) that was completed in 554. Several books written after 554 mention the Khitans as <b>being</b> <b>active</b> during the late third and early fourth centuries. The Book of Jin (648), a history of the Jin dynasty (265–420), refers to the Khitans in the section covering the reign of Murong Sheng (398–401). Samguk Sagi (1145), a history of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, mentions a Khitan raid taking place in 378.|$|E
5|$|The animal faces {{a variety}} of {{critical}} threats. Poaching {{has long been a}} problem. Statistics show between 1959 and 1969 Amazonian Brazil alone accounted for 1,000 to 3,000 pelts annually. The species was so thoroughly decimated, the number dropped to just 12 in 1971. The implementation of CITES in 1973 finally brought about significant hunting reductions, although demand did not disappear entirely: in the 1980s, pelt prices were as high as US$250 on the European market. The threat has been exacerbated by the otters' relative fearlessness and tendency to approach human beings. They are extremely easy to hunt, <b>being</b> <b>active</b> through the day and highly inquisitive. The animal's relatively late sexual maturity and complex social life makes hunting especially disastrous.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Amelia was a weak, poorly {{organized}} {{tropical storm}} that formed during the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season. Amelia developed from a tropical wave that {{moved through the}} Atlantic Ocean uneventfully. The disturbance then entered {{an area of the}} Gulf of Mexico that was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis and became the first tropical depression of the season, after which it was forecast to make landfall before any significant intensification. However, the tropical depression defied predictions, quickly strengthening into a weak tropical storm just hours before making landfall in Corpus Christi. The storm lasted roughly a day over land before becoming unidentifiable after <b>being</b> <b>active</b> for just under 48hours. After dissipating, the storm caused a severe flooding disaster in Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Eskimos {{utilized}} {{a committee}} of running backs, with McCarty, Daniel Porter, and Jerome Messam all receiving significant playing time. McCarty was used mostly in short-yardage situations on the ground, while also <b>being</b> <b>active</b> as a receiver and on special teams. He played in 18 games, made eight starts, and finished with 209 yards on 52 carries with no touchdowns. He also caught 22 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. McCarty played in both of the Eskimos' playoff games. In the West Semi-Finals against the Stampeders, he rushed for a goal-line touchdown, in addition to making three receptions and two special-teams tackles. McCarty played a more limited role in the West Finals against the BC Lions, where he was given only one carry for six yards, made one tackle on special teams, and caught two passes {{for a total of}} four yards.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos <b>being</b> <b>active</b> at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E

5|$|Saint Anselm offers over 100 student {{organizations}} on campus, including arts & culture organizations, performance groups, sports groups, political organizations, religious organizations, {{and social}} action groups. The Student Activities Office encourages {{and is available}} for students wishing to develop an organization not yet established at Saint Anselm. Clubs on campus include The Knights of Columbus, Alpha Phi Omega, Abbey Players, Campus Activities Board, Classics Society, The History Society, Democrats, Republicans, Green Team, Italian Club, Dance Club, Muslim Student Association, Jazz Band, Organization for Life, Mock Trial, Psychology Club, and Yearbook Club. An example of the college students <b>being</b> <b>active</b> in the local community is that the Saint Anselm College Knights of Columbus, Council 4785 in Manchester, New Hampshire won the 2009–2010 National Community Activity Award for creating a comprehensive recycling program at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women. The Campus Activities Board (CAB), a student-run organization, runs several committees that oversee campus-wide activities and student services. In 2008, CAB organized singer Howie Day, in 2009, the band Third Eye Blind performed at the college. Jason Derulo and Matt Nathanson performed there in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The large eyes of Protoceratops {{has been}} {{suggested}} as evidence for a nocturnal lifestyle. However, subsequent comparisons between the scleral rings of Protoceratops and modern birds and reptiles have indicated a more cathemeral lifestyle, <b>being</b> <b>active</b> throughout the day during short intervals.

Support for efficacy and mattering specifically focuses on youth <b>being</b> <b>active,</b> instrumental agents of change in their communities, collective decision-making and adults listen to and respect their voice.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{responses}} to escape predation include burrowing into substrate and <b>being</b> <b>active</b> {{only through a}} restricted period of the day. Furthermore, insects may feign death, a response termed thanatosis. Beetles, particularly weevils, are especially fond {{of this sort of}} acting. Bright colors may also be flashed underneath cryptic ones. A startle display occurs when prey takes advantage of these markings after being discovered by a predator. The striking color pattern, which often includes eyespots, is intended to evoke prompt enemy retreat. Better formed eyespots seem to result in better deterrence.|$|E
25|$|Many of today's Biblical scholars, such as N. T. Wright, in {{tracing the}} concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots, see Earth and Heaven as {{overlapping}} or interlocking. Heaven is known as God's space, his dimension, {{and is not a}} place that can be reached by human technology. This belief states that Heaven is where God lives and reigns whilst <b>being</b> <b>active</b> and working alongside people on Earth. One day when God restores all things, Heaven and Earth will be forever combined into the New Heavens and New Earth of the World to Come.|$|E
