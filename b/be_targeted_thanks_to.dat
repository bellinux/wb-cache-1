40|$|Nowadays each {{manufacturers}} of racing cars must pass specific crash tests controlled by legislation, before seeing their {{vehicles in the}} market and in motor racing. In order to ensure the driver’s safety in case of high-speed crashes, special impact structures must be designed to absorb the race car’s kinetic energy and limit the decelerations acting on the human body. This <b>target</b> <b>is</b> achieved <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> the synergy between the numerical and experimental analysis. Investigated in this work is the best solution, in terms of energy absorption, for a specific frontal impact attenuator in CFRP material with sandwich structure. In particular, given the geometry reported by the manufacturer, it has been necessary to find the right combination of material and lamination varying the stacking sequence and its disposition. Analyses have been conducted by the joining of numerical models, performed using LSDYNA, with experimental tests, through an instrumented drop tower equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{stereoselective}} group 4 catalysts for the fine tuning of polyolefins microstructure <b>is</b> a challenging <b>target</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> {{the development of}} metallocene and postmetallocene systems. The main interactions leading to the enantioselective processes are predominantly steric in nature although several attempts to modify this general framework (e. g. by electronic factors) have been reported. Within the various strategies, the “directional site epimerization promoted electronically” published by Kol et al. immediately appeared {{as one of the}} most promising approaches, allowing for the synthesis of polypropylene samples with high isotacticities as well as high control of degree of isotacticity. It consists basically in modify the regular chain migration mechanism by placing donors of different trans influence trans to the two coordination sites in an octahedral environment. The system used is a salalen ligands, with halfsalan O,N,N donors bind in a fac mode and the half-salen O,N,N donors bind in a mer mode the metal active site (see Chart 1 A). The difference with respect to the salan ligands wrapping with a fac-fac geometry (see Chart 1 B) might allow to interplay with both steric and electronic factors. In this communication we will report about our extensive study by using DFT calculations on the propene polymerization mechanisms promoted by salan and salalen ligands. Our results offer an alternative interpretation of the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} researches in progress at Biodesign Lab of Politecnico di Milano. The focus of these researches is to develop wearable devices designed around the body. The relation between human body and the new technologies (microtech and smart textile) is changing deeply and continually. It is essential to emphasise the need of developing an interdisciplinary approach amongst the different areas, their point of contact being, naturally, their interest in the human-being as a unicum and a complex entity. The design necessarily should drive these changes. It is fundamental for a product {{in close contact with}} human body to be totally adaptable to human anatomy. The wearables fix body silhouette inhibiting or making easier movements and postures through ergonomic and enveloping shapes. The research in wearable area is directed toward a new phase, where the attention is on the user desire and toward {{the creation of a new}} interdisciplinary sector, in which the various traditional disciplines are integrated. It is necessary to create interdisciplinary program, a field in which the researchers would learn a new scientific language that allows them to talk effectively and promote interdisciplinary capability recognized and legitimized in the proper discipline. Indeed, it is crucial that more researchers could participate in this multidisciplinary field, and that is the reason why the role of the industrial design is established. The development of the wearable device design needs to accomplish the requirements of comfort and adaptableness connected to the anatomy of human body. From this point of view, the wearable is not an overlapping structure or close architecture but an enveloping film, “a second skin”. The contribution of industrial design, in order to be innovative, will have to structure and analyze several intervention levels: methodologies approach and education. Into this scientific context has been introduced a new discipline - biodesign. Behind the main philosophical concept of Biodesign is the human body, considered as a psycho-biological unicum [1]. Research activities, therefore, aim at developing artificial devices which can be fully integrated into the human body. This <b>target</b> <b>is</b> achieved <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> an interdisciplinary approach aimed at fill the gap in wearable systems that sometimes just consider technological, functional and medical requirements but barely meet user needs. Biodesign approach considers and estimates human physical and psychical abilities, his limits and necessities. This feature, typical of wearables is connected to the primary target of research, so that improve comfort and wearability...|$|R
5000|$|The Italian Command {{intended}} {{to employ the}} special SM82s to bomb the English oil plants of Manama, in the Persian Gulf, {{in order to show}} the potential ability of the Italian air force. It was a long and difficult mission involving a 4,000 kilometre flight. Ettore Muti and his comrades spent four days working on a complete revision of the plans and established a complex flight plan....On December 18, at 5.10 pm, after filling both the normal and the supplementary tanks, they loaded three out of four SM82s with 1.5 tons of incendiary and explosive bombs weighing 15, 20 or 50 kilograms. Then the four three-engine bombers took off.In command of the first aircraft, which gained height with difficulty from the Rhodes- Gadurrà runway because it was overloaded with 19,500 kilograms, was Lieutenant Colonel Muti. He was assisted by Major Giovanni Raina and by Captain Paolo Moci, who had previous experience in flying planes overloaded up to 21 tons.....The SM82s, after gaining height (a manoeuvre which took remarkable efforts because of the enormous weight of the aircraft) headed east, flying over Cyprus, Lebanon and Syria, bending to the southeast as they went past Jordan and Iraq until they reached the Persian Gulf. During the very long outward flight, the role of Muti's SM82 pathfinder proved its essential function in leading the squadron..... At 2.20 am, just before reaching the Bahrain Islands, Lieutenant Colonel Federici's aircraft suddenly lost sight contact with Muti's SM82 and had to drop its bombs on different targets in the vicinity of Manama, while the other planes hit the fixed target. As bombardier Raina later told [...] "the operation of spotting the <b>target</b> <b>was</b> easy <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> the total illumination of the extractive and refinery plants" [...] which were partially damaged by the bombs (half a dozen wells and some oil deposits were set on fire). As soon as they perceived the glares of the first explosions, the Italian planes made off along the escape route landing to the Zula runway (Eritrea) at 8 8:40.The whole Italian formation had flown 2,400 kilometres in 15.30 hours. At the Eritrean airport, along with a small crowd of Italian aviators, the brave pilots found the fourth SM82 squadron which, in the meantime, had come from Rhodes as a support plane on the way back, should one of the crafts make an emergency landing in the desert.

40|$|One way {{to reach}} {{intracellular}} therapeutic targets in cells consists {{in the use of}} short nucleic acids which will bind specifically <b>to</b> on <b>targets</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> either Watson-Crick base pairing or protein nucleic acids recognition rules. Among these short nucleic acids an important class of therapeutic agents is antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs. However, the major problem of nucleic acids is their poor stability in biological media. One method, among others, to solve the stability problem is the use of colloidal carriers such as nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have already been applied with success to in vitro drug delivery to particular types of cells and in vivo in several experimental models. Many membrane and intracellular processes deal with nanosized structure (typically 100 nm) which are processed further through the recognition sites of receptors and enzymes. Thus non-viral nanoparticles are interesting candidates to present biochemical molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins to cells as well as to protect them in vivo during delivery. This review focuses on the recent developments in the design of nanotechnologies to improve the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs...|$|R

A synthetic brush copolymer, named PHEA-BIB-ButMA (PBB), was synthesized by Atom Trasnfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) starting from the Î±-poly(N- 2 -hydroxyethyl) -D,L-aspartamide (PHEA) and poly butyl methacrylate (ButMA). Empty and sorafenib loaded PBB NPs were, then, produced by using a dialysis method and showed spherical morphology, colloidal size, negative Î¶ potential and the ability to allow a sustained sorafenib release in physiological environment. Sorafenib loaded PBB NPs were tested in vitro on HCC cells in order to evaluate their cytocompatibility and anticancer efficacy if compared to free drug. Furthermore, the enhanced anticancer effect of sorafenib loaded PBB NPs was demonstrated in vivo by using a xenograft model, by first allowing Hep 3 B cells to grow subcutaneously into nude mice and then administering sorafenib as free drug or incorporated into NPs via intraperitoneal injection.

In IEEM technique, a broad (not focused) ion beam is sent onto the Device Under Test (DUT).

50|$|Riccioli {{also argued}} that the {{rotation}} of the Earth should reveal itself in the flight of artillery projectiles, because on a rotating Earth the ground moves at different speeds at different latitudes. He wrote that If a ball is fired along a Meridian toward the pole (rather than toward the East or West), diurnal motion will cause the ball to be carried off is, the trajectory of the ball will be deflected, all things being equal: for on parallels of latitude nearer the poles, the ground moves more slowly, whereas on parallels nearer the equator, the ground moves more rapidly. Therefore, were a cannon, aimed directly at a target to the north, to fire a ball, that ball would strike slightly to the east (right) of the <b>target,</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> the Earth's rotation. But, if the cannon were fired to the east there would be no deflection, as both cannon and target would move the same distance in the same direction. Riccioli said that the best of cannoneers could fire a ball right into the mouth of an enemy's cannon; if this deflection effect existed in northward shots they would have detected it. Riccioli argued that the absence of this effect indicated that the Earth does not rotate. He was correct in his reasoning in that the effect he describes actually does occur. It is known today as the Coriolis effect after the nineteenth-century physicist Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis (1792-1843). However, the rightward deflection actually occurs regardless of the direction the cannon is pointed (a much more developed understanding of physics than what was available in Riccioli's time is required to explain this), and so cannoneers would not notice any differences based on direction.|$|R

There, they discover Hajus has overthrown Tarkas. Tarkas, Carter, and Sola are thrown into an arena to be killed by two enormous four-armed Great White Apes. Carter defeats them and then challenges and easily kills Hajus, so becoming Jeddak of the Tharks.|$|R
40|$|Airborne or {{satellite}} hyperspectral sensing {{has proven}} valuable in many <b>target</b> detection applications, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> the dense spectral {{sampling of the}} sensed data, which provides a high material discriminability. Within this framework, this paper focuses on detection algorithms that rely upon sub-space-based characterization of background. Whereas background subspace estimation has been typically accomplished through a global approach, which employs the whole image, a local methodology is here adopted. In fact, most of the interference affecting targets derives from the background materials {{in which they are}} inserted. Such a background interference lies in a subspace that is more likely spanned by the spectra of the pixels in the target neighborhood, rather than by endmembers/eigenvectors extracted from the whole image. Real hyperspectral imagery from the HyMap sensor is used to experimentally compare both global and local approaches to background subspace estimation. On this data, which exemplifies a mixed-pixel cluttered detection problem, detection results were strongly in favor of the local approach...|$|R
