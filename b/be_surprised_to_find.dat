500|$|Green {{considers}} herself nerdy: [...] "When {{people first}} meet me, they find me very cold... I keep myself at a distance, and I think that's why I'm so drawn to acting. It {{allows me to}} wear a mask". She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out that I am {{a bit of a}} homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?" [...] She has expressed interest in taxidermy and entomology. She collects preserved skulls and insects.|$|E
500|$|The {{negative}} views towards Wollstonecraft persisted {{for over}} a century. The Rights of Woman was not reprinted {{until the middle of}} the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. George Eliot wrote [...] "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the Rights of Woman as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".|$|E
500|$|Charles Taylor from Salon.com stated, [...] "t's {{agreeable}} {{and often}} funny, and adults who take {{their kids to}} see it might <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> themselves having a pretty good time." [...] Elvis Mitchell from The New York Times gave it a positive review, praising the film's use of [...] "creative energy", saying [...] "There hasn't been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as Monsters, Inc." [...] Although Mike Clark from USA Today thought the comedy was sometimes [...] "more frenetic than inspired and viewer emotions are rarely touched to any notable degree," [...] he also viewed the film as [...] "visually inventive as its Pixar predecessors." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} ministers the society of friends has ever encountered, he labored earnestly to lead them in what he considered the true new covenant dispensation, an invisible inward covenant and union with God, and saw the tendency that tradition, books, rituals and even the Bible itself had to hinder that light within. Even at 81 years of age, facing heavy opposition from orthodox friends, bodily afflictions, and material in circulation to damage his reputation as a minister, he never wavered in his convictions on placing the sure rule of faith, the law written on the heart, the only thing sufficient to bring each of the children of men to the true peace and love of God. Although liberal friends today claim that he is their founder, many would be uncomfortable with his definition of Christianity: [...] "Nothing more than a complete mortification of our own will, and a full and final annihilation of all self exaltation." [...] On the other hand, conservative friends, would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in his own journals and letters, his deep knowledge of scripture and challenging call to true Christianity and self-denial, as, in his words, [...] "It is only in the valley of humiliation that one can have fellowship with the oppressed seed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> myself with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we all work together again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. They put me on probation, but I kept on racing... nowhere." ...|$|E
