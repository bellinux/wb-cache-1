5|$|Before {{publication}} of the novel, several Hollywood executives and studios declined to create a film based on it, including Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Pandro Berman at RKO Pictures, and David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures. Jack L. Warner liked the story, but Warner Bros.'s biggest star <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis</b> was uninterested, and Darryl Zanuck of 20th Century-Fox did not offer enough money. Selznick changed his mind after his story editor Kay Brown and business partner John Hay Whitney urged him to buy the film rights. In July 1936—a month after it was published—Selznick bought the rights for $50,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bringing Up Babys {{reputation}} as a flop, it was successful {{in some parts of}} the U.S. The film premiered on February 16, 1938 at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco (where it was a hit), and was also successful in Los Angeles, Portland, Denver, Cincinnati and Washington, D.C.. However, it was a financial disappointment in the Midwest, as well as most other cities in the country, including NYC; to RKO's chagrin, the film's premiere in New York on March 3, 1938 at Radio City Music Hall made only $70,000 and it was pulled after one week in favor of Jezebel with <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In mid-1932, {{after nine}} pictures, Tracy {{remained}} virtually {{unknown to the}} public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in his weekly rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with Me and My Gal (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), a prison drama co-starring <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis.</b> Tracy was hopeful {{that it would be}} his break-out role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.|$|E

5|$|The Foehls knew {{many in the}} Hollywood film industry, and {{a number}} of film stars stayed at the hotel. In late December 1957, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood celebrated their wedding {{reception}} at the hotel. <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis,</b> Roy Rogers, Bing Crosby, Frankie Avalon, Humphrey Bogart, Betty Grable, Janet Leigh, Marilyn Monroe, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and Tony Curtis were known to have stayed there. Sometimes late at night, Jimmy Durante would come down from his room to play the piano in the lounge for other sleepless guests. The Foehls ran the hotel very closely—they lived on the premises.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Stork Club {{was also}} {{featured}} in several movies, including The Stork Club (1945), Executive Suite (1954), Artists and Models (1955), and My Favorite Year (1982). Billingsley received $100,000 {{for the use}} of the club's name in the 1945 film. In All About Eve (1950), the characters played by <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis,</b> Gary Merrill, Anne Baxter and George Sanders are shown in the Cub Room of the Stork Club. The Alfred Hitchcock film The Wrong Man (1957) starred Henry Fonda as real-life Stork Club bassist Christopher Emanuel Balestrero ("Manny"), who was falsely accused of committing robberies around New York City. Scenes involving Balestrero playing the bass were actually shot at the club. The film's screenplay, written by Maxwell Anderson, was based on a true story originally published in Life.|$|E

5000|$|Time observed, [...] "The {{best thing}} {{that can be said}} about Winter Meeting is that its attempt to {{articulate}} Ethel Vance's obscure theme is a thoroughly honest failure and that <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis's</b> talents are great enough to be sometimes apparent {{even in the midst of}} such unrewarding mediocrity." ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} soundtrack recordings of Steiner’s music, both as soundtracks, collections, and recordings by others. Steiner wrote into his seventies, ailing and near blind, but his compositions “revealed a freshness and fertility of invention.” A theme for A Summer Place in 1959, written when Steiner was 71, {{became one of}} Warner Brothers’ biggest hit-tunes for years and a re-recorded pop standard. Steiner also scored 18 of <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis’s</b> romantic dramas.|$|R
5|$|The casting {{of the two}} lead roles {{became a}} complex, two-year endeavor. For the role of Rhett Butler, Selznick wanted Clark Gable from the start, but Gable was under {{contract}} to MGM, who never loaned him to other studios. Gary Cooper was considered, but Samuel Goldwyn—to whom Cooper was under contract—refused to loan him out. Warner offered a package of <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis,</b> Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland for lead roles {{in return for the}} distribution rights. By this time, Selznick was determined to get Gable and eventually struck a deal with MGM. Selznick's father-in-law, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer, offered in August 1938 to provide Gable and $1,250,000 for half of the film's budget but for a high price: Selznick would have to pay Gable's weekly salary, and half the profits would go to MGM while Loew's, Inc—MGM's parent company—would release the film.|$|E
25|$|This was the {{era when}} Errol Flynn {{was one of}} Warner Brothers' {{consistently}} top stars. In 1937 he was Warner Bros. No. 1 star, ahead of Paul Muni and <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis.</b> In 1938 he was 3# just behind <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis</b> and Paul Muni. By 1939 he was No. 3 again, this time behind <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis</b> and James Cagney. In 1940 and 1941 he was again Warner Bros. No. 1 top Box Office draw for both years. In 1942, he was No. 2 behind James Cagney. In 1943, he was Warners #2 star, behind Humphrey Bogart.|$|E

5|$|D: Paul Muni's {{performance}} in Black Fury was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. For two years only, the Academy allowed a write-in vote.

Muni came 2nd in the vote; however, the Academy does not recognize Davis or Muni as nominees in these years.|$|R
50|$|When the Second World War started, he {{returned}} to America. where he coasted into a career in B movie roles, usually playing upper-crust characters, with occasional appearances on Broadway. He occasionally had supporting parts in major films such as How Green Was My Valley, in which he played a brother of Roddy McDowall's character; and Now, Voyager, in which he played a wealthy widower engaged to <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis's</b> character. His last screen appearance was in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Ex-Lady is a 1933 American Pre-Code comedy film {{directed}} by Robert Florey. The screenplay by David Boehm {{is based on}} an unproduced play by Edith Fitzgerald and Robert Riskin. It is a lightweight and modern version of a drawing room comedy. The film was made before the Motion Picture Production Code was in force, and it is risqué: in subject matter (people having affairs without shame), in staging (double beds) and in the fairly revealing negligees that <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis's</b> character wears.|$|R

5000|$|In the Saturday Review, Arthur Knight opined {{the film}} [...] "comes {{to grips with}} its central problem with a forthright honesty and {{integrity}} [...] [...] [...] It may be that in fashioning the story the authors have made their film a bit too pat, a bit too glib, a bit too easy in its articulation of the various points of view expressed. <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis's</b> enlightened liberalism sounds at times as dangerously smug and self-righteous as the benighted politicos and anti-intellectuals who oppose her." ...|$|R
5|$|B: <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis's</b> {{performance}} in Of Human Bondage was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. Several influential people at the time campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year (and the following year also) the Academy relaxed its rules and allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible to win the award, {{regardless of whether they}} were an official nominee or not. While the Academy does not officially recognize this as a nomination for Davis, they have included her in the list of nominees for the 1935 ceremony on their official website.|$|R
50|$|Arliss made ten sound films {{exclusively}} for Warner Bros. under {{a contract that}} gave the star an unusual amount of creative control over his films. Curiously, his casting of actors and rewriting of scripts were privileges granted him by the studio that are not even mentioned in his contract. One of these films, The Man Who Played God (1932), was <b>Bette</b> <b>Davis's</b> first leading role. Until the end of Davis's life, she would credit Arliss for personally insisting upon her as his leading lady and giving {{her a chance to}} show her mettle. The two also co-starred in The Working Man in 1933.|$|R
