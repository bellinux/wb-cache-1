The islands would provide protection to the peninsula, but the navy refused to occupy them. Brévié had to buy some old merchant vessels for the task.In 1939 <b>Bréviés</b> administration defined the [...] "Brévié Line", which defined {{the border between the}} waters of Cambodia and Cochin China. This was the subject of post-colonial disputes between Vietnam and Cambodia.The reform program he instituted came to a halt when the Popular Front left office in France, followed by the start of World War II.Brévié was succeeded by Georges Catroux (1877-1969) in August 1939.Brévié wrote the prefaces to two charming books by Tran Van Tung, Sourvenirs dun enfant de campagne (1939) and Rêves dun campagnard annamite (1940).|$|R
6000|$|As {{the young}} officer {{went back to}} his duties the head-lines of the papers he had but glanced at began to burn into his brain. Hitherto his name had been most inconspicuous; only once or twice had it {{achieved}} a long-primer setting; mainly it had kept to the security and dignity of <b>brevier</b> notices in the Army and Navy Journal.

6000|$|I {{believe we}} all breathed more freely, {{although}} {{the situation was}} still full enough of impending possibilities to prevent peaceful enjoyment of our dinner. As the Editor finished his hurried translation, {{it was suggested that}} we ought to warn the unsuspecting escort of Tournelli's threats. But it was pointed out that this would be betraying the woman, and that Jo Hays (her companion) was fully {{able to take care of}} himself. [...] "Besides," [...] said the Editor, aggrievedly, [...] "you fellows only think of YOURSELVES, and you don't understand the first principles of journalism. Do you suppose I'm going to do anything to spoil a half-column of leaded <b>brevier</b> copy--from an eye-witness, too? No; it's a square enough fight as it stands. We must look out for the woman, and not let Tournelli get an unfair drop on Hays. That is, if the whole thing isn't a bluff." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{should have}} been a poet in our company to {{describe}} that charming little bay of Glaucus, into which we entered on the 26th of September, in the first steam-boat that ever disturbed its beautiful waters. You can't put down in prose that delicious episode of natural poetry; it ought to be done in a symphony, full of sweet melodies and swelling harmonies; or sung in a strain of clear crystal iambics, such as Milnes knows how to write. A mere map, drawn in words, gives the mind no notion of that exquisite nature. What do mountains become in type, or rivers in Mr. Vizetelly's best <b>brevier?</b> Here lies the sweet bay, gleaming peaceful in the rosy sunshine: green islands dip here and there in its waters: purple mountains swell circling round it; and towards them, rising from the bay, stretches a rich green plain, fruitful with herbs and various foliage, in the midst of which the white houses twinkle. I can see a little minaret, and some spreading palm-trees; but, beyond these, the description would answer as well for Bantry Bay as for Makri. You could write so far, nay, much more particularly and grandly, without seeing the place at all, and after reading Beaufort's [...] "Caramania," [...] which gives you not the least notion of it.|$|E
60|$|Francis was {{reminding}} Stephen {{of years}} before when they had been at school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken {{of the past and}} its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then. Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a <b>brevier</b> book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.|$|E

5000|$|Minion is a serif {{typeface}} {{designed by}} Robert Slimbach in 1990 for Adobe Systems and inspired by late Renaissance-era type. The {{name comes from}} the traditional naming system for type sizes, in which minion is between nonpareil and <b>brevier,</b> with the type body 7pt in height. As the name suggests, it is particularly intended as a font for body text in a classical style, neutral and practical while also slightly condensed to save space. Slimbach described the design as having [...] "a simplified structure and moderate proportions." ...|$|E

In 1865, John Murdoch, in his Classified Catalogue of Tamil Printed Books, wrote: [...] "Tamil typography owes its present excellence mainly to Mr. P. R. Hunt, of the American Mission Press. With much labour, he superintended the cutting of the punches of several founts; the smallest size (<b>brevier)</b> he had prepared in America. Mr. Hunt has produced the smallest vernacular edition of the Scriptures ever yet issued in India. The American Mission Press has also raised the standard of printing throughout the Tamil country." ...|$|E

Clarence Poy of San Francisco said he would buy the mine if Reeve flew his supplies and men in. Reeve took the current owner, Jack Cook to the mine to inspect it. The landing spot {{turned out not to}} be as good as had been claimed, but although the aircraft was partially buried in soft snow, no damage was done. Reeve later marked out a landing strip with flags and lamp black.|$|E

5000|$|The Register was {{conceived}} by Robert Thomas, a law stationer, who had purchased {{for his family}} 134 acre {{of land in the}} proposed South Australian province after being impressed by the ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. The first issue (printed by William Clowes & Sons, Duke-street, Stamford-street, Lambeth, London), appeared in London on 18 June 1836 with his friend and partner, George Stevenson, as editor. Thomas embarked for South Australia aboard the Africaine later that year, arriving on 10 November 1836 with his family and equipment to set up a printing plant. It was six months before the first colonial edition of The Register was printed on 3 June 1837 in a small mud hut on an acre in Hindley Street, near what is now named Register Place. (The colloquialism [...] "mud hut" [...] would seem to be an understatement for a substantial pisé building in which was operated a demy Stanhope press, an ancient wooden press, and racks holding [...] "half a ton of bourgeois and <b>brevier</b> type, a good fount of small pica for printing official documents, and a quantity of general jobbing type" [...] with all the other requirements for editing, setting up, printing and distributing an admittedly small circulation newspaper.) ...|$|E
