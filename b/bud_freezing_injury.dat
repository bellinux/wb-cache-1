The results showed that <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> (determined by electrolyte leakage analysis) and malonaldehyde (MDA) content of cv. ‘Fishomi’ were significantly lower than of cv. ‘Roughani’ ones. The activities of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymes of cv. ‘Fishomi’ were signifi cantly {{higher than those of}} cv. ‘Roughani’. However, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of cv. ‘Roughani’ was higher than of cv. ‘Fishomi’. The proline accumulated in leaves of cv. ‘Fishomi’ was significantly higher than of cv. ‘Roughani’ during freezing stress. The results demonstrated that <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> percentage was positively correlated with ion leakage percentage and MDA content in both cultivars.

Whole plants in pots or in the field were subjected to sub-zero temperature regimes from - 1 to - 19 degrees C. Extracellular ice formation was achieved by reducing temperatures slowly, at - 2 degrees C per hour. The floral initiation stage was most sensitive to <b>freezing</b> <b>injury,</b> as yields (fresh and dry head weights) were significantly reduced at - 1 and - 3 degrees C, and the shoot apices were killed at - 5 degrees C. There was no significant yield reduction when the inflorescence buttoning stage was treated at - 1 and - 3 degrees C. Although shoot apices survived the - 5 degrees C treatment at buttoning, very poor quality heads of uneven bud size were produced as a result of arrested development. The lethal temperature for pot-grown broccoli was between - 3 and - 5 degrees C, whereas the lethal temperature for field-grown broccoli was between - 7 and - 9 degrees C. The difference was presumably due to variation in cold acclimation. <b>Freezing</b> <b>injury</b> can reduce broccoli head yield and quality and retard plant growth.

A new seed treatment fungicide for maize (Stamina) has shown positive effects on maize plants under cold stress, not related to protection against fungi. The goal of this project {{was to determine whether}} the seed treatment Stamina protects maize seedlings from cold stress or <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> by enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in maize seedlings. In this study, three seed treatments (Stamina and a binding agent, binding agent only, and no treatment) were used for each of three seed lots. Seeds were planted and grown at 10 °C for seven days, followed by four days at 25 °C. At the end of the four days at 25 °C, seedlings were moved back to 10 °C for ten days to provide additional stress. Seedling height, dry weight, and SOD were measured {{at the end of the}} 25 °C treatment (Point A), as well as at the end of the second stress (Point B). <b>Freeze</b> <b>injury</b> was measured at Point B at three temperatures: - 1. 0 °C, - 1. 5 °C, and - 2. 0 °C. Stamina treated seedlings were taller and contained greater SOD activity at Point A, compared to seedlings treated with binders or no treatment. Stamina treated seedlings were taller and heavier than seedlings treated with binders or no treatment at Point B, but no differences in SOD activity were found. The effects of temperature, seed lot, and treatment were variable over all levels in the freezing assay. Variability in injury was most evident at - 1. 5 °C. These results indicate Stamina provides protection against oxidative stress at Point A, evidenced by increased SOD activity. This leads to greater performance in seedling height. Mean relative growth rate measurements indicate Stamina is providing some level of protection against the chilling stress at Point B, as Stamina treated seedlings are both taller and heavier, even though SOD activity is not enhanced. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of Stamina on <b>freeze</b> <b>injury</b> due to inconsistencies in <b>freeze</b> <b>injury</b> on seedlings treated with binders.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that enhanced tolerance of oxidative stress would improve winter survival, two clones of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) were transformed with a Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) targeted to the mitochondria or to the chloroplast. Although Mn-SOD activity increased in most primary transgenic plants, both cytosolic and chloroplastic forms of Cu/Zn-SOD had lower activity in the chloroplast SOD transgenic plants than in the nontransgenic plants. In a field trial at Elora, Ontario, Canada, the survival and yield of 33 primary transgenic and control plants were compared. After one winter most transgenic plants had higher survival rates than control plants, with some at 100 %. Similarly, some independent transgenic plants had twice the herbage yield of the control plants. Prescreening the transgenic plants for SOD activity, vigor, or freezing tolerance in the greenhouse was not effective in identifying individual transgenic plants with improved field performance. <b>Freezing</b> <b>injury</b> to leaf blades and fibrous roots, measured by electrolyte leakage from greenhouse-grown acclimated plants, indicated that the most tolerant were only 1 °C more freezing-tolerant than alfalfa clone N 4.

Four experiments were carried out to acquire hyperspectral reflectance and biochemical parameters for oilseed rape plants subjected to freezing treatment. Principal component analysis and support vector machines were applied to raw reflectance, first and second derivatives (SDR), and inverse logarithmic reflectance to differentiate freezing and the different stages of post-thawing from the normal leaf state. The impacts on biochemical retrieval using particular spectral domains were also assessed using a multivariate analysis. Results showed that SDR generated the highest classification accuracy (> 95. 6 %) in the detection of post-thawed leaves. The optimal ratio vegetation index (RVI) generated the highest predictive accuracy for changes in leaf water content, with a cross validated coefficient of determination (R 2 cv) of 0. 85 and a cross validated {{root mean square error}} (RMSEcv) of 2. 4161 mg/cm 2.

Quantitative sensory testing (QST) can be used to assess neurosensory symptoms but has previously not been used on cold injury patients. Objective. To evaluate neurosensory sequelae after local <b>freezing</b> cold <b>injury</b> by thermal and vibrotactile perception thresholds and by symptom descriptions. Design. Fifteen patients with a local <b>freezing</b> cold <b>injury</b> in the hands or feet, acquired during military training, were studied with QST by assessment of vibrotactile (VPT), warmth (WPT) and cold (CPT) perception thresholds 4 months post-injury. In addition, a follow-up questionnaire, focusing on neurovascular symptoms, was completed 4 months and 4 years post-injury. Results. QST demonstrated abnormal findings in one or both affected hands for VPT in 6 patients, for WPT in 4 patients and for CPT in 1 patient.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} early theoreticians of cryopreservation was James Lovelock (born 1919) known for Gaia theory. He suggested that damage to red blood cells during freezing was due to osmotic stress. During the early 1950s, Lovelock had also suggested that increasing salt concentrations in a cell as it dehydrates to lose water to the external ice might cause damage to the cell. Cryopreservation of tissue during recent times began with the freezing of fowl sperm, which during 1957 was cryopreserved by a team of scientists in the UK directed by Christopher Polge. The process was applied to humans during the 1950s with pregnancies obtained after insemination of frozen sperm. However, the rapid immersion of the samples in liquid nitrogen did not, for certain of these samples - such as types of embryos, bone marrow and stem cells - produce the necessary viability to make them usable after thawing. Increased understanding of the mechanism of <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> to cells emphasised the importance of controlled or slow cooling to obtain maximum survival on thawing of the living cells. A controlled-rate cooling process, allowing biological samples to equilibrate to optimal physical parameters osmotically in a cryoprotectant (a form of anti-freeze) before cooling in a predetermined, controlled way proved necessary. The ability of cryoprotectants, in the early cases glycerol, to protect cells from <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> was discovered accidentally. <b>Freezing</b> <b>injury</b> has two aspects: direct damage from the ice crystals and secondary damage caused by the increase in concentration of solutes as progressively more ice is formed. During 1963, Peter Mazur, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S., demonstrated that lethal intracellular freezing could be avoided if cooling was slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. That rate differs between cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate around 1 °C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such as glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide, but the rate is not a universal optimum.|$|R

In this study, we evaluate 3 D culture models for simulating this process in vitro. Buttons (8 mm diameter) were first punched out of keratocyte populated compressed collagen matrices, exposed to a 3 mm diameter <b>freeze</b> <b>injury,</b> and cultured in serum-free media (basal media) or media supplemented with 10 % FBS, TGFb 1 or PDGF BB. Following <b>freeze</b> <b>injury,</b> a region of cell death was observed {{in the center of}} the constructs. Although cells readily migrated on top of the matrices to cover the wound area, a limited amount of cell migration was observed within the constructs. We next developed a novel “sandwich” model, which better mimics the native lamellar architecture of the cornea. Using this model, significant migration was observed under all conditions studied. In both models, cells in TGFb and 10 % FBS developed stress fibers; whereas cells in PDGF were more dendritic. PDGF stimulated the most inter-lamellar migration in the sandwich construct. Overall, these models provide insights into the complex interplay between growth factors, cell mechanical phenotypes and the structural properties of the ECM...|$|R
40|$|For many, {{concerns}} {{about the implications of}} "environmental change" conjure up scenarios of forest responses to global warming, enrichment of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, and the northward migration of maladapted forests. From that perspective, the primary focus of this chapter, that is, causes of <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> to red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), may seem somewhat counterintuitive and inconsistent with the overall theme of the book. However, the dramatically increased incidence of <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> to northern montane red spruce forests over the past four decades is, in fact, largely a function of human-induced environ-mental change. "Environmental change " {{in the context of this}} chapter includes both changing climatic patterns and chemical changes in the atmospheric, forest canopy, and/or soil environment that may directly or indirectly result from atmospheric wet (precipitation or cloud water) or dry (direct deposition of gases or aerosols) deposition. Winter injury to red spruce is now recognized as a significant factor in the decline of montane red spruce forests in northeastern North America. It is well documented that red spruce has been subject to repeated, severe, regionwide winter injury over at least the past 50 years, with this injury most commonly observed in montane forests (Friedland et al., 1984...|$|R

40|$|I Numerous {{anthropogenic}} {{factors can}} deplete cal-cium (Ca) from forest ecosystems. Because an adequate supply of Ca {{is needed to}} support fundamental biologi-cal functions, including cell membrane stability and stress response, the potential for Ca deficiency following the individual, cumulative, or potentially synergistic, in-fluences of anthropogenic factors raises important ques-tions concerning organism and ecosystem health. Past work has shown that one Ca-depleting factor (foliar acid mist exposure) reduces concentrations of biologically im-portant membrane-associated Ca (mCa) from red spruce foliar cells, destabilizes these cells, and results in their in-creased susceptibility to the <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> responsibl...|$|R
40|$|The thermotropic {{transition}} of plasma membrane of Dactylis glomerata was studied by using fluorescence polarization of embedded fluorophore, 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene. Under {{the presence of}} 35 % ethylene glycol, reversible thermotropic transitions were observed in isolated plasma membrane vesicles in nearly the same temperature range as the temperature of <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> to cells. In liposomes prepared from isolated plasma membranes, however, the thermotropic transitions occurred at much lower temperatures in comparison with those of intact membrane vesicles. Following treatment with pronase, the thermotropic transition also shifted downward...|$|R
40|$|Haplopappus {{gracilis}} and Acer saccharum {{tissue culture}} cells are extremely sensitive to <b>freezing</b> <b>injury,</b> and exhibit {{a decrease in}} survival from 98 % at − 1 C to 4 % at − 3 C (Haplopappus) and 92 % at − 3 C to 13 % at − 5 C (Acer) when suspended in distilled H 2 O, seeded at − 1 C, and then cooled by 0. 1 C/minute. Similar results are obtained when cells are suspended in growth medium. The extent of shrinkage of cells during freezing can be duplicated by exposure of the cells to plasmolyzing solutions of nonpenetrating substances (Δ Tf = 1. 86 φvm). Solutions of sucrose and glycerol that produce extensive plasmolysis cause a decrease in survival within 3 to 5 minutes at room temperature, and the higher the molality to which the cell is exposed the greater the injury. Also, the rate of rehydration of the plasmolyzed cell and of the frozen cell affects its survival, with the slower rate being more beneficial. The close correlation between the decrease in survival at subzero temperatures and the decrease in survival when cells are placed in solutions having osmolalities, which could produce the same extent of shrinkage as these killing temperatures, suggests that this shrinkage is related to <b>freezing</b> <b>injury</b> in tissue culture cells...|$|R
