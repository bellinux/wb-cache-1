500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun.

News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E

5000|$|Erin Hershey Presley {{was cast}} as Alison Barrington in 2000. For {{the first two}} years of her run, Alisons love {{interest}} was Jamal Woods. The character was crafted as, at first, shallow and spoiled. She then softened to be playful and charming. The breakup with Jamal and the romance with Rafe Kovich developed her into full adulthood. Rafe was created in 2001 as a vampire slayer and an angel. Brian Gaskill, who had portrayed an angel before in the short film Higher Grounds, was cast in the part. Gaskill told Soap Opera Weekly he was excited to be playing an angel again. [...] "Theres something about having that light," [...] he said in the interview. [...] "Playing someone who comes from there is very freeing." [...] Rafe was written as [...] "unconventional," [...] allowing Gaskill to infuse his own [...] "offbeatness" [...] into the role. On other programs, he was not allowed the same freedoms to make the acting choices he wanted. [...] "I would make choices on some shows and theyd say, Thats really quirky and interesting, <b>but</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> Not on this show! Youve got to be the good-looking cool guy." [...] Gaskill credited the role for helping him in his personal life as well as with his acting. [...] "It has opened me up as much as an actor and as a person in ways that I never expected," [...] he said in an interview with Soap Opera Update. [...] "Its been a little bit of back and forth between me and Rafe. Im bringing to Rafe, but Rafe is giving to me. Thats where Im at. Sort of a coming of age a little late." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brian Lowry of Variety said Hannibal is [...] "... the tastiest drama {{the network}} has {{introduced}} in awhile," [...] and had particular praise for the central trio of Dancy, Mikkelsen and Fishburne. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the series a 9/10, which constitutes a score of [...] "Amazing". He said, [...] "A prequel TV series about Hannibal Lecter has to overcome a lot of preconceptions ... <b>But</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> None of that matters when you actually watch the show, because Hannibal is terrific." [...] Linda Stasi of The New York Post gave the series {{two and a half}} stars out of four, praising the performances and called it [...] "... The most beautifully shot and produced show on network TV, with many scenes simply and literally breathtaking..." [...] Jeff Simon from The Buffalo News called Hannibal [...] "deeply sinister" [...] and [...] "brilliant." [...] The Chicago Sun Times TV critic Lori Rackl said, [...] "Hannibal is a haunting, riveting... drama that has the look and feel of a show audiences have become more accustomed to seeing on cable than broadcast," [...] and concluded that [...] "It's also extremely well executed... bound to leave viewers hungry for more." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called Hannibal [...] "creepy, haunting, smart, utterly gorgeous..." [...] and the best of this season's serial killer shows. Sepinwall also praised the character of Hannibal, writing he has been made into a believable supervillain without making the police force and others look incompetent. [...] Reflecting on the completed first season, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff wrote that the series acts as a corrective to the [...] "empty" [...] violence on much of television and [...] "restores the seriousness of purpose to a genre long in need of it.... Hannibal is interested in death and murder as a means to glance sidelong at some of life’s largest questions. When not functioning as a cop drama, it’s an intricately twisted serial-killer thriller, but it’s also a surprisingly deep series about psychiatry and the state of the human mind." [...] VanDerWerff concluded that Fuller had taken a series [...] "that had every reason to be a cheap cash-in and has, instead, turned into one of TV’s best shows." ...|$|E

On July 20, Carey held a record signing for the [...] "Loverboy" [...] single at Roosevelt Field shopping mall in Long Island before fans and the media. As a camera crew covered the event, she began rambling on several subjects before finally discussing radio-host Howard Stern and how his jokes about herself on his program bothered her greatly and how everything in life should be positive. At that point, Carey's publicist Cindi Berger grabbed the microphone from her hand, and asked the news crew to stop filming. Berger said later, [...] "She was not speaking clearly and not talking about what {{she had come to}} talk about: her record."
