50|$|Indonesia: Aired on <b>B-Channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rajawali Televisi (abbreviated to RTV, {{previously}} named <b>B-Channel)</b> is {{a national}} private television station in Indonesia owned by Rajawali Corporation. RTV has a segmentation as the family television. RTV is a television station that is established based broadcasting license of the Indonesian Broadcasting Commission and permit {{the determination of the}} frequency of the Department of Transportation. RTV airtime is from 03.30 am until 04.00 am. RTV officially airs on November 1, 2009 in Jakarta as <b>B-Channel.</b> Currently, RTV's program is more focused on entertainment, soft news and variety show for the family. On May 3, 2014, <b>B-Channel</b> changed its name to RTV {{at the time of the}} grand launching Langit Rajawali.|$|E
50|$|G.722 {{has also}} been widely used by radio {{broadcasters}} for sending commentary-grade audio over a single 56 or 64 kbit/s ISDN <b>B-channel</b> (the least significant bit is dropped on 56kb circuits).|$|E
25|$|The net {{bit rate}} of ISDN2 Basic Rate Interface (2 <b>B-channels</b> + 1 D-channel) of 64+64+16 = 144kbit/s also refers to the payload data rates, while the D channel {{signalling}} rate is 16kbit/s.|$|R
50|$|The {{bearer channel}} (B) is a {{standard}} 64 kbit/s voice channel of 8 bits sampled at 8 kHz with G.711 encoding. <b>B-Channels</b> {{can also be used}} to carry data, since they are nothing more than digital channels.|$|R
50|$|The Primary Rate Interface {{channels}} are typically used by medium to large enterprises with digital {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) telephone systems to provide digital access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The <b>B-channels</b> may be used flexibly and reassigned when necessary to meet special needs such as video conferences.|$|R
5000|$|IsoEthernet {{combines}} 10 megabits {{per second}} Ethernet and 96 64-kilobits per second ISDN [...] "B" [...] channels. It was originally developed to provide data and voice/video over the same wire without degradation by fixing the amount of bandwidth assigned to the Ethernet and <b>B-channel</b> sides.|$|E
50|$|A SPID (Service Profile Identifier) is {{a number}} {{assigned}} by a phone company to a terminal on an Integrated Services Digital Network <b>B-channel.</b> A SPID tells equipment at the phone company's central office about the capabilities of each terminal (computer or phone) on the B-channels. A Basic Rate home or business user may divide service into two B-channels with one used for normal phone service {{and the other for}} computer data. The SPID tells the phone company whether the terminal accepts voice or data information.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, {{specifically}} in time-division multiplex (TDM) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) variants, a frame is a cyclically repeated data block {{that consists of}} a fixed number of time slots, one for each logical TDM channel or TDMA transmitter. In this context, a frame is typically an entity at the physical layer. TDM application examples are SONET/SDH and the ISDN circuit switched <b>B-channel,</b> while TDMA examples are the 2G and 3G circuit-switched cellular voice services. The frame is also an entity for time-division duplex, where the mobile terminal may transmit during some timeslots and receive during others.|$|E
50|$|ISDN-BRI is {{currently}} primarily used in industries with specialized and very specific needs. High-end videoconferencing hardware made by {{companies such as}} Sony, Polycom, Tandberg, and LifeSize via the LifeSize Networker can bond up to 8 <b>B-channels</b> together (using a BRI circuit for every 2 channels) to provide digital, circuit-switched video connections to almost anywhere in the world. This is very expensive, and is being replaced by IP-based conferencing, but where cost concern is less of an issue than predictable quality and where a QoS-enabled IP does not exist, BRI is the preferred choice.|$|R
50|$|ISDN is a {{circuit-switched}} {{telephone network}} system, which also {{provides access to}} packet switched networks, designed to allow digital transmission of voice and data over ordinary telephone copper wires, resulting in potentially better voice quality than an analog phone can provide. It offers circuit-switched connections (for either voice or data), and packet-switched connections (for data), in increments of 64 kilobit/s. In some countries, ISDN found major market application for Internet access, in which ISDN typically provides a maximum of 128 kbit/s bandwidth in both upstream and downstream directions. Channel bonding can achieve a greater data rate; typically the ISDN <b>B-channels</b> {{of three or four}} BRIs (six to eight 64 kbit/s channels) are bonded.|$|R

5000|$|Each <b>B-channel</b> carries data, voice, {{and other}} services. The D-channel carries control and {{signaling}} information. Larger connections are possible using PRI pairing. A dual T1-PRI could have 24 + 23 = 47 B-channels and 1 D-channel (often called [...] "47B + D"), but more commonly has 46 B-channels and 2 D-channels thus providing a backup signaling channel. The concept applies to E1s {{as well and}} both can include more than 2 PRIs. When configuring multiple T1's as ISDN-PRI's, it's possible to use NFAS (non-facility associated signalling) to enable one or two D-channels to support additional B-channels on separate T1 circuits.|$|E

40|$|Transport of {{molecules}} across mitochondrial outer membrane is pivotal {{for a proper}} function of mitochondria. The transport pathways across the membrane are formed by ion channels that participate in metabolite exchange between mitochondria and cytoplasm (voltage-dependent anion-selective channel, VDAC) {{as well as in}} import of proteins encoded by nuclear genes (Tom 40 and Sam 50 /Tob 55). VDAC, Tom 40, and Sam 50 /Tob 55 are present in all eukaryotic organisms, encoded in the nuclear genome, and have b-barrel topology. We have compiled data sets of these protein sequences and studied their phylogenetic relationships with a special focus on the position of Amoebozoa. Additionally, we identified these proteincoding genes in Acanthamoeba castellanii and Dictyostelium discoideum to complement our data set and verify the phylogenetic position of these model organisms. Our analysis show that mitochondrial b-barrel channels from Archaeplastida (plants) and Opisthokonta (animals and fungi) experienced many duplication events that resulted in multiple paralogous isoforms and form well-defined monophyletic clades that match the current model of eukaryotic evolution. However, in representatives of Amoebozoa, Chromalveolata, and Excavata (former Protista), they do not form clearly distinguishable clades, although they locate basally to the plant and algae branches. In most cases, they do not posses paralogs and their sequences appear to have evolved quickly or degenerated. Consequently, the obtained phylogenies of mitochondrial outer membrane <b>b-channels</b> do not entirely reflect the recent eukaryotic classification system involving the six supergroups: Chromalveolata, Excavata, Archaeplastida, Rhizaria, Amoebozoa, and Opisthokonta...|$|R

40|$|Audio via the Internet {{gets more}} and more {{attention}} for program production as a contribution medium, for business to business distribution as a useful alternative to courier services, {{as well as a}} direct to home multi-media broadcasting service. Unfortunately the Web is still very narrow which means {{that in the case of}} a 28. 8 Kbps modem, the bit rate of the audio program is by a factor of 50 reduced compared with the bit rate used for CD. This means that high sophisticated compression techniques have to be applied to the audio signal before transmitting via the Internet. Subjective listening tests are presently the only tool to evaluate the audio quality of the compression schemes. Such tests with different type of typical broadcast material were performed at bit rates which are suitable for a 14. 4 and 28. 8 Kbps modem, as well as for 1 <b>B-channel</b> ISDN with five different Internet Radio audio coding systems. The background and the results of these tests, which have been conducted within the EBU B/IR (Broadcast Management: Internet Radio Project Group) according to ITU-T Recommendation P. 80, are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|TiO 2 (B) has {{attracted}} considerable attention {{in recent years}} because it exhibits the largest capacity among all studied titania polymorphs, with high rate performance for Li intercalation being achieved when this material is nanostructured. However, due to the complex nature of its lithiation mechanism and practical challenges in probing Li structure in nanostructured materials, a definitive understanding of the lithiation thermodynamics {{has yet to be}} established. A comprehensive mechanistic investigation of the TiO 2 (B) nanoparticles is therefore presented using a combination of in situ/operando X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) and electrochemical techniques. The discharge begins with surface reactions in parallel with Li insertion into the subsurface of the nanoparticles. The Li bulk insertion starts with a single-phase reaction into the A 2 site, a position adjacent to the <b>b-channel.</b> A change of the Li diffusion pathway from that along this open channel to that along the c-direction is likely to occur at the composition of Li 0. 25 TiO 2 until Li 0. 5 TiO 2 is attained, leading to a two-step A 2 -site incorporation with one step kinetically distinct from the other. Subsequent Li insertion involves the C' site, a position situated inside the channel, and follows a rapid two-phase reaction to form Li 0. 75 TiO 2. Due to the high diffusion barrier associated with the further lithiation, Li insertion into the A 1 site, another position adjacent to the channel neighboring the A 2 sites, is kinetically restricted. This study not only explores the lithiation reaction thermodynamics and mechanisms of nanoparticulate TiO 2 (B) but also serves as a strong reference for future studies of the bulk phase, and for future calculations to study the Li transport properties of TiO 2 (B) ...|$|E
