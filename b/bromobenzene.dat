25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is called the}} Williamson ether synthesis. It involves treatment of a parent alcohol with a strong base to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable leaving group (R–X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include iodide, bromide, or sulfonates. This method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. <b>bromobenzene,</b> see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.|$|E

40|$|The electrocatalytic {{activation}} of the carbon-bromine bond in susbstituted <b>bromobenzenes</b> has been studied in dimethylformamide (DMF) at Ag, Au, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pd, Pt and Zn electrodes. The electrocatalytic properties of these metals have been evaluated by comparing reduction peak potentials, Ep, of C 6 H 5 Br at such electrodes with Ep measured for the same compound at glassy carbon (GC). Only Ag, Cu and Au show remarkable electrocatalytic properties with positive shifts of Ep between 0. 42 and 0. 69 V with respect to GC. Ag, Cu and Au show also good catalytic activities for various substituted <b>bromobenzenes</b> (ArBr). The possibility of exploiting the electrocatalytic {{activation of}} ArBr for the synthesis of benzoic acids has also been investigated. In CO 2 -saturated DMF, Ag and Cu show high conversions of ArBr with moderate to good yields of ArCO 2 H. In all cases hydrodebromination to ArH is in competition with carboxylation, {{the relative importance of}} the two reactions strongly depending on the substituent {{as well as on the}} nature of the electrode material.

40|$|The 1 H NMR {{spectra of}} 1 -halonaphthalenes were {{recorded}} and assigned. These data {{together with the}} known 1 H chemical shifts of the halobenzenes and of H- 5 in 4 -halophenanthrenes were used to investigate different models of halogen SCS using the CHARGE program. Good agreement was obtained with the observed shifts for the fluoro compounds, but a new model which included the anisotropy of the C - X bond (X = Cl, Br, I) and steric and electric field effects was required to give an accurate description of the observed chemical shifts for the other halogens. A previous observation of an anomalous 1 H SCS on the meta protons in halobenzenes was further investigated using the 1 -halonaphthalenes plus the observed 1 H shifts {{of a number of}} 2 -substituted <b>bromobenzenes.</b> The meta SCS of the bromo substituent in the <b>bromobenzenes</b> was only observed on H- 5. When a substituent was attached to C- 2, H- 3 showed no appreciable effect. This remarkable effect was investigated by CHARGE and GIAO calculations and shown to be due to the -electron system. It was reproduced in CHARGE as a effect from the C - X carbon atom. The observed 1 H chemical shifts in the above compounds were compared with those calculated by CHARGE, the GIAO technique and by the ACD database program. The recommended ab initio basis set for the iodo compounds (Lan 12 DZ) gave very poor calculated shifts, which suggests that 1 H chemical shifts of fourth-row atoms when calculated with the GIAO technique should be viewed with caution. In contrast, the recommended 6 - 31 G** basis set with the B 3 LYP technique in the Gaussian 98 program gave calculated values in reasonable agreement with the observed data, as did the ACD package. These different prediction methods were compared by pie charts, scatter plots and r. m. s. errors and the CHARGE program was shown to be more accurate for the compounds considered here than the other two methods.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction {{of a series}} of aromatic bromides including substituted <b>bromobenzenes</b> and polycyclic bromoarenes has been investigated in acetonitrile at silver and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes. Whereas GC behaves as a noncatalytic electrode, Ag exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activities for the reduction of all compounds. The electrocatalytic effects are strongly inﬂuenced by the molecular structure of the aromatic bromide, decreasing with increasing electron-withdrawing ability of the substituents as well as with extension of the polycyclic aromatic system. Dissociative electron transfer (ET) to an organic halide RX may occur either in a single step (concerted mechanism) or in two distinct steps with the formation of an intermediate radical anion (stepwise mechanism). The mechanism of the reduction process was analyzed at both catalytic and noncatalytic electrodes. Electroreduction of all compounds at GC occurs according to a stepwise mechanism, whereas at Ag both mechanisms were observed depending on the structure of the molecule. This study reports unprecedented examples of a passage from one dissociative ET mechanism to the other upon a change {{of the nature of the}} electrode material. The process at Ag involves adsorption of reagents, intermediates and products and is catalytic regardless of the mechanism of the dissociative ET. Analysis of the data herein reported together with literature data on the electroreduction of different types of organic halides sheds some light on the relation between catalysis and dissociative ET mechanism...|$|R

Of 17 organic solvents that were tested as guest candidates, 6 inclusion compounds were isolated, mostly as bulk products. All compounds were characterized with XRD methods. With benzene, fluoro-, chloro-, and <b>bromobenzenes,</b> toluene, and o-xylene, 1 : 1 inclusions form; {{they are all}} green, relatively stable, and isostructural (triclinic, P 12 ̆ 07 b, Z = 2). The guest species accommodate flattened cages formed upon van der Waals packing of host molecules. The guest inclusion influences the distortion in the bischelate fragment of the host molecule, as the dihedral angle between two chelate rings ranges up to 120. This distortion is probably responsible for the green color of these phases. The series of inclusions exhibits an order of thermal stability opposite to that which would be expected from the volativity of the neat guests; the order indicates strong preference of the inclusion matrix to benzenes with smaller substituents. With benzene, one more inclusion phase was isolated as a metastable product, with a host-to-guest ratio of 1 : 4; it is brown and of a distinct structural type (triclinic, P 12 ̆ 07 b, Z = 1).

50|$|When {{a mixture}} of two {{practically}} immiscible liquids is heated while being agitated to expose the surface of each liquid to the vapor phase, each constituent independently exerts its own vapor pressure {{as a function of}} temperature as if the other constituent were not present. Consequently, the vapor pressure of the whole system increases. Boiling begins when the sum of the vapour pressures of the two immiscible liquids just exceeds the atmospheric pressure (approximately 101 kPa at sea level). In this way, many organic compounds insoluble in water can be purified at a temperature well below the point at which decomposition occurs. For example, the boiling point of <b>bromobenzene</b> is 156 °C and the boiling point of water is 100 °C, but {{a mixture of}} the two boils at 95 °C.
