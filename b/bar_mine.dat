2500|$|An {{excavation}} {{report from}} the Golden <b>Bar</b> <b>Mine</b> between the Macraes Flat and Palmeston, Otago, shows that located {{in front of the}} main mine workings of ca.1897, archaeological material was found. [...] This material was a small heart-shaped brooch with 13 glass (paste) diamonds. [...] This archaeological evidence suggests that women were present at this site, and within the Golden Bar goldfield. [...] The exact occupation of women from this evidence is unknown, but indicates that women were present on the goldfields during the 19th Century gold rush in Otago.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>bar</b> <b>mine's</b> shape {{allows a}} 50% {{reduction}} in the number of mines in a minefield without reducing its effectiveness. It was reported that it would take 90 sappers 150 minutes to lay a 1,000 yard mine field consisting of 1,250 Mk 7 British anti-tank mines, weighing a total of 17 tonnes. By comparison, it would take 30 sappers 60 minutes to lay a 1,000 yard minefield consisting of 655 <b>bar</b> <b>mines</b> weighing a total of 7.2 tonnes.|$|R
50|$|The British Army {{has since}} been using <b>bar</b> <b>mines</b> simply as {{breaching}} frame charges, for instance to blow holes in tough compound walls in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|R

[...] Who, when Gascogne's vexed gulf is raging wide, [...] Shall hush it {{as a nurse}} her infant's cry? [...] His magic power let such vain boaster try, [...] And {{when the}} torrent shall his voice obey, [...] And Biscay's whirlwinds list his lullaby, [...] Let him stand forth and <b>bar</b> <b>mine</b> eagles' way, And they shall heed his voice, and at his bidding stay.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 7 {{mine was}} a {{circular}} British anti-tank blast mine. It replaced the World War 2-era Mk 5 mine, and has in turn {{been replaced by}} the L9 <b>Bar</b> <b>Mine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The L9 <b>Bar</b> <b>Mine</b> entered British {{service in}} 1969. A number of sub-variants {{of the mine}} exist, {{designated}} L9A1 through L9A8. It was replaced as an anti-tank mine in British service (by the Shielder minelaying system) in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Obuasi is a gold <b>bar</b> <b>mining</b> mining {{community}} and {{town in the}} southern part of Obuasi Municipal of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Obuasi is the capital of the Obuasi Municipal which lies south of Ashanti capital city Kumasi 39 miles (59.4 kilometres) away south-west of Kumasi or 1 hour 2 minutes road-drive from Obuasi to Kumasi. Obuasi has a settlement population of 175,043 people. Obuasi gold <b>bar</b> <b>mining</b> community has delicate mosaic from the Ashanti people culture of Ashanti and the semi-island exclave Ashantiland. Obuasi wears a ring of hills as its adornment and Obuasi sits quietly albeit industriously on the soil that births the top-9 single richest bullion gold <b>bar</b> gold <b>mining</b> mining|mine on Earth the Obuasi Gold Mine.|$|R
5000|$|... circa 1940: Loe <b>Bar</b> <b>mined</b> {{and timber}} baulks or booms moored {{on the surface}} of the Loe to prevent {{seaplanes}} landing. A pillbox was built near Bar Lodge. By 2010 erosion had caused the pillbox to fall onto the beach.|$|R
50|$|Konongo (also Konongo-Odumase) is a gold <b>bar</b> <b>mining</b> and {{manganese}} mining community {{located in}} Ashanti, Ghana. The town {{serves as the}} capital of the Asante Akim Central Municipal. As of 2012, Konongo has a settlement population of 41,238 people. Konongo is about 33 mi from Kumasi, the Ashanti capital.|$|R

50|$|Gold Canyon {{is located}} {{a few miles}} south of Alleghany, California, {{on the border between}} Sierra and Nevada Counties. The middle fork of the Yuba River flows through the canyon. Gold mining began in Gold Canyon in the early 1850s and has {{continued}} to present day. Three major gold mines are located here: German <b>Bar</b> <b>Mine,</b> Gold Canõn Mine, and Independent Mine.|$|E
50|$|The RARS {{identified}} {{that the previous}} ammunition scales for the NATO 30-day battle would be completely used up in the 8+2 scenario. Furthermore the change from 105mm (with a shell weighing 18 lbs) to 155mm (with a shell weighing 96 lbs) plus the huge quantities of <b>bar</b> <b>mines</b> created additional storage requirements {{with an emphasis on}} locating stocks forward to meet shorter warning scenarios.|$|R
50|$|In Spanish this {{is called}} lanzamiento de barra or barra vasca and in French {{lancement}} de <b>bar</b> de <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{a parcel}} of forty <b>bar</b> <b>mines</b> being shipped by rail on a Ministry Of Defence (MOD) train from DMC Longtown to Oxfordshire {{disappeared}} while in transit. Twenty-eight were recovered promptly alongside the line near Warrington, but twelve (approximately 100kg of RDX) were missing, Counter-terrorism officers {{together with the}} Royal Military Police led the enquiry. Five men were later jailed for their part in the theft and the missing explosives were recovered.|$|R
50|$|The L9 <b>Bar</b> <b>Mine</b> {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} British anti-tank landmine. The bar mine's principal {{advantage is}} its long length, and therefore its trigger length. A typical anti-tank landmine is circular, and a vehicle's wheels or tracks, which make up only {{a small proportion of}} its total width, must actually press on the mine to activate it. To increase the probability of a vehicle striking the mine, the mine's effective trigger width must be increased.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bar</b> <b>mine</b> {{is made of}} plastic, and {{cannot be}} {{detected}} by metal detectors. A metal plate is attached to bar mines which are intended to be subsequently recovered by friendly forces, usually for training purposes. A full width attack mine (FWAM) fuze and an anti-disturbance fuze are available for the bar mine; these are secured {{on the ends of}} the mine, adjacent to the pressure plate. If either is used, the mine must be laid by hand.|$|E
50|$|The long mines {{can also}} be laid through a simple plough {{attached}} {{to the rear of}} a FV432 Armoured Personnel Carrier. Laying circular mines in similar fashion requires a far larger plough and more powerful towing vehicle. The <b>bar</b> <b>mine</b> laying FV432s were also usually fitted with launchers for the L10 Ranger Anti-Personnel Mine, to make subsequent clearing of the minefield by hand by enemy sappers more difficult; however, the L10 was withdrawn from service, in line with several conventions regulating mines which have been agreed to by the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the {{facility}} began in 1878, {{on the site of}} the Stony <b>Bar</b> <b>mining</b> camp along the American River. The prison officially opened in 1880 with a capacity of 1,800 inmates; they spent most of their time in the dark, behind solid boiler plate doors in stone cells measuring 4 by 8 ft with 6 in eye slots. Air holes were drilled into the cell doors in the 1940s, and the cell doors are still in use today.|$|R
50|$|To counter these {{developments}} {{a decision was}} made to make all divisional artillery 155mm and phase out the 105mm Abbot. The Corps Barrier Plan, a major structure of obstacles, including a huge minefield made up of anti-tank <b>bar</b> <b>mines</b> and Ranger anti-personnel mines was also strengthened to blunt such tactics. Finally two parallel studies: the Battle Attrition Study (BAS) and Review of Ammunition Rates and Scales (RARS) worked through the implications to the British Army of the predicted new style of Soviet aggression.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Rabbi Philip R. Alstat, {{who served}} as Jewish {{chaplain}} for The Tombs, the Manhattan Detention Facility, for thirty years, and also served as the Secretary of the National Jewish Council of Prison Chaplains, shared his vision of prison ministry by saying, [...] "My goals {{are the same as}} those of the prison authorities - to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron <b>bars.</b> <b>Mine</b> are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart." ...|$|R

50|$|The Riegel mine 43 or (Sprengriegel/R.Mi. 43) is a German steel cased {{anti-tank}} <b>bar</b> <b>mine</b> {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine is a long thin rectangle. It consists of a lower and upper metal tray, and an internal metal-cased explosive block. It uses two ZZ42 fuzes inserted into {{either end of the}} internal block, although it can be used with an additional pressure fuze on the top. The mine is similar to the Italian B-2 mine. A variant, the Riegel mine 44 was also produced with a different fuze. Approximately 3,051,400 were produced between 1943 and 1945.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bar</b> <b>mine</b> {{was used}} by small {{detachments}} of special forces of the British Army during the Gulf War in 1991. A number were captured from Kuwaiti Army stocks by the Iraqi Army in 1990, and subsequently used by {{them in the same}} conflict. It was reported that they disabled a number of M60 Patton tanks and other armoured vehicles belonging to the United States Marine Corps, even when these were fitted with mine-clearing ploughs. Unless the plough struck the mine squarely in the centre, the mine would often be rotated into a position in which it would pass between the tines of the plough, then blow up the track and front roller of the tank.|$|E
50|$|Little Rattlesnake <b>Bar</b> was a <b>mining</b> site.|$|R
50|$|Sixty {{percent of}} the gold, which is <b>mined</b> for doré <b>bars,</b> is <b>mined</b> underground. Workers in the deepest parts of the mine operate {{machinery}} via remote control to reduce the chance of being trapped by rock falls.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It suits me,' says I. 'Quiet and {{retirement}} {{are good for}} a man sometimes. And I need a job. I can tend <b>bar,</b> salt <b>mines,</b> lecture, float stock, do a little middle-weight slugging, and play the piano.' ...|$|R
50|$|Shaped charge devices {{like the}} Hohl-Sprung mine 4672 were also {{developed}} by Germany {{later in the}} war, although these did not see widespread use. The most advanced German anti-tank mine {{of the war was}} their minimal metal Topfmine.In contrast to the dinner plate mines such as the German Tellermine were bar mines such as the German Riegel mine 43 and Italian B-2 mine. These were long mines designed to increase the probability of a vehicle triggering it, the B2 consisted of multiple small shaped-charge explosive charges along its length designed to ensure a mobility kill against enemy vehicles by destroying their tracks. This form of mine was the inspiration for the British L9 <b>bar</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scheelite usually {{occurs in}} tin-bearing veins; and is {{sometimes}} found {{in association with}} gold. Fine crystals have been obtained from Caldbeck Fells in Cumbria, Zinnwald/Cínovec and Elbogen in Bohemia, Guttannen in Switzerland, the Riesengebirge in Silesia, Dragoon Mountains in Arizona and elsewhere. At Trumbull in Connecticut and Kimpu-san in Japan large crystals of scheelite completely altered to wolframite have been found: those from Japan have been called “reinite.” It was mined until 1990 at King Island, Australia, Glenorchy in Central Otago and Macraes Flat in North Otago and also at The Golden <b>Bar</b> <b>mine</b> at Dead Horse Creek during World War 1 in Nelson, New Zealand. There is {{a high concentration of}} Scheelite in Northeast of Brazil, mainly in the Currais Novos mine in Rio Grande do Norte State.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} to be used in conjunction with the L9 <b>Bar</b> <b>Mine</b> anti-tank mine, to make anti-tank minefields more difficult for enemy sappers to clear by hand. A FV432 would be fitted with a plough through which bar mines would be laid. A firing frame which held 18 clips of 4 barrels each would be fitted {{to the top of the}} vehicle. Each barrel contained 18 Ranger mines, for a total of 1296 mines. The frame could fire in any direction (although mines were not usually fired over the front of the vehicle). As each section of the anti-tank minefield was completed, several of the barrels would be fired. A small propelling charge would launch the mines, scattering them between 50m and 250m behind or to the side of the mine-laying vehicle. The act of launching the mine from the tube would release a spring-loaded safety catch and start a timer which would arm the mine after 30 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Early mining {{was with}} pick and shovel where the above-water sand <b>bars</b> were <b>mined</b> by hand. The {{material}} was carried on barges {{to the nearby}} drying works. Soon suction dredges were employed and the mining spread along the lower Peace River.|$|R
25|$|Copper {{was also}} a valued {{commodity}} in imperial Mali. According to the records of Ibn Battuta, copper which traded in <b>bars</b> was <b>mined</b> from Takedda {{in the north and}} traded in the south for gold. Contemporary sources claim 60 copper bars traded for 100 dinars of gold.|$|R
