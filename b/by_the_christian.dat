5|$|Dreamtime {{opens with}} the premise {{that many of those}} accused of {{witchcraft}} in early modern Christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys {{with the aid of a}} hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> authorities. Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess Diana, and he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 681 as a pagan state, Bulgaria was {{formally}} Christianised by Byzantine clergy in the 860s, under Prince Boris (r. 852–889). The right to convert Bulgaria to Christianity {{was the subject}} of a political dispute between Byzantium and the Papacy. With the conversion to Christianity, Boris hoped to solve internal ethnic issues and improve the foreign relations of his state, which was not treated equally <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> rulers of Europe.|$|E
5|$|From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian {{authors who}} would become the Latin Church Fathers were in active {{dialogue}} with the Classical tradition, within {{which they had been}} educated. Tertullian, a convert to Christianity from Roman Africa, was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> perspective. When the orator Symmachus argued for the preservation of Rome's religious traditions, he was effectively opposed by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and future saint—a debate preserved by their missives.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E

He was educated at Toogoolawah State School, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Brothers in Warwick and at St. Joseph's Nudgee College. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 12October 1941. Following aircrew training, he {{graduated}} as a sergeant pilot on 15October 1942. He served as an instructor before being posted to the South West Pacific as a fighter pilot with No.75 Squadron, flying P-40 Kittyhawks. He gained his commission in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Other critics even {{in later}} years insisted that the {{character}} of Shylock is that of an outsider separated from society, that the Jewish Shylock represented an older form of justice, meant to be supplanted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> view, represented by Portia, who argued for the prevalence of mercy. Shylock, these critics maintained, must be removed {{in order to allow}} society to attain a Christian form of peace. Hazlitt's view, however, has remained as a valid countervailing concept of the play, one that does not arrive at easy conclusions or take sides readily.|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, {{the party}} {{system has been}} {{dominated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor {{has been a member}} of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (in parliament from 1949 to 2013) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles. In the German federal election, 2017, Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> apologist Justin Martyr, who stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge {{in a cave}} outside of the town. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave {{in the town of}} Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz.|$|E
5|$|The {{powerful}} Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan {{was severely}} defeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> kings at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340. Marinid Morocco subsequently went into internal convulsions, too busy for active intervention in Spain, {{clearing the way}} for a renewed attempt by the Castilians on Algeciras and Gibraltar. Algeciras was taken with relative ease by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1344. Gibraltar, however, would not fall as easily. The Castilans subjected it to a fifth siege between 1349–50. It ended when Alfonso XI died from bubonic plague during the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E

5|$|Divine command theory {{features}} in the ethics of many modern religions, including Judaism, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Christianity, {{as well as being}} a part of numerous older polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.|$|E

That July, she performed alongside Nick Hamlyn at Corner Brook's Downtown Days festival. In December 2012, she held two free coffeehouses in Newfoundland: at the Stavanger Drive Second Cup on the 15th and at Cornerstone Ministry Centre on the 21st. Over the subsequent {{months into the}} middle of 2013, she performed on a monthly basis at the Stavanger Drive Second Cup, which is owned by Newman. She also performed at the Majestic Theatre and the Fat Cat Blues Bar in St. John's. In 2013, she was named a showcase winner <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Women in Media Association (CWIMA) and was selected to perform at the organization's national conference.|$|E
5|$|She further {{asserted}} {{that in the}} Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo-Daro, which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati, {{as well as the}} deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete. Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by Pan in Greece, Cernunnos in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> authorities, she nevertheless {{asserted that}} his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as evidence of his veneration.|$|E

5|$|The Christian Songs chart is {{a record}} chart {{compiled}} by Billboard magazine. Launched on June21, 2003, the chart is ranked by overall audience impressions (the approximate number of audience impressions made for each play, as determined by BDS data cross-referenced with Arbitron listener information). While all Christian radio formats are covered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Songs chart, it is dominated by Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) radio stations, which cater to a mostly adult audience. As opposed to Christian stations that cater to young audiences, Christian AC stations tend to play hits often and for long periods. As a result, number-one singles on the Christian Songs chart often have lengthy stays at the top position.|$|E
5|$|The first {{history of}} Christian Science {{appeared}} in McClure's magazine in 14 installments from January 1907 to June 1908, preceded by {{an editorial in}} December 1906. The essence of the articles, which included court documents and affidavits from Eddy's associates, was that Eddy's chief concern was money, {{and that she had}} derived Christian Science from Quimby. The material was also published as a book, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science (1909). It became the key source for most non-church histories of the religion. The editor-in-chief assigned five writers to work on the series, including the novelist Willa Cather as the principal author. The book was kept out of print from early in its life <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Science church, which bought the original manuscript. It was republished in 1971 by Baker Book House when its copyright expired, and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press.|$|E
5|$|While the BPC was {{primarily}} political, Black Consciousness activists also established the Black Community Programmes (BCPs) {{to focus on}} improving healthcare and education and fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by a program on Christian action, established <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Institute of Southern Africa and the South African Council of Churches. Additional funds came from the Anglo-American Corporation, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and Bokwe Mafuna, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited Kimberley, where he met the PAC founder and anti-apartheid activist Robert Sobukwe.|$|E
