The ring was five (5) metres in diameter, which was drawn in chalk, {{and as a}} result if the {{opponent}} went out of the ring more than three (3) times he would be announced as the loser. There were also no attacks to the eyes, throat or groin, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> could be applied. Also if there was excessive blood loss, then the injured fighter would be announced as the loser.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film three-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and said in his print review [...] "I forgot {{something}} about toys a long time ago, and Toy Story 2 reminded me". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said [...] "Toy Story 2 {{may not have the}} most original title, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> about it is, well, mint in the box". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "It's a great, IQ-flattering entertainment both wonderful and wise".|$|E
500|$|Maysak {{affected}} Yap and Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia, {{as well as}} the Philippines. The {{storm was}} responsible for four deaths in the Federated States of Micronesia alongside 10injuries. Damage was estimated at $8.5million (2015USD). Estimates from the Red Cross suggested that there were 5,000people in desperate need of food, water and shelter, and needed emergency assistance. Pacific Mission Aviation administrator Melinda Espinosa said [...] "Most concrete structures withstood the fury <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> was damaged."

500|$|Lucy granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, {{became a}} fan of MOBA after seeing the {{portrait}} in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure {{what happened to her}} arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from." ...|$|E
500|$|Wade Keller, {{also from}} the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, awarded the Cena–Punk bout five stars out of five, and said the [...] "athleticism wasn't at the A+ level, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that equals magic in pro wrestling {{happened}} in the last 40 minutes". Keller awarded the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match four stars and said there were [...] "lots of good workers taking a lot of big bumps, but also selling them, {{during the course of the}} match". For the Orton–Christian match, Keller said that it was [...] "paced well, executed well, and the finish played into the personalities and storyline of this feud". Regarding the outcome of the Henry–Big Show match, Keller commented that it was [...] "interesting to see WWE really truly get behind Henry for the first time after all of this time".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV upon the album's release, Big Boi explained that most of its material had been finished while at Jive, stating [...] "It's basically the same album. I could have been done, like, a year ago. But being that we were having creative differences — you know, every time they rejected what I was doing, I would {{go back in the}} studio and work on more stuff. The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> was already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E

500|$|The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly {{praised the}} {{gameplay}} and music. Maximum commented that [...] "Ridge Racer isn't without its bad points – basically, {{there is only}} one track and the game lacks the awesome crash sequences of Daytona USA, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in the title is sheer class". They commented positively on the [...] "feeling of smoothness and speed", the [...] "distinctly European" [...] dance music, the engine sounds, and the unrealistically exaggerated driving manoeuvres. In 1996, IGN commented that despite two years of release the game [...] "has definitely stood the test of time", but complained that [...] "there is no two-player mode" [...] and that [...] "the cars don't really vary in performance that much". AllGame's Shawn Sackenheim praised the game, particularly the graphics and audio, and concluded that it [...] "is a fun title that racing fans will love". Coming Soon Magazine praised its [...] "ultra fluid and very realistic" [...] graphics, but criticised the game for being too short. The Electric Playground's Victor Lucas gave top marks, remarking [...] "The experience of playing RR supersedes the thrills generally attributed to playing other racing video games", and further commented [...] "I really can't stress enough how deserving of your video game dollars Ridge Racer is". Edge praised the [...] "dazzling" [...] graphics and [...] "arcade-perfect" [...] music.|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was reassuring to see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Destructoid scored it 9/10, {{stating that}} it [...] "feels like an MMO world I've {{been living in}} for several weeks now" [...] though the [...] "more grimdark theme isn't quite as charming as the {{original}} Xenoblade, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> makes up for it." [...] GameSpot stated that, of [...] "all the open-world games to come out this year, Xenoblade Chronicles X {{may be the most}} formidable" [...] as a [...] "truly enormous game, both in scale and scope," [...] praising the landscapes, creature design, unlockables and quests, combat, and character progression and customization, but criticizing the inconsistent soundtrack, ambiguous systems, and disappointing story. Eurogamer said it is [...] "Japanese RPG-making at its most ambitious and determined." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{view is that}} Wong's last beimo {{match was}} {{actually}} {{a different kind of}} incident. In beimo competition, according to Yuen Yim Keung, [...] "There were also no attacks to the eyes, throat or groin, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> could be applied." [...] Yuen also said that there were three two-minute rounds in a beimo match. In contrast, others have said that there were no rules and no time limits. Moreover, some question whether or not a referee was present. When Wu Chan Nam fought in a beimo match, there was a referee present—Wong Kiu. According to Life and Legend of Bruce Lee, there was always supposed to be a referee present at a beimo match, as Wong re-enacted the scene of a 1950s beimo match on a rooftop and played the role of the referee.|$|E
2500|$|Blackman {{is adamant}} that musicality {{has nothing to}} do with gender. [...] "The gender {{question}} is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with gender", Blackman says. [...] "I'm there because I love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green." [...] "There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion", says Blackman. [...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In terms of my goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{play was}} {{performed}} {{for the first}} time at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada in 1978, when it was directed by Brian Bedford, starring William Hutt as Titus, Jennifer Phipps as Tamora, Alan Scarfe as Aaron and Domini Blithe as Lavinia. Bedford went with neither stylisation nor realism; instead the violence simply tended to happen off-stage, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> was realistically presented. The play received mixed reviews with some praising its restraint and others arguing that the suppression of the violence went too far. Many cited the final scene, where despite three onstage stabbings, not one drop of blood was visible, and the reveal of Lavinia, where she was totally bloodless despite her mutilation. This production cut Lucius' final speech and instead ended with Aaron alone on the stage as Sibyl predicts the fall of Rome in lines written by Bedford himself. As such, [...] "for affirmation and healing under Lucius the production substituted a sceptical modern theme of evil triumphant and Rome's decadence." ...|$|E
6000|$|The comic and {{the tragic}} are {{inextricably}} mingled in this world. I {{believe that this}} is no accident, <b>but,</b> like <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> a special arrangement.

The feeling of anxiety aroused by the war news was, I may say, mitigated by the manner of its announcement.|$|R
50|$|In 1917, Sir Augustus and Lady Nanton {{converted}} {{their summer}} {{house on the}} Lake of the Woods into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers returning from Europe.

2500|$|Chicago Sun-Times {{film critic}} Roger Ebert gave the film {{two out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "House of Wax {{is not a good}} movie, but it is an {{efficient}} one and will deliver most of what anyone attending House of Wax could reasonably expect...assuming it would be unreasonable to expect very much." [...] He said of Hilton's performance that [...] "she is no better or worse than the typical Dead Post-Teenager and does exactly what she is required to do in a movie like this, with all the skill—admittedly finite—that is required." [...] Film critic Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and wrote that it gives horror fans exactly what they want. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, [...] "After a month, no one will talk about this movie again. Still, with a picture like this, there is really only one question: Is it fun? Yes. Lots. Definitely." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it boring and poorly-acted, though he complimented Cuthbert and Murray. [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "The set design is fairly elaborate {{by the standards of the}} genre, and the victims don't die in precisely the order you might expect, <b>but</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> goes pretty much according to formula".|$|E

50|$|Superman {{returned}} to movie theaters in 1978 with director Richard Donner's Superman, starring Christopher Reeve, which spawned three sequels {{and was the}} most successful Superman feature film.
