5|$|Britain was {{challenged}} again by France under Napoleon, {{in a struggle}} that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations.</b> It was not only Britain's position {{on the world stage}} that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Successive Australian governments saw good {{relations}} {{and stability in}} Indonesia (Australia's largest neighbour) as providing an important security buffer to Australia's north, but the East Timor issue complicated co-operation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations.</b> Australia provided important sanctuary to East Timorese independence advocates like José Ramos-Horta (who based himself in Australia during his exile).|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{transfer}} of revolutionary concepts from North America to France. The American Declaration of Independence was translated at least nine times into French {{on the eve of}} the French Revolution, and references to the U. S. A. are frequent in the debates of the Constituent. The conceptual shifts that appear in these translations and debates reflect the social and political differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> revolutionary <b>nations.</b> <b>The</b> universalist preamble of the American Declaration is often interpreted by the French as particular to the colonies, as they tend to emphasize <b>the</b> contrast <b>between</b> them and what they see as a young people. Beyond these discrepancies, the question of the rights of man as it appears in the translations and debates reveals the many contradictions inherent in Enlightenment philosophy. The adaptation into French of a text which is both universal and specific to the founding of the American nation is indicative of <b>the</b> fundamental differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nation</b> states.

In his absence, Monty Noble captained the Australian team against the touring English in 190304.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidate}} that wins {{the election and}} assumes office is eventual President of South Korea Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil). His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of reunification between the North and South after witnessing the grim reality that is the struggle <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations.</b> With strong ambitions, he leads diplomatic outreaches with the North that no one expected of a candidate so early in his term.|$|E

India cleared Zardari's government of any direct involvement in the attacks, but simultaneously demanded the extradition of 20 Pakistanis which it alleged had taken part in them. Zardari offered to send Inter-Services Intelligence Director-General Ahmed Shuja Pasha {{to assist in the}} investigation.|$|E

5|$|Acclaimed across Latin America, Castro {{traveled}} to Venezuela {{to attend the}} first-anniversary celebrations of Marcos Pérez Jiménez's overthrow. Meeting President-elect Rómulo Betancourt, Castro proposed greater relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations,</b> unsuccessfully requesting a loan of $300,000,000 and a new deal for Venezuelan oil. Returning home, an argument between Castro and senior government figures broke out; the government had banned the National Lottery and closed down the casinos and brothels, leaving thousands of waiters, croupiers and prostitutes unemployed, infuriating Castro. As a result, Prime Minister José Miró Cardona resigned, going into exile in the U.S. and joining the anti-Castro movement.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807.

A major strain on the relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations</b> became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, Key has {{supported}} closer {{relations with the}} United States, an ANZUS defence partner.

Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.|$|E
