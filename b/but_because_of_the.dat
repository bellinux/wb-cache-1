The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South West England, Radstock has a {{temperate}} climate, which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10°C (50°F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months in the region, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The southwest of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.|$|E

December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.|$|E

5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{speed with which it}} reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E

Chu claimed that he {{made the decision to}} wager for a tie not out of kindness <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar.

The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony {{all the way through}} only once before the concert.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
