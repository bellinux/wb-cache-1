25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the crisis caused by the prospect of a new Catholic heir made William decide to invade the next summer as early as November 1687, but this is disputed.

25|$|In January 1967, after {{production}} of the Griffith had been discontinued, TVR unveiled the Tuscan V8, initially in short-wheelbase and then long-wheelbase configurations. It was first displayed at the Racing Car Show at Olympia, in London. The Tuscan did not provide the economic boost to TVR that the Lilleys had hoped, {{and it was only}} built in low volume. A Tuscan owned by racing driver John Burton was modified by race car mechanic Mike Bigland to improve the handling, and Bigland's success was noticed by Martin Lilley; this would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relationship that would be important {{in the development of the}} later M Series chassis.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was {{an ambitious}} {{attempt on the}} part of both London and Berlin to reach better relations, but it {{ultimately}} floundered because of conflicting expectations between the two states. For the Germans, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was intended to mark the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance against France and the Soviet Union, whereas for the British, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of arms limitation agreements that were made to limit German expansionism. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was highly controversial, both at the time and since, because the 35:100 tonnage ratio allowed Germany the right to build a Navy beyond the limits set by the Treaty of Versailles, and the British had made the agreement without consulting France or Italy.|$|E

Carnegie led the International League in home runs in 1938 and 1939. Carnegie has won multiple accolades during his career and after. In 1938, he won the Most Valuable Player in the International League. Carnegie was the career International League leader in home runs with 258, until Mike Hessman hit his 259th on June 30, 2014.

Carnegie is also a Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame member, inducted in 1992. Amongst many fans and professionals, Carnegie is widely renowned {{as one of the}} best Buffalo baseball players ever.|$|E
25|$|In 570 the Arian {{king of the}} Visigoths, Leovigild, {{made his}} first attack on the Suebi. Between 572 and 574, Leovigild invaded {{the valley of the}} Douro, pushing the Suebi west and northwards. In 575 the Suebic king, Miro, made a peace treaty with Leovigild in what seemed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new period of stability. Yet, in 583 Miro {{supported}} the rebellion of the Catholic Gothic prince Hermenegild, engaging in military action against king Leovigild, although Miro was defeated in Seville when trying to break on through the blockade on the Catholic prince. As a result, he was forced to recognize Leovigild as friend and protector, for him and for his successors, dying back home just some months later. His son, king Eboric, confirmed the friendship with Leovigild, but he was deposed just a year later by his brother-in-law Audeca, giving Leovigild an excuse to attack the kingdom. In 585 AD, first Audeca and later Malaric, were defeated and the Suebic kingdom was incorporated into the Visigothic one as its sixth province. The Suebi were respected in their properties and freedom, and continued to dwell in Gallaecia, finally merging {{with the rest of the}} local population during the early Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|After {{the teams}} {{exchanged}} three-and-outs {{to begin the}} second half, the Patriots embarked on a nine-play, 89-yard drive that ended on a 4-yard Jabar Gaffney touchdown reception that gave the Patriots a 24–7 lead. After another punt, the Patriots advanced into Bills territory on a 26-yard pass to Welker that was kept alive when Welker lateraled to Moss for another 11yards. Morris then ran in for a 4-yard touchdown. The Bills were able to pin the Patriots at their own 2-yard line on their next punt, but that only proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 10-play, 98-yard drive that {{came to a close}} when Brady connected with Moss on a 45-yard touchdown pass, extending the Patriots' lead to 38–7. The catch made Moss the first player in NFL history to have three games with at least 100 receiving yards to start a season. After an exchange of punts, the Bills began their ensuing drive with Edwards throwing an interception to cornerback Asante Samuel, which was returned 42yards to the Bills' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not generate any points off the turnover, with an Evans run on fourth down from the Bills' 8-yard line coming up short of the first down. The game would end on the Bills' next drive, sending the Patriots to a 3–0 start.|$|E
