40|$|Abstract. This {{study focused}} on {{investigating}} the Nd:YAG laser perforation process of several common plastic films including biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP), <b>biaxially-oriented</b> <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> (BOPET) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) films. Films were perforated under various pulse energies of 50, 150 and 250 mJ and with pulse duration of ~ 10 ns and pulse repetition of 1 Hz. It was found that, BOPP, BOPET and LDPE films could be perforated using our developed Nd:YAG laser perforating system. Perforation width or diameters of all films increased with increasing pulse energies. Observed perforations were different among the three film types. For instance, at the pulse energy of 150 mJ, average microperforation diameters of BOPP, BOPET, and LDPE were 51. 9, 57. 5, and 31. 0 microns, respectively. Overall results clearly demonstrated that a Nd:YAG laser perforation process {{used in this study}} was effective in developing breathable packaging films with tailored oxygen permeation property. Commercial BOPP films containing 200 - 1, 400 micro-perforations/m 2 (average perforation diameter of 50 µm) showed a significant improvement in oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of 25 - 700 % over that of the regular BOPP. Very high OTR films of 16, 000 cc/m 2. day could be effectively produced for the micro-perforated BOPP, where OTR values of close to 20, 000 cc/m 2. day was obtainable in the case of BOPET films...|$|E

The hydrolization of <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> film was primarily performed with sodium hydroxide aque-ous solution {{to produce a}} carboxyl-enriched surface. The multilayer films were fabricated by the alternate adsorption of the oppositely charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and silver nanoparticles on <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate. The assembly process was monitored by UV–VIS spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma. The surface topography and chemical composition of the self-assembly films was characterized by atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The images indicated that the silver nanoparticles were successfully assembled and well distributed on the substrate. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metallic silver on the <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate. The thermal properties of the multilayer films were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analyser. The results revealed that the storage modulus of ten-bilayer films decreases with temperature increasing and the glass transition temperature of ten-bilayer films {{have been found to}} be 99. 3 C, whereas it is 94. 8 C for the original <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> film...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{behaviour}} of blends of {{a liquid}} crystalline copoly(ester amide) (Vectra B 950) with two isotropic polymers {{has been studied}} by differential scanning calorimetry. One of the isotropic polymers is an amorphous polymer – polycarbonate, {{the other is a}} semi-crystalline polymer – <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate).</b> It was found that the glass transition temperature of polycarbonate decreases with increasing Vectra concentration in the blend, suggesting a partial miscibility between the Vectra liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and polycarbonate. The miscibility is enhanced through heat treatment at elevated temperatures presumably due to a transesterification reaction. Moreover, the presence of the amorphous poly- carbonate hinders the crystallization of the liquid crystalline polymer in the blends. It was also observed that heat treatment of the Vectra LCP and <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> blends causes a loss in crystallinity and shifts in transition temperatures of <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate),</b> indicating that exchange reactions occur between Vectra B 950 and <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate).</b> Based on these results, a new strategy, in situ compatibilization, is proposed to improve the interfacial adhesion between an LCP and an isotropic polymer...|$|R
