5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered <b>by</b> <b>Georgia,</b> however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|George P. Burdell is {{a fictitious}} student officially {{enrolled}} at Georgia Tech in 1927 {{as a practical}} joke. Since then, he has supposedly received all undergraduate degrees offered <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech, served in the military, gotten married, and served on Mad magazine's Board of Directors, among other accomplishments. Burdell at one point led the online poll for Times 2001 Person of the Year award. He has evolved into an important and notorious campus tradition; all Georgia Tech students learn about him at orientation.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{had another}} {{significant}} {{win over the}} Clemson Tigers on October 29, 2011 at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Clemson was ranked nationally No. 5 at the time, and the Tigers suffered their first defeat of the season {{at the hands of}} the Yellow Jackets. Tevin Washington led the Yellow Jackets to a 31–17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech's defense in the first half, and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for the Yellow Jackets.|$|E

5|$|Georgia {{began its}} first {{possession}} with a 25-yard kickoff return, {{but failed to}} earn a first down {{in the face of}} a tough Hokie defensive effort. Georgia punter Gordon Ely-Kelso kicked a 56-yard punt following the Virginia Tech defensive stop. A breakdown in special teams coverage <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> allowed Virginia Tech kick returner Eddie Royal to break free, returning the kick 56yards back to the original line of scrimmage. As a result of the excellent field position provided by the return, Virginia Tech was able to drive the remaining 30yards to the end zone. Branden Ore earned his second touchdown of the game, making the score 14–3 with 6:13 remaining on the clock.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII, Vanille was {{originally}} {{going to be}} the main character, but after the game was shown off with Lightning in the central role, the decision was scrapped. In an interview with Siliconera, Vanille's English voice actor stated that she found it relatively easy connecting with the character because of the similarities in their basic personalities. Vanille is voiced <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> van Cuylenburg in English, and by Yukari Fukui in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Georgia outplayed Vanderbilt. The Commodores had two first downs {{in the first}} half, both because of Bulldog penalties. A Commodore punt was {{returned}} 15 yards <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> to the Vanderbilt 30-yard line, and the Bulldogs completed an 18-yard pass from Dick Hartley to halfback Jim Tom Reynolds on Vanderbilt's 12-yard line. After three short gains, Hartley advanced five yards and Vanderbilt was penalized for being offside. Jim Reynolds, gaining a yard or so, went over for the touchdown with a counter on the following series; the close call was disputed. At {{the end of the}} half, Georgia had gained 113 yards to Vanderbilt's nine.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, 2011, Georgia Tech {{was forced}} to vacate the win due to an NCAA investigation. The NCAA accused Tech of fielding an ineligible player during the game, and {{although}} {{they were unable to}} obtain evidence that an ineligible player had been played, the NCAA concluded that the investigation had been hampered <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech's administration. This was taken as evidence of wrongdoing, and penalties for playing an ineligible player were imposed.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 ACC Championship Game {{was held}} in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, on December 6, 2008. Virginia Tech won by a score of 30–12, {{becoming}} the first ACC team to win consecutive ACC championship games. Tampa also hosted the 2009 ACC Championship Game which was won <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech over Clemson. Poor attendance in both of the Florida locations caused a move to Charlotte, North Carolina's Bank of America Stadium for the 2010 and 2011 games. Charlotte hosted the game again in 2012 and 2013. In February 2014 {{it was announced that}} Charlotte would continue to host the game through at least 2019.|$|E

The copyright to that version expired in 1952, so Greenblatt wrote a new arrangement and {{applied for a}} new copyright. In 1953, Greenblatt sold the copyright for the new version to Georgia Tech for one dollar. There was some controversy when MPL Communications acquired the old copyright; a law firm commissioned <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech in 1984, Newton, Hopkins & Ormsby, concluded that while there were copyrighted versions of the song, the version used by the school was not copyrighted and falls in the public domain.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} several alumni owned {{vehicles}} that are painted {{to resemble the}} Wreck. These vehicles mimic {{the look and feel}} of the Reck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One of the most famous instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Toyah Laverne Battersby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British soap opera Coronation Street, played <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Taylor. Toyah {{and her family}} {{were introduced to the}} serial by executive producer Brian Park in a bid to increase falling ratings. Actress and singer Toyah Willcox gave the producers permission to name the youngest member of the Battersby family after herself, since the character was said to be born during the height of her career. Taylor originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall, but was cast as Toyah instead. The role marked her acting debut. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 July 1997.|$|E

Three days later, a military offensive against the Kodori Gorge was officially initiated by Abkhaz separatists. Abkhaz defence official said that Georgian forces were pushed out of the Kodori Gorge by the operation. Although he claimed that Russians {{did not participate in}} the battle, Russian military traffic headed for the gorge was witnessed by an Associated Press reporter. Casualties were light on both sides; Abkhaz fighters accidentally killed one of their comrades, and two Georgian soldiers were also killed. About 2,000 people living in the Kodori Gorge fled.|$|E

5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech. However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
5|$|His third book (co-authored <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Congressman John Linder) {{entitled}} The FairTax Book, {{explains the}} proposal to implement a national retail sales tax {{in lieu of the}} federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, McNair's {{idea for}} a Yellow Jacket was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was {{apparently}} unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellow jacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student, {{a few weeks later}} simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans naturally believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980 this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot <b>by</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E
