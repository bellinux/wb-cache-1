5|$|At {{present the}} most {{informative}} sequence of dinosaur-bearing {{rocks in the}} world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (from Montana and Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.|$|E
40|$|Couette flow of two viscous, incompressible, {{immiscible}} fluids in {{a channel}} bounded by permeable <b>beds</b> <b>is</b> investigated. The lower <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> of finite thickness with high permeability {{and the upper}} <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> of infinite thickness with low permeability. The flow in the lower permeable <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> described by Brinkman equation whereas the flow in the upper permeable <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> described by Darcy’s law. The flow between the two <b>beds</b> <b>is</b> governed by Navier-Stokes equations. The velocity field and the mass flow rate are obtained. It is observed that the velocity is in increasing trend with the increment in the Reynolds number...|$|R

50|$|The Gynaecology and Maternity {{block with}} 40 <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} in 1928. Construction {{works of the}} Ophthalmic Block with 80 <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1932. The Out Patient (OP) block and Casualty was constructed in 1940. A Children's ward with 36 <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> constructed nearby in 1943 and later merged with the Gynaec block.|$|R
5|$|Outcrops of this {{brightly colored}} red, brown, and pink banded {{formation}} {{can be seen}} in the Kolob Canyons section of the park and in buttes on either side of State Route9 between Rockville, Utah to the south and Virgin, Utah to the southwest of the park borders. Progressively higher <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> exposed until the top of the formation is reached at the mouth of Parunweap Canyon (when traveling to the park on Route9).|$|E
5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> sandwiched between units comprising interbedded sandstones, siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed {{at the mouth}} of a delta's distributaries.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> formed of {{sediment}} which deposited during the various Missoula Floods, around 16,450 to 13,750BCE, {{and during the}} Bonneville Flood that occurred in approximately 12,500BCE. Another potential source for periodic flooding, still somewhat controversial, is flood release by jökulhlaups from subglacial lakes in British Columbia, but no specific source for these jökulhlaups has yet been identified.|$|E
30|$|The {{optimized}} <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> lighter 8 % than original one, {{with the}} rail deformation reduced by 5 %. Therefore, the light-weight {{design of the}} <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> realized with the enhanced performance.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{attempts}} at radiometric dating of the Driftwood Creek <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> unsuccessful, however a volcanic ash exposed {{in the lake}} shale <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> radiometrically dated at 51.77 ± 0.34 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|By 1957, {{the number}} of <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> {{increased}} to 120. In 1958, an x-ray block was established. In 1959, a maternity ward with 12 <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> added. In 1960, a TB annexe with 220 <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> created, and subsequently, a cardiology centre was opened. By 1973, an ICU was started and soon many out-patient clinics such as eye, dental and ENT were also introduced.|$|R
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
5|$|In addition, about 3,750 <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} at the University-affiliated housing communities of Knights Circle and The Pointe at Central, which are off-campus apartment communities owned by The University of Central Florida Foundation, Inc. and managed by Asset Campus Housing. These communities contain many UCF services such as Resident Assistants, UCF Police service, reduced rent and offer shuttle service to and from campus on class days. The university also administers NorthView, which is {{owned and operated by}} UCF and located directly north of the main campus in Oviedo. NorthView houses 600 students, and includes a , a Catholic Student Center, and a common space for other faith based organizations to use.|$|E
5|$|Only 18 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Bahrain, animals such as gazelles, desert rabbits and {{hedgehogs}} are common in the wild but the Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora. The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, patchy coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as dugongs and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of sea cows, marine turtles and dolphins within its territorial waters.|$|E
50|$|On March 7, 2006, six {{continuing}} care <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> {{opened in}} the hospital. The project was funded through the Health Sustainability Initiative (HSI), and government funding. More <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> opened on June 16, 2008.|$|R
25|$|The {{district}} had 4,360 hospital beds.Out of this 1,105 <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> in {{the medical}} college at Bardhaman and 809 <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> in the four subdivisional towns and the balance {{in the rural areas}} in 2005-06.|$|R
50|$|A triple loft <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> an {{arrangement}} involving {{a total of}} three bunks. These bunks are a combination of bed types, where a loft <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> perpendicularly attached to a bunk bed to form an L-shape.|$|R
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> {{one element}} {{in a chain}} of {{evidence}} which helped identify and define the progression of the Missoula Floods, which occurred around 16,450 to 13,750 yearsBCE. During the floods, flow through the Wallula Gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis. Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E
50|$|Two special {{editions of}} the first were {{constructed}} with step-side <b>beds.</b> Both <b>were</b> constructed by L.E.R. Industries of Edwardsburg, Michigan. The step-side <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> constructed out of fiberglass and galvineel. Wooden <b>bed</b> rails <b>were</b> also available.|$|R

5|$|The Tendaguru {{ecosystem}} primarily {{consisted of}} three types of environment: shallow, lagoon-like marine environments, tidal flats and low coastal environments; and vegetated inland environments. The marine environment existed above the fair weather wave base and behind siliciclastic and ooid barriers. It appeared to have had little change in salinity levels and experienced tides and storms. The coastal environments consisted of brackish coastal lakes, ponds and pools. These environments had little vegetation and were probably visited by herbivorous dinosaurs mostly during droughts. The well vegetated inlands were dominated by conifers. Overall, the Late Jurassic Tendaguru climate was subtropical to tropical with seasonal rains and pronounced dry periods. During the Early Cretaceous, the Tendaguru became more humid. The Tendaguru <b>Beds</b> <b>are</b> similar to the Morrison Formation of North America except in its marine interbeds.|$|E
5|$|The Triassic rocks {{consist of}} red marls, sandstones, breccias and {{conglomerates}} which {{spread over the}} older rocks. The Dolomitic Conglomerate is an old shingle beach of Keuper Marl age. The Rhaetic <b>Beds</b> <b>are</b> full of fossils due to invasion of the Jurassic Sea. The Lias consists of clays and limestones, the latter being quarried and are famous for their fossils. Blue Lias was burnt locally to provide a source of lime for making lime mortar. It is still used as a decorative building stone. Blue Lias {{is believed to have}} been quarried on the Polden Hills as early as the 15th century and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until 1973, when the local cement works closed.|$|E
5|$|The brolga breeds {{throughout}} its range in Australia and New Guinea. The {{start of the}} breeding season is largely determined by rainfall rather than the time of year; thus the season is February to May after the rainy season in the monsoonal areas, and September to December in southern Australia. The flocks split up and pairs establish nesting territories in wetlands. In food-rich habitats, nests can be quite close together, and are often found {{in the same area}} as those of the sarus crane. The nest, which is built by both sexes, is a raised mound of sticks, uprooted grass, and other plant material sited on a small island in shallow water, or occasionally floating. If no grasses are available, mud or roots unearthed from marsh <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> employed. Sometimes the birds make hardly any nest, take over a disused swan nest, or simply lay on bare ground.|$|E
50|$|Platform <b>beds</b> {{which might}} <b>be</b> {{recognized}} as more accurate representations of today's platform <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> better defined as loft <b>beds.</b> The <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> originally situated high {{off the ground}} to allow for more living space below.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{species is}} P. lujiatunensis, {{found in the}} lowest beds of the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other beds of the Yixian, the age {{of which is the}} subject of much debate. Although many early studies using radiometric dating put the Yixian in the Jurassic Period, tens of millions of years outside of the expected temporal range of Psittacosaurus, most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using argon-argon dating, a team of Chinese scientists dated the lowest beds in the formation to about 128mya, and the highest to approximately 122mya. A more recent Chinese study, using uranium-lead dating, suggests that the lower <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> younger, approximately 123.2mya, while agreeing with an age of 122mya for the upper beds.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions about 44million {{years ago}} during the Eocene {{deposited}} lavas accompanied by debris flows (lahars) atop the older {{rocks in the}} western part of the province. Containing fragments of shale, siltstone, conglomerates, and breccias, the debris flows entombed plants and animals caught in their paths; the remnants of these ancient flows comprise the rock formations exposed in the Clarno Unit. Preserved in the Clarno Nut <b>Beds</b> <b>are</b> fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts, fruits, roots, branches, and seeds. The Clarno Formation also contains bones, palm leaves longer than , avocado trees, and other subtropical plants from 50million years ago, when the climate was warmer and wetter than it is in the 21stcentury. Large mammals that inhabited this region between 50 and 35million years ago included browsers such as brontotheres and amynodonts, scavengers like the hyaenodonts, as well as Patriofelis and other predators. Eroded remnants of the Clarno stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood, are still visible near the monument, for example Black Butte, White Butte, and other buttes near Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates are high, and life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. Abortion is illegal in Malawi. The Penal Code punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with the disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi, a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in Malawi, and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are. Raising Malawi also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education, health care, infrastructure and agriculture in Malawi.|$|E
