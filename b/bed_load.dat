5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bed</b> <b>load</b> {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. <b>Bed</b> <b>load</b> is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|E

40|$|In Natural Gas Processing, {{dehydration}} is a {{very important}} process especially when the natural gas is being transported over long distances as LNG. There are basically two types of dehydration process, TEG absorption and adsorption by desiccant materials. The adsorption dehydration is the most dominant process in the LNG plant, but prior to this process, TEG absorption is usually done upstream of the LNG plant to make the gas transportable to the LNG plant. After TEG absorption, there is always a small portion of TEG that is carried over by the dried natural gas to downstream processes. This TEG impacts the adsorption process negatively. There are also other factors that affect an adsorption process, these factors range from operating parameters of the adsorption column, the feed gas inlet conditions, and other factors that vary from plant to plant. A Matlab model has been developed to simulate an adsorption process. The bed saturation and mass transfer has been modelled and simulated. Also, a heat transfer model has been developed to examine the temperature interactions between the gas, adsorbent and column wall. The bed saturation length was found to be dependent on the duration of the adsorption time in an adsorption cycle. The longer the adsorption time, the longer the bed saturation or the equilibrium zone. For an adsorption time of 50 minutes, the equilibrium zone length was 1. 2 meters, for 100 minutes, the equilibrium zone length was 1. 4 meters and 3. 5 meters for 240 minutes. The longer the equilibrium zone, the further down the mass transfer zone is pushed towards the column bottom. The MTZ length has been kept constant in this project work, although in practice the MTZ length increases towards the exit of the column. The <b>bed</b> <b>loading</b> in an adsorption process is also affected by the feed gas conditions, such as the feed gas temperature and water saturation. From simulations, the feed gas temperature is seen to have inverse effect on the <b>bed</b> <b>loading.</b> The temperature was decreased from base case value of 27 0 C to 10 0 C and this increased the <b>bed</b> <b>loading</b> from 38. 5 % weight to 40. 0 % weight. Conversely, when the temperature was increased from 27 0 C to 50 0 C, the <b>bed</b> <b>loading</b> reduced to 35. 5 % weight. The feed gas temperature is usually determined by the upstream process before the adsorption column, usually a scrubber. This scrubber temperature determines how much water is collected in the scrubber. The <b>bed</b> <b>loading</b> is also seen to be affected by feed gas water saturation from simulations. This has a direct effect on the bad loading. When the water saturation was decreased from 730 ppm (base case) to 200 ppm, the <b>bed</b> <b>loading</b> reduced to 35. 0 % from 38. 5 % weight (base case). Similarly, when the water saturation was increased to 930 ppm, the <b>bed</b> <b>loading</b> increased to 39. 5 % weight. This is simple to understand, as the water saturation determines how much water comes into the column with the gas, and hence how much water is retained in the bed. The heat transfer model did not show any difference in the temperatures of the gas, adsorbent and column wall throughout the column length. In industry and normal practice, there is a slight temperature difference between the gas, adsorbent and wall towards the bottom or exit of the column. In this project work, this difference was not noticed, rather the gas, adsorbent and wall temperature all remained 27 0 C throughout the column. This could be due to several reasons, but the most likely reason here is that the Matlab model could have been faulty and {{there was no time to}} figure out where this fault was...|$|R

25|$|The sediments entrained in a flow can {{be transported}} along the bed as <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> {{in the form}} of sliding and rolling grains, or in {{suspension}} as suspended load advected by the main flow.

25|$|Floods {{occur in}} {{all types of}} river and stream channels, from the {{smallest}} ephemeral streams in humid zones to normally-dry channels in arid climates to the world's largest rivers. When overland flow occurs on tilled fields, it {{can result in a}} muddy flood where sediments are picked up by run off and carried as suspended matter or <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> Localized flooding may be caused or exacerbated by drainage obstructions such as landslides, ice, debris, or beaver dams.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{sediment}} trapping due to dams can be exacerbated {{when combined with}} other activities such as in-stream gravel mining. Excavation of gravel from a river bed forms pits within the channel profile which can trap much of the incoming <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sediment, preventing or slowing it from reaching the coastline. Mining can also {{reducing the amount of}} overall sediment available for transport, especially when it occurs down stream from dams. For example; approximately 300,000m3 of gravel is extracted from the San Luis Rey River in South California every year, which is almost 50 times more than the bedload sediment yield after the dam was built. Thus, removing more bedload sediment further decreases the sediment yield available to the coast.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Sedimentation is a {{hydraulic}} phenomenon that {{is emerging as}} a serious challenge in river engineering. When the flow reaches a certain state that gather potential energy, it shifts the sediment <b>load</b> along channel <b>bed.</b> The transport of such materials {{can be in the}} form of suspended and <b>bed</b> <b>loads.</b> The movement of these along the river course and channels {{and the ways in which}} this could influence the water intakes is considered as the major challenges for sustainable O&M of hydraulic structures. This could be very serious in arid and semi-arid regions like Iran, where inappropriate watershed management could lead to shifting a great deal of sediments into the reservoirs and irrigation systems. This paper aims to investigate sedimentation in the Western Canal of Dez Diversion Weir in Iran, identifying factors which influence the process and provide ways in which to mitigate its detrimental effects by using the SHARC Software. For the purpose of this paper, data from the Dezful water authority and Dezful Hydrometric Station pertinent to a river course of about 6 Km were used. Results estimated sand and silt <b>bed</b> <b>loads</b> concentrations to be 193 ppm and 827 ppm respectively. Given the available data on average annual <b>bed</b> <b>loads</b> and average suspended sediment loads of 165 ppm and 837 ppm, there was a significant statistical difference (16 %) between the sand grains, whereas no significant difference (1. 2 %) was find in the silt grain sizes. One explanation for such finding being that along the 6 Km river course there was considerable meandering effects which explains recent shift in the hydraulic behavior along the stream course under investigation. The sand concentration in downstream relative to present state of the canal showed a steep descending curve. Sediment trapping on the other hand indicated a steep ascending curve. These occurred because the diversion weir was not considered in the simulation model. Keywords—SHARC model, sedimentation, Western canal, De...|$|R

40|$|The two fluid model (TFM) {{closed by}} the kinetic theory of {{granular}} flows (KTGF) {{has been developed}} to {{a high level of}} maturity over the past three decades. However, significant uncertainties still remain about the influence of various closure models on the predictions of the hydrodynamics and especially the reactive performance of fluidised bed reactors. The three factors investigated in this study – frictional pressure, geometry (2 D/ 3 D) and friction at the walls – all have significant influences on model predictions of the behaviour of a pseudo- 2 D bubbling fluidised bed reactor. This study aims to quantify the influence of these important factors on simulation output both in terms of hydrodynamics and reactive performance. Simulations designed to evaluate the effects of these factors were carried out over a wide range of fluidisation velocities, bed loadings and particle sizes to reveal significant impacts on the results. Differences in simulation results varied significantly with changes in the three operating variables investigated (fluidisation velocity, <b>bed</b> <b>loading</b> and particle size) and were analysed in detail. Finally, 3 D simulations with wall friction and frictional pressure included showed qualitatively very similar hydrodynamic behaviour to that observed in the experiments. Quantitatively, measurements of the bed expansion ratio compared well for different fluidisation velocities and the particle sizes, but some unexplained differences were still observed in response to changes in the <b>bed</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R
