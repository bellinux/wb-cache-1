With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the <b>thermal</b> <b>capacity</b> limits for wheels. In the present work, important aspects of the <b>thermal</b> <b>capacity</b> of tread <b>braked</b> railway wheels have been assessed in a literature survey. Then two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to standard design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. The influence of <b>brake</b> block materials, <b>thermal</b> parameters and <b>brake</b> pressure distribution on the wheel temperatures has been investigated. A general result is that hot spots only have a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. Simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. In a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials, the heat partitioning characteristics between wheel and block material at controlled elevated disc temperatures were investigated by a finite element approach where a model was calibrated using measured temperatures. In the final part of the present thesis, a modelling framework was proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential stop braking. A parametric study was done for analysing the influence of various loading levels and other important factors on temperatures, axial flange deflection, residual stresses and the fatigue life of the wheels. The model and the numerical results will be useful for assessing the <b>thermal</b> <b>capacity</b> of wheels and for developing new design rules and standards.

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to support the development of the commercial vehicle electric parking brake. Though nowadays widely used on passenger cars, electric parking brake applications on commercial vehicles present completely different challenges. With the <b>brake</b> mass, <b>thermal</b> <b>capacity</b> and required clamp forces an order of magnitude higher, safe parking demands much more attention. In the first instance, the priority is placed upon predicting heat dissipation from the brake disc only. The research is presented in two parts; part one (presented here) focuses on analytical modelling and experimental verification of predicted disc temperatures over long cooling periods, with part two investigating the air flow, velocities and convective heat transfer coefficients using computational fluid dynamics modelling, also followed by experimental validations. To begin the analytical analysis, a study was conducted into the variance in mean local convective heat transfer coefficients over a simplified brake disc friction surface, by investigating typical dimensionless air properties. A nonlinear equation was derived for the average surface convective heat transfer coefficient (h conv hconv) variability with temperature drop for the entire cooling phase. Starting from fundamental principles, first-order differential equations were developed to predict the bulk disc temperature. By including variation of the convective and radiative heat dissipation throughout the cooling period, a good correlation was achieved with measured values, to within 10 %. Experiments were conducted on a specifically designed thermal rig which uses 15 [*]kW induction heater to heat the disc. Numerous experiments proved the results are very repeatable, throughout the cooling period.

Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures.

In recent years, {{there has been}} growing interest in alternative cycles to the standard 4 -stroke Otto engine for improving efficiency and lowering emissions of spark-ignition engines. One proposed concept is the 5 -stroke engine, which uses two cylinders, a combustion cylinder and an expansion cylinder with a transfer port between them. Excess pressure in the combustion cylinder can be further expanded by using a second expansion cylinder to harness additional work. The expansion cylinder runs on a two-stroke cycle, allowing the use of two combustion cylinders to one expansion cylinder in a three-cylinder configuration to increase efficiency. Previous work has investigated the performance of prototype 5 -stroke engines compared to 1 -D modeling results; none have conducted a thorough study on the interactions of various design parameters.

40|$|The Heavy Duty Truck Engine Program at Cummins {{embodied}} three significant development phases. All {{phases of}} work strove {{to demonstrate a}} high level of diesel engine efficiency in the face of increasingly stringent emission requirements. Concurrently, aftertreatment system development and refinement was pursued in support of these efficiency demonstrations. The program's first phase focused on the demonstration in-vehicle of {{a high level of}} heavy duty diesel engine efficiency (45 % <b>Brake</b> <b>Thermal</b> Efficiency) at a typical cruise condition while achieving composite emissions results which met the 2004 U. S. EPA legislated standards. With a combination of engine combustion calibration tuning and the development and application of Urea-based SCR and particulate aftertreatment, these demonstrations were successfully performed by Q 4 of 2002. The second phase of the program directed efforts towards an in-vehicle demonstration of an engine system capable of meeting 2007 U. S. EPA legislated emissions requirements while achieving 45 % <b>Brake</b> <b>Thermal</b> Efficiency at cruise conditions. Through further combustion optimization, the refinement of Cummins Cooled EGR architecture, the application of a high pressure common rail fuel system and the incorporation of optimized engine parasitics, Cummins Inc. successfully demonstrated these deliverables in Q 2 of 2004. The program's final phase set a stretch goal of demonstrating 50 % <b>Brake</b> <b>Thermal</b> Efficiency from a heavy duty diesel engine system capable of meeting 2010 U. S. EPA legislated emissions requirements. Cummins chose to pursue this goal through further combustion development and refinement of the Cooled EGR system architecture and also applied a Rankine cycle Waste Heat Recovery technique to convert otherwise wasted thermal energy to useful power. The engine and heat recovery system was demonstrated to achieve 50 % <b>Brake</b> <b>Thermal</b> Efficiency while operating at a torque peak condition in second quarter, 2006. The 50 % efficient engine system was capable of meeting 2010 emissions requirements through the application of NOx and particulate matter reduction techniques proven earlier in the program...|$|R
