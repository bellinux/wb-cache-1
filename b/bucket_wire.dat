40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{methods for}} removing dragline <b>bucket</b> <b>wire</b> rope terminations {{with the objective}} of finding efficient methods that are safer than the method most commonly used at U. S. surface mines, which is to use the explosive impact of a projectile fired from a cannon to remove the rope termination. Removal of a wire rope termination for repair or replacement requires separation of the wedge and socket that lock together to secure the rope end. The Bureau investigated currently used methods and improved upon and tested two safer alternate methods for removing wire rope terminations. A cannon test program was conducted, using 40 -and 50 -gr primer (detonating) cord, to establish the possible force produced with a 4 -in-bore cannon and a 55 -lb projectile. Wedge and socket units supplied from cooperating mines were separated under controlled conditions to establish data on separation force requirements. The two alternate methods investigated were use of the force generated by (1) a pendulum ram and by (2) a portable hydraulic pusher. Both methods are capable of providing sufficient force to effect wedge and socket separations on draglines with up to 78 -yd 3 buckets under normal conditions...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{laboratory}} downward displacement vertical autoclave {{with the help}} of thermocouples recorded on a 12 point multichannel strip recorder, the risk of failing to sterilize laboratory discard buckets has been demonstrated. The use of proper temperature and time controls can prevent this risk. A load in a bucket with perforated sides is more easily sterilized than in a solid <b>bucket.</b> <b>Wire</b> baskets, where appropriate, facilitate the sterilizing practice. The addition of water to a bucket does not reduce the time of heating up. It is desirable that sealed bottles of media should not be sterilized in simple downward displacement autoclaves, but if used, strict monitoring of temperatures and times is essential both in the heating up stage and especially in the cooling stage. The temperatures in bottles are slow to rise and very slow to fall. Bottles at high temperature 80 - 105 degrees C. or over have a high internal pressure which can allow the bottles to explode when subjected to thermal shock if removed too early. It is suggested that all laboratory autoclaves should have a load temperature simulator or similar device to control the temperature of the load during the cycle automatically. For the sterilization of fluid media, it is suggested that, in addition to a simulator there should be accelerated cooling to reduce damage to the media and, what is more important, to rapidly bring down the temperature and thus the internal pressure in the bottles to a safe level. The opening of the sterilizer door or lid should be automatically controlled by the load temperature simulator...|$|E
