6000|$|... § XIII. The {{question}} of <b>bevelling</b> becomes {{a little more}} complicated in the inlet than the outlook window, because the mass or quantity of light admitted is often of more consequence than its direction, and often vice versâ; and the outlook window is supposed to be approachable, which is far from being always the case with windows for light, so that the <b>bevelling</b> which in the outlook window is chiefly to open range of sight, is in the inlet a means not only of admitting the light in greater quantity, but of directing it to the spot on which it is to fall. But, in general, the <b>bevelling</b> of the one window will reverse that of the other; for, first, no natural light will strike on the inlet window from beneath, unless reflected light, which is (I believe) injurious to the health and the sight; and thus, while in the outlook window the outside bevel downwards is essential, in the inlet it would be useless: and the sill is to be flat, if the window be on a level with the spot it is to light; and sloped downwards within, if above it. Again, as the brightest rays of light are the steepest, the outside bevel upwards is as essential in the roof of the inlet as it was of small importance in that of the outlook window.|$|E
60|$|I have no doubt, from {{observation}} {{of the way the}} windows are set together, that the side pieces were carved in pairs, like hooks, of which the keystones were to be the eyes; that these side pieces were ordered by the architect in the gross, and were used by him sometimes for wider, sometimes for narrower windows; <b>bevelling</b> the two ends as required, fitting in keystones as he best could, and now and then varying the arrangement by turning the side pieces upside down.|$|E
6000|$|... § III. We have it also {{determined}} by necessity, that the apertures shall {{be at least}} above a man's height, with perpendicular sides (for sloping sides are evidently unnecessary, and even inconvenient, therefore absurd) and level threshold; and this aperture we at present suppose simply cut through the wall without any <b>bevelling</b> of the jambs. Such a door, wide enough for two persons to pass each other easily, and with such fillings or valves as we may hereafter find expedient, may be fit enough for any building into which entrance is required neither often, nor by many persons at a time. But when entrance and egress are constant, or required by crowds, certain further modifications must take place.|$|E
50|$|Zerol <b>bevel</b> gears are an {{intermediate}} type between straight and spiral <b>bevel</b> gears. Their teeth are curved, but not angled. Zerol <b>bevel</b> gears {{are designed with}} the intent of duplicating the characteristics of a straight <b>bevel</b> gear but they are produced using a spiral <b>bevel</b> cutting process.|$|R
5000|$|Double <b>bevel</b> or {{compound}} <b>bevel</b> — A back <b>bevel,</b> {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge <b>bevel</b> (the <b>bevel</b> which is the foremost cutting surface). This back <b>bevel</b> keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single <b>bevel,</b> sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single <b>bevel</b> blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the <b>bevel</b> is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double <b>bevels</b> are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and back <b>bevel</b> angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a double <b>bevel,</b> with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|R

6000|$|... § V. Farther. As persons on {{the outside}} may often {{approach}} the door or depart from it, beside the building, so as to turn aside as they enter or leave the door, and therefore touch its jamb, but, on the inside, will {{in almost every case}} approach the door, or depart from it in the direct line of the entrance (people generally walking forward when they enter a hall, court, or chamber of any kind, and being forced to do so when they enter a passage), it is evident that the <b>bevelling</b> may be very slight on the inside, but should be large {{on the outside}}, so that the plan of the aperture should become as at b, Fig. XLIII. Farther, as the bevelled wall cannot conveniently carry an unbevelled arch, the door arch must be bevelled also, and the aperture, seen from the outside, will have somewhat the aspect of a small cavern diminishing towards the interior.|$|E
60|$|The major {{was aware}} that Maud had used this room {{for the last seven}} years. It was here he had seen her {{handkerchief}} waving at the loop, when he last departed; and hundreds of times since had he thought of this act of watchful affection, with doubts that led equally to pain or pleasure, as images of merely sisterly care, or of a tenderer feeling, obtruded themselves. These loops were four feet long, cut in the usual <b>bevelling</b> manner, through the massive timbers; were glazed, and had thick, bullet-proof, inside shutters, that in this room were divided in equal parts, in order to give Maud the proper use of the light she wanted. All these shutters were now closed by command of the captain, in order to conceal the lights that would be flickering through the different garrets; and so far had caution become a habit, that Maud seldom exposed her person at night, near the loop, with the shutter open.|$|E
6000|$|... § XI. 1. Outlook apertures. For these no general outline is determinable by {{the necessities}} or inconveniences of outlooking, except {{only that the}} bottom or sill of the windows, at {{whatever}} height, should be horizontal, {{for the convenience of}} leaning on it, or standing on it if the window be to the ground. The form of {{the upper part of the}} window is quite immaterial, for all windows allow a greater range of sight when they are approached than that of the eye itself: it is the approachability of the window, that is to say, the annihilation of the thickness of the wall, which is the real point to be attended to. If, therefore, the aperture be inaccessible, or so small that the thickness of the wall cannot be entered, the wall is to be bevelled[57] on the outside, so as to increase the range of sight as far as possible; if the aperture can be entered, then bevelled from the point to which entrance is possible. The <b>bevelling</b> will, if possible, be in every direction, that is to say, upwards at the top, outwards at the sides, and downwards at the bottom, but essentially downwards; the earth and the doings upon it being the chief object in outlook windows, except of observatories; and where the object is a distinct and special view downwards, it will be of advantage to shelter the eye as far as possible from the rays of light coming from above, and the head of the window may be left horizontal, or even the whole aperture sloped outwards, as the slit in a letter-box is inwards.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the grips, {{it is important to know}} that the handle of a racquet always consists of 8 sides, or in other words, has an octagonal shape. A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called <b>bevels.</b> The <b>bevels</b> can be numbered from 1 to 8; with the racquet surface perpendicular to the ground, the <b>bevels</b> are numbered from the top anti-clockwise.

6000|$|... § XIX. The depth {{at which}} the glass should be placed, in windows without traceries, will {{generally}} be fixed by the forms of their <b>bevelling,</b> the glass occupying the narrowest interval; but when its position is not thus fixed, as in many London houses, {{it is to be}} remembered that the deeper the glass is set (the wall being of given thickness), the more light will enter, and the clearer the prospect will be to a person sitting quietly in the centre of the room; on the contrary, the farther out the glass is set, the more convenient the window will be for a person rising and looking out of it. The one, therefore, is an arrangement for the idle and curious, who care only {{about what is going on}} upon the earth: the other for those who are willing to remain at rest, so that they have free admission of the light of Heaven. This might be noted as a curious expressional reason for the necessity (of which no man of ordinary feeling would doubt for a moment) of a deep recess in the window, on the outside, to all good or architectural effect: still, as there is no reason why people should be made idle by having it in their power to look out of window, and as the slight increase of light or clearness of view in the centre of a room is more than balanced by the loss of space, and the greater chill of the nearer glass and outside air, we can, I fear, allege no other structural reason for the picturesque external recess, than the expediency of a certain degree of protection, for the glass, from the brightest glare of sunshine, and heaviest rush of rain.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a quandary}} but, {{bringing}} {{common sense to}} bear on it, evidently {{there was nothing for}} it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, <b>bevelling</b> around by Mullett's and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's the stonecutter's in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke's the baker's it is said.|$|E

50|$|Urewe {{ceramics}} are modest in size, measuring from 30 cm up to {{a maximum}} of 36 cm in height. Three distinct shapes have been observed: vases, small vases, both closed s-shaped pieces, open-bowls on which stereotyped patterns have been crafted: and <b>bevelling</b> on the rim, hatching on the neck surface for ease of handling, the body decorated with a ribboned pattern of crafted geometrical designs, and a dimple base finish. The decorative markings are adapted to and emphasise the shape of the vase with its 4 components, often seen on the little vase in simplified form. Conversely, these ‘4 component’ patterns are all stuck on the bowl; regardless of its ‘3 components’ shape. One proposed hypothesis suggests the bowl was developed later than the vase. Support for this comes from the identification, in terms of Bantu linguistics, of a new term first appearing around 1000 B.C. meaning “frying pan” probably serving as a clue to a change in cooking techniques reflecting adaptation to a more sedentary lifestyle when Bantu-speaking people began to settle in the Rwanda and Burundi hills.|$|E
