50|$|Cubane (C8H8) is a {{synthetic}} hydrocarbon molecule {{that consists of}} eight carbon atoms arranged {{at the corners of}} a cube, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. A solid crystalline substance, cubane is one of the Platonic hydrocarbons {{and a member of the}} prismanes. It was first synthesized in 1964 by Philip Eaton and Thomas Cole. Before this work, researchers believed that cubic carbon-based molecules would be too unstable to exist. The cubic shape requires the carbon atoms to adopt an unusually sharp 90° <b>bonding</b> <b>angle,</b> which would be highly strained as compared to the 109.45° angle of a tetrahedral carbon. Once formed, cubane is quite kinetically stable, due to a lack of readily available decomposition paths. It is the simplest hydrocarbon with octahedral symmetry.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{reported}} use of halogen bonding in liquid crystal formation was by H. Loc Nguyen. [...] In {{an effort to}} form liquid crystals, alkoxystilbazoles and pentafluoroiodobenzene were used. Previous studies by Metrangolo and Resnati demonstrated the utility of pentafluoroiodobenzene for solid-state structures. Various alkoxystilbazoles have been utilized for nonlinear optics and metallomesogens. Using another finding of Resnati (e.g. N&minus;I complexes form strongly), the group engineered halogen-bonded complexes with iodopentafluorobenzene and 4-alkoxystilbazoles. X-ray crystallography revealed a N&minus;I distance of 2.811(4) Å and the <b>bonding</b> <b>angle</b> to be 168.4°. Similar N&minus;I distances were measured in solid powders. The N&minus;I distance discovered is shorter {{than the sum of}} the Van Der Waals radii for nitrogen and iodine (3.53 Å). The single crystal structure of the molecules indicated that no quadrupolar interactions were present. The complexes in Figure 4 were found to be liquid-crystalline.|$|E
50|$|The {{accepted}} {{crystal structure}} of ordinary ice was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1935. The structure of ice Ih is roughly one of crinkled planes composed of tessellating hexagonal rings, with an oxygen atom on each vertex, and {{the edges of}} the rings formed by hydrogen bonds. The planes alternate in an ABAB pattern, with B planes being reflections of the A planes along the same axes as the planes themselves. The distance between oxygen atoms along each bond is about 275 pm and is the same between any two bonded oxygen atoms in the lattice. The angle between bonds in the crystal lattice is very close to the tetrahedral angle of 109.5°, which is also quite close to the angle between hydrogen atoms in the water molecule (in the gas phase), which is 105°. This tetrahedral <b>bonding</b> <b>angle</b> of the water molecule essentially accounts for the unusually low density of the crystal lattice - it is beneficial for the lattice to be arranged with tetrahedral angles even though there is an energy penalty in the increased volume of the crystal lattice. As a result, the large hexagonal rings leave almost enough room for another water molecule to exist inside. This gives naturally occurring ice its unique property of being less dense than its liquid form. The tetrahedral-angled hydrogen-bonded hexagonal rings are also the mechanism that causes liquid water to be densest at 4 °C. Close to 0 °C, tiny hexagonal ice Ih-like lattices form in liquid water, with greater frequency closer to 0 °C. This effect decreases the density of the water, causing it to be densest at 4 °C when the structures form infrequently.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBi-material {{interfaces}} {{exist in}} many advanced materials and structures. Measurement of interface bonding strength is more diffucult than measurement of strengths of homogeneous materials {{because of the}} presence of stress singularity at the interface corner, non uniform stress distribution along the interface and co-existence of normal and shear stress components. The order of the stress singularity depends on the interface geometry and material combination. Besides pure tensile and pure shear strength, a general biaxial normal-shear bonding strength criterion, for example, in the form of a strength envelope in normal-shear stress plane, is prefered to more realistically and adequately characterize the strength property of bi-material interface. This paper presents a new test method to determine the interface bonding strength envelope. The design of specimen geometry is based on an axi-symmetric asymptotic analysis on the stress field near the free edge of the bi-material interface, through which appropriate interface <b>bonding</b> <b>angle</b> is chosen to eliminate the stress singularity.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to form {{uncompressed}} thermobonded 3 D wool nonwoven shell structures in one continuous process, and to study the controlling factors that govern this process. Lack of bonding between wool fibres and between wool and thermoplastic fibres was attributed to the wool fibre's low surface energy because of the lipids on the outer surface of wool fibres (epicuticle). To overcome this problem, three different surface treatments were investigated; chlorination, Hercosett and plasma. The purpose of these treatments was to raise the surface energy of wool fibres by bond scission and the introduction of new functional polar groups and ablation of the outer lipid layer or membrane. For thermobonding with wool fibres, low melting nylon fibres were chosen because of their high polarity and chemical compatibility with wool fibres. SEM, BSM and ESEM imaging techniques as well as tensile strength testing for single fibres, pair bonded samples and 3 D nonwoven shells were used to assess the samples. Results have shown {{that it is possible to}} thermobond wool and nylon fibres as 3 D shell structures, given that wool fibres are treated appropriately and the bonding temperature is controlled properly.

40|$|One {{challenge}} in {{condensed matter physics}} is the active control of quantum phases of functional transition metal oxides (TMOs) using photons. The realization of active control falls into the research field of photo-induced phase transitions using ultrafast spectroscopy, which has attracted research effort {{for the past two}} decades. Early research demonstrated photo-control of spin crossover compounds and the neutral-to-ionic transition in organic crystals. The realization of photo-control of the macroscopic properties of metal oxides is not a simple extension of the old subject, but a rebirth and extension of this research area as reflected in the following ways: 1. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy (UOS) provides a dynamical route to analyze the coupled degrees of freedom in the equilibrium state of TMOs, providing a new approach to understand fundamental issues in condensed matter physics. 2. UOS studies of complex materials drive the development of new high precision experimental techniques to facilitate mode-selective excitation. 3. The active control of magnetism, ferro-electricity, superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions in TMOs opens new avenues for the design and application of novel optoelectronic devices. An even greater challenge for photo-induced phase transition is to realize nonthermal switching between the ground state and a meta-stable phase, having a well-defined order parameter. For this purpose we perform ultrafast optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy on the strain-engineered colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) material La 2 / 3 Ca 1 / 3 MnO 3. We utilize the anisotropic strain applied by NdGaO 3 (001) substrates to tune the La 2 / 3 Ca 1 / 3 MnO 3 into a charge ordered insulating (COI) phase, originating from the enhanced orthorhombicity of the lattice, such that Mn-O-Mn <b>bonding</b> <b>angle</b> deviates from 180 ^o. Both octahedral tilting and Jahn-Teller-like distortion suppress the ferromagnetism and itinerant nature of the d-electrons. Thus, a charge ordered insulating phase dominates at low temperatures. Using ultrafast spectroscopy, we demonstrate a persistent and single-laser-pulse driven insulator-to-metal phase transition in these La 2 / 3 Ca 1 / 3 MnO 3 thin films. The experimental results demonstrate that the light-induced phase transition is of a cooperative nature involving multiple degrees of freedom, with the key ingredient of the switching being magnetoelastic coupling.
