The first race was held on 23 February 1843 when prize money on offer was only $150. In 1924, the Club changed its name to the Singapore Turf Club.

5000|$|There {{are four}} main avenues for race betting in Australia. Licensed {{on-track}} bookmakers offer fixed-odds betting, mostly on wins and places. Off-track betting was traditionally {{controlled by the}} various state government through organisation called [...] "Totalisator Agency Boards" [...] (TAB), which offered mainly parimutuel betting - that is, the odds were not fixed but involved [...] "the house" [...] taking a fixed cut and distributing the remainder amongst people who made a winning bet. Many of these [...] "TABs" [...] have now been privatised, and many pubs now offer <b>betting</b> <b>services</b> linked to the privatised offshoots of the companies. In some parts of Australia there was a tradition of illegal off-course bookmaking, known as SP bookmaking. This became a large area of vice, intimately associated with police corruption and racetrack rigging. Several Royal Commissions investigated the practice, {{and there were many}} attempts to eradicate it. Once a common sight in suburban pubs and bars, the introduction of telephone and internet betting at fixed prices by licensed on-course bookmakers has made it largely redundant.
