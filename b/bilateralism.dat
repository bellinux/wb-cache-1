50|$|There {{has been}} a long debate on the merits of <b>bilateralism</b> versus multilateralism. The first {{rejection}} of <b>bilateralism</b> came after the First World War when many politicians concluded that the complex pre-war system of bilateral treaties had made war inevitable. This {{led to the creation of}} the multilateral League of Nations (which was disbanded in failure after 26 years).|$|E

50|$|International {{relations}} are developed through international cooperation {{and international organizations}} giving rise to military alliance, cooperation through a trade pact or development of a trade bloc. These can set common policies of foreign intervention through <b>bilateralism</b> or multilateralism, and international agreement on a treaty.|$|E
50|$|Carmen María Gallardo Hernández (born 28 November 1949) is a Salvadorian diplomat. Gallardo Hernádez's {{career has}} {{established}} {{her as a}} prominent figure and proponent of both <b>bilateralism</b> and multilateralism relations. She has served in key diplomatic posts abroad and has served {{in a wide variety}} of representative roles in the United Nations and other international organizations.|$|E
50|$|Compared to unilateralism and <b>bilateralism</b> {{where only}} the country itself decides {{on what to}} do or make {{decisions}} between two nations, multilateralism is much more complex and challenging. It involves a number of nations which makes reaching an agreement difficult. In multilateralism, there may be no consensus; each nation has to dedicate to some degree, to make the best outcome for all.|$|E
50|$|Economic {{agreements}}, such as {{free trade}} agreements (FTA) or {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI), signed by two states, are a common example of <b>bilateralism.</b> Since most economic agreements are signed according to the specific characteristics of the contracting countries to give preferential treatment to each other, not a generalized principle but a situational differentiation is needed. Thus through <b>bilateralism,</b> states can obtain more tailored agreements and obligations that only apply to particular contracting states. However, the states will face a trade-off {{because it is more}} wasteful in transaction costs than the multilateral strategy. In a bilateral strategy, a new contract has to be negotiated for each participant. So it tends to be preferred when transaction costs are low and the member surplus, which corresponds to “producer surplus” in economic terms, is high.Moreover, this will be effective if an influential state wants control over small states from a liberalism perspective, because building a series of bilateral arrangements with small states can increase a state's influence.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bilateralism</b> is {{the conduct}} of political, economic, or {{cultural}} relations between two sovereign states. It {{is in contrast to}} unilateralism or multilateralism, which is activity by a single state or jointly by multiple states, respectively. When states recognize one another as sovereign states and agree to diplomatic relations, they create a bilateral relationship. States with bilateral ties will exchange diplomatic agents such as ambassadors to facilitate dialogues and cooperations.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the high}} profile of modern {{multilateral}} {{systems such as}} the United Nations and World Trade Organization, most diplomacy is still done at the bilateral level. <b>Bilateralism</b> has a flexibility and ease lacking in most compromise-dependent multilateral systems. In addition, disparities in power, resources, money, armament, or technology are more easily exploitable by the stronger side in bilateral diplomacy, which powerful states might consider as a positive aspect of it, compared to the more consensus-driven multilateral form of diplomacy, where the one state-one vote rule applies.|$|E

5000|$|Henry Kissinger {{appointed}} Tom to {{the role}} of Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs in 1973. [...] Tom’s job was to corral the allies into a common approach to the energy crisis and prevent <b>bilateralism</b> from gaining the upper hand. The US spearheaded the International Energy Program (IEP) Agreement, underpinned by the International Energy Agency(IEA), which still exists today, as a counterweight to OPEC. To make the US credible on the IEA, Congress adopted our first energy legislation in 1975 promoting conservation, renewable and alternative energy resources.|$|E
5000|$|Although [...] "as a rule, {{multilateralism}} is {{the preferred}} strategy for exercising control over another country," [...] <b>bilateralism</b> was preferred {{in the region and}} was thus deliberately selected due to the asymmetric advantages of creating economic and material dependency of the smaller states on the stronger state by constraining aggressive behaviors of the former. In the post-Cold War period, the domino theory, which “held that the fall of one small country in Asia could trigger a chain of countries falling to communism” was prevailing which made the U.S. perceive the costs of pursuing multilateralism high as it may entrap the U.S. into another unwanted war.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, these {{challenges}} presented by U.S {{could be explained}} more with the strong belief on bilateral alliances as instruments of control. Liberal institutionalists would argue, though, that great powers might still opt for a multilateral alliance. But great powers can amplify their capabilities to control small powers and maximize their leverage by forging a series of bilateral arrangements with allies, rather than see that leverage diluted in a multilateral forum. Arguably, the George W. Bush administration favored intense <b>bilateralism</b> over multilateralism, or even unilateralism, for similar reasons. Rather than going it alone or going it with others, the administration opted for intensive one-on-one relationships with handpicked countries that maximized the U.S. capacity to achieve its objectives.|$|E

50|$|The Locke Mission {{refers to}} the 1951 - 1953 attempt by the {{administration}} of Harry S Truman to create a regional office for the Near East (encompassing much of the modern day Middle East) in Beirut, Lebanon. This office operated {{under the guidance of}} Edwin A. Locke Jr. to coordinate all aspects of United States economic policy toward the region, with a particular focus on U.S. aid. In 1951, this aid was primarily provided to Arab refugees through the United Nations Relief and Works Administration and to specific nations and social classes through the Mutual Security Program and the Technical Cooperation Administration. A variety of factors doomed the mission, the office was quickly closed down, and today the Locke Mission is primarily noteworthy {{as one of the first}} examples of a drift from <b>bilateralism</b> toward regionalism in the Near East.|$|E
5000|$|Choosing {{multilateralism}} {{means there}} is a coordinated approach in foreign policies with several countries rather than a single one. To Choose <b>bilateralism</b> means that foreign policies of a country are not coordinated with other countries and/or that engage with another single country. Multilateralism, by contrast, involves both the coordination of policy among three or more states and coordination around a series of generalized principles of conduct. Victor Cha argues that: power asymmetries [...] "select" [...] {{for the type of}} structures, bilateral or multilateral, that offer the most control. If small powers try to control a larger one, then multilateralism is effective. But if great powers seek control over smaller ones, bilateral alliances are more effective.Thus, this decision to select <b>bilateralism</b> or multilateralism when enacting foreign policies would be greatly affected by its size of power {{and the power of the}} country which it seeks to have control over. Take the example of Foreign Policy of the United States, there are a large number of references discussing how the United States chose to interact with its alliances. Among them in particular, the United States chose multilateralism in Europe and decided form NATO, while it formed bilateral alliances, or the Hub and spokes architecture in East Asia. Although there are many arguments about the reason why the United States decided to do so, Victor Cha's [...] "powerplay" [...] theory provides a possible reason. Victor Cha argues that: ...postwar U.S planners had to contend with a region uniquely constituted of potential rogue allies, through their aggressive behavior, could potentially entrap the United States in an unwanted wider war in Asia. ... To avoid this outcome, the United States created a series of tight, deep bilateral alliances with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan through which it could exercise maximum control and prevent unilateral aggression. Furthermore, it did not seek to make these bilateral alliances multilateral, because it wanted to amplify U.S. control and minimize any collusion among its partners.|$|E

On March 2, 2012, head of U.S. Pacific Command Admiral Robert Willard visited Bangladesh, and later said at a Congressional hearing that U.S. Special Forces teams were currently stationed in this South Asian country for tactical training purposes-- Bangladesh—as part of the counter-terrorism cooperation with that nation.

40|$|Symmetry in {{biological}} systems is {{the occurrence of}} an event {{on both sides of}} the system. The term <b>bilateralism</b> was introduced to represent this phenomenon, and it was defined as the conditional co-occurrence of two events given that at least at one of them has occurred. This phenomenon is highly associated with the prevalence of each of the events. Two parameters were developed to evaluate the presence of this phenomenon, testing whether events co-occur with higher probability than would be expected by chance. Nonparametric confidence intervals were constructed using the bootstrap percentile method. These non parametric confidence intervals were used in testing the null hypothesis of no <b>bilateralism.</b> A simulation study was performed to examine the properties of the two <b>bilateralism</b> parameters 2 ̆ 7 estimates. The size and power of the tests of <b>bilateralism</b> were examined under a variety of sample sizes and prevalences of the two events. The simulation study showed that both parameter estimates have similar properties, and the tests have similar size and power. The power of the test was affected by the prevalence of either event, the differences in the prevalences, the sample size and by number of events that occur simultaneously. The methodology of testing for <b>bilateralism</b> was applied on data from the Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study (PiSCES). This study collected up to 6 months worth of daily diaries about pain and medical utilization from patients with sickle cell disease. Each diary recorded the body site and side where pain was experienced over the past 24 hours. The sample consists of 119 subjects who completed at least 50 daily pain diaries (reference). Information about the subjects age, gender and sickle cell genotype were also available. Nine body sites (5 upper peripheral, and 4 lower peripheral site) were analyzed to test for <b>bilateralism.</b> <b>Bilateralism</b> was tested for each subject and each site separately. The associations of prevalence of <b>bilateralism</b> on each site, and percentages of sites that hurt bilaterally with age, gender and genotype where studied. The results show a high prevalence of bilateral pain among sickle cell patients at all sites. Age gender and genotype were associated with higher prevalence in bilateral pain in some, but not all sites. The percentage of sites that have bilateral pain is also associated with the number of sites that have pain...|$|E
40|$|Bilateralists {{hold that}} our {{inferential}} practices {{can be explained}} in terms of conditions on assertion and rejection.

On the contrary, according to the bilateralist, an explanation of the role of propositional neg-ation will appeal to a more fundamental notion of rejection.

Unsurprisingly, aid allocation net of the <b>bilateralism</b> effect is highly correlated with multilateral aid pattern. Perhaps more surprisingly, the <b>bilateralism</b> effect is adverse to the Sub-Saharan African region, in spite of its strong post-colonial ties with European donors, because trade linkages play actually a greater role than political ties.

We find that when countries have asymmetric endowments or when governments value producer interests more than tari¤ revenue and consumer surplus, there exist circumstances where global free trade is a stable equilibrium only if countries are free to pursue bilateral trade agreements. By contrast, under symmetry, both <b>bilateralism</b> and multilateralism yield global free trade. ...|$|E

40|$|Until 2006, {{trade policy}} of the European Union (EU) had mainly been focused on {{multilateralism}} embraced by the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). Meanwhile, the EU maintained an effective suspension on the opening of bilateral or regional negotiations where their increasing number was considered a ‘spaghetti bowl’ that creates problems for the international trading system. However, the suspension of the DDA negotiations in July 2006 forced the EU to reveal a new trade policy with the motto of “rejection of protectionism at home, accompanied by activism in creating open markets and fair conditions for trade abroad” which focuses on the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade of goods and services. Consequently, the EU gave pace to signing FTAs with its significant trade partners. This new trade strategy based on increasing FTAs and thus on <b>bilateralism,</b> which aims at the highest possible degree of trade, investment, and services liberalization, targets regulatory convergence and the abolishment of non-tariff barriers beside stronger provisions on intellectual property rights and competition. This paper discusses whether the new trade strategy of the EU leads to a distraction of the EU’s trade policy focus from multilateralism to <b>bilateralism</b> or it still remains committed to the WTO.

40|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{international}} economic events over the past 20 {{years has been the}} proliferation of bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). Bilateral agreements account for 80 percent of all agreements notified to the WTO, 94 percent of those signed or under negotiation, and currently 100 percent of those at the proposal stage. Some have argued that the growth of <b>bilateralism</b> is attributable to governments having pursued a policy of "competitive liberalization" - implementing bilateral FTAs to offset potential trade diversion caused by FTAs of "third-country-pairs" - but the growth of <b>bilateralism</b> can also be attributed potentially to "tariff complementarity" - the incentive for FTA members to reduce their external tariffs on nonmembers. Guided by new comparative statics from the numerical general equilibrium monopolistic competition model of FTA economic determinants in Baier and Bergstrand (2004), we augment their parsimonious logit (and probit) model of the economic determinants of bilateral FTAs to incorporate theory-motivated indexes to examine the in°uence of existing memberships on subsequent FTA formations. The model can predict correctly 90 percent of the bilateral FTAs within five years of their formation, while still predicting "No-FTA" correctly in 90 percent of the observations when no FTA exists, using a sample of over 350, 000 observations for pairings of 146 countries from 1960 - 2005. Even imposing the higher correct prediction rate of "No-FTA" of 97 percent in Baier and Bergstrand (2004), the parsimonious model still predicts correctly 75 percent of these rare FTA events; only 3 percent of the observations reflect a country-pair having an FTA in any year. The results suggest that while evidence supports that "competitive liberalization" is a force for <b>bilateralism</b> the efect on the likelihood a pair of countries forming an FTA of the pair's own FTAs with other countries (i. e., tariff complementarity) is likely {{just as important as the}} effect of third-country-pairs' FTAs (i. e. competitive liberalization) for the growth of <b>bilateralism.</b> Free Trade Agreements; International Trade; Endogenous Tariffs...|$|E
