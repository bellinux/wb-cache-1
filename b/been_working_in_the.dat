5|$|The 4th Cavalry Division, {{which had}} {{advanced}} to capture Beisan {{in the afternoon}} of 20 September, now controlled the area north along the River Jordan, while the 5th Cavalry Division garrisoned Afulah and the Nazareth area. Here motor ambulances, which had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Judean Hills, rejoined their division on 22 September. The Australian Mounted Division's 3rd Light Horse Brigade occupied Jenin. In consequence, all direct routes northwards were now controlled by the Desert Mounted Corps, forcing the retreating Ottoman Seventh Army and {{what remained of the}} Eighth Army to withdraw along minor roads and tracks heading eastwards across the Jordan River, towards the Hedjaz railway.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck, which No. 3 Commando led, on 4 April 1945. The next day, they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and {{under the cover of}} darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese. As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was an attack on a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found a number of these weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factory.|$|E

5|$|Horsfield {{made his}} second debut for Halifax in October 1996. On {{the last day}} of the 1996–97 season, needing to beat Stevenage Borough to avoid relegation from the Conference, Horsfield scored the goal that {{clinched}} a 4–2 victory. The following season, Halifax won the Conference title by a nine-point margin, thus regaining their Football League status. Horsfield's 30 goals in 40 league games, including hat-tricks against Yeovil Town, Telford United and Hereford United, made him that season's Conference top scorer. Together with team-mate Mark Bradshaw, Horsfield was selected for England's semi-professional representative team for a match against their Dutch counterparts, but injury prevented him from playing. In the Conference, Horsfield had still <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building trade while playing football part-time, but promotion to the Football League meant he had to give up his job to become a full-time footballer. Seven goals in his first ten games in the Third Division attracted a bid from Fulham, then in the Second Division and managed by Kevin Keegan.|$|E

25|$|Most {{students}} who pursue the Executive MBA have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business world for some time. Many are corporate executives {{who want to}} advance within their companies.

In 2009, incoming students began following an alternating Saturday schedule and two summer sessions. The change from an alternating Friday/Saturday schedule was made to accommodate students in a challenging economic environment. The first EMBA class graduated {{in the spring of}} 1980.|$|E
25|$|The current tomb keeper is Lim Geok Qi, who has <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cemetery {{and for the}} Japanese Association {{for over}} 50 years. He was born in 1938, and lived {{most of his life}} in the Cemetery. His father found {{difficulty}} to find work when he first arrived in Singapore from China but was soon recommended to a job as a tomb keeper at the Japanese Cemetery. Lim grew up in the cemetery assisting his father in the cremating bodies and arranging burials at the cemetery. When the young Lim came of age, he tried to seek other forms of employment but in 1960, his father fell sick, and requested him to take over his duties as tomb keeper. And so the young man in his 20s took over his father's duties to become the second generation tomb keeper. Like his father, Lim was paid a minimal salary for the job, but given free accommodation and transportation. As he was thrifty in nature, he was able to start his own family, and expanded his living quarters when his family size grew. In 1973, new burials was not allowed, so Lim's main duties was to look after and maintain the Japanese cemetery, as well as serving as a cemetery guide for visitors from Japan.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the non-teaching staff {{organised}} {{a strike}} against the management (headed by then trustee of Parshvanath Charitable Trust – Mr. Tekchand Shah) for non-payment of their salaries. Due to the strike, classes were not held for several days. At the same time, the political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's local branch also held a movement on college campus against then vice-principal and applied chemistry lecturer Mr. S. D. Shah for alleged harassment of some female {{students and staff}} members. The students also protested against {{certain aspects of the}} college that made student life difficult. For example: absence of basic facilities like ceiling fans in classrooms, canteen for the college, etc.; certain college rules like students not being allowed to wear T-shirts (and punishments like college IDs being confiscated, fines of Rs 100 or more being imposed on students not obeying these rules, or found loitering outside class during lecture/practical hours). The events led to the arrest (and later release on bail) of Mr. S. D. Shah, change of the PCT trustee from Mr. Teckchand Shah to Mr. Ashok Bhai Shah, and change of the college principal from Dr. Ram Reddy to Dr. Uttam D. Kolekar. In the transition process, the college was managed by the state government of Maharashtra. Mr. S. D. Shah has not <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> college since his arrest.|$|E
