25|$|Virginia {{election}} {{authorities were}} ordered {{by a federal}} judge to preserve late-arriving absentee ballots sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the McCain campaign. It alleged that the state sent absentee ballots late to service members. According to federal law, absentee ballots must <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. The charge against Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{items that}} were {{considered}} dangerous to handle, almost any type of merchandise was allowed to <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> by the Parcel Post service, even baby alligators and honey bees. (Such fragile items were later additionally charged by Special handling stamps.) Soon the new service was widely used by farmers and other rural Americans to purchase merchandise they previously could not obtain at their remote locations. This in turn aided the growth of mail order giants such as Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward.|$|E

25|$|Moscoe {{recommended}} several {{reforms to}} transit policy following his {{appointment to the}} TTC in 1991. He supported lower rates for Toronto's poorer residents, arguing that transit passes could <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> out with welfare cheques. This idea was opposed by then-TTC chair Mike Colle. Moscoe also advocated lower advertising rates for small businesses, noting that a national recession was resulting in many spaces being left unused. He opposed the TTC's elimination of environmentally friendly trolley services in January 1992, and led a successful initiative for their restoration later in the same year. Moscoe also opposed a 16% fare increase in 1992, arguing that the TTC could cut expenses through administration instead.|$|E
25|$|Odd-numbered freeways have tolls, {{which are}} {{automatically}} collected by ETC. The current rate for cars is (NT$1.2/km up to 200km) + (NT$0.9/excess km), km being kilometers traveled per day. The first 20 km per day {{is free and}} thus deducted from the distance. Freeways may be used directly, but users are advised to apply for an “eTag”, which is free and when equipped gives 10% discounts and allows you to store pre-paid money for tolls. The eTag can also be set to pay tolls automatically with credit card or a savings account. Users without the eTag pay tolls at convenience stores 3 days after usage and if not, bills will <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> to car owners.|$|E
25|$|After Elvis's {{return to}} America, the couple stayed in contact over the phone, though {{they would not}} {{see each other again}} until the summer of 1962, when Priscilla's parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks. Priscilla's parents allowed her to go only if Elvis would pay for a {{first-class}} round trip, arrange for her to be chaperoned at all times, and that she write home every day. Elvis agreed to all these demands and Priscilla flew to Los Angeles. Elvis told her {{that they were going to}} Las Vegas and, to throw her parents off the scent, he had Priscilla write a postcard for every day they would be gone so that they could <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> from Los Angeles by a member of his staff.|$|E

25|$|On 9 October {{a survey}} {{started in the}} {{prefecture}} Fukushima: ultrasonic examinations were done of the thyroid glands of all 360,000 children between 0 and 18 years of age. Follow-up tests will be done {{for the rest of}} their lives. This was done in response to concerned parents, alarmed by the evidence showing increased incidence of thyroid cancer among children after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The project was done by the Medical University of Fukushima. The results of the tests will <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> to the children within a month. At the end of 2014 the initial testing of all children should be completed, after this the children will undergo a thyroid checkup every 2 years until they turn 20, and once every 5 years above that age.|$|E
25|$|Homeless {{people often}} find it {{difficult}} to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including health care and clinic access. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot <b>be</b> <b>mailed.</b> Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a Catch-22. This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.|$|E
25|$|Excerpts from Naked Lunch {{were first}} {{published}} in the United States in 1958. The novel was initially rejected by City Lights Books, the publisher of Ginsberg's Howl; and Olympia Press publisher Maurice Girodias, who had published English-language novels in France that were controversial for their subjective views of sex and antisocial characters. But Allen Ginsberg managed to get excerpts published in Black Mountain Review and Chicago Review in 1958. Irving Rosenthal, student editor of Chicago Review, a quarterly journal partially subsidized by the university, promised to publish more excerpts from Naked Lunch, but he was fired from his position in 1958 after Chicago Daily News columnist Jack Mabley called the first excerpt obscene. Rosenthal went on to publish more in his newly created literary journal Big Table No. 1; however, the United States Postmaster General ruled that copies could not <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> to subscribers {{on the basis of}} obscenity laws. John Ciardi did get a copy and wrote a positive review of the work, prompting a telegram from Allen Ginsberg praising the review. This controversy made Naked Lunch interesting to Girodias again, and he published the novel in 1959.|$|E

25|$|BVG ride-passes {{are issued}} for {{specific}} periods of time, and most require validation with a stamping machine {{before they are}} first used. The validation shows the date and {{time of the first}} use, and where the ticket was validated (in code), and therefore when the ticket expires. For example, once validated, an all-day pass allows unlimited use from the time of purchase to 3:00 am the following day. Unlike most other metro systems, tickets in Berlin are not checked before entering tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn stations. They are however checked by the bus drivers upon entering. On the tram, S-Bahn and U-Bahn, a proof-of-payment system is used: there are random spot checks inside by plainclothes fare inspectors who have the right to demand to see each passenger's ticket. Passengers found without a ticket or an expired/invalid ticket are fined €60 per incident. The passenger may be required to pay on the spot, and is required on the spot to give a valid address to which the relevant fine notice can <b>be</b> <b>mailed</b> (it {{does not have to be}} in Germany). On the third incident, the BVG calls the offender to court, as there is now a history of 'riding without paying'.|$|E
