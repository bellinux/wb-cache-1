5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning he does not have leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E

Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death</b> in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army.

On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train.

25|$|The 1841 census {{showed a}} {{population}} of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage.

25|$|In 2000, Denez Prigent {{released}} his third album, Irvi.

25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins. However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of afterlife or reincarnation for the soul, or resurrection of the body at a later date.|$|E

30|$|Freud {{suggests}} that the desire for survival and a need for protection is something inherent in being human.

One could use Yoga’s concept of the Guru as a metaphor for Freud’s <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>life</b> drives respectively: the dark and the light (the light is the destroyer of darkness) (Feuerstein, [1997], p. 112).

25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they {{can mean the difference}} <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death,</b> and consequently where the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.|$|E
25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in {{the right amount of}} powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant the difference <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E

The model is implemented in discrete modeling formalism and allows to predict probabilities of having a particular cellular phenotype in response to engagement of cell death receptors. Using an original parameter sensitivity analysis developed for discrete dynamic systems, we determine the critical parameters affecting cellular fate decision variables that appear to be critical in the cellular fate decision and discuss how they are exploited by existing cancer therapies...|$|R
25|$|Today, {{the charge}} of {{vandalism}} in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent bolts and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in the difference <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure {{for long periods of}} time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations to where fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements lead to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act. Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices. This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore don't require as much protection. Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form. Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like Yosemite National Park, many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{total of}} 1, 514 fossil bones were studied from the Vaskapu II rock shelter (Bükk Mountains, North Hungary). The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate those processes of bone modification that were important in the dispersal, destruction and preservation of bone in the deposit. Size-selective taphonomic processes were detected in the accumulation of vertebrate remains. The fossils were transported by water through a 15 m high fissure system above the locality during repeated precipitation and thawing. Size-sorting of the bones occurred within the fissures. During this process the fossils were damaged and fragmented and the remains were eventually emplaced into the Vaskapu II rock shelter. The size-sorting is statistically established by a method based on the chisquare test. This method clearly describes the differences <b>between</b> the <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death</b> assemblages...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnder income-differentiated mortality, poverty {{measures}} reflect {{not only}} the "true" poverty, but, also, the interferences or noise caused by the survival process at work. Such interferences lead to the Mortality Paradox: the worse the survival conditions of the poor are, the lower the measured poverty is. We examine several solutions to avoid that paradox. We identify conditions under which the extension, {{by means of a}} fictitious income, of lifetime income profiles of the prematurely dead neutralizes the noise due to differential mortality. Then, to account not only for the "missing" poor, but, also, for the "hidden" poverty (premature death), we use, as a fictitious income, the welfare-neutral income, making indifferent <b>between</b> <b>life</b> continuation <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> The robustness of poverty measures to the extension technique is illustrated with regional Belgian data...|$|R
