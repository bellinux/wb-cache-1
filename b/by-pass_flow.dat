Another important difference between pasted and US welded bowls is the bottom protrusion. - Through a fluid dynamical study and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis through Fluent® program, 16 modified prototypes have been designed and built up based on the standard US welded bowls. - Best of all, the ultrasounds welded bowl with dome shaped collector (changing R) gives high improvements at every wash flow rates (87 % at 750 ml/min, 75 % at 800 ml/min [...] ) and delays the by-pass at 800 ml/min...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a numerical simulation using CFX 4. 4 of the Energy Amplifier Experimental Facility (X-ADS) downcomer channel. The simulation {{is focused on}} the Steady-State Analysis. The Intermediate Heat exchangers (IHX) of the X-ADS reference configuration are immersed in the lead-bismuth eutectic of the downcomer. Due to the absence of a physical separation between the primary coolant hot and cold collectors, two different flow paths are available in the downcomer region: inside the IHX and outside it (IHX <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow).</b> The amount of IHX <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> is determined by the balance between the driving force due to buoyancy (originated by the weight difference between the cooled fluid inside the IHX and the hot outside downcomer fluid) and the IHX pressure losses. At the IHX exit the two flow paths are mixed before the core inlet. This fact provides a potential for a downcomer thermal stratification, which is influenced by the actual value of coolant flow rate outside the IHX. The amount and extension of the thermal stratification phenomena is the object of this study. The simulation allowed studying the position and intensity of the thermal stratification phenomena. Several runs have been performed. However, to limit the extension of the paper, we deal with the results of only one of the calculations performed, which resulted in the worst condition {{from the point of view}} of thermal loads on the structure. Other results obtained will be shortly recalled when needed. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

40|$|A {{generalized}} one-dimensional {{computer code}} for analyzing the flow and heat transfer in the turbomachinery cooling passages was developed. This code {{is capable of}} handling rotating cooling passages with turbulators, 180 degree turns, pin fins, finned passages, <b>by-pass</b> <b>flows,</b> tip cap impingement flows, and flow branching. The code {{is an extension of}} a one-dimensional code developed by P. Meitner. In the subject code, correlations for both heat transfer coefficient and pressure loss computations were developed to model each of the above mentioned type of coolant passages. The code has the capability of independently computing the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient on each side of a rectangular passage. Either the mass flow at the inlet to the channel or the exit plane pressure can be specified. For a specified inlet total temperature, inlet total pressure, and exit static pressure, the code computers the flow rates through the main branch and the subbranches, flow through tip cap for impingement cooling, in addition to computing the coolant pressure, temperature, and heat transfer coefficient distribution in each coolant flow branch. Predictions from the subject code for both nonrotating and rotating passages agree well with experimental data.

Accordingly a well-established Large Eddy Simulation (LES) technique has first been validated against experimental data for a low-speed turbulent round jet and then used to perform a parametric series of simulations, numerical experiments, for a coaxial jet representative of a modern, large by-pass ratio jet engine exhaust under a variety of conditions with passive scalar introduced into either the core or bypass flow. Effects of free-stream velocity, swirl, and boundary proximity have all been considered and conclusions drawn. The comparisons between LES data and experiment measurements were in good agreement for low-velocity round jet. For a higher-velocity coaxial jet, initial instabilities on the shear boundary between the core and <b>by-pass</b> <b>flows</b> were seen to quickly develop into large scale coherent (vortex) motions which grew in scale and lost energy to a broader range of motions at downstream. The numerical databases generated for this series of coaxial jet configurations provide a valuable source of information for more accurately initialising lower order modelling of subsequent jet efflux development and vortex interaction...|$|R

Troubleshooting: Whole entire factors were investigated from process condition change, piping layout, separating drum size and valve design. Very viscous and sticky heavy hydrocarbon called `Green Oil? was found at the valves & cylinder could cause valve late closing and consequential excessive impact stress during valve closing. Increased colder spill-back <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> could cool down gas after separator drum made easy formation of heavy hydrocarbon condensate. Moreover liquid condensate could exist as slug at low point of suction manifold piping directly connected to compressor suction. Valve dynamics and pulsation after revamp was acceptable but plate type valve seemed to be not good choice under service including sticky liquid showing bouncing at edge of plate during late closing. Solution implementation and Result: Low point drain of compressor suction manifold piping was added for liquid removal and spill-back flow was reduced by running compressors at partial load to reduce condensation by colder <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow.</b> Valve type was changed to poppet type which is known as relatively better for very viscous and sticky liquid service. Detail study and investigation on suction separator showed nothing bad. After all improvement implementation valve life increased to over 1 year.

MR propagator experiments, which measure the conditional probability density for displacement, were performed to characterise molecular displacements in these systems. Simulations were performed using the experimental velocity and diffusion maps to aid interpretation of experimentally measured propagators and enable characterisation of the macro-mixing and transport properties within TVF and VFR systems.

The objectives were to evaluate if a simple kinematic wave model could be used {{to characterize}} drainage under conditions of <b>by-passing</b> <b>flow</b> and to investigate the variability of runoff generation under wet and dry antecedent conditions in this well structured soil. Cores were taken to depths of 0. 4 and 0. 7 m, with six cores obtained from each depth. Results show that variations in soil structure between cores have a greater influence on the hydrologic response than variations in antecedent water content. It may be inferred that, in this soil, good structural continuity substantially enhances soil drainage and, in consequence, decreases surface runoff. During wetting, kinematic celerities ranged from 337 to 3200 mm h- 1 in the short cores and from 357 to 1400 mm h- 1 in the long cores. The corresponding estimated ranges of mobile or 'macropore' fractions were from 0. 015 to 0. 154 m 3 m- 3 in the short cores and 0. 033 to 0. 132 m 3 m- 3 in the long cores.

A 'code-friendly' modification has been proposed which enhances the numerical stability, in particular, for explicit and uncoupled flow solvers. As a result of introducing Reynolds-number dependence into a coefficient of the s-equation, the skin-friction distribution for the <b>by-pass</b> transitional <b>flow</b> over a flat plate is better predicted.

40|$|Groundwater {{flow and}} {{contaminant}} transport modelling in karst systems remains a challenge {{because of the}} complexity of the geology made of caves, voids, conduits of various sizes and forms and interacting matrix. Such heterogeneous structures cause complex hydraulic conditions for groundwater flow and transport processes. Despite the progresses in field investigation techniques and experiments, detailed knowledge and characterization of the karst system geometry and connectivity remains inaccessible and pragmatic modelling approaches have to be used. Groundwater models of different complexities have been developed for karst systems, ranging from transfer functions and linear reservoir models to spatially distributed models. Here, a new flexible modelling approach, the Hybrid Finite-Element Mixing-Cell method (HFEMC), has been developed that allows combining in a single model, and in a fully interacting way, different mathematical approaches of various complexities for groundwater modelling in complex environments. This includes linear reservoirs, distributed reservoirs, groundwater flow in variably saturated equivalent porous media, with possibilities to consider <b>by-pass</b> <b>flows</b> along preferential flow paths, internal boundary conditions between the karstic features and the surrounding rock mass matrix background and drainage by surface waters. This method has been implemented in the groundwater flow and solute transport numerical code SUFT 3 D. The objective of this communication is to present the modelling concepts and to discuss the potentials and advantages of the HFEMC method for modelling groundwater flow in karst systems over existing more classical modelling approaches. The discussion is supported by illustrative “synthetic” examples representative of karst systems and a real modelling application to the case of groundwater rebound and water inrush in a closed underground coal mine which presents a very similar geometrical and hydrological context to a karst, with cavities, drains and interacting rock mass.

40|$|Agrochemical {{contamination}} in groundwater {{is an increasing}} problem that poses a significant long term threat to water quality and is of concern for legislators, water utilities and consumers alike. In the dual porosity aquifers common in the UK, movement of pesticides and their metabolites through the unsaturated zone to groundwater is {{generally considered to be}} through one of two pathways; a rapid <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> and a slower ‘piston-flow’ route via the rock matrix. However, the dissolved form or ‘colloidal species’ in which pesticides move within the water body is poorly understood. Following heavy rainfall, very high peaks in pesticide concentration are often observed in shallow UK aquifers. These concentrations might be well explained by colloidal transport of pesticides. We have sampled a Chalk groundwater beneath a deep (30 m) unsaturated zone known to be contaminated with the pesticide diuron. Using a tangential flow filtration technique we have produced colloidal fractions from 0. 45 µm to 1 kDa. In addition, we have applied agricultural grade diuron to a typical chalk soil and created a soil water suspension which was also subsequently fractionated using the same filtration system. The deep groundwater sample showed no evidence of association between colloidal material and pesticide concentration. In comparison, despite some evidence of particle trapping or sorption to the filters, the soil water clearly showed an association between the < 0. 45 µm and < 0. 1 µm colloidal fractions which displayed higher pesticide concentrations. Degradation products were also observed and found to behave in a similar manner to the parent compound. Although colloids can be generated in the Chalk soil zone, it appears transport to depth in a colloidal-bound form does not occur. Comparison with other field and monitoring studies suggests that rapid <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> is less likely to occur beneath 5 m. Therefore, shallow groundwaters are most at risk from rapid transport of high concentrations of pesticide-colloidal complexes. The presence of a deep unsaturated zone will mean that most of the colloidal-complexes will be filtered by the narrow chalk pores and the majority of pesticide transport will occur in a ‘dissolved’ form through the more gradual ‘piston-flow’ route. ...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{performance}} simulation and {{estimation of}} gas turbine engines is very useful for gas turbine manufacturers and users alike {{and such a}} simulation normally starts from its design-point. When some of the engine component parameters for an existing engine are not available, they must be estimated in order that the performance analysis can be started. Therefore, the simulated design-point performance of an engine may be slightly different from its actual performance. In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based non-linear gas turbine design-point performance adaptation approach has been presented to best estimate the unknown component parameters and match available design-point engine performance. In the approach, the component parameters may be compressor pressure ratios and efficiencies, turbine entry temperature, turbine efficiencies, engine mass flow rate, cooling <b>flows,</b> <b>by-pass</b> ratio, etc. The engine performance parameters may be thrust and SFC for aero engines, shaft power and thermal efficiency for industrial engines, gas path pressures and temperatures, etc. To select the most appropriate to-be-adapted component parameters, a sensitivity analysis is {{used to analyze the}} sensitivity of all potential component parameters against the engine performance parameters. The adaptation approach has been applied to an industrial gas turbine engine to test the effectiveness of the approach. The approach has also been compared with a non-linear Influence Coefficient Matrix (ICM) based adaptation method and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two adaptation methods have been compared with each other. The application shows that the sensitivity analysis is very useful in the selection of the to-be-adapted component parameters and the GA-based adaptation approach is able to produce good quality engine models at design-point. Compared with the non-linear ICM-based method, the GA-based performance adaptation method is more robust but slower in computation and relatively less accurate.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{coupling}} between high temperature steam electrolysis and carbon dioxide methanation (hydrogenation) to produce a synthetic gas directly injectable in the natural gas distribution grid. This system concept {{is one of the}} existing possibilities related to a pathway named Power-to-gas. According to this strategy, low-priced surplus electric energy coming from renewable energy sources (RES) or nuclear plants can be converted into chemical energy of a fuel in order to store it for a longer time. Another purpose is to compensate the unbalances of the electric grid due to the daily and seasonally fluctuations of electricity production from RES (especially wind and solar). The integration between solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) technology and methanation seems to be promising due to the possible thermal integration between exothermal hydrogenation and thermal energy required within the water splitting unit. Hydrogen generated through steam electrolysis can react with carbon dioxide producing methane and water (4 H 2 + CO 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O). A preliminary screening of nickel-based catalysts has been carried out at atmospheric pressure in order to identify the catalyst(s) with higher activity. During this experimental activity seven samples have been tested: a standard NiO on γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst (Ni/A); three Ni-based samples (Ni/C 5, Ni/C 10 and Ni/C 15) with a composite support containing a mixture of γ-Al 2 O 3 and other promoters (CeO 2, ZrO 2 and TiO 2); two nickel-aluminum hydrotalcites (Ni-Al 8. 7 and Ni-Al 12, prepared at a pH of 8. 7 and 12, respectively) and a commercial NiO/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst (CRG-F). Hydrotalcites and commercial catalyst present better performance than oxides-supported nickel samples and are more active especially at low temperature (below 300 °C). The different activity far from equilibrium can be put in relation with some physic and chemical properties. Hydrotalcites and commercial catalyst presented higher nickel content than the other samples. Moreover, also the metal dispersion seems {{to play a role in}} order to enhance the catalytic performance. Concerning oxide-supported Ni-based catalysts, the addition of promoters (CeO 2, TiO 2 and ZrO 2) to γ-Al 2 O 3 within the support showed a beneficial effect on the activity due to the increased catalyst reducibility. A new test rig has been designed and set up in order to perform an experimental activity at high pressure (up to 30 bar). Samples at both small (0. 25 - 0. 5 mm) and pellet (3 mm) size have been tested at different pressure, temperature and inlet gas composition. As a preliminary activity, a commercial catalyst at pellet size was tested at 300 °C and different residence times with two different inlet mixtures (in order to reproduce a series of two reactors with an inter-condensation of the produced water). This experimental activity enabled the production of synthetic gas with hydrogen content lower than 5 %, which is the maximum acceptable H 2 amount considered in this work for the direct injection of SNG into the natural gas distribution grid. Thus, the feasibility of the process in terms of overall conversion into methane was verified. Then, a test campaign has been carried out by varying several operating parameters in order to describe the methanation kinetics for a commercial catalyst (NiO/γ-Al 2 O 3) at small particles size (250 - 500 μm). Total and reactants partial pressures and temperature were varied during the experimental activity. The obtained experimental points have been used into an ideal PFR model for the kinetic parameters estimation. Both power law and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LHHW) rate equations were considered. Concerning LHHW-type equations, the one leading to the best fitting of experimental data is based on the dissociative chemisorption of both hydrogen and carbon dioxide as reaction mechanism. The obtained kinetics was used as a basis for a 1 D plug flow reactor model applied to a series of two cooled multi-tube fixed bed reactors for methane synthesis: the main goal is to estimate temperature and conversion profiles along the axial coordinate. Evaporating water at 240 °C (i. e. at ≈ 33 bar) has been considered as a coolant: this strategy ensures a high heat transfer coefficient on the shell side. Both micro and macro kinetics equations are solved. Thus, transport phenomena between gas and solid catalyst have been taken into account. In addition, the evaluation of the effectiveness factor for isothermal particles enabled the estimation of the mass transfer inside the porous catalyst. In order to moderate the temperature increase (i. e. to prevent the hot spot risk) especially within the first reactor, part of the reacting CO 2 is conveyed directly to the second reactor by-passing the first one. A carbon dioxide split ratio of 0. 7 (meaning that the 30 % of the total CO 2 <b>flow</b> <b>by-passes</b> the first reactor) ensures that the maximum temperature reached within the solid catalyst is lower than 600 °C (this value has been fixed at the maximum acceptable temperature). The length of the second reactor was adjusted in order to ensure a methane fraction in the outlet gas equal to 95 % (on dry basis), enabling the production of a synthetic gas with a H 2 content lower than 5 % (i. e. injectable in the NG pipeline). Inlet pressure has been set equal to 15 bar. The obtained results from the 1 D model have been used for the design of the methanation unit consisting in a series of two cooled reactors with steam inter-condensation. Then, the process modeling of a plant coupling high temperature electrolysis and methanation is presented: the main goal of this analysis is the calculation of an overall plant efficiency (in terms of electricity-to-SNG chemical energy). The plant size has been set considering a 10 MWel SOEC-based electrolysis unit. It has been assumed that the heat produced from the exothermal methanation is entirely used for the water evaporation; the as generated steam is the key reactant of the electrolysis unit. Through the pinch analysis, a further thermal integration between hot and cold streams was performed. The external heat requirement obtained through the minimization of thermal needing was equal to 121 kW (≈ 1 % of the electrolyser duty). However, such integration requires a too high number of heat exchangers, resulting in increasing costs and higher system complexity. Thus, the heat exchangers network has been re-designed in order to reduce the number of components. Hot and cold streams of electrolysis section have been coupled; a similar procedure has been applied to the methanation unit. Thus, the only integration between the two sections is represented by the reaction heat used for the water evaporation. The reduced complexity results in a higher external heat requirement (272 kW) : this new value has been considered acceptable (≈ 3 % of the electrolysis power). Efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the SNG chemical power and the overall electric input (including electrolysis power, compression duties and external heating). The SOEC-based power-to-gas system presented an HHV-based efficiency equal to ≈ 86 % (≈ 77 % on LHV basis) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Preferential flow dominates water {{movement}} and solute transport in boreal forest hillslopes. However, {{only a few}} model applications to date have accounted for preferential flow at forest sites. Here we present a parallel and coupled simulation of flow and transport processes in the preferential flow domain and soil matrix of a forested hillslope section in Kangaslampi, Finland, using a new, three-dimensional, physically based dual-permeability model. Our aim is to simulate lateral subsurface stormflow and solute transport at the slope during a chloride tracer experiment, and to investigate the role of preferential flow in the tracer transport. The model was able to mimic the observed tracer transport during tracer irrigation, but overestimated the dilution velocity of the tracer plume in the highly conductive soil horizons near the soil surface after changing the irrigation to tracer-free water. According to the model, 140 times more chloride was transported downslope in the preferential flow domain than in the soil matrix during the tracer irriga-tion. The simulations showed, together with reference simulations with a traditional one pore domain model, that a two pore domain approach was required to simulate the observed flow and transport event. The event was characterized by the transmissivity feedback phenomenon and controlled by preferential flow mechanisms, in particular by lateral <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow.</b> According to our results, accounting for the slow-flow and fast-flow domains of soil, {{as well as the}} water and solute exchange between the domains, is essen-tial for a successful simulation of flow and solute transport in preferential flow dominated hillslopes. 1...|$|E

Design solutions for intermediate cases with integrated outlet guide vanes, {{which has the}} job to both carry load and direct the by pass air, are considered competitive for the future. Critical factors when designing integrated outlet guide vanes are weight, cost, structural stiffness, sound damping and operating life. Historically, the outlet guide vane (OGV) configuration has been solid vanes manufactured in materials like aluminium and titanium. A solid vane design will make the target weight for the outlet guide vanes to be exceeded, especially when engines are getting larger in diameter due to a desire to increase the <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow.</b> One way of reducing {{the weight of the}} OGV design is to make them hollow. The question is if a hollow vane will fulfil the mechanical requirements that an OGV configuration must withstand. Several concepts of OGV configurations have been developed and analyzed. Solid vane concepts have also been analyzed for reference purposes. The different concepts have also been evaluated with respect to material selection. Both the use of aluminium and titanium has been considered, since these are the most commonly used materials in outlet guide vanes. The chosen concept is made in titanium with a sheet thickness of 2 mm and has solid leading and trailing edge. The vane also has a polymer-foam core to increase the stiffness even further. By making the vanes hollow in titanium, the weight can be decreased with 10 % compared to making them solid in aluminium. The analysis showed that the configuration with a foam core has better strength properties and is more resistance to buckling than the configuration without a foam core.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} problems of using optical fiber sensors in real-world environments is surface fouling, that is the cumulative build-up of undesirable material on the working surface of the sensor. One of the scopes of the Brite-EuRam Project 'BOSS' was the development of non-toxic, optically-transparent and biologically-inert materials, suitable to inhibiting or reducing bio-fouling, {{to be used as}} coatings for optical and optical fiber sensors. The present paper presents the results of tests of anti-biofouling coated fiber optic probes for reflectance spectroscopy in blood-simulating 'foul' media, that are Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), Fibrinogen and Platelet Enriched plasma (PEP). The anti-biofouling coating, a proprietary invention of Biocompatibles Ltd., was a cross-linkable polymer with silane functionality to improve adhesion to silica-containing substrates. Two identical fiber optic probes for reflectance spectroscopy were considered, one of which was coated by means of PC- 1036 layer. Both probes were optically excited and the signals were continuously detected while immersing the probes in a <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> cell used as dynamic test environment. After 24 -hour testing, a visual check of both probes was carried out by means of optical microscopy. All tests in BSA, Fibrinogen and PEP showed that PC- 1036 coating was suitable to avoid build-up of biological material. In fact optical signal variations of non-coated probes showed fluctuations in the 6 - 20 % range, while coated probes exhibited a nearly-stable optical signal. These results were confirmed also by microscopic check, which showed adhesions of biological material on non-coated probes. The figure below shows the end surfaces of two optical fiber couples after 24 -hour testing in BSA. Fibers at the left were anti-biofouling coated and appeared perfectly clean: only the shadow of the coating was visible. Fibers at the right were un-coated and showed a relevant adhesion of biological material. Similar images were obtained by testings in Fibrinogen and PEP.

40|$|Minimal {{research}} has been conducted to examine dissolution and remediation of NAPL located in lower-permeability (K) media. The purpose of this research was to investigate dissolution of non-uniformly distributed residual NAPL located in lower-K media and how mass transfer was affected. Additionally, in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) effectiveness using KMnO₄ in the laboratory and field was examined. A series of column and flow cell experiments were conducted with trichloroethene (TCE). For uniformly distributed residual NAPL control experiments, reduced interfacial pool area and resonance time were likely the most important mass transfer limitation. For non-uniformly distributed residual NAPL, <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> attributed to reduced effective permeability was initially the most important factor affecting nonideal mass transfer. Dissolution times increased with physical heterogeneity due to bypass flow. Mass transfer was more non-ideal for non-uniformly distributed NAPL. Nonideal mass transfer was most pronounced for non-uniformly distributed NAPL in lower-K zones. NAPL location influences dissolution behavior and ultimately remediation. Mass flux reduction versus mass reduction comparisons for the experiments exhibited how mass transfer trends vary between systems. The effectiveness of KMnO₄ ISCO of residual TCE located in lower-K media was examined. KMnO₄ solution was flushed through a flow cell followed by water flushing to evaluate long-term mass flux behavior, which was then compared to a water-flush control. For water flushing following KMnO₄ flushing, mass flux was similar to the control experiment. However, since contaminant mass was reduced, the number of pore volumes required for complete TCE removal via water flushing was estimated to be reduced by half. 1, 1 -Dichloroethene (DCE) is thought to be located in lower permeability strata adjacent to the water table at the Samsonite Building Area. Eight injection wells were emplaced in the source zone area, with well screens spanning the vadose and saturated zones, and injected with ~ 250 kg of 1. 7 % KMnO₄ solution. Bench-scale studies using core material determined that DCE was readily degraded by KMnO₄, even at lower reagent concentrations (< 1 mM). The natural oxidant demand was determined to be 1. 0 x 10 ⁻⁵ g of KMnO₄/g of sediment. Aqueous DCE levels dropped below detection after KMnO₄ solution was present...|$|E
40|$|A full {{understanding}} of the processes controlling the movement of pesticides within the soil 1 water regime {{is critical to the}} successful reduction of losses of these substances to surface waters. Until recent years the importance of absorbed phase transport of pesticides has largely been ignored with respect to drainflow and the appearance of strongly absorbed hydrophobic compounds in riverine sediments has hitherto been largely attributed to surface runoff 1 erosion. Field studies were setup for the 1994 / 5 winter season to investigate the hydrology and chemistry associated with drainflow from the lighter clay soils of Boarded Barns Farm, with two calcareous (Hanslope and Stretham) and two non-calcareous (Melford and Ludford) soils being chosen for study. Instrumented study plot areas were established in each field, with drainflow measurement and water sampling being automated. Laboratory based investigations (including rainfall simulation and desorption) were carried out to support, extend and clarify the field data, in particular the processes involved in the transport of isoproturon and sediment. A striking feature seen in the field studies was the appearance of large amounts of suspended sediment in drainflow from the Melford soil, in contrast to the clear drainflow from the calcareous soils. The sediments in drain flow were identified as being of surface origin, generated by rainfall impact and transported via preferential <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow.</b> Laboratory investigations have indicated that the chemical nature of the topsoil is a dominant factor controlling the transport of sediments and clay flocculation due to the presence of calcium carbonate is proposed as a mechanism for preventing sediment transport in the calcareous soils. Where sediment was found in drainflow, it was shown to be responsible for the transport and losses in the absorbed phase of not only diflufenican, a strongly absorbed pesticide, but also isoproturon, a weakly absorbed pesticide. The laboratory studies indicate that isoproturon is transported predominantly absorbed to sediment and later desorbs 1 diffuses slowly into the aqueous phase of the receiving waters. The results of the field experiments were confirmed by the rainfall simulation studies on 20 cm deep (20 cm diameter) topsoil cores taken from the field, which showed sediment transport only in the non-calcareous soil. The extent of this phenomena of sediment transport in the UK is not well defined, due to the historical lack of research, however soils known to show the effect have a land coverage of 6 % of England and Wales. The present study highlights an additional mechanism by which pesticide losses to surface waters may occur, but the relative importance will depend heavily on the hydrological, structural and chemical nature of the soil system...|$|E
40|$|The Valhall field, {{operated}} by BP Norge, is a mature {{field in the}} North Sea requiring more attention than before {{to be able to}} maintain a viable production rate. Keeping the rate sufficient is ultimately done, in simple terms, with two measures; drilling more wells and increasing the life time of the wells. However, doing these two things in the oil rich but weak chalk has proven to be more and more difficult over the years, and as with other maturing fields, Valhall is in need of new and more complicated methods of drilling and completing wells. Low fracture gradient and risk of breakthrough of injection water in producing wells are two of the main challenges met at Valhall today. One method that allows wells to be drilled in such conditions is by using open hole zonal isolation. Pumping cement is the normal method of providing zonal isolation between the casing or liner and the annulus. This paper focuses on the alternative methods to avoid cement by using open hole packers to seal between the reservoir liner and the formation. The packers available that are summarized have many different ways of providing zonal isolation, including inflating a rubber bladder with cement or mud, mechanical movement from applied or downhole pressure, rubber that swells in contact with a specific fluid or metal elements that are expanded by pressure. All have benefits and limitations that make them applicable in some situations and unsuited in others. Good open hole zonal isolation is vital for the ability to shut off unwanted water production and if achieved will improve well performance and hydrocarbon recovery at Valhall. Selecting the appropriate packers is not a straight forward task and requires considerations of the many variables of different wells. Stimulation method and formation weakness are amongst the parameters that will be most important when considering open hole packers. During stimulation, cooling and heating could result in movement of the reservoir liner and risk of leak-past and <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> in the weak Valhall chalk, thus compromising zonal isolation. Several open hole packers on the market are applicable for Valhall, but swell packers are seen as the preferred solution due to self-healing capabilities, possibility for long elements and easy deployment. These properties are beneficial in meeting the challenges at Valhall. Further work is recommended for better understanding of the behavior of open hole packers downhole. This could include a geomechanical study of open hole completions in the Valhall chalk to find out if long swell packers will perform better than shorter packers and a review of long-term reliability of swell packers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{salinity}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} abiotic stresses that decreases agricultural crop production through imposition of both ionic and osmotic stresses. The accumulation of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ in the cytosol to toxic levels inhibits metabolism. Unlike Na⁺, less is known about Cl⁻ uptake and transport in plants. Grapevine is moderately sensitive to salinity and accumulation of toxic levels of Cl⁻ in leaves is the major reason for salt-induced symptoms. In this study Cl⁻ uptake and transport mechanism(s) were investigated in two grapevine (Vitis sp.) rootstock hybrids differing in salt tolerance: 1103 Paulsen (salt tolerant) and K 51 - 40 (salt sensitive). Increased external salinity caused high Cl⁻ accumulation in shoots of the salt sensitive K 51 - 40 in comparison to Paulsen. Measurement of ¹ ⁵ NO₃⁻ net fluxes under high salinity showed that by increasing external Cl⁻ concentrations K 51 - 40 roots showed reduced NO₃⁻ accumulation. This was associated with increased accumulation of Cl⁻. In comparison to Paulsen, K 51 - 40 showed reduced NO₃⁻ / Cl⁻ root selectivity with increased salinity, but Paulsen had lower selectivity over the whole salinity range (0 - 45 mM). In order to examine if root hydraulic and permeability characterisations accounted for differences between varieties, the root pressure probe was used on excised roots. This showed that the osmotic Lpr was significantly smaller than hydrostatic Lpr, but no obvious difference was observed between the rootstocks. The reflection coefficient (σ) values (0. 48 - 0. 59) were the same for both rootstocks, and root anatomical studies showed no obvious difference in apoplastic barriers of the main and lateral roots. Comparing the uptake of Cl⁻ with an apoplastic tracer, PTS (3 -hydroxy- 5, 8, 10 -pyrentrisulphonic acid), showed that there was no correlation between Cl⁻ and PTS transport. These results indicated that <b>by-pass</b> <b>flow</b> of salts to the xylem is the same for both rootstocks (10. 01 ± 3. 03 % and 12. 1 ± 1. 21 %) and hence pointed to differences in membrane transport to explain difference in Cl⁻ transport to the shoot. ³ ⁶Cl⁻ fluxes across plasma membrane and tonoplast of K 51 - 40 and Paulsen roots showed that ³ ⁶Cl⁻ influx in root segments of Paulsen was greater than K 51 - 40 over the first 10 minutes. Unidirectional influx within 10 min loading time showed increases with increases in the external concentrations in both rootstocks but Paulsen had higher influx rate when compared to K 51 - 40. This appeared to be due to a greater Vmax. There was no significant difference in Km. It was shown that ³ ⁶Cl⁻ accumulation and transport rate to the shoot of K 51 - 40 was higher than that of Paulsen. Compartmental analysis of ³ ⁶Cl⁻ efflux from intact roots confirmed that the difference in influx observed between the rootstocks was consistent with the results obtained for excised roots, although the values were not exactly the same. It was also shown that the main root of Paulsen had greater contribution to ³ ⁶Cl⁻ uptake than lateral roots. ³ ⁶Cl⁻ fluxes by lateral roots were not significantly different between the rootstocks. Cl⁻ and Na⁺ distribution patterns in different root cell types were determined using the X-ray microanalysis technique. It was shown that Cl⁻ content in the hypodermis and cortical cells was higher than the other cell types in both rootstocks, but overall Cl⁻ content in the root of Paulsen was higher than K 51 - 40. The pericycle of the main root of Paulsen accumulated more Cl⁻ than K 51 - 40. It was concluded that Cl⁻ loading to the xylem was different in the rootstocks and Paulsen tended to prevent the xylem Cl⁻ loading process. Lateral roots also displayed opposite behaviour consistent with flux analysis. Membrane potential difference (PD) of the cortical cells showed a rapid and transient depolarization by adding 30 mM NaCl in both rootstocks that was followed by a gradual hyperpolarization. Depolarizations caused by 30 mM Choline-Cl, Na-MES and NaCl measured by the root surface potential method showed that Choline-Cl in K 51 - 40 and Na-MES in Paulsen caused greater depolarization than that of Na-MES in K 51 - 40 and Choline-Cl in Paulsen respectively. Assuming that PD measured in this method was the trans-root potential (TRP), it was concluded that the higher depolarization by Choline-Cl in K 51 - 40 can be due to higher Cl⁻ efflux rate to the xylem. Two different mechanisms were also detected for Cl⁻ transport: HATS which was observed in the range of 0. 5 - 5 mM and a LATS in the range of 10 - 30 mM of the external NaCl concentration. This was consistent with the concentration dependence of Cl⁻ influx. In conclusion, evidence obtained from different experiments of this study indicated that in the grapevine rootstocks (Paulsen and K 51 - 40) Cl⁻ was mostly transported through the symplastic pathway. From ECl values determined for the rootstocks by the Nernst equation, a proton-driven transport system was responsible for Cl⁻ transport in both the HATS and LATS range of external NaCl concentrations. The rate of Cl⁻ transport from the root to shoot (xylem loading) was the major difference in Cl⁻ transport between the rootstocks in terms of salinity tolerance. Thesis (Ph. D.)
