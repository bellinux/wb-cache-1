25|$|Bit {{numbering}} is {{a concept}} similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. Bit endianness or bit-level endianness refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in RS-232, Ethernet, and USB. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. Teletext, I²C, SMBus, PMBus, and SONET and SDH). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception {{is caused by the}} feature of some cyclic redundancy checks to detect all burst errors up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the <b>byte</b> order on <b>serial</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{universal}} asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) takes bytes of {{data and}} transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion. At the destination, a second UART re-assembles the bits into complete bytes. Each UART contains a shift register, which is the fundamental method of conversion between serial and parallel forms. <b>Serial</b> <b>transmission</b> of digital information (bits) through a single wire or other medium is less costly than parallel transmission through multiple wires.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} can {{be implemented}} to transmit either 8-bit values (the standard in consumer electronics) or 10-bit values (sometimes used in studio environments). Both a parallel and a <b>serial</b> <b>transmission</b> format are defined. For the parallel format, a 25-pin Sub-D connector pinout and ECL logic levels are defined. The serial format can be transmitted over 75-ohm coaxial cable with BNC connectors, {{but there is also}} a fibre-optical version defined.|$|R

It also allows the distance between units to be extended up to 60 km over a dedicated fiber. “Permanent virtual circuits” are supported through the switch.|$|R

The sequence is repeated for each byte sent. Figure 1 : Timing Diagram for <b>serial</b> <b>transmission</b> (8 -bit Data Example). The red arrows indicate when the bits of data should be read at the receiver. <b>Serial</b> <b>transmission</b> does not involve a clock signal.
