5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often {{taught about}} the Raëlian {{perspective}} {{of the body and}} sexuality. She discussed these topics from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.|$|E
5|$|If {{a device}} {{key is to}} be revoked, the media key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique key, BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Because</b> <b>They</b> <b>Can</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} album from American rock group Nelson, {{released}} by Geffen Records in 1995.|$|R
5000|$|Connascenses {{are said}} to be [...] "dynamic" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> {{discovered}} at runtime.|$|R
25|$|Adding more mirrors {{does not}} add more {{possibilities}} (in the plane), <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> always <b>be</b> rearranged to cause cancellation.|$|R
25|$|Cubic {{equations}} {{of state}} are called such <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> rewritten as a cubic function of Vm.|$|E
25|$|Italian verbs {{have three}} {{additional}} forms, known as nominal forms, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used as nouns or adjectives, {{rather than as}} verbs.|$|E
25|$|Lambs {{that are}} {{slaughtered}} soon after weaning {{generally do not}} need mulesing <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> protected by chemical treatment for the short time they are at risk.|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>They</b> <b>Can</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} at various studios such as Sound City, Studio F, Nichols Canyon Studios, Caravell Studios, Granny's House, Capitol Studios, Cactus Studios and Quarkbrain Studio. It featured original band members Brett Garsed, Paul Mirkovich, Joey Cathcart and Bobby Rock {{on most of}} the songs, and it featured guest musicians such as Mike Baird, Don Felder, Steve Porcaro and others. The album was mixed at Conway Studios.|$|R
50|$|There are ten waterfalls on the river, {{although}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> {{reached by}} a moderate hike on the Superior Hiking Trail they are lightly visited.|$|R
5000|$|... probes {{may have}} {{problems}} reporting reliably the NetFlow fields related to routing, like AS Numbers or IP masks, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>be</b> expected to use {{exactly the same}} routing information as a router.|$|R
25|$|In Latin America and Africa, {{mechanical}} typewriters {{are still}} common <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used without electrical power. In Latin America, the typewriters used {{are most often}} Brazilian models – Brazil continues to produce mechanical (Facit) and electronic (Olivetti) typewriters to the present day.|$|E
25|$|In number theory, {{these numbers}} are called 5-smooth, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{characterized}} as having only 2, 3, or 5 as prime factors. This is a specific case of the more general k-smooth numbers, i.e., a set of numbers that have no prime factor greater than k.|$|E
25|$|This fast {{response}} {{has led to}} suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to detect sudden changes in which way is up (because light, especially UV light which is absorbed by vegetation, usually comes from above).|$|E
5000|$|Extrusion {{profiles}} {{with holes}} {{are very difficult}} to produce <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> just produced by a simple die, so it should be practiced {{to reduce the number of}} holes as much as possible.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the band}} was {{frustrated}} by the reaction at Geffen, they {{decided to return to}} the studio to record another album. The result <b>was</b> <b>Because</b> <b>They</b> <b>Can,</b> which <b>was</b> released in 1995. Shortly after the band broke up with Geffen.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Because</b> <b>They</b> <b>Can</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in 1995, {{five years after}} the release of Nelson's first album. According to Gunnar Nelson, Geffen was not [...] "going to put any money into promoting it". The album went mostly unnoticed and did not appear on the Billboard charts. [...] "(You Got Me) All Shook Up" [...] was released to radio and video outlets, and peaked at #30 on the Radio & Records Pop chart. On another interview, Gunnar said about the album [...] "I’m really proud of it, but our fanbase had gone away. Everybody had changed their musical tastes, and it was really kind of a drag".|$|R
25|$|Such springs were {{essential}} in modern watches with a detached lever escapement <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> adjusted for isochronism. Watches {{in the time}} of Huygens and Hooke, however, employed the very undetached verge escapement. It interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Tait-Bryan angles, {{following}} z-y’-x″ (intrinsic rotations) convention, {{are also}} known as nautical angles, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used to describe the}} orientation of a ship or aircraft, or Cardan angles, after the Italian mathematician and physicist Gerolamo Cardano, who first described in detail the Cardan suspension and the Cardan joint.|$|E
25|$|Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} is an exceedingly rare type of dizygotic twinning {{in which one}} twin implants in the uterus as normal and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies must be resolved <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> life-threatening to the mother. However, in most cases, the intrauterine pregnancy can be salvaged.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{there are}} diphthongs and triphthongs which are {{analyzed}} as a vowel nucleus plus a semivowel ( [...] or [...] ) coda <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> {{followed by a}} final consonant. These include: (with short monophthongs) , , , , (with long monophthongs) , (with long diphthongs) , , , , [...] and [...]|$|R
50|$|Spaceships <b>are</b> {{important}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> sometimes <b>be</b> {{modified to}} produce puffers. Spaceships <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> used to transmit information. For example, in Conway's Game of Life, {{the ability of}} the glider (Life's simplest spaceship) to transmit information is part of a proof that Life is Turing-complete.|$|R
5000|$|Dionysius Thrax calls consonants sýmphōna [...] "{{pronounced}} with" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> pronounced with a vowel. He divides {{them into}} two subcategories: hēmíphōna, semivowels ("half-pronounced"), which correspond to continuants, not semivowels, and áphōna, mute or silent consonants ("unvoiced"), which correspond to stops, not voiceless consonants.|$|R
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to postulate that the long vowels and diphthongs should be counted as separate single phonemes, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> treated as sequences of two vowels. They are in fact historically derived from two-syllable sequences. This is easily seen in the synchronic co-existence of allomorphic pairs of Hawaiian forms such as kolu with -kou, both meaning 'three'.|$|E
25|$|Fossil fuels are {{of great}} {{importance}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> burned (oxidized to carbon dioxide and water), producing significant amounts of energy per unit mass. The use of coal as a fuel predates recorded history. Coal was used to run furnaces for the melting of metal ore. Semi-solid hydrocarbons from seeps were also burned in ancient times, but these materials were mostly used for waterproofing and embalming.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{microphones}} {{are often}} portrayed in movies as spy gadgets, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used {{to pick up}} sound {{at a distance from}} the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.|$|E
50|$|Some authors {{require it}} be {{possible}} to create new functions at runtime to call them 'first-class'. As a result, functions in C are not first-class objects; instead, they are sometimes called second-class objects, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> still <b>be</b> manipulated in most of the above fashions (via function pointers).|$|R
5000|$|Other {{countries}} that have banned the R4 flashcarts include Australia, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In Italy, in May 2016, a trial declared sale of the flashcart legal <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> used to run non-copyrighted unsigned software, reverting a previous trial held in 2009 that declared the selling illegal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{east and}} west {{branches}} of the Split Rock River, {{not to be confused}} with Split Rock Creek, join in the park. [...] There are ten waterfalls on the river, although <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> reached by a moderate hike on the Superior Hiking Trail and are not marked on park maps, they are lightly visited.|$|R
25|$|Extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) are a {{group of}} autoantigens that were {{originally}} identified as antibody targets in people with autoimmune disorders. They are termed ENA <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> extracted from the cell nucleus with saline. The ENAs consist of ribonucleoproteins and non-histone proteins, named by either {{the name of the}} donor who provided the prototype serum (Sm, Ro, La, Jo), or the name of the disease setting in which the antibodies were found (SS-A, SS-B, Scl-70).|$|E
25|$|Laplace's {{equation}} and Poisson's equation are {{the simplest}} examples of elliptic partial differential equations. The {{general theory of}} solutions to Laplace's equation is known as potential theory. The solutions of Laplace's equation are the harmonic functions, which are important in many fields of science, notably the fields of electromagnetism, astronomy, and fluid dynamics, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to accurately describe the behavior of electric, gravitational, and fluid potentials. In the study of heat conduction, the Laplace equation is the steady-state heat equation.|$|E
25|$|Some marine aquariums {{also include}} a refugium. Refugiums are small {{containers}} or aquariums that are hidden behind or beneath the main aquarium and connected to it via a water pump (often {{in a similar manner}} to a sump). Refugiums have recently become quite popular among reef aquarists <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to serve several purposes such as adding water volume or providing a fish-free site for biological filtration in live rock and/or the sandbed. Fish-free refugiums host populations of copepods, amphipods, isopods, and other zooplankton.|$|E
50|$|Military commanders {{throughout}} the world are attracted to young soldiers for combat <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>be</b> trained {{to carry out the}} most repulsive orders, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in abundance when adult soldiers <b>are</b> scarce and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> forced to fight for little or no pay. they often give them drugs to keep them dependent on their leaders and make them more susceptible to indoctrination by their leaders.|$|R
50|$|Elephants at Phnom Tamao {{have been}} trained using gentle Positive Reinforcement or Target Training. This means that they will simply not receive their “reward” (pieces of fruit or vegetables) {{if they do not}} follow the keeper's verbal command. It is often {{preferable}} to train captive elephants <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> then <b>be</b> handled more safely, which means their health <b>can</b> <b>be</b> checked and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> better cared for.|$|R
40|$|We prove {{and discuss}} some power {{weighted}} Hardy-type inequalities on finite and infinite sets. In particular, it is proved that these inequalities <b>are</b> equivalent <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> all <b>be</b> reduced to an elementary inequality, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> proved by Jensen inequality. Moreover, the corresponding limit (Pólya-Knopp type) inequalities and equivalence theorem are proved. All constants in these inequalities are sharp. Validerad; 2014; 20131104 (ysko...|$|R
