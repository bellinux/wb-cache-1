The first such elevator for the <b>Board</b> <b>was</b> raised in nearby Port Arthur, Ontario, and was acclaimed {{as one of the}} best grain elevators ever built in Canada, and one of the cheapest. Over the next two years, Howe traveled the West, supervising the construction of terminal elevators near major cities and ports.
