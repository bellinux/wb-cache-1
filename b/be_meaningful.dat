5|$|The Temple of the Warriors bears {{iconography}} depicting feathered serpents {{associated with}} Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This {{means that the}} building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may <b>be</b> <b>meaningful.</b> However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E
5000|$|Stimuli <b>are</b> either <b>meaningful</b> or meaningless. For example, {{letters and}} {{familiar}} objects, like a cup, <b>are</b> <b>meaningful,</b> while unidentifiable and non-geometric forms are not. In {{both types of}} stimuli, the global advantage is observed, but the global interference effect only occurs with meaningful stimuli. [...] In other words, when the global object <b>is</b> <b>meaningful,</b> the reaction time for identification of the local feature increases.|$|R

5|$|Harry and Hermione {{continue}} the quest, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including {{the death of}} Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and the place where his parents died, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, but she {{turns out to be}} Nagini in disguise, awaiting their arrival. The snake attacks Harry and again they barely escape, but Harry's wand is destroyed. Their luck finally appears to turn in the Forest of Dean. A mysterious silver doe Patronus appears and guides Harry to an icy pond containing the Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. During Harry's attempt to recover the sword, the Horcrux attempts to kill him. He is saved by Ron, who was guided back by the Deluminator, and they realise Dumbledore's gifts may <b>be</b> <b>meaningful.</b> Ron takes the sword and uses it to destroy the locket.|$|E
5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E

5000|$|In semantical sense, it is {{a theory}} of {{language}} which draws a distinction between [...] "real" [...] names, i.e., names associated with bodies and pseudo-names, onomatoids, which denote states, relations, properties, events, etc. It further elaborates on when a sentence <b>is</b> <b>meaningful,</b> when it has a literal, direct sense or when it <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> or has an indirect sense.|$|R
30|$|The finite {{dimensional}} variational reduction <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> {{in view of}} {{the following}} property.|$|R
25|$|If the formats have {{approximately}} the same aspect ratios, the characteristic dimensions can be the format diagonals; if the aspect ratios differ considerably (e.g., 4×5 vs. 6×17), the dimensions must be chosen more carefully, and the DOF comparison may not even <b>be</b> <b>meaningful.</b>|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} could be reconciled by acknowledging {{the tension between}} an agent's interests as an individual and {{as a member of}} various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests. For example, it may <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as a citizen of their town.|$|E
25|$|According to Danish {{noise and}} music theorist Torben Sangild, one single {{definition}} of noise in {{music is not}} possible. Sangild instead provides three basic definitions of noise: a musical acoustics definition, a second communicative definition based on distortion or disturbance of a communicative signal, and a third definition based in subjectivity (what is noise to one person can <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> to another; what was considered unpleasant sound yesterday is not today).|$|E

50|$|Statements that <b>are</b> not <b>meaningful</b> cannot <b>be</b> {{expressed}} as propositions. Every verifiable proposition <b>is</b> <b>meaningful,</b> {{although it may}} be either true or false. Every proposition asserts or denies something, and thus is either true or false.|$|R

25|$|Depending {{on which}} theory of utility is used, the {{interpretation}} of marginal utility can <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> or not. Economists have commonly described utility {{as if it were}} quantifiable, that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale. This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.|$|E
25|$|Large loss: The size of {{the loss}} must <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> from the {{perspective}} of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the {{size of the}} expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.|$|E
25|$|Expectancy {{theory has}} been shown to have useful {{applications}} in designing a reward system. If policies are consistently, clearly and fairly implemented, then the instrumentality would be high. If the rewards are substantial enough to <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> to an employee, then the valence would be also considered high. A precursor to motivation is that the employee finds the reward(s) attractive. In some instances, the reward or outcome might inadvertently be unattractive, such as increased workload or demanding travel that may come with a promotion. In such an instance, the valence might be lower for individuals who feel work–life balance is important, for example.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} normalizations in {{statistics}} - nondimensional ratios of errors, residuals, {{means and standard}} deviations, which are hence scale invariant - {{some of which may}} be summarized as follows. Note that in terms of levels of measurement, these ratios only make sense for ratio measurements (where ratios of measurements <b>are</b> <b>meaningful),</b> not interval measurements (where only distances <b>are</b> <b>meaningful,</b> but not ratios).

25|$|In {{some cases}} these {{questions}} may be sufficiently answered through {{the study of}} formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also {{run the risk of}} inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over {{whether or not they are}} sufficiently finitary to <b>be</b> <b>meaningful.</b> Gödel's second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But Gödel proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} would only <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> {{if it was}} put into action, regardless of Thich Tinh Khiet's announcement to his disciples that it heralded a new era. This required the monks {{to return to their}} normal lives and government and its officials to implement its promises. Many protesters arrested in the past remained in jail contrary to the communiqué's promises. After the deadly riot occurred only a day after the signing of the communique, the crisis steepened as more Buddhists began calling for a change of government and younger monks such as Thích Trí Quang began to come to the forefront, blaming Diệm for discontent that was hindering the effort against the Vietcong. Due to the failure of the agreement to produce the desired results, the older and more senior monks, who were more moderate, saw their prestige diminished, and the younger, more assertive monks began to take a more prominent role in Buddhist politics.|$|E

500|$|The {{problem of}} {{religious}} language considers {{whether it is}} possible to talk about God meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language {{has the potential to be}} meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still <b>be</b> <b>meaningful.</b> Statements like [...] "God loves me" [...] are discussed largely in Religious Language.|$|E
500|$|As a final extension, since 0.999... = 1 (in the reals) and ...999 = −1 (in the 10-adics), then by [...] "blind {{faith and}} unabashed juggling of symbols" [...] one may add the two {{equations}} and arrive at ...999.999... = 0. This equation {{does not make}} sense either as a 10-adic expansion or an ordinary decimal expansion, but it turns out to <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> and true if one develops a theory of [...] "double-decimals" [...] with eventually repeating left ends to represent a familiar system: the real numbers.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee's {{occasional}} {{public comments}} on political issues still attracted considerable attention. [...] He {{spoke to the}} 1944 UFA convention on post-war reconstruction, and expressed pessimism about Canada's economic prospects. [...] He advocated a policy of full employment, and emphasized that jobs had to <b>be</b> <b>meaningful</b> rather than [...] "put men to work building roads like coolies in China when machines can do it better". [...] He criticized the government-imposed wartime ceiling on wheat prices, of $1.25 per bushel, as forcing farmers to shoulder an unfair burden of a national crisis, as they had during the depression.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{psychology}} researchers consider {{meaning in}} {{life as a}} subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life. Wong has proposed that whether life <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal striving and life as a whole <b>is</b> <b>meaningful</b> according to some objective normative standard.|$|R
