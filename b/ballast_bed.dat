Ensuring the high speed rail traffic, increasing railway track capacities, providing comfortable and safe ride as well as high reliability and availability railway track, has led to development of innovative systems for railway track. The so-called slab track was first built in 1972 and since then, they have developed many different slab track systems around the world. Slab track was also built on slovenian railway network. The most recent implementation of slab track is in tunnels Križiški, Jurgovski and Ležeški on a section line Sežana – Gornje Ležeče. In comparison to ballasted track, slab track requires no maintenance, so it is installed mainly on high speed and highly loaded lines. Due {{to the possibility of}} direct mounting rails to the structures, the low construction height and lower weight than conventional track, slab track is built on sections in tunnels and on bridges. Moreover, the advantage of slab track is also longer life cycle, better geometric stability of the track, safer and comfortable ride. Slab track has disadvantages such as higher investment costs in combination with longer time of construction, limited corrections upon completion of construction, higher vibration and noise emissions as well as expensive and longer repairs in case of derailment of the train...|$|R

50|$|The {{community}} {{was named after}} B.J. Hereford, who {{was a friend of}} the town's founder. It was where cowboys Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury first met and became associated with Ike Clanton, in 1878. The two brothers would later be killed during the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in Tombstone, Arizona, with Ike Clanton being at the center of that dispute with the Earp faction. The El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, a mining road originally built by Phelps Dodge Mining Corporation, established a siding at the town around 1892, which featured a water tank and stock loading platforms. This line continued on to the wye connection at Fairbank and the New Mexico and Arizona Railroad, and then on to Benson. Hereford was a common stop for travelers heading from Tombstone, 15 miles northwest, down the San Pedro River en route to Naco, Arizona and thence Mexico, approximately 14 miles away. The original townsite was populated until the 1950s, and the last structures disappeared in the early 1960s.

40|$|In {{coastal regions}} of Australia, high {{population}} density and increased traffic volumes {{has led to the}} expansion of transportation infrastructure. Such developments have necessitated the use of ground improvement techniques in response to environmental legislation and requirements for improved performance and sustainability. In this paper, a brief overview of innovative ground improvement techniques in the major areas such as railway embankments, port reclamation and uncontrolled fills is provided. Ballasted rail tracks are often placed on freshly quarried ballast, which offers the desirable resiliency to cyclic and impact loads. However, <b>ballasted</b> <b>beds</b> often need periodic maintenance due to deformation and degradation associated with breakage. Recycled ballast is a cheaper and environmentally viable option but its strength characteristics need to be investigated beforehand. The assessment of different types of geosynthetics for improving the stability and drainage of railway tracks under high cyclic loading is also necessary. Field tests were carried out to measure the in-situ stresses and deformations of ballast on sections of instrumented track at Bulli and Singleton, New South Wales (NSW), Australia funded and built by RailCorp and ARTC, Australia respectively. Stabilization of soft subgrade soils using prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) is also essential for improving the overall stability of track and reducing differential settlement during the operation of trains. The effectiveness of using PVDs has been observed through field measurements and finite element analyses. Due to an increase in trade activities at the Port of Brisbane, Queensland (Qld) new facilities on Fisherman Islands {{at the mouth of the}} Brisbane River will be constructed on the new outer area (235 ha) adjacent to the existing port facilities via land reclamation. A vacuum assisted surcharge load and conventional surcharge scheme in conjunction with PVDs was selected to reduce the required consolidation time through the deeper subsoil layers. The design of the combined vacuum and surcharge fill system and the construction of the embankment are described in this paper. The 45 ha reclamation project involving the Outer Harbor extension of Port Kembla in Wollongong, NSW provided the opportunity of examining the potential use of coal wash (CW) and steel furnace slag (SFS) as the predominant reclamation fill. Detailed laboratory investigations indicated that there are optimum CW-SFS mixtures that may meet most of the geotechnical specifications to be used as an effective structural fill.

Several processing methods were applied in order to obtain the dielectric permittivity of the ballast system under investigation. The results were validated using the "volumetric mixing approach" (available within the literature) as well as by performing a numerical simulation on the physical models used in the laboratory. It is important to emphasize the significance of the random-sequential absorption (RSA) paradigm coupled with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique used during the data processing.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Beaufort Formation, in its type area on Prince Patrick Island, is {{a single}} lithostratigraphic unit, a few tens of metres thick, {{consisting}} of unlithified sandy deposits of braided rivers. Organic beds in the sand have yielded more than 200 species of plants and insects and probably originated during the Pliocene, when the area supported coniferous forest. This Beaufort unit forms the thin eastern edge of a northwest-thickening wedge of sand and gravel beneath {{the western part of}} the island. These largely unexposed beds, up to several hundred metres thick, include the Beaufort unit and perhaps other older or younger deposits. On the islands northeast and southwest of Prince Patrick Island (Meighen Island to Banks Island), the name Beaufort Formation has been applied to similar deposits of late Rrtiary age. Most recorded Beaufort beds on these islands are stratigraphically and paleontologically equivalent to the “type ” Beaufort, but a few sites that have been called Beaufort (such as Duck Hawk Bluffs and the lower unit at Ballast Brook, on Banks Island) differ stratigraphically and paleontologically from the “type ” Beaufort. This paper recommends that these deposits (probably middle Miocene) and others like them be assigned new stratigraphic names and not be included in the Beaufort Formation as now defined. Informal names Mary Sachs gravel (Duck Hawk Bluffs) and <b>Ballast</b> Brook <b>beds</b> are proposed as an initial step.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{monitoring of}} <b>ballasted</b> railway track <b>beds</b> is fundamental for maintaining safe operational conditions of railways and lowering maintenance costs. Railway ballast can be damaged over {{time by the}} breakdown of aggregates or by the upward migration of fine clay particles from the foundation, along with capillary water. This may cause critical track settlements. To that effect, early stage detection of fouling is of paramount importance. Within this context, ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a rapid nondestructive testing technique, which is being increasingly used for the assessment and health monitoring of railway track substructures. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient signal processing approach based on entropy analysis, which was applied to GPR data {{for the assessment of}} the railway ballast conditions and the detection of fouling. In order to recreate a real-life scenario within the context of railway structures, four different ballast/pollutant mixes were introduced, ranging from clean to highly fouled ballast. GPR systems equipped with two different antennas, ground-coupled (600 and 1600 MHz) and air-coupled (1000 and 2000 MHz), were used for testing purposes. The proposed methodology aims at rapidly identifying distinctive areas of interest related to fouling, thereby lowering significantly the amount of data to be processed and the time required for specialist data processing.
