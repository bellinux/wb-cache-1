In this work, a series of milling experiments are done by carbide <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> on a workpiece of titanium alloy TC 17, using the rotational angle and the inclination angle of tool axis to describe the tool orientation and the effect of tool orientation on surface integrity are studied. The results show that the surface roughness in both directions (feed direction and step direction) is optimal when the rotational angle is within the scope of 0 ° to 90 ° with a constant inclination angle. The change of the inclination angle has little effect on the roughness in feed direction, but much larger or smaller angle leads to a bigger roughness in step direction. The various tool orientations have an enormous impact on surface morphology. Compressive residual stress can be detected on all machined surface during changing the rotational angle and reached the maximum when it is 90 °. The surface residual stress reduces with the increase of the inclination angle. The tool orientation makes little effect on the microhardness due to the lower degree of work hardening...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Generally, <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> {{are used}} for free-form surface {{machining}}. When machining curved surfaces with large curvature change using <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> {{it is necessary to}} use tools with larger curvature of the cutting edges than the maximum curvature of the surface and minute pick feeds or to change tools for fitting the curvature of one part of the surface. However this causes poor machining efficiency. The curvature of the cutting edge of a flat <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> can be fitted to the curvature of a point on machined surfaces by adjusting the tool posture. Therefore, flat <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> can efficiently cut almost all curvature curved surfaces without tool change. This paper proposes two methods for deciding tool posture and tool path for 5 -axis control machining based on minimum cusp height. To decide the tool path, one method defines tool paths along isoparametric curved lines, while the other defines tool paths along curved lines along the minimum curvature direction. The basic system was constructed based on the proposed method, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified...|$|R

The investigation was focused on <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> inclination against the work piece (defined by surface inclination angle α. Surface roughness was investigated in a 3 D array, and measurements were conducted parallel to the feed motion direction. The analysis of machined surface irregularities {{as a function of}} frequency (wavelength λ), {{on the basis of the}} Power Density Spectrum – PDS was also carried out. This kind of analysis is aimed at valuation of primary factors influencing surface roughness generation as well as its randomness. Subsequently, a surface roughness model including cutter displacements was developed. It was found that plain cutting with <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> (surface inclination angle α = 0 °) is unfavorable from the point of view of surface roughness, because in cutter’s axis the cutting speed vc ≈ 0 m/min. This means that a cutting process does not occur, whereas on the machined surface some characteristics marks can be found. These marks do not appear in case of α ≠ 0 °, because the cutting speed vc ≠ 0 on the full length of the active cutting edge and as a result, the machined surface texture is more homogenous. Surface roughness parameters determined on the basis of the model including cutter displacements are closer to experimental data for cases with inclination angles α ≠ 0 °, in comparison with those determined for plain cutting (α = 0 °).
