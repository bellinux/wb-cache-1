5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide orogeny and the {{creation}} of the <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> Range province worked together to steepen the gradient of streams flowing west on the Colorado Plateau.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 11named storms, there were two additional storms in the season, classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The first developed in July in the Australian <b>basin,</b> <b>and</b> briefly crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on July14. Soon after it re-entered the Australian <b>basin</b> <b>and</b> dissipated. The other formed just southeast of Diego Garcia on November20. It tracked to the southwest, and the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph). The storm dissipated on November25 northeast of Mauritius. In addition, Cyclone Daryl, which formed in the Australian basin on March6, crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on March16 as a weakening storm without being renamed. Two days later it re-entered the Australian basin before dissipating.|$|E

5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, <b>basin</b> <b>and</b> range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E

5|$|The Upper Klamath Basin, {{defined by}} the {{drainage}} area of the Klamath River above Iron Gate Dam, is a unique transitional area between the Cascade Range {{to the west and}} the <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> Range Province of the northern Great Basin to the southeast. This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath Lake basins. Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions. Almost the entire basin is a graben region, bearing <b>basin</b> <b>and</b> range characteristics, formed by uplifting and subsidence along several north–south faults.|$|E
5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over a kilometer) in elevation. An alternate {{theory is that}} the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} {{has nine}} subspecies, although {{the differences are}} small and change gradually across the range. The subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in morphology, habitat usage, and vocalizations. These groups cover eastern North America, the Great <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions. The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern S. c. carolinensis has the palest back. The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. The calls {{of the three groups}} differ, as described above. The Great <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> Eastern forms have been observed in secondary contact on the Great Plains, where they do not seem to mix.|$|E

5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} {{on the open}} sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic <b>basin,</b> <b>and</b> the amount of populated coastline.|$|E

5|$|Cairanoolithus is {{native to}} Southwestern Europe, {{including}} southern France and northern Iberia. Its fossils date to the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian.

C. dughii is from the La Cairanne site in Bouches du Rhône, France, from Roquehautes-Grand Creux and from the Villeveyrac Basin.

5|$|During the day, {{the storm}} crossed 180°, {{entering}} the western Pacific <b>basin</b> <b>and</b> being re-designated as a typhoon. The storm tracked steadily northwestward, attaining a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a high-end Category 3 storm, before turning {{back towards the}} east. The storm gradually weakened, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September17 and again crossing the International Date Line. The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters. Throughout its existence, Hurricane/Typhoon Della traveled roughly , the longest known track of any Pacific hurricane at the time.|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century until {{the early part of the}} 1970s, coal was mined in the eastern portion of the Catawissa Creek watershed. The coal was {{primarily}} mined in the Jeansville Coal <b>Basin</b> <b>and</b> the Green Mountain Coal Basin. The Catawissa Water Company once used water from Catawissa Creek. Five drainage tunnels were built in the watershed in the 1930s, and they still discharge acid mine drainage in the 21st century. Strip mining has occurred in parts of the watershed, mainly the Catawissa Creek headwaters and the Little Tomhicken Creek sub-watershed.|$|E

Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River <b>basin,</b> <b>and</b> coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States.
