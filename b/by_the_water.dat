5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about {{for no apparent}} reason. In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that this Brownian motion was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's feeding {{habitat is}} rocky coasts, {{rather than the}} damp {{grassland}} favoured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pipit. The Eurasian rock pipit feeds mainly on invertebrates, seeking out most of its prey on foot, only occasionally flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes sea slaters or other species that hide under stones.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} was unexpected, {{and almost}} certainly began some days {{before it became}} apparent at the surface. The sea floor at the eruption site is 130metres (426ft) below sea level, and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed, quenched and dissipated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pressure and density. Gradually, as repeated flows built up a mound of material that approached sea level, the explosions {{could no longer be}} contained, and activity broke the surface.|$|E

The high point of Middleton is <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> tower at {{the western end of}} Town Street.

5|$|Water {{is pumped}} {{to the summit}} at {{the western end of}} the locks, from Wilton Water, by the {{restored}} Crofton Pumping Station. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level in the summit pound.|$|E
5|$|While most marine {{bioluminescence}} {{is green}} to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow.

5|$|With {{the victory}} at Magdhaba the {{occupation}} of El Arish was secure. This was the first town captured on the Mediterranean coast and infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade quickly began to fortify the town. The Royal Navy arrived on 22 December 1916, and supplies began landing on the beaches near El Arish on 24 December. After {{the arrival of the}} railway on 4 January 1917 followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pipeline, El Arish quickly developed into a major base for the EEF.|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds sustained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> life, {{such as the}} black skimmer, brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
