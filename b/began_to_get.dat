Kalk, the officer-of-the-deck when the torpedo struck — <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> men {{out of the water}} and into the life rafts. Kalk worked in the cold Atlantic water to {{equalize}} the load among the various rafts, but died of exhaustion and exposure.|$|E

5|$|As a child Juha Vainio was {{diagnosed}} with congenital heart disease, causing his lips to turn blue, and the onset of rapid breathlessness. He underwent a heart operation in early 1949 {{at the same time}} as his mother suffered an attack of tuberculosis from which she later recovered. Juha was at first kept in the adults' ward due to the serious nature of the operation, but later transferred to the children's ward to recover. He soon went home and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better.|$|E

5|$|In the NBA, Miller had {{a modest}} role {{for most of}} his first two seasons. He <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> regular playing time midway through his second season and in the final weeks of his second season he became an {{everyday}} starter due to injury. In 2016, he earned an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection and {{was a member of the}} 2015–16 ABA League champion, the 2015–16 Basketball League of Serbia champion and the 2016–17 Israeli Basketball State Cup winner.|$|E
5|$|Brooklyn went hitless in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the top half of the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis hitless. With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases loaded. The Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|Despite trials, James' life in Utah was {{punctuated by}} moments of joy. A daughter, Mary Ann, {{was born in}} May 1848—the first black child born in Utah. Eventually things <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better for the Mannings: by the mid 1860s {{they were able to}} build a {{comfortable}} home and had acquired both farmland and animals, including an ox, horses, and a small flock of sheep. By the end of 1865 the Jameses, while not wealthy, were fairly prosperous. Only four households in the area held more assets in 1865 than they did, while 31 held less. The family was growing quickly as well. Between 1848 and 1860 six children were born: Miriam, Ellen Madora, Jessie, Jerry, Isaac, and Vilate. James' oldest son, Sylvester, was listed {{as a member of the}} Nauvoo Legion in 1861.|$|E

5|$|Legend of Mana was {{designed}} as a 2D game, despite the PlayStation's 3D-focus, as the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. Kawazu initially let Ishii have a relaxed schedule and budget, as Ishii had a great number of ideas he wanted in the game, but when the project <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of control and out of time Kawazu tightened down the rest of the development schedule and convinced the Square executives to delay the game by two months—even though it had already been announced to the public—to allow it to be completed as Ishii envisioned. Kawazu has said that this experience taught him that his true skill in game development lay in working as a producer.|$|E
5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved on both sides. The communist country of North Korea was supported by Russia, China and others, while the democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and {{over the next three years}} more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish American men and women were serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E

In the 50-metre freestyle, he won the event {{with a time of}} 21.84 seconds, beating the Pan American Games record, and becoming the first swimmer from South America to swim it in under 22 seconds. Cielo <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> close to the world record in the 50-metre freestyle, a time of 21.64 seconds, which at the time belonged to legendary swimmer Alexander Popov. He also broke the Pan Am Games and South American record in the 4×100-metre freestyle, with a time of 3:15.90, along with Fernando Silva, Eduardo Deboni and Nicolas Oliveira.

5|$|Liverpool <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a {{foothold}} in the match after 30 minutes, their best chance came in the 36th minute when a shot by Murphy went over the crossbar. Three minutes later, their approach paid off as they scored. A long-range shot from Steven Gerrard deflected off United midfielder David Beckham and into the United goal to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Three minutes after the goal, United had a chance to equalise: A shot by midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón was saved by Dudek, but the ball rebounded to Scholes, but his subsequent shot was blocked by Henchoz. After a free-kick by Beckham just before half-time was saved by Dudek, Liverpool counter-attacked through midfielder El Hadji Diouf down the right-hand side of the pitch, though his subsequent cross into the penalty area was intercepted by Keane.|$|E
