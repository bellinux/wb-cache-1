5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

He said, [...] "Whether it's pretentious or not, I {{think it depends on}} how it's used. [...] I don't quite agree with using too much of that sort of thing, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> get Plummer, suddenly it's working." ...|$|E

You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness.

500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in a way you don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 August 1915, Tatiana {{wrote her}} mother another letter expressing {{her desire to}} help her bear the burdens {{brought on by the}} war: [...] "I simply can't tell you how awfully sorry I am for you, my beloved ones. I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments I am sorry I'm not a man." [...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, <b>but,</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinto's {{first film}} of 2015 was Terrence Malick's Knight of Cups, an {{experimental}} film that featured an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, and Antonio Banderas. She played Helen, a model with whom Bale embarks on a [...] "dalliance". She talked about acting without a script: [...] "It {{is definitely a}} bit nerve-racking {{on the first day}} because you don't know where you are going to go. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> figure that out, then it doesn't really matter. It is actually very relaxing. It is fun and liberating. It is an experience that I completely embrace". Premiering at the competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, the film received average to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in the United States in March 2016. She was among the 100 narrators of Unity (2015), a documentary that explores the relationships between Earth's species. Her third release of that year was the Colombian action film Blunt Force Trauma, in which she starred opposite Ryan Kwanten and Mickey Rourke as a woman looking for her brother's murderer. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticised the film, stating that it [...] "takes itself much more seriously than viewers will." [...] In 2015, Pinto worked on Andy Serkis' Jungle Book, a motion capture adventure fantasy film based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. She will portray Mowgli's adoptive mother in the film.|$|E

500|$|Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a two and {{half out of}} four stars saying, [...] "Who knew that the franchise's creators would {{eventually}} find a plot twist that made sense? Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value? Given our cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> get past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E
500|$|A {{civil lawsuit}} was filed by Jordan Chandler {{and his parents}} on September 14, 1993. In late 1993, {{district}} attorneys in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties both convened grand juries to assess whether criminal charges should be filed against Jackson. By January 1, 1994, $2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in California and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses, but Jordan's allegations could not be corroborated. On January 4, 1994, Chandler's attorney, Larry Feldman, filed a motion for the photos from Jackson's December 1993 body search from investigators, saying Jackson's attorneys and the L.A. district attorney had refused to give him copies. A few weeks later, Feldman petitioned the court {{that he should be}} allowed access to Jackson's finances over concerns that the singer's wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court. One adviser to Jackson stated, [...] "You can take pictures of Michael's dick and he's not gonna like it, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> start {{trying to figure out how}} much money he has, that's where he stops playing around." [...] Initially Jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded. Feldman filed a counter-motion, saying the delay would hurt Jordan's chances for recovery and make it more difficult to gather evidence. It is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal statute of limitations as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date, such as the case of Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court. Also, the constitutional right to a [...] "speedy trial" [...] only applies to criminal cases according to the Sixth Amendment, not civil cases.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the Game Pak's space limitations, {{full motion}} video {{is not usually}} {{feasible}} for use in cutscenes. A notable exception is Resident Evil 2, which contains the equivalent material of the two CD-ROM discs of the original PlayStation version, plus some expanded content, plus higher quality audio samples and unique surround sound technology, making it what IGN calls [...] "the best version of the game".

In the recording studio, Syco Music heard some of Sandé's songs which they wanted, but she refused and told them she wanted to keep them for her own album. They later asked her to write for some of their artists, and Leona Lewis went into the studio with her and Naughty Boy to record for a couple of weeks, and she said that her and Lewis had a lot in common. She also said that Lewis has a phenomenal voice and she was lovely.|$|E
