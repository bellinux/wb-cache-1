Daily feed intake was only slightly lower for singly-housed minks. Singly-housed females came on heat slightly later than females housed with a male. No statistically significant differences were found in whelping success due to feeding intensity or housing system. Whelping results tended, however, to be best for the females on restricted feeding and housed with a male (4. 1 kits/mated female), and poorest for the females fed the standard ration but housed singly (3. 4 kits/mated fe-male). The conventional housing set-up, in which males and females are housed in pairs, is therefore recommended, but feeding from autumn onwards should be restricted. ...|$|E

40|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} species, helping {{close relatives}} may provide important fitness benefits. However, helping can be energetically expensive and {{may result in}} increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Consequently, an oxidant/ antioxidant imbalance can lead to higher oxidative stress susceptibility. Given the potential costs of helping, {{it may be that}} only individuals with a sufficiently good body condition and/or stable oxidative balance can afford to help. Knowledge about relationships between social status and oxidative balance in cooperatively breeding systems is still limited. Studying these relationships is important for understanding the costs of helping and physiological pressures of reproduction. Here we evaluate the relationship between helping behaviour, body condition and oxidative balance in a wild population of the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). In this species, some subordinate individuals help dominant birds with the rearing of young, while others refrain from any assistance. We assessed body condition and oxidative parameters of birds of different social status caught during different breeding stages.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the effects of maternal energy on the growth and small intestine development of offspring. After mating, twenty gilts (Large White (LW) <b>breeding,</b> <b>body</b> weight (BW) at 135. 54 ± 0. 66 kg) were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments: a control diet (CON) group and a high-energy diet (HED) group, respectively. The nutrient levels of the CON were referred to meet the nutrient recommendations by the National Research Council (NRC, 2012), while the HED was designed by adding an amount of soybean oil that was 4. 6 % of the total diet weight to the CON. The dietary treatments were introduced from day 1 of gestation to farrowing. At day 90 of gestation, day 1 post-birth, and day 28 post-birth, the weights of fetuses and piglets, intestinal morphology, enzyme activities, and gene and protein expressions of intestinal growth factors were determined. The results indicated that the maternal HED markedly increased the BW, small intestinal weight, and villus height of fetuses and piglets. Moreover, the activities of lactase in fetal intestine, sucrase in piglet intestine were markedly increased by the maternal HED. In addition, the maternal HED tended to increase the protein expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R) in fetal intestine, associated with significantly increased the gene expression of IGF- 1 R. In conclusion, increasing energy intake could promote fetal growth and birth weight, with greater intestinal morphology and enzyme activities...|$|E
40|$|The repeat {{breeding}} {{problem in}} cattle is widespread {{among all the}} heavy dairy breeds in cattle and is being considered as a major problem throughout the world. The aetiology of the repeat breeding is of various origins. It is notorious for causing disturbance in the overall cattle health leading to lowered fertility and economic loss in dairy herds. Repeat breeding is caused by fertilization failure or early embryonic death, {{and the reasons for}} the reproductive failure may be due to various disturbances occurring at different sites along the genital tract, including the delicate hormonal regulation system. There are many diseases and disturbances held responsible for repeat breeding. Even intrinsic factors, such as oocyte quality, have been found to cause repeat <b>breeding.</b> <b>Body</b> condition and body weight also have an impact on fertility in cattle. Body condition scoring helps to isolate external scores and relate it to the internal condition of the animal and hence forms a good indication for grading the cattle. It has been observed previously that repeat breeder heifers (RBH) often are over weight and fat. For the present study, three RBH and two virgin heifers (VH, controls) of the Swedish Red breed were selected. The immature oocytes were collected by ovum pick-up twice weekly during five weeks. The oocytes were classified quality-wise and further examined under transmission electron microscope, TEM. Similar numbers of follicles were available for puncture in the ovaries of RBH and VH, but significantly more (P< 0. 05) of the follicles were aspirated for retrieval of oocytes in RBH (76. 4 %) than in VH (64 %). There was a numerically higher occurrence (NS) of low quality oocytes collected from RBH (60 %) than from VH (52 %). The occurrence of cytoplasmic vacuoles and lipid droplets was similar in oocytes from RBH and VH with a tendency (P = 0. 07) for more lipid droplets in RBH. The VH oocytes as a group were more uniform compared to RBH that displayed a great variation especially in numbers of lipid droplets. The most prominent difference between RBH and VH oocytes was the significantly higher total lipid amount present in the cytoplasmic lipid droplets in RBH oocytes (P< 0. 001), which was clearly visible as heterogeneous cytoplasm already under the stereomicroscope and confirmed by TEM. The results indicate that there are morphological differences in the appearance of RBH and VH oocytes, particularly due to higher lipid content in the cytoplasm, which can indirectly explain the low oocyte quality and the sub fertility in RBH...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstract Body {{mass and}} body {{condition}} are often tightly linked to animal {{health and fitness}} in the wild and thus are key measures for ecophysiologists and behavioral ecologists. In some animals, such as large seabird species, obtaining indexes of structural size is relatively easy, whereas measuring body mass under specific field circumstances may {{be more of a}} challenge. Here, we suggest an alternative, easily measurable, and reliable surrogate of body mass in field studies, that is, body girth. Using 234 free-living king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at various stages of molt and <b>breeding,</b> we measured <b>body</b> girth under the flippers, body mass, and bill and flipper length. We found that body girth was strongly and positively related to body mass in both molting ([Formula: see text]) and breeding ([Formula: see text]) birds, with the mean error around our predictions being 6. 4 %. Body girth appeared to be a reliable proxy measure of body mass because the relationship did not vary according to year and experimenter, bird sex, or stage within <b>breeding</b> groups. <b>Body</b> girth was, however, a weak proxy of body mass in birds at the end of molt, probably because most of those birds had reached a critical depletion of energy stores. Body condition indexes established from ordinary least squares regressions of either body girth or body mass on structural size were highly correlated ([Formula: see text]), suggesting that body girth was as good as body mass in establishing body condition indexes in king penguins. Body girth may prove a useful proxy to body mass for estimating body condition in field investigations and could likely provide similar information in other penguins and large animals that may be complicated to weigh in the wild...|$|R

The present study tested these ideas in an Australian loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) population at Mon Repos Beach (24 ° 48 °S, 152 ° 27 °E, Queensland) to determine if variation in MP was related female <b>breeding</b> history or <b>body</b> size, or influenced embryo and hatchling outcomes in clutches from 29 females and 552 hatchlings. MP was moderately high (65. 5 %), but experienced females did not {{have higher levels of}} MP than first-time breeders (neophytes), nor was female size related to the number of sires. Instead, more subtle patterns emerged: multiply-sired clutches of experienced females were sired by more males than those of multiply-sired neophyte clutches and primary fathers sired a greater proportion of offspring when mated to larger females. These findings are consistent with cross-seasonal sperm storage in experienced breeders contributing to a small proportion of paternity and size-dependent variation in polyandrous mating behavior. MP did not influence offspring size, levels of within-clutch morphological variation or hatching success. However, the number of sires of a clutch was positively correlated with proportion of developed embryos, suggesting a fitness advantage of MP. From a population perspective, male-biased sex ratios likely contribute to the MP levels observed, and levels could decrease with projected feminisation of populations due to climate change...|$|R
