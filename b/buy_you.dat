500|$|The homoerotic {{overtones of}} Barton's {{relationship}} with Charlie are not unintentional. Although one detective demands {{to know if}} they had [...] "some sick sex thing", their intimacy is presented as anything but deviant, and cloaked in conventions of mainstream sexuality. Charlie's first friendly overture toward his neighbor, for example, {{comes in the form of}} a standard pick-up line: [...] "I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> a drink". The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also cited as an example of homoerotic affection. [...] "We consider that a sex scene", Joel Coen said in 2001.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers found {{independently}} {{producing the}} film to have both benefits and challenges. Although {{they were given a}} great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that [...] "Money doesn't just <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished...

That the world is ruled by a shadowy cabal of super-intelligent lizards?... Sadly not. Her extreme point of view {{turns out to be}} that money can't <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> happiness and that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be." [...] He also panned the lyric [...] "I like to express my extreme point of view", saying that it's difficult to hear that line without feeling a prickle of excitement.|$|E

500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Dragon Quest game {{is often}} cited as the first console RPG. GameSpot called the original Dragon Quest one of the fifteen most influential games of all time and the [...] "most influential role-playing games of all time", stating that nearly all Japanese RPGs since then have drawn from its gameplay [...] "in some shape or form." [...] Next Generation said it was [...] "probably the first ever 'Japanese style' RPG", and listed the series collectively as number 56 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time". They commented, [...] "While never as ambitious as Square's Final Fantasy series, later installments of Dragon Warrior can't be beaten for sheer size (if you only had enough cash to <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> one game that had to last you a month, you bought a Dragon Warrior title)." [...] In response to a survey, Gamasutra cites Quinton Klabon of Dartmouth College as stating Dragon Warrior translated the D experience to video games and set the genre standards. Games such as Mother, Breath of Fire and Lufia & the Fortress of Doom were inspired by various Dragon Quest titles. Dragon QuestIIIs class-changing system would shape other RPGs, especially the Final Fantasy series. Dragon Quest IVs [...] "Tactics" [...] system, where the player can set the AI routines for NPCs, {{is seen as a}} precursor to Final Fantasy XIIs [...] "Gambits" [...] system. Dragon Quest V is cited as having monster recruiting and training mechanics that inspired monster-collecting RPGs such as Pok√©mon, Digimon, and Dokapon, and in turn the modern trend of collecting achievements. Dragon Quest V also introduced the concept of a playable pregnancy. The real world and dream world setting of Dragon Quest VI is considered an influence on the later Square RPGs Chrono Cross and Final FantasyX. The Dragon Quest series was recognized by Guinness World Records, with six world records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition. These records include [...] "Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom", [...] "Fastest Selling Game in Japan", and [...] "First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet".|$|E

I'm not gonna let their fathers, with all of their money, <b>buy,</b> <b>you</b> know, big-time lawyers and get them off. I'm doing this for you.'"

2500|$|Benaud gave a {{suitably}} motivated Lindwall the new {{ball and}} he bowled {{as well as}} he ever had, making the ball swing more than the Englishmen and bowling Trevor Bailey for a duck to record his record 217th Test wicket, the same batsman who had given him his 100th Ashes Test wicket four years before. Peter May received a torrid over, playing and missing several times in a row before he edged the ball though the slips and then to Neil Harvey. Lindall (3/37) was given a standing ovation as he left the field on the third day with England 22/2. He chased down Trueman to complain about the bouncer who told him [...] "I'd played bugger all in the way of cricket in that summer of '53, when I came up against you at the Oval. You bowled me a bouncer then, but I didn't squeal of moan about it". Lindwall said [...] "Christ! You still remember that?...I made a promise to myself to <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> a beer after that Test but never got round to it. What says you keep me to that promise now?" [...] and they went to the bar. Peter Richardson (23) held off the bowlers for over two hours and put on 66 with Colin Cowdrey who looked in fine form with seven boundaries in his 44. He was run out when he trotted in for a single, even though the umpire was unsighted by the wicket-keeper Wally Grout. Cowdrey took strike again unaware of his dismissal until he was asked to depart. Richie Benaud had strained a muscle batting and Ian Meckiff damaged his Achilles tendon again so the bulk of the bowling fell to Alan Davidson (2/95). Tom Graveney made 54 and looked as good as ever, but he only got support from Trueman who tried to hit every ball and either pulled off a perfect stroke or missed completely in an entertaining 36. The young Gordon Rorke (3/41) took the last three wickets and England were out for 214.|$|E
