5|$|In Liao custom betrothal {{was seen}} as being equally serious to, if not more serious than, {{marriage}} itself, and was difficult to annul. The groom would pledge to work for three years for the bride's family, pay a bride price, and lavish the bride's family with gifts. After the three years, the groom would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the bride back to his home, and the bride would usually cut off all ties with her family.|$|E

Jagd-Division (3rd Fighter Division), that a intruder operation <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place. Schnaufer proposed waiting until the enemy had crossed beyond the lines over the North Sea before attacking them. Grabmann was enthusiastic, and suggested the operation go further and attack the enemy bombers while they were attempting to land in eastern England. Schnaufer also became aware of Schmid's desire for an intruder operation at this time and personally urged him to approach the High Command once more.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} February, {{the warring}} parties reached a compromise. Under its terms, Modell would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his personnel to Baltimore, but would leave Cleveland the Browns' colors, logos and heritage for a reactivated Browns franchise {{that would take}} the field no later than 1999. The $175 million earmarked for stadium improvements was to be used instead build a new stadium, with up to $48 million of additional financial assistance from the NFL. Further, Modell was ordered to pay Cleveland $9.3 million to compensate for lost revenues and taxes during the Browns' three years of inactivity, plus up to $2.25 million of the city's legal fees. As {{a result of the}} deal Modell's team was technically an expansion franchise, called the Baltimore Ravens.|$|E

He formally {{changed his name to}} Wilder-Neligan in October, and remained at Anzac until November, after which the battalion was evacuated to Egypt. During its time in Egypt, the 9th Battalion was stationed for a period on the front line in the desert near the Suez Canal. On one occasion, an Ottoman patrol was seen, and the adventurous Wilder-Neligan asked to <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> out a patrol on camels to cut them off. With certain restrictions, this was permitted, but no contact with the enemy occurred. In March 1916, he relinquished his post of adjutant, and was substantively promoted to captain before the battalion left Alexandria for France and the Western Front {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|The matter {{ended in}} court, {{with a case}} to {{determine}} whether Autolink should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had been disloyal {{in regard to the}} contract, Ofoten District Court ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the ownership of the radios to Autolink. The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. There was agreement that Autolink, on 13February 2008, had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK12 million, of which NOK9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} ODIs {{have changed since}} the first Afro-Asia Cup. During the tournament, the ICC experimented with a rule called supersub – where the twelfth man would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> to {{the field in the}} place of one of the players and would be allowed to bat and/or bowl in his place, gaining a full cap in the process. As a result this meant there were {{generally}} 12 capped players per match instead of the regular 11, even though a player may have not participated in either batting or bowling in a match. For example, Muttiah Muralitharan bowled during the first innings of the first ODI, but was replaced by Mohammad Ashraful who batted in his place: both players are listed as having a full cap. These rules were not in place for the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal match or the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.|$|E

5|$|On 19 November, Hill {{visited the}} {{commanding}} officer of the French forces guarding a vital bridge at Medjez el Bab, and warned him that any attempt by German forces to cross the bridge would be opposed by the battalion. Hill attached 'R' Company to the French forces to ensure the bridge was not captured. German forces soon arrived at the bridge, and their commanding officer demanded that they <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of the bridge and cross it to attack the British positions. The French rejected the German demands, and in conjunction with 'R' Company repelled subsequent German attacks that lasted several hours. The battalion was reinforced by the U.S. 175th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the Derbyshire Yeomanry, but, despite fierce resistance, the German forces proved to be too strong, and by 04:30 on 20 November the Allied forces had yielded the bridge {{and the surrounding area}} to the Germans. Two days later, Hill received information that a strong Italian force, which included a number of tanks, was stationed at Gue Hill. Hill decided to attack the force and attempt to disable the tanks, and the following night moved the battalion, less a small guard detachment that remained at Béja, to Sidi N'Sir where it linked up with a force of French Senegalese infantry. Hill decided that the battalion's section of 3inch mortars would cover 'R' and 'S' Companies as they advanced up Gue Hill and attacked the Italian force, while a small force of sappers would mine the road {{at the rear of the}} hill to ensure the Italian tanks could not retreat.|$|E
