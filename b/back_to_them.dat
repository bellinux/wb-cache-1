5|$|Armed {{conflict}} erupted {{again in}} 1459, and again Clifford {{was found on}} the side of the King and Queen. Clifford took part in the parliament that attainted the Yorkists– by now in exile– and he took a share of the profits from their lands, as well as being appointed to offices traditionally in their keeping. The Yorkist lords returned from exile in June 1460 and subsequently defeated a royal army at Northampton. As a result of the royalist defeat, Clifford was ordered to surrender such castles and offices as he had from the Nevilles <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> although it is unlikely that he did so. In fact, he and his fellow northern Lancastrian lords merely commenced a campaign of destruction on Neville and Yorkist estates and tenantry, to such an extent that in December 1460, the duke of York and his close ally, the earl of Salisbury, raised an army and headed north to crush the Lancastrian rebellion. This winter campaign culminated in the Battle of Wakefield in the last days of the year, and was a decisive victory for the Lancastrian army, of which Clifford was by now an important commander. The battle resulted in the deaths of both York and Salisbury, but was probably most notorious for Clifford's slaying of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, York's seventeen-year old second son and the younger brother of the future King Edward IV. This may have resulted in Clifford's being nicknamed 'Butcher Clifford,' although historians disagree as to how widely used by contemporaries this term was.|$|E

5|$|The Rock {{lost the}} WWF Championship to Angle at No Mercy in October. Around this time, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and {{defeated}} him at Survivor Series. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell {{match for the}} WWF Championship at Armageddon, which Kurt Angle won to retain the title. On December 18 on Raw, The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, then losing it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> the next night at a SmackDown! taping. In 2001, The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out in February, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Mr. McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night's Raw Is War, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H came to the ring with a sledgehammer and it seemed he would help The Rock, because of the rivalry between Austin and Triple H (and an argument with McMahon earlier in the night), but he attacked him instead, allying with McMahon and Austin. Austin and Triple H formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended. Johnson used this time off {{to act in the}} movie The Mummy Returns.|$|E

25|$|NBC's initial {{contract}} with the NHL ran for two years, with an option given to the network to renew for two additional years. NBC's NHL coverage was delayed a {{year because of the}} 2004–05 NHL lockout, which wound up cancelling the entire regular season and playoffs. NBC instead, decided to replace five of its scheduled NHL broadcasts with alternate sports programming (such as reruns of NASCAR Year in Review and The Purina Incredible Dog Challenge). NBC also decided to give one of the slots back to local affiliates, some of which filled the time given <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> with infomercials.|$|E

O'Neal was looking to expand his business ventures with real-estate development projects aimed at assisting Orlando home owners facing foreclosure.

25|$|However, the Swedes {{began to}} resent the {{monopoly}} trading {{position of the}} Hansa (mostly German citizens) and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he {{was regarded as a}} hero to the Swedish people. History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustave would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop and freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> rather than going to a feudal landowning class. This was not the case in other countries of Europe like Poland were the peasantry was still bound by serfdom and a strong feudalistic land owning system.|$|E
25|$|Kilala and Rei {{fall into}} the world of Beauty and the Beast, {{followed}} by Rei's old fiancée Sylphy, the obnoxious and self-busy princess of Floradiso. They accidentally lose the Beast's pocket watch in the river, and follow the current to the village to get it back. After finding out that the watch is in Gaston's hands, Rei starts a fight with the bulky man only to lose. Gaston throws the watch <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but keeps the amber stored inside. Kilala and Sylphy pose as dancers to steal back the jewel. Rei starts a fight with Gaston again, and wins, along with the gem. Kilala convinces the Beast to confess his feelings to Belle and give her the broken pocket watch, which she happily accepts. As a token, Belle and Beast give Kilala the amber, only to find out that it's one of the gems needed for the Tiara.|$|E
25|$|The Union fleet faced only token {{opposition}} at Chalmette, {{and thereafter}} had clear sailing to New Orleans. The fourteen vessels remaining arrived {{there in the}} afternoon of April 25 and laid the city under their guns. In the meantime, General Lovell had evacuated the troops {{that had been in}} the city, so no defense was possible. Panic-stricken citizens broke into stores, burned cotton and other supplies, and destroyed much of the waterfront. The unfinished CSS Mississippi was hastily launched; it was hoped that she could be towed to Memphis, but no towboats could be found, so she was burned by order of her captain. Farragut demanded the surrender of the city. The mayor and city council tried to buck the unpleasant duty up to Lovell, but he passed it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> After three days of fruitless negotiations, Farragut sent two officers ashore with a detachment of sailors and marines. They went to the Custom House, where they hauled down the state flag and ran up the United States flag. That signified the official return of the city to the Union.|$|E

The interior ministry announced that the passports of the three cricketers had been given <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> {{so that they could}} travel to Qatar. Seven days before the appeal began Mohammad Asif announced that he had withdrawn his appeal because he wanted to understand the charges against him. Butt and Amir announced that their appeals were to continue. The ICC moved the hearing to the UAE. Salman Butt announced that he hoped the appeals would be completed quickly so that he could make a swift return to international cricket and participate in the series against South Africa in October 2010. Their initial appeal against the suspension was rejected on 31 October, 2010. Butt and Amir hit out at the ICC saying that, although the ruling went against them, they weren't informed {{of the reasons for the}} decision.|$|E
25|$|The eighteenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, with a finish on the Mont Ventoux. It was won {{with a great}} margin by Jean-François Bernard, who became the new leader of the general classification, and the new hope of the French cycling fans. Bernard was a good climber and a good time-trialist, and {{had the support of}} a good team, so he could be able to stay leader {{until the end of the}} race. But already in the next stage, Bernard lost considerable time. He had a flat tire just before the top of a climb, and lost contact with the other riders while he had to wait for repairs, and had to spend energy to get back. His rivals Mottet and Roche had made a plan to attack in the feed zone, where cyclists could get their lunch. Mottet and Roche had packed extra food at the start of the stage, and attacked while Bernard was at the back of the peloton. Bernard chased them, but was not able to get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and lost four minutes in that stage, which made Roche the new leader, closely followed by Mottet and Delgado.|$|E
25|$|The veneration of nats also shares similar {{practices}} with Buddhism. In Buddhism, offerings are extremely common and expected. Shrines and temples, {{in which these}} offerings are to be made, are seen in both Burmese folk religion and Buddhism. In both the faiths, many different statues of various deities {{can also be seen}} around the house. Burmese folk religion differs dramatically in the concept of a soul. Buddhism does not believe in a soul that leaves after one dies, but rather a consciousness that is transferred to a new person (consciousness is reborn in another). In contrast, Burmese folk religion holds that the soul can leave the body it inhabits. This soul is often depicted {{in the form of a}} butterfly called a leppya. The act of the soul leaving the host often happens in dreams, or when someone is sick or dying. If one is awoken in the middle of their dream, it is said that their soul might not be <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> yet. If a host tries to live without its soul it will die. When someone is dying, butterfly hunts are often held to try to recapture the soul that has wondered off.|$|E
