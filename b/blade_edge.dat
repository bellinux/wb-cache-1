40|$|This is {{the first}} release of the {{repository}} which addresses autonomous inspection of wind blades using computer vision combined with structured light to accurately segment and detect wind <b>blade</b> <b>edges.</b> The method is invariant to both rotation and scale, while it is computationally efficient for use on real-time applications. The <b>blade</b> <b>edges</b> will be detected according to the segmented area of the blade, and identified as Hough transformed lines to easily follow a manouvering scheme which intends to follow the <b>blade</b> <b>edges</b> from root to tip, while maximizing {{the view of the}} blade without loosing view of the respective edges. It will also be shown that the method detects the blade tip, regardless of rotation and scale. Furthermore, the structured light will be utilized to efficiently compute feature point matches from a stereo vision system. These matches will be used to conduct 3 D reconstruction of the respective feature points using 2 D triangulation. This will enable transformation of coordinates between the image frame and camera frame, including a real-time estimate of the distance to the blade...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>blade's</b> <b>edge</b> {{often has}} a Scandinavian (or [...] "Scandi") grind, i.e. a single flat bevel. The blade should {{be strong enough}} to split (reindeer) bones, and {{tempered}} to sustain low temperatures. Some Sami knives have fullers.|$|R

5000|$|Draw the <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> {{along the}} strop spine-first. By contrast, {{sharpening}} {{on a stone}} is usually done by pushing the blade over it edge-first. Pushing will cut into the leather, damaging the strop and the edge.|$|E

40|$|Plants {{are very}} well adapted to growth in ultraviolet-B (UV-B) {{containing}} light. In Arabidopsis thaliana, many of these adaptations are mediated by the UV-B receptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR 8). Using small amounts of supplementary UV-B light, we observed changes {{in the shape of}} rosette leaf blades. Wild type plants show more pronounced epinasty of the <b>blade</b> <b>edges,</b> while {{this is not the case}} in uvr 8 mutant plants. The UVR 8 effect thus mimics the effect of phytochrome (phy) B in red light. In addition, a meta-analysis of transcriptome data indicates that the UVR 8 and phyB signaling pathways have over 70 % of gene regulation in common. Moreover, in low levels of supplementary UV-B light, mutant analysis revealed that phyB signaling is necessary for epinasty of the <b>blade</b> <b>edges.</b> Analysis of auxin levels and the auxin signal reporter DR 5 ::GUS suggest that the epinasty relies on altered auxin distribution, keeping auxin at the leaf <b>blade</b> <b>edges</b> in the presence of UV-B. Together, our results suggest a co-action of phyB and UVR 8 signaling, with auxin as a downstream factor. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{tomahawk}} competitions {{themselves have}} their own regulations concerning the type and style of tomahawk used for throwing. There are special throwing tomahawks made {{for these kinds of}} competitions. Requirements such as a minimum handle length and a maximum <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> (usually 4") are the most common tomahawk throwing competition rules.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{the shield}} was not {{successfully}} integrated into the Korean Military despite its mention {{in a variety of}} Korean historical manuals. Korean sword, then, integrates a variety of parries which are intended to redirect the opponent's attack and produce an opportunity (K. Teum) for the defender to counter the attack. These parries are most often accomplished with the {{use of the}} spine of the sword or the sides of the blade rather than with the <b>blade</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
50|$|A modern gouge {{is similar}} to a chisel except its <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> is not flat, but instead is curved or angled in cross-section. The modern version is {{generally}} hafted inline, the blade and handle typically having the same long axis. If the bevel of the blade is on the outer surface of the curve the gouge is called an 'outcannel' gouge, otherwise it is known as an 'incannel' gouge. Gouges with angled rather than curved blades are often called 'V-gouges' or 'vee-parting tools'.|$|E

50|$|Used doctor blades, from gravure {{and other}} {{printing}} and coating processes, may be inspected using a goniometer, typically {{with a built-in}} light source, to examine the <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> {{to see whether the}} blade has worn at the desired angle and whether there are signs of wear at other angles. A difference in angle from that set on the machine may indicate excessive pressure, and a range of angles ("rounding") probably indicates a lack of stiffness, or wear, in the blade holder assembly.|$|E
5000|$|A {{razor strop}} (or razor strap) is a {{flexible}} strip of leather, canvas, denim fabric, balsa wood, or other soft material, used to straighten and polish {{the blade of}} a straight razor, a knife, or a woodworking tool like a chisel. In many cases stropping re-aligns parts of the <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> that have been bent out of alignment. In other cases, especially when abrasive polishing compound is used, stropping may remove {{a small amount of}} metal. Stropping can also burnish (i.e. push metal around on) the blade.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Hobby {{microscope}} {{view of a}} 220 grit diamond sharpening stone. Tiny diamonds are electroplated to a perforated metal {{carrier strip}} and bonded to a plastic backing. The feature identified with the red line across it measures about 0.08 mm across. The dark area at upper right is a void designed to allow for swarf created during sharpening to be cleared from the diamonds. This relatively coarse stone {{would be used to}} reshape a damaged <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> which would be refined by finer grit stones.|$|E

50|$|Tlāximaltepōztli:This {{weapon was}} meant to {{represent}} the Aztec God Tepoztecatl. Basically an axe, comparable to a tomahawk, the head of which was made out of either stone, copper or bronze and had a two side design, one side had a sharp <b>bladed</b> <b>edge</b> while the other one a blunt protrusion.|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure that}} the blow would be fatal, executioners' swords usually were blade-heavy two-handed swords. Likewise, if an axe was used, it almost {{invariably}} would be wielded with both hands. In England a bearded axe was used for beheadings, with the <b>blade's</b> <b>edge</b> extending downwards {{from the tip of}} the shaft.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{profiling}} of the <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> {{is performed}} by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards {{by means of a}} rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by laha, the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a chakmak over the edge {{in a manner similar to}} that used by chefs to steel their knives.|$|E
50|$|Nakiri bocho and usuba bocho are Japanese-style {{vegetable}} knives. They {{differ from}} the deba bocho in their shape, as they have a straight <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> suitable for cutting {{all the way to}} the cutting board without the need for a horizontal pull or push. These knives are also much thinner. While the deba bocho is a heavy blade for easy cutting through thin bones, the blade is not suitable for chopping vegetables, as the thicker blade can break the vegetable slice. The nakiri bocho and the usuba bocho have much thinner blades, and are used for cutting vegetables.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a {{traditional}} steel blade that benefits from regular honing and resharpening {{in order to}} keep a sharp edge, a ceramic knife will stay sharp and retain its cutting edge for much longer—up to 10x longer according to some tests. The inherent hardness of the ceramic material also makes it more difficult for the consumer to resharpen. [...] Although a ceramic knife therefore does not need regular sharpening {{in the same way as}} steel, its <b>blade</b> <b>edge</b> will eventually degrade or chip and lose its cutting edge, at which point specialized sharpening services are required for the ceramic edge.|$|E
