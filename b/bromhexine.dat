40|$|Neutrophils {{are major}} culprits for the protease/antiprotease {{imbalance}} during various lung diseases, that is, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, these cells are presently considered an ideal target for the pharmacologic control of tissue injury during these diseases. This study was planned in order to investigate if ambroxol and its precursor <b>bromhexine</b> are actually capable of preventing alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (A 1 AT) inactivation by stimulated neutrophils and possibly {{to look into the}} mechanisms underlying this event. Ambroxol inhibited the production of superoxide anion by activated neutrophils, whereas <b>bromhexine</b> had no inhibitory effect. Ambroxol decreased the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from activated neutrophils with high efficiency, whereas <b>bromhexine</b> had a modest activity. Ambroxol and <b>bromhexine</b> were capable of limiting the chlorination of monochlorodimedon by HOCl, displaying the capacity of directly scavenging the oxidant. Ambroxol decreased the release of elastase and myeloperoxidase from activated neutrophils, whereas <b>bromhexine</b> was ineffective. Ambroxol prevented the A 1 AT inactivation by neutrophils, whereas <b>bromhexine</b> was completely ineffective. Among drugs currently available for in vivo use in humans, ambroxol is unique by virtue of its ability to prevent neutrophil-mediated A 1 AT inactivation via inhibition of HOCl production as well as HOCl scavenging. Also taking into account its capacity for curbing elastase release, the drug displays the potential to lessen the burden of oxidants/proteases and to increase the antiprotease shield at the site of inflammation. Thus, ambroxol appears to be a good candidate for raising attempts to develop new therapeutic histoprotective approaches to inflammatory bronchopulmonary diseases...|$|E

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of pilocarpine and <b>bromhexine</b> in improving radiotherapy-induced xerostomia and its associated symptoms. Materials and methods. In this single-blind, randomized crossover study, pilocarpine and <b>bromhexine</b> tablets were used by twenty-five patients suffered from xerostomia, with a medical history of head and neck radiotherapy. At step A, the patients were treated with pilocarpine for 2 weeks. In addition, they were asked to take <b>bromhexine</b> for 2 weeks with a oneweek washout period. At step B, the inverse process was conducted (first <b>bromhexine,</b> then pilocarpine). Whole resting saliva was collected from patients before and after receiving each medication by precise measurements. Then, efficacy of the two drugs in the treatment of xerostomia and its related oral complications was evaluated using questionnaires by Dichotomous format. The results were statistically analyzed using t-student and Fisher’s exact and chi-squared tests. Statistical significance was set at P< 0. 05. Results. The difference between saliva secretion rates before and after medications was not significant for <b>bromhexine</b> users at two steps of the study (P= 0. 35); however, it was significant for pilocarpine users (P= 0. 0001).

A break at pH 5. 5 in Ep versus pH plot revealing a protonation-deprotonation (pK(a)) equilibrium of brombexine was observed. Spectrophotometrically, an apparent pK, value of 4. 3 was also determined. An electrodic mechanism involving the oxidation of <b>bromhexine</b> via two-electrons and two-protons was proposed. Controlled potential electrolysis followed by HPLC-UV and GC-MS permitted the identification of three oxidation products: N-methylcyclohexanamine, 2 -amino- 3, 5 -dibromobenzaldehyde and 2, 4, 8, 10 -tetrabromo dibenzo[b,f][1, 5] diazocine.

40|$|Ambroxol is {{a widely}} used secretolytic agent {{originally}} developed from vasicine, a natural alkaloid found in Adhatoda vasica, extracts {{of which have been}} used to treat bronchitis, asthma, and rheumatism. We previously reported that ambroxol inhibits IgE-dependent mediator secretion from human mast cells and basophils, key effector cells of allergic inflammation. Here, the mechanisms involved in the inhibitory properties of ambroxol were assessed in comparison to other secretolytic analogues (e. g. vasicine, <b>bromhexine,</b> sputolysin). The results show that, in comparison to ambroxol, which reduced IgE-dependent histamine release from basophils at 10 microM- 1 mM, the release of the amine was only moderately reduced by sputolysin and vasicine at 1 mM. In contrast, above 10 microM, <b>bromhexine</b> was found to be toxic to basophils in vitro as evidenced by induction of histamine release and reduced cell viability. In contrast, the inhibitory actions of ambroxol at concentrations below 1 mM were not toxic and entirely reversible. Ambroxol was also more potent than either sputolysin or vasicine in attenuating basophil IL- 4 and IL- 13 secretions, whereas bromhexine-induced suppression of de novo cytokine synthesis was due to toxic effects. Additionally, ambroxol reduced IgE-dependent p 38 MAPK phosphorylation in basophils, unlike <b>bromhexine,</b> sputolysin and vasicine. These results clearly show that ambroxol is both more potent and effective at inhibiting IgE-dependent basophil mediator release and p 38 MAPK activity than the other secretolytic analogues employed. The therapeutic potential of ambroxol as an anti-allergic agent is further underlined by these data. ...|$|E

40|$|Mucociliary {{clearance}} (MCC), {{the process}} in which airway mucus together with substances trapped within are {{moved out of the}} lungs, is an important defence mechanism of the human body. Drugs may alter this process, such {{that it is necessary to}} know the effect of the drugs on MCC. Indeed, agents stimulating MCC may be used therapeutically in respiratory medicine, especially in patients suspected of having an impairment of their mucociliary transport system. In contrast, caution should be taken with drugs depressing MCC as an undesired side-effect, independently of their therapeutic indication. Since cough clearance (CC) serves as a back-up system when MCC fails, the influence of drugs must be examined not only on MCC but also on CC. Ultimately, the clinical repercussions of alterations in mucus transport induced by drug administration must be studied. Tertiary ammonium compounds (anticholinergics), aspirin, anaesthetic agents and benzodiazepines have been shown to be capable of depressing the mucociliary transport system. Cholinergics, methylxanthines, sodium cromoglycate, hypertonic saline, saline as well as water aerosol have been shown to increase MCC. Adrenergic antagonists, guaifenesin, S-carboxymethylcysteine, sodium 2 -mercapto-ethane sulphonate and frusemide have been reported not to alter the mucociliary transport significantly. Amiloride, uridine 5 '-triphosphate (UTP), quaternary ammonium compounds (anticholinergics), adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase), N-acetylcysteine, <b>bromhexine</b> and ambroxol have been reported either not to change or to augment MCC. Indirect data suggest that surfactant as well as antibiotics may improve the mucociliary transport system. As for the influence of drugs on CC, amiloride and rhDNase have been demonstrated to increase the effectiveness of cough. A trend towards an improved CC was noted after treatment with adrenergic agonists. The anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide, which is a quaternary ammonium compound, has been suggested to decrease CC significantly. <b>Bromhexine,</b> ambroxol and neutral saline seemed not to alter CC, either positively or negatively. Finally, treatment with either amiloride, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, <b>bromhexine,</b> ambroxol, N-acetylcysteine, S-carboxymethylcysteine or hypertonic saline has been suggested as a possible cause of clinical improvement in patients, such as the experience of dyspnoea, the case of expectoration or the frequency of infective exacerbations.

MethodsWe investigated the antitussive effects of a KJ (30  ml/day; 762  mg genuine extracts with standardized contents of 0. 2  mg/ml vasicine, 0. 8  mg/ml chicoric acid, and 0. 03  mg/ml eleutherosides B and E), <b>bromhexine</b> hydrochloride (24  mg/ 30  ml/day) and PL on cough and blood markers. The primary outcome was cough relief, which was assessed as the change of cough frequency from baseline (cough index). Secondary outcomes were safety with regards to reported adverse events (AEs) and hematological data. ResultsBoth KJ and BH relieved cough more effectively than placebo. On {{the third and fourth}} days of treatment, we observed faster improvement in the group receiving KJ compared to in the groups receiving BH (100 %) or PL (100 %), indicating a slightly shorter recovery time in the KJ group. KJ showed a good tolerability and safety profile. ConclusionKJ exerted significant antitussive effects in URI. The present data further support the therapeutic use of KJ in upper respiratory tract infections...|$|E

Objective: To {{prepare and}} {{evaluate}} three different dosage forms, containing doxycycline hydrochloride (HCI) and <b>bromhexine</b> hydrochloride (HCI) respectively and in combination, {{for the treatment}} of respiratory diseases in pigeons. Background: Birds have held a place in man's affection since the ancient Egyptians and Romans kept birds. Europeans have successfully bred birds, especially smaller birds and pigeons, for centuries. Only in recent years, however, have science and medicine been applied to aviculture and pet care. Pigeon racing is one of the sports not well known to the general public. These sportsmen invest a great deal to ensure that their pigeons are disease free. During racing they are exposed to infectious agents in the racing baskets and bring these pathogens back to the racing flock. If you ask any experienced flier what health problem he fears most for his pigeons during the racing season, he will probably say respiratory infection. Respiratory diseases are very common in pigeons. They are the major cause of poor performance and pigeon loss during the racing season. Doxycyline HCI, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is the world-wide veterinary therapeutic agent of choice {{for the treatment of}} Chlamydia, a principle cause of respiratory infection. Doxycyline HCI has several advantages: greater activity, providing effective blood levels for up to 20 hours after a single dose compared to 4 hours for older tetracyclines; causes less disruption to the normal bowel bacteria; has less detrimental effect on the immune system; and is less affected by calcium and other minerals. <b>Bromhexine</b> HCI is an expectorant drug, promoting bronchial secretion and having mucolytic properties. It is commonly used in combination with antibiotics such as doxycycline HCI for the treatment of respiratory infections in the pigeon loft. Because avian medicine has not been commercialised as much as those for human use, it has left fanciers experimenting with dosage forms and strengths resulting in severe consequences. There is a great need for sophisticated medication developed specifically for the pigeon market. Methods: This study investigated the formulation of a direct compressed tablet and a water-soluble powder containing doxycycline HCI and <b>bromhexine</b> HCI respectively and in combination. The formulation and evaluation of the stability of an ophthalmic solution, containing doxycycline HCI was also investigated. Initial test were done on all three formulations. The tablets were inspected visually and tested for uniformity of mass, hardness, friability, disintegration, assay and dissolution. The water-soluble powder was tested for its pH, constitution time, assay, moisture content and visual properties. An "in use" assay was also done on the doxycycline HCI powder. Three containers (stainless steel, glass and plastic) were used and the powder was dissolved in tap water (5 mglml). Samples were taken from every container after 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours and analysed. The results obtained were compared to the same powder but with no citric acid in the formulation. The same containers and time intervals were used for the comparing powder. The ophthalmic solution's appearance, pH, density, viscosity, assay, particulate matter and preservative efficacy were tested. The formulations were stored at three different temperatures and humidities for three months. The above mentioned tests were repeated after every month. An HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of doxycycline HCI and <b>bromhexine</b> HCI was developed and validated. Results and discussion: Based on the different test results generated over the twelve weeks of stability evaluation of the products that were developed in this study, doxycycline HCI and <b>bromhexine</b> HCI, respectively and in combination, seemed to have been relatively stable. The final tablets, water-soluble powders and ophthalmic solution formulations remained stable. The "in use" assay of the powder containing citric acid showed no discoloration, precipitation or breakdown when dissolved in water for a period of 24 hours. The powder lacking the citric acid showed discoloration after only 3 hours. This powder showed significant breakdown as well. The containers used for the storage of the tablets and the powders didn't seal tight enough. The moisture uptake was very high resulting in poor disintegration and dissolution times. Therefore the powder and the tablets should be stored in tightly sealed containers with enough silica as drying agent. The containers used for the tablets, powders and ophthalmic solution respectively, seemed not to influence the stability of the formulations negatively. The newly developed and validated HPLC method was used to analyse the stability samples and it proved to be reliable and easy to execute. Conclusion: Accelerated stability tests indicated that the formulations remained stable and that no significant breakdown occurred. Complete stability trial studies should however be conducted to claim their stability. The newly developed HPLC method was used over the twelve-week period to analyse accelerated stability samples, and it proved to be reliable and easy to carry out. Master...|$|E
