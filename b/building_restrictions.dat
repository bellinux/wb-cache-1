5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} <b>building</b> <b>restrictions</b> which hindered organized expansion.|$|E
25|$|The only brick {{stations}} were Tønsberg Station and Larvik Station, designed in Historicism and Renaissance Revival. In {{addition to these}} stations' size, it was decisive that local <b>building</b> <b>restrictions</b> banned wooden buildings. The two stations had the same floor plan and design, but Larvik was slightly longer. Their design was inspired from the main farmhouses of Jarlsberg and Larvik. The {{stations were}} innovative for their design with a central vestibule with direct access to both the town and track sides, with branches to waiting rooms for second and third class. They were also innovative in that the upper floor, with the station-master's residence, was smaller than the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|Introduced as Senate Bill 520 {{and signed}} into law in December 1972, this {{legislation}} was originally known as the Alquist-Priolo Geologic Hazard Zones Act, and had the goal of reducing damage and losses due to surface fault ruptures or fault creep. The act restricts construction of buildings designed for human occupancy across potentially active faults. Since it is presumed that surface rupture will likely take place where past surface displacement has occurred, the state geologist was given the responsibility for evaluating and mapping faults that had evidence of Holocene rupture, and creating regulatory zones around them called Earthquake Fault Zones. State and local agencies (as well as the property owner) were then responsible for enforcing or complying with the <b>building</b> <b>restrictions.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1960s, a {{large part}} of the town centre was redeveloped to designs by Bernard Engle (now tp bennett + Engle) under the {{direction}} of Fred Pooley, who prepared the general plan for public inquiry in 1962. The projected provided a new shopping centre, bus station, and linking with the new County Hall. The new town centre was tiered, with an underground bus station and market, an open ground level pedestrian square around which were larger shops and a cafeteria built high on stilts, and above, a three floored department store. While this form of town planning is often scorned today, at the time it provided exactly what was required by its consumers, greater shopping choices with easy access and convenient public transport all in a modern environment contrasting with the war time <b>building</b> <b>restrictions</b> which had lingered, in Britain, until the previous decade.|$|E
500|$|Construction of {{the second}} design began in 1949 and was {{finished}} in 1960. Progress was hampered by post-war <b>building</b> <b>restrictions,</b> {{and the effects of}} inflation on Nuffield's donation led to various cost-saving changes to the plans. In one change, the tower, which had been planned to be ornamental, was redesigned to hold the college's library. It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years and is about [...] tall, including the flèche on top. The buildings are arranged around two quadrangles, with residential accommodation for students and fellows in one, and the hall, library and administrative offices in the other.

[...] According to Morris, the debate ended as a draw, or perhaps even a Voorhis victory.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{cultural forms}} and values, using {{the medium of}} the existing <b>building</b> height <b>restriction</b> in bali of 15 m. The results form part of findings emanating from fundamental research activities funded by the Indonesian Department for Education. The study has been contextualized in the ongoing debate over bali’s contentious Local Government Regulation No 3, (2005). That directive authorises structures exceeding the currently imposed height limit, one which could be detrimental to local culture. The article is neither {{a rejection of the}} aforementioned regulatory amendment nor is it an approval. However, it does emphasize the idea that culture should be the determining characteristic of bali’spatial organisation. The argument concentrates on the culture of space and its dynamics-territoriality. Using a qualitative research method of Matrix of culture derived by anthropologist, E. T. Hall (1973 : 50 - 129),culturally strategic territorialities are defined, correlated within nine cultural dimensions. The article will be presented in four sections. Firstly, it examines <b>building</b> height <b>restrictions</b> in bali. The second and third sections analyse territorial cultural forms and practices which are deemed important to the <b>building</b> height <b>restriction,</b> if the Balinese culture is to be sustained. Fourth, significant conclusions are drawn which affect bali’s cultural future development. Keywords : Bulding height, cultural forms, cultural practices, spatial plannin...|$|R
