40|$|SUMMARY Electron {{microscopic}} {{changes in}} <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> from two cases of {{subacute spongiform encephalopathy}} are described. Large vacuoles seen in astrocytic and neuronal processes were sur-rounded {{by one or more}} concentric membranes. Dense-core vesicles were found in axonal endings and in nerve cell perikarya; these particles could represent catecholamine-containing vesicles. Subacute spongiform encephalopathy is a rela-tively rare disease. Although the clinical and electroencephalographical features are well de-fined (Goldhammer, Bubis, Sarova-Pinhas, and Braham, 1972), a definitive diagnosis during life can be made only by cerebral biopsy. During the last few years the main changes have been well described in several papers dealing with the electron microscopical appearance of <b>brain</b> obtained by <b>biopsy.</b> Vernon, Horta-Barbosa, Fuccillo, Sever, Baringer, and Birnbaum (1970...|$|R
40|$|Bile acid {{levels were}} {{measured}} in the sera, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue of 10 patients immediately after death from fulminant hepatic (FHF). Serum bile acids in FHF were predominantly conjugated, and total bile acid levels were higher in all 10 patients than in normal controls (85. 9 +/- SE 8. 4 compared with 5. 7 +/- 0. 4 nmol/ml, P less than 0. 001). Small but significant amounts could be detected in CSF (range 1. 2 - 5. 3 nmol total bile acid/ml) and <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> (1. 0 - 18. 8 nmol/g wet weight) of FHF patients, whereas none could be detected in CSF and <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> of patients dying without evidence of liver disease. There was no relationship between serum, CSF, or brain levels and duration of coma, or presence of cerebral oedema found in five FHF patients at necropsy. However, serum bile acid levels were similar in FHF {{to those found in}} chronic liver disease without encephalopathy and lower than those found to inhibit brain respiration in vitro. A primary role for these compounds in the pathogenesis of coma in FHF therefore seems unlikely...|$|R

The demonstration of Lafora bodies within the apocrine sweat gland of the skin by an axillary skin biopsy examination is a classic approach that may now be substituted by genetic testing. The inclusion bodies, which seem to contain high levels of carbohydrates, are typically labeled by a specific stain called PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) which is resistant to diastase treatment. Under strong clinical suspicion, liver and <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> may be undertaken. Currently the preferred method of certain diagnosis is DNA sequencing.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of urokinase (u-PA) and the urokinase receptor (u-PAR) in malignant astrocytoma cell invasion of normal brain, astrocytic expression of u-PAR and u-PA mRNAs were analyzed by riboprobe in situ hybridization in astrocytoma and non-neoplastic <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies.</b> In eight of eight malignant astrocytomas (glioblastomas), u-PAR and u-PA mRNA expression was demonstrated, whereas in seven non-neoplastic <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies,</b> u-PAR and u-PA mRNAs were not expressed. In one of four low grade and all anaplastic astrocytomas u-PAR mRNA was expressed, although u-PA mRNA was undetectable. Consistent with the mRNA detection, u-PAR and u-PA proteins were expressed by malignant astrocytes in five of five glioblastoma biopsies. To study the tumor margin, U- 251 MG glioblastoma cells were propagated intracerebrally in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft (28 days), and u-PA mRNA was found to localize predominantly to the leading tumor edge, whereas u-PAR mRNA was expressed throughout the tumor. Furthermore, adherent human U- 251 MG glioblastoma cells in vitro expressed u-PAR and u-PA proteins, which localized to sites of integrin alpha nu beta 3 cell-matrix contacts. These data indicate that co-expression of u-PAR and u-PA mRNAs and proteins marks the malignant astrocyte phenotype and that u-PA bound to u-PAR {{may play a role}} in glioblastoma cell invasion of normal brain by virtue of its expression at the leading tumor edge...|$|R
40|$|In vitro chemosensitivity {{testing of}} short term primary glioma {{cultures}} derived from <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> {{is still in}} the research phase and has not yet found a place in clinical use. The main reasons for this slow progression are the small amounts of tissue available and the lack of a suitably sensitive assay capable of use in the clinical setting. This study examines whether the MTS and ATP cell survival assays, which determine cytotoxicity via colorimetric and luminescence analysis respectively, could potentially fulfill this role. Primary glioma cultures were tested for chemosensitivity using the MTS and ATP assays and were found to be generally sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel but relatively resistant to carmustine and etoposide. For both assays, LD 50 values lay in the range 2 - 130 μg/ml but {{in the vast majority of}} cases, those obtained by the ATP assay were markedly lower those obtained by the MTS assay. Moreover, at cell numbers less than 2000 in the cases of paclitaxel and carmustine and less than 4500 in the case of cisplatin, these drugs were generally indicated as ineffective against the glioma cultures tested by the MTS assay but effective against these cultures by the ATP assay. These data clearly demonstrate that the ATP assay is more sensitive when estimating small cell numbers generated by primary glioma cultures from <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> and more reliably detects higher kill rates by anticancer drugs. This study also supports the feasibility of using the ATP assay for chemosensitivity testing in a clinical setting...|$|R

25|$|Whether BBB {{dysfunction}} is {{the cause}} or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could {{also play a role}} in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is ALCAM (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called CD166), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is CXCL12, which is found also in <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of CXCL13 under methylprednisolone therapy.

40|$|Background: The {{prevention}} and treatment of cognitive decline in the elderly population is reaching an increasing significance as people are living longer {{than they have in}} the past due to better healthcare services. Dementia is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the aging population, and society would greatly benefit from strategies to delay or decrease the progression. It has been suggested that certain medications, dietary measures, mental activity, and exercise may decrease the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly population. There has been mixed evidence that people who use a specific cholesterol lowering medication, the HMG-CoA reductase class, better known as statins, are less likely to develop dementia. However, direct evidence of statin effects of neuropathologic markers of Alzheimer’s disease is lacking. This paper will review recent research on the usage of statins in the treatment of dementia and its efficacy and validity. Methods: A systematic review of the past six years of published literature was conducted using the search engines MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PubMed using keywords dementia, Alzheimer’s, cognitive decline, and statins. Relevant references were retrieved and reviewed. Original research and cohort studies that included statin usage and cognitive decline were analyzed. Meta-analyses were excluded. Only studies published within the past six years were analyzed. The population included older adults greater than 60 years old who did not have baseline dementia at the time the study was initiated, and who used statin therapy for at least four months, monitored over the course of at least five years. Articles of original research that examined the effects of statin medications on cognitive function were selected. Seven studies were selected that met the above criteria, and were analyzed for quality and significant results. Results: Results from studies varied as to whether statins had any protective effects in the decline of dementia. Some studies made conclusions based on patient’s function on cognitive tests alone, while other looks into more advanced tests such as cranial MRI scans or even <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Of the seven studies reviewed, three concluded a decrease in cognitive decline while taking a statin medication, however four did not. One exam looked into cognitive decline as well as <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> and found that although there was no significant change in cognitive outcome, there were some benefits on brain autopsy of statin users. However, another study where <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies</b> were performed did not find any significant improvement due to statin medications. MRI analysis did not yield any significant benefit from statin drugs. Conclusion: Based on the above results, there are no significant consistent indications to use statins in the prevention of dementia. Statins may play a role in limiting cognitive decline, however more detailed analysis needs to be performed in order to better understand the role that statins play...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} corticosteroid-responsive focal granulomatous encephalitis as {{a manifestation}} of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 disease in the brain: something easily missed and easily treated.

HSV- 1 PCR analysis was negative in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but positive in <b>brain</b> <b>biopsies,</b> which showed vasocentric granulomatous inflammation. Paired blood and CSF samples showed intrathecal synthesis of HSV- 1 type-specific IgG. The patients improved clinically only after immunosuppression.

In addition to routine histologic methods (H&E staining), samples are evaluated with immunohistochemistry for ubiquitin, amyloid precursor protein, and neurofilament to characterize axonal changes and myelin basic protein for myelin pathology. Immunohistochemical stains for microglia (CD68 or HLA-DR) and astrocytes (GFAP) are also helpful techniques to characterize white matter pathology. With a similar pathology to POLD, HDLS is commonly grouped as adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) so as to give these individually under-recognized conditions heightened attention.|$|R
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of neurosarcoidosis often is difficult. Definitive diagnosis {{can only be}} made by biopsy (surgically removing a tissue sample).
