40|$|A long-standing {{debate in}} the {{literature}} is whether attention can form two or more independent spatial foci {{in addition to the}} well-known unique spatial focus. There is evidence that voluntary visual attention divides in space. The possibility that this also occurs for automatic visual attention was investigated here. Thirty-six female volunteers were tested. In each trial, a prime stimulus was presented in the left or right visual hemifield. This stimulus was characterized by the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superior, middle or inferior ring, the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> all these rings, or the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> the superior and inferior rings. A target stimulus to which the volunteer should respond with the same side hand or a target stimulus to which she should not respond was presented 100 ms later in a primed location, a location between two primed locations or a location in the contralateral hemifield. Reaction time to the positive target stimulus in a primed location was consistently shorter than reaction time in the horizontally corresponding contralateral location. This attentional effect was significantly smaller or absent when the positive target stimulus appeared in the middle location after the double prime stimulus. These results suggest that automatic visual attention can focus on two separate locations simultaneously, to some extent sparing the region in between. CNPqFINE...|$|R
40|$|Triplet {{blinking}} is {{a phenomenon}} observed commonly in single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. At high to moderate excitation intensities one can distinguish bright (on) and dark (off) periods in the fluorescence intensity trajectory caused by sojourns into the nonemissive triplet state. In this work, we focus on triplet <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> immobilized molecule in the low excitation regime, where a threshold between on and off intensity levels cannot be set, and, therefore, a standard on/off analysis of fluorescence intensity trajectories is not possible. In the low excitation regime triplet blinking parameters can be recovered from photon arrival time trajectories, i. e., records of individual photon arrival time.

40|$|In imaging {{applications}} the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> {{quantum dots}} is an ambiguous phenomenon. Although unwanted in conventional imaging, <b>blinking</b> is <b>of</b> significant relevance for super-resolution microscopy. Recent studies report on excitation-wavelength dependent quantum dot blinking, while other studies do not observe this effect. To investigate this disagreement we have systematically studied {{the effect of}} the excitation wavelength on <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots that are commonly used in imaging applications. We recorded single quantum dot intensity traces for 14 different excitation wavelengths and determined for each excitation wavelength the probability to find short- (0. 5 s) lasting bright state periods. This represents <b>a</b> systematic study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger set <b>of</b> excitation wavelengths than heretofore reported in the literature. For the quantum dots analyzed, we find minor variations in blinking with excitation wavelength. These variations do not follow a trend and do not correlate with features in the absorbance spectrum of the quantum dots. Our results show that in practice changing the excitation wavelength for CdSe/ZnS quantum dots does not allow optimization <b>of</b> <b>blinking</b> for e. g. super-resolution microscopy and that the effect <b>of</b> <b>blinking</b> as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> excitation wavelength is not a salient parameter in imaging applications...|$|R

40|$|As flies {{navigate}} {{their environment}} {{in search of}} food or mates, they execute sharp turns known as saccades that occur faster than the <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human eye. These maneuvers are initiated by changes in visual motion detected by the eyes, whereas their termination is under the control of small, dumbbell-shaped structures called halteres. The halteres are located behind the forewings and evolved from the hindwings. These structures oscillate during flight and function as biological gyroscopes; they detect unexpected body rotations during flight and trigger wing reflex maneuvers. Like the wings, the halteres possess <b>a</b> small set <b>of</b> muscles that control the structure’s motion from their base and receive input from the visual system. However, while the critical role of the halteres in stabilizing flight is long known as flies crash catastrophically without them, the role of the haltere and its steering muscles during flight maneuvers remains unclear. Using fluorescence imaging of the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP 6 f, we observed haltere steering muscle activity in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, during <b>a</b> broad array <b>of</b> visual stimuli. We found that these muscles are particularly responsive during voluntary escape maneuvers and are tuned to rotations about the body’s cardinal axes. These results suggest that the visual system is able to activate individual muscles to control haltere motion, and thus mechanosensory input. With this work, we are beginning to understand how hard-wired reflexes may be modified by the nervous system to produce voluntary behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Strength {{training}} {{is important for}} everyone, including children with cerebral palsy. The concept of strength development for cerebral palsy (CP) has recently become very popular. The idea of intensive therapy to treat patients with CP is supported by research. However, many professionals suffer from <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> basic knowledge about strengthening physiology, strength training, adaptation to exercises, etc. Therapists and fitness and wellness instructors are often {{not sure how to}} proceed, and they end up modifying adult versions of strength training programs and applying them to children. Many professionals misinterpret pediatric strength training as a weight lifting, power lifting, and body building therapy program. To understand the role of strength in intensive therapy, one needs to understand that strength is the most important element of life. All human movement—from the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye to walking and running—depends on strength and proper functioning of skeletal muscle. Each basic activity is based on strength. It is impossible to develop endurance, speed, agility, balance or coordination without it. Research confirms that children with CP respond to external stimuli such as strengthening exercises the same way (neurologically and morphologically) as non-disabled individuals. These findings allow therapists to use knowledge from sport medicine and exercise physiology to develop a new and effective therapy program. Strength is very important for patients with neuromotor disorders. It helps not only to initiate movement, but also to control or inhibit it.

Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with <b>an</b> official time <b>of</b> 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human eye, and the distance as the thickness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coat <b>of</b> paint, <b>a</b> sheet <b>of</b> paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second, and timing to the thousandth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second is prohibited for tie-breakers.
