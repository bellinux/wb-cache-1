40|$|The salted {{and dried}} product of tuna roe (bottarga) is a seafood {{characteristic}} of the Mediterranean area and exported all over the world. Samples of bottarga from <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus,</b> L) caught in the southwest Mediterranean sea were analysed. The samples were characterised by high content of marine wax esters (55 - 67 mol% of lipid classes), of docosahexaenoic (22 : 6 n- 3, 25 w%) and oleic (18 : 1 n- 9, 19 w%) fatty acids. Cholesterol was detected as 7 - 9 w% of lipids. Free fatty acids, index of lipid hydrolysis, represented 32 - 39 mol% over total fatty acids. Among metabolites, nutrients as taurine, nicotinamide and B-alanine, were found. The microflora comprised staphylococci, enterococci (2. 2 log(10) CFU/g) and lactic acid bacteria (3 log(10) CFU/g). The food-borne pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were not detected. These findings indicate tuna bottarga as valuable source of nutrients.
