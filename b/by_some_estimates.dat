5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>estimates</b> to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of 1915, many Ghadarites (nearly 8,000 in the Punjab {{province}} alone <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>estimates)</b> had returned to India. However, they were not assigned a central leadership and begun their work on an ad hoc basis. Although some were rounded up by the police on suspicion, many remained at large and began establishing contacts with garrisons in major cities like Lahore, Ferozepur and Rawalpindi. Various plans {{had been made to}} attack the military arsenal at Mian Meer, near Lahore and initiate a general uprising on 15 November 1914. In another plan, a group of Sikh soldiers, the manjha jatha, planned to start a mutiny in the 23rd Cavalry at the Lahore cantonment on 26 November. A further plan called for a mutiny to start on 30 November from Ferozepur under Nidham Singh. In Bengal, the Jugantar, through Jatin Mukherjee, established contacts with the garrison at Fort William in Calcutta. In August 1914, Mukherjee's group had seized a large consignment of guns and ammunition from the Rodda company, a major gun manufacturing firm in India. In December 1914, several politically motivated armed robberies to obtain funds were carried out in Calcutta. Mukherjee kept in touch with Rash Behari Bose through Kartar Singh and V.G. Pingle. These rebellious acts, which were until then organised separately by different groups, were brought into a common umbrella under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose in North India, V. G. Pingle in Maharashtra, and Sachindranath Sanyal in Benares. A plan was made for a unified general uprising, with the date set for 21 February 1915.|$|E

40|$|Nonparametric {{estimation}} of a quantile qm(X),α of a random variable m(X) is considered, where m : ℝd → ℝ is a function, which is costly to compute and X is an ℝd-valued random variable with known distribution.

40|$|Several authors (Molenaar & Hoijtink, 1990; Meijer & Sijtsma, 2001) {{have shown}} that several person-fit {{statistics}} present some important limitations. One issue is that the distribution of some parametric person-fit statistics is unknown. Another important issue is that the distribution of person-fit indexes is most often derived under the true ability level. In this situation, replacing the true ability <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>estimate</b> can seriously affect the distribution of these indexes. Snijders (2001) proposed a method to correct the mean and the variance of many parametric person-fit statistics to be approximately standard normally distributed, and derived the corrected version of the lz index. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to apply this correction to other well-known parametric indexes, and to compare them with their classical versions. The simulation results indicate that the standardized indexes have empirical type I errors close to the nominal significance level, and that the corrected indexes outperform their classical versions in this regard...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to translation memories. The proposed translation technology uses linguistic analysis (morphology and parsing) to determine similarity between two source-language segments, and attempts to assemble a sensible transltion using translations of source-language chunks if the entire source segment was not found. This is achieved by integrating a rule-based machine translation (RBMT) engine. The drawback of this approach is language-dependence; however, proper grammar acquisition methods are being developed to speed up grammar preparation for further language pairs. The paper discusses the basic processes of the proposed TM. Then the underlying machine translation engine is described. This is followed by an outline of the inegrated translation support tool where the proposed TM architecture is to become a core component. We argue that both the recall and the precision of a language-aware translation memory is higher than those of character-based systems. To this end, the paper {{introduces a}}n evaluation scheme currently being prepared for use for testing the TM, followed <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>estimated</b> figures, the latter providing arguments in favour of the proposed TM scheme. 1...|$|R
