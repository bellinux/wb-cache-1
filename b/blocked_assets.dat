Since most Iranian assets in the United States had been withdrawn after the embassy hostage crisis, the only substantial monetary asset left was approximately $150,000 in the Bank Melli's account in the Bank of New York. Before turning over the funds to the five students, however, the Bank of New York sued for a legal decision regarding its responsibilities in the case. The United States Department of Justice, speaking as amicus curiae in support of Bank Melli, advised that the bank had no responsibility for turning the funds over to the students; in March, 2006, Judge Denise Cole ruled against them, and was upheld by the Second Circuit Court in April, 2007.

5000|$|... “The saga {{began when}} he (Krok) immigrated to Australia in April 2002. Prior his departure, he had sought {{professional}} advice on the tax implications relating to his assets which eventually led to him setting up an elaborate scheme to avoid adverse exchange control implications. The scheme involved him, inter alia, vesting the beneficial interests in both the assets and the income in a British Virgin Islands company {{through a series of}} agreements. In consequence to all his transactional activity, according to Mr Krok, he ceded all his South African income and assets to a company except for the bare ownership thereof, and he had no income or capital gains on which he could be taxed by the ATO under the agreements. On 29 December 2008, Mr Krok again emigrated from Australia to the United Kingdom. He set up a similar tax avoidance scheme in respect of which he purported to transfer to the second appellant, Jucool Enterprises Inc. (Jucool), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, his assets situated in South Africa. In 2009, the ATO launched an audit of Mr Krok’s taxation affairs as part of a government initiative investigating participation by Australians in internationally promoted tax arrangements to identify taxpayers involved in significant offshore transactions or large transfers of funds to or from Australia. Resultant, the ATO held Mr Krok liable for $25 361 875.79 plus interest.” The ATO’s investigation also revealed Krok’s illegal use of funds while his assets were frozen, noting that Krok used South African credit cards from <b>blocked</b> <b>assets</b> for purchases ranging from the purchasing and renovation of multiple holiday homes, private payments to his mother and the purchasing of 2010 FIFA World Cup tickets.|$|E

40|$|Doctoral {{candidate}} Birgit Snijder-Kuipers {{recommended to}} use the term ‘change of legal form’ instead of ‘conversion’. These words convey the meaning ofthis legal concept better. In the opinion of Snijder-Kuipers change of legal form is a form of amendment of the articles of association. A separate legal concept is not necessary. Advisors and legislators are advised by the doctoral candidate to give consideration to this legal concept when preparing legislation, articles of association, agreements and last wills. The word ‘conversion’ has more than one meaning. One is conversion as meant in sections 2 : 18, 2 : 71, 2 : 72, 2 : 181 and 2 : 183 of the Dutch Civil Code. I refer to that legal concept as ‘change of legal form’. These words more accurately convey that this legal concept means the transformation of the legal form of the corporate entity. If there is a change of legal form the legal personality of the legal entity is maintained, as a result of which its assets are maintained. The central question is what is the nature, the function and the advisable scope of the legal concept of change of legal form under Dutch corporate law. To the extent a foundation changes its legal form, the law prescribes that the assets are blocked at the time of change of legal form of the foundation. There is a ‘blocked assets clause’ in Dutch law. I describe the implications of the <b>blocked</b> <b>assets</b> clause. The consequences of change of legal form to present legal relationships are also described. Finally, there is attention given to specific changes of legal form: religious denominations, partnerships and internationally the EESV, SE and SCE. ...|$|E
