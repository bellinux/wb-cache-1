Dubbed the Brazil Cost (Custo Brasil), this phenomenon is affecting the ability of Brazilian businesses to compete internationally and pursue innovation.|$|E

25|$|In July 2013, Uber started {{services}} in Taiwan. However, {{as the company}} registered as an information service firm, {{it did not have}} any permission to operate transportation services. This led to protests from taxi drivers and fines in millions of dollars from the government. Refusing to pay the penalties, Uber was banned in February 2017. In April 2017, the company resumed services after constructive talks with authorities and partnered with licensed car rental companies. The service can only operate within Taipei, but it will eventually expand to other cities. However, Ho Chen Tan, Minister of Transportation and Communications, said that Uber is not welcome if the fines aren't paid to the government; the company must switch its <b>business</b> <b>registration</b> as well in order to operate legally.|$|E
2500|$|Nationals of the {{following}} countries as well as Macau permanent residents can enter Hong Kong without a visa for tourism or business-related purposes. For business visits, they can undertake a limited range of business-related activities, namely [...] "concluding contracts or submitting tenders, examining or supervising the installation/packaging of goods or equipment, participating in exhibitions or trade fairs (except selling goods or supplying services direct to the general public, or constructing exhibition booths), settling compensation or other civil proceedings, participating in product orientation, and attending short-term seminars or other business meetings". They are prohibited from taking up employment or study in the territory, or from [...] "establishing or joining in any business". The last provision means that non-residents may not commence operating a business while in Hong Kong, and thus will be refused permission for <b>business</b> <b>registration</b> by the Inland Revenue Department unless it can be proven that the business began operation while they were outside of Hong Kong. However, the Companies Registry permits non-residents to incorporate limited liability companies and to be appointed as corporate directors (though not as corporate secretaries).|$|E

2500|$|The Singapore High Court has quashed a {{decision}} when it found, among other things, that the decision-maker {{had not taken}} into account relevant considerations. In Tan Gek Neo Jessie v. Minister for Finance (1991), the applicant had registered a clothing business called [...] "JC Penney Collections". Three years later, she was ordered by the Registrar of Businesses to alter her business name to one that did not mention [...] "JC Penney" [...] {{on the ground that}} the name was that of an American company, J.C. Penney Company Inc., which had registered two [...] "Penneys" [...] trademarks in Singapore. The Registrar relied on section 11 of the <b>Business</b> <b>Registration</b> Act, which stated that the Registrar was entitled to cancel the registration of a business name that [...] "so nearly resembles the name of any corporation or the name under which another person carries on business as to be calculated to mislead" [...] if the business owner failed to change the name within six weeks from being requested to do so. The Court noted that the Registrar had placed much reliance on the trademarks registered by J.C. Penney, but had failed to consider the following facts: first, J.C. Penney had not used the trademarks on any goods in Singapore; secondly, the registration of the trademarks had expired and did not appear to have been renewed; and thirdly, the applicant herself had not used [...] "JC Penney" [...] or [...] "Penneys" [...] as a trademark on any items she sold. Thus, by ordering the applicant to change her business name, the Registrar had accorded to J.C. Penney more rights than it was entitled to under the law relating to trademark infringement and the tort of passing off.|$|E

40|$|The Productivity Commission has {{released}} two companion reports, benchmarking business regulation across jurisdictions: {{one on the}} Quantity and Quality of Regulation, {{the other on the}} Cost of <b>Business</b> <b>Registrations.</b> The first report provides indicators of the stock and flow of regulation and regulatory activities, and quality indicators for a range of regulatory processes, across all levels of government. The indicators provide some baseline information for each jurisdiction, against which trends in {{the quantity and quality of}} regulation might be assessed in the future. It is apparent that there are significant differences across jurisdictions, reflecting different regulatory approaches as well as the characteristics of the jurisdictions themselves. This second report provides estimates of compliance costs for business in obtaining a range of registrations required by the Australian, state, territory and selected local governments. The registrations include generic requirements for incorporation, taxation and <b>business</b> name <b>registrations.</b> In addition, the Commission benchmarked specific registration costs incurred for five types of business (a café, builder, long day child care, real estate agent and winery). It emerged that the estimated time costs of <b>business</b> <b>registrations</b> were generally relatively low, with most costs and differences across jurisdictions relating to fees and charges. These reports are the first instalment of a series of studies benchmarking Australian business regulation across jurisdictions. They have also served to test the usefulness of different survey techniques and benchmarking indicators and provided lessons for future exercises. In particular, the <b>business</b> <b>registrations</b> study highlighted the potential challenges in obtaining adequate data from individual businesses. The reports should facilitate a more informed discussion about comparative performance and help jurisdictions identify where they might improve their regulatory performance. benchmarking, business regulation, compliance costs, regulatory processes, regulatory performance...|$|R

The practice has been criticised by many groups who argue that the benefit encourages people to drive more (thus increasing CO2 emissions), reduces government tax revenues, distorts economic competition, and may work to neutralise other government programs and objectives.|$|R
