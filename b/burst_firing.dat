50|$|D5 receptors may be {{involved}} in <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> of subthalamic nucleus neurons in 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease. In this animal model, blockage of D5 receptors with flupentixol reduces <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> and improves motor deficits. Studies show that DRD5 T978C polymorphism is not associated with the susceptibility to PD, nor with the risk of developing motor fluctuations or hallucinations in PD.|$|E
50|$|At {{the base}} of the theory lies diminished {{excitatory}} or increased inhibitory input at the thalamic level. This leads to a switch of the thalamocortical neurons from tonic to <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> and subsequently entrains thalamic and cortical areas with pathological oscillations at around 5 Hz.|$|E

50|$|An {{improved}} {{variant of}} the AEK-971 with a new trigger mechanism with {{the location of the}} thumb safety-selector lever on the right side, receiving additionally a three-shot <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> mode, and an extended padded retractable lightweight stock. When the stock is retracted, the shoulder rest connects with the pistol grip forming a streamlined structure which allows the weapon to be used without hampering <b>fire</b> capabilities. The <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> accuracy of the 5.45×39mm AEK-971S is two times higher than that of the 5.45×39mm AK-74M assault rifle.|$|R

50|$|A modern {{battery of}} six guns, each firing 43 kg {{projectiles}} with a <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> speed of four rounds per minute, can deliver over a metric tonne of ordnance per minute {{for up to}} four minutes. This is an immense weight of fire, which can be delivered with very high accuracy.|$|E
50|$|T-type {{channels}} play {{a secondary}} pacemaker role in neurons that have resting membrane potential between -90 and -70 mV {{as they have}} {{an important role in the}} genesis of <b>burst</b> <b>firing.</b> An excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) opens the channels, thus generating a LTS. The LTS triggers Na+-dependent action potentials and activates high-voltage activated calcium channels.|$|E
50|$|Voltage-dependent calcium {{channels}} can {{be distinguished}} based on their voltage-dependence, deactivation, and single-channel conductance. Low-voltage-activated calcium channels {{are referred to as}} 'T' type because their currents are both transient, owing to fast inactivation, and tiny, owing to small conductance. T-type channels are thought to be involved in pacemaker activity, low-threshold calcium spikes, neuronal oscillations and resonance, and rebound <b>burst</b> <b>firing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Commercial 7.5×54mm [...] "French" [...] {{ammunition}} made {{in countries}} other than France for current distribution {{have been known}} to produce <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> (2 or 3 rounds at a time) because of more sensitive primers. The original heavy steel firing pins on the MAS-49 and 49/56 can be replaced by commercial titanium firing pins which are much lighter and generally cure the problem of <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> on these weapons. It is also possible to prevent these slamfires by shortening the firing pin by approximately 0.5 mm, or by modifying the bolt to accommodate a firing pin return spring.|$|R
50|$|It is {{designed}} as a special operations and personal defence weapon (PDW). It has compensator openings cut into {{the end of the}} barrel to vent gases and make the weapon more stable during automatic <b>burst</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{machine pistol}} is {{typically}} a handgun-style, magazine-fed, self-loading firearm, capable of fully automatic or <b>burst</b> <b>fire,</b> and chambered for pistol cartridges. The term is a literal translation of Maschinenpistole, the German {{term for a}} hand-held automatic weapon firing pistol cartridges.|$|R
50|$|The {{neuronal}} {{cells that}} allow for the transfer of PGO waves from the pons to {{the other parts of}} the brain reside on the rostral portion of the peribrachial area. This grouping of cells fire in precisely two modes. The first mode is <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> through low-threshold Calcium (Ca2+) ion channels. The other mode is a repetitive tonic firing through Sodium (Na+) dependent ion channels.|$|E
50|$|Neither the God Helmet, nor {{technologies}} {{derived from}} it, {{are examples of}} transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which uses magnetic fields {{on the order of}} one million times stronger than those used in Persinger's lab. Despite this, Persinger reports similar effect sizes with his apparatus. The magnetic fields employed in TMS and in Persinger's experiments are also very different. TMS uses single, paired, and repetitive pulses of high intensity to penetrate the cranium. In contrast, Persinger's apparatus uses weak complex magnetic signals patterned after physiological processes, such as one derived from limbic <b>burst</b> <b>firing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There are {{excitatory}} glutamatergic afferents {{that arise}} from most structures that project into the VTA. These glutamatergic afferents {{play a key role}} in regulating VTA cell firing. When the glutamatergic neurons are activated, the firing rates of the dopamine neurons increase in the VTA and induce <b>burst</b> <b>firing.</b> Studies have shown that these glutamatergic actions in the VTA are critical to the effects of drugs of abuse. In contrast, the tVTA (also known as the RMTg) projects to the VTA with GABAergic afferents, functioning as a [...] "master brake" [...] for the VTA dopamine pathways.|$|E
50|$|In {{many games}} the weapons {{featured}} can be <b>fired</b> in <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> or single shot fire modes. Modifying a controller or keyboard/mouse {{to gain the}} advantage of having a faster firing weapon than the standard player {{can be considered a}} method of cheating.|$|R
25|$|The {{fire control}} selector, with its lever {{located on the}} left side of the {{receiver}} wall, enables fully automatic fire (lever in the “C”-marked position), semi-automatic fire (“P”) and 3-round <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> mode (“S”). The selector can be operated with the safety either engaged or disabled.|$|R
30|$|A spark {{caused by}} {{a failure of the}} {{electrical}} systems in the garage makes <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> and soon the garage is filled with dense smoke. The high level of smoke triggers the fire alarm that immediately reaches the nearest fire department to activate the necessary reliefs.|$|R
50|$|Bursting, or <b>burst</b> <b>firing,</b> is an {{extremely}} diverse general phenomenon of the activation patterns of neurons in {{the central nervous system}} and spinal cord where periods of rapid action potential spiking are followed by G0 phase quiescent periods. Bursting is thought to be important in the operation of robust central pattern generators, the transmission of neural codes, and some neuropathologies such as epilepsy. The study of bursting both directly and in how it takes part in other neural phenomena has been very popular since the beginnings of cellular neuroscience and is closely tied to the fields of neural synchronization, neural coding, plasticity, and attention.|$|E
50|$|The PLZ-52 is a 155mm / 52 caliber tracked {{self-propelled}} howitzer {{similar in}} appearance to the PLZ-45, {{but based on}} a slightly different hull. Having a gross vehicle weight of 43 tonnes, the PLZ-52 features a new powerpack, which consists of a diesel engine developing 1,000 hp at 2,300 rpm coupled to a fully automatic transmission. This gives a maximum road speed of up to 65 km/h and an operational range up to 450 km. The PLZ-52 howitzer has a maximum firing range of 53 km (with ERFB-BB-RA projectiles), maximum firing rate of eight rounds per minute, a <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> rate of three rounds per fifteen seconds, and a multiple-round simultaneous impact capability of four rounds.|$|E
50|$|The MP5A4 (fixed stock) and MP5A5 (sliding stock) models, {{which were}} {{introduced}} in 1974, are available with four-position trigger groups. The pistol grips are straight, lacking the contoured grip and thumb groove of the MP5A1, MP5A2, and MP5A3. The selector lever stops are marked with bullet pictograms rather than letters or numbers (each symbol represents the number of bullets that will be fired when the trigger is pulled and held rearward with a full magazine inserted in the weapon) and are fully ambidextrous (the selector lever is present {{on each side of}} the trigger housing). The additional setting of the fire selector, one place before the fully automatic setting, enables a two or three-shot <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> mode.|$|E
50|$|The {{fire control}} selector, with its lever {{located on the}} left side of the {{receiver}} wall, enables fully automatic fire (lever in the “C”-marked position), semi-automatic fire (“P”) and 3-round <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> mode (“S”). The selector can be operated with the safety either engaged or disabled.|$|R
5000|$|A novel {{feature is}} the grip safety, which locks the trigger and the bolt in the closed position, thus {{safeguarding}} against accidental firing if the grip is not held firmly or if the gun is dropped. The safety and fire-selector switch, which in the original Model 12 were two separate push-pin button (with the fire-selector being a button that activated single-fire or <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> whether it was pushed {{on the right side}} or the left side) have been re-engineered in a modern lever-type selector with three positions (S for [...] "Sicura" [...] or Safety, 1 for Single-fire, R for [...] "Raffica" [...] or <b>Burst</b> <b>fire).</b> The fixed firing pin {{on the face of the}} bolt can strike the primer only when the cartridge is chambered fully, and this also avoids accidental firing, according to its designers.|$|R
50|$|The MSBS-5.56 is a {{selective}} fire modular assault rifle which {{is capable of}} semi-automatic <b>fire,</b> 3-round <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> and fully automatic fire. The MSBS-5.56K and MSBS-5.56B have a cyclic rate of fire of around 700-900 rounds per minute (RPM). They have many common interchangeable parts and can be converted {{from one to the}} other.|$|R
5000|$|The handgun {{comes in}} two varieties. The [...] "M" [...] (Militär, military) variant is selective-fire (semi-auto/three-round bursts). The [...] "Z" [...] (Zivil, civilian) variant is a {{semi-automatic}} only version, {{and although it}} has no provision to mount the stock, it can be fitted after minor alterations to the handgrip. Four hundred VP70Zs were made in 9×21mm IMI; these samples were made primarily for the civilian market of Italy, where {{the use of the}} 9×19mm Parabellum is permitted only to military and law enforcement agencies. All of the VP70Z pistols sold to Italy had the provision to mount the stock, although it would still not allow the use of the three-round <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> mode.|$|E
5000|$|The M4 carbine was {{developed}} from various outgrowths of these designs, including {{a number of}} 14.5 in-barreled A1 style carbines. The XM4 (Colt Model 727) started its trials in the mid-1980s, with a barrel of 14.5 in. Officially adopted {{as a replacement for}} the M3 [...] "Grease Gun" [...] (and the Beretta M9 and M16A2 for select troops) in 1994, it was used with great success in the Balkans and in more recent conflicts, including the Afghanistan and Iraq theaters. The M4 carbine has a three-round <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> mode, while the M4A1 carbine has a fully automatic firing mode. Both have a Picatinny rail on the upper receiver, allowing the carry handle/rear sight assembly to be replaced with other sighting devices.|$|E
50|$|However, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the LTS are all-or-none events due to the regenerative nature of the phenomenon. As with the action potentials that follow them, LTS vary little in amplitude or shape at different holding potentials. This dictates that suprathreshold depolarizing inputs do not affect the amplitude and only factor into the initial activation of the LTS. The amount of de-inactivation determines the conductance of Ca2+ channels and is the main factor {{that contributes to the}} amplitude of LTS. It has also been suggested that the activity of delayed rectifier K+ channels can affect the amplitude of LTS. <b>Burst</b> <b>firing</b> caused by LTS are therefore thought to be used as on/off signaling as opposed to tonic firing which is graded and more responsive to the intensity of depolarizing inputs.|$|E
50|$|The lightest of the {{new designs}} were not capable of {{sustained}} automatic fire, as {{they did not have}} water jackets and were fed from comparatively small magazines. Essentially machine rifles with a bipod, weapons like the Lewis Gun, Chauchat and the Madsen were portable by one soldier, but were made for single and <b>burst</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Trejo pistol has a {{blowback}} {{action with}} unlocked firing from a closed bolt. It {{is designed for}} <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> rather than full-auto because of limited magazine capacity. At the {{time when it was}} introduced to the Mexican market, there were no laws against fully automatic capabilities in small calibers like the [...]22 Long Rifle.|$|R

50|$|The English word '{{flamethrower}}' is a loan-translation of , {{since the}} modern flamethrower was first invented in Germany. The first flamethrower, {{in the modern}} sense, is usually credited to Richard Fiedler. He submitted evaluation models of his Flammenwerfer to the German Army in 1901. The most significant model submitted was a man-portable device, consisting of a vertical single cylinder 4 ft long, horizontally divided in two, with pressurized gas in the lower section and flammable oil in the upper section. On depressing a lever the propellant gas forced the flammable oil into and through a rubber tube and over a simple igniting wick device in a steel nozzle. The weapon projected a jet of fire and enormous clouds of smoke some 20 yd. It was a single-shot weapon—for <b>burst</b> <b>firing,</b> a new igniter section was attached each time.|$|E
50|$|The GABAergic neurons of the {{pars reticulata}} spontaneously fire action potentials. In rats, the {{frequency}} of action potentials is roughly 25 Hz. The purpose of these spontaneous action potentials is to inhibit targets of the basal ganglia, and decreases in inhibition are associated with movement. The subthalamic nucleus gives excitatory input that modulates the rate of firing of these spontaneous action potentials. However, lesion of the subthalamic nucleus leads to only a 20% decrease in pars reticulata firing rate, suggesting that the generation of action potentials in the pars reticulata is largely autonomous, as exemplified by the pars reticulata's role in saccadic eye movement. A group of GABAergic neurons from the pars reticulata projects to the superior colliculus, exhibiting {{a high level of}} sustained inhibitory activity. Projections from the caudate nucleus to the superior colliculus also modulate saccadic eye movement.Altered patterns of pars reticulata firing such as single-spike or <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> are found in Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|Richard Fiedler was a German {{scientist}} {{who invented the}} modern flamethrower. This is a weapon that projects a stream of ignited liquid, usually oil. He submitted evaluation models of his Flammenwerfer to the German Army in 1901. The most significant model submitted was a man-portable device, consisting of a vertical single cylinder 4 feet (1.2 m) long, horizontally divided in two, with pressurized gas in the lower section and flammable oil in the upper section. On depressing a lever the propellant gas forced the flammable oil into and through a rubber tube and over a simple igniting wick device in a steel nozzle. The weapon projected a jet of fire and enormous clouds of smoke some 20 yards (18 m). It was a single-shot weapon - for <b>burst</b> <b>firing,</b> a new igniter section was attached each time it was used for battle or other uses of any sorts. It was first used in the western front.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes and {{implements}} {{the concept}} of wireless DC motor drives, which can achieve the abilities of selective driving and controllable speed. Due to different resonant frequencies of the multiple energy receivers of the associated DC motor drives, the transmitter can be purposely tuned to the specified resonant frequency which matches with the specified receiver, hence driving the specified motor selectively. In the meantime, the <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> control is used to regulate the operating speed of the motor working at the resonant frequency, hence retaining the maximum power transmission efficiency. Both finite element analysis and experimentation are given to verify {{the validity of the}} proposed wireless DC motor drive system. For exemplification, three different resonant frequencies, namely 60 kHz, 100 kHz and 140 kHz, are selected to energize three DC motors. Under the <b>burst</b> <b>fire</b> control method, the speed of each motor can be regulated separately and the wireless power transfer (WPT) system can achieve the measured power transmission efficiency of about 60 %...|$|R
50|$|On 17 September, the Razakars {{arrived at}} the dead {{of the night in}} country boats and encircled the entire village. On the early morning of 18 September between 4 AM and 5 AM, a group of Pakistani {{soldiers}} arrived at Krishnapur from Astagram camp in Kishoreganj. The Pakistani contingent arrived in two speedboats in two groups. One group of soldiers alighted from the boat and started firing indiscriminately as they entered the village. The other group patrolled around the village the speedboat. At this time, the Razakars too began to fire as they entered the village and started looting. They went from door to door and robbed the villagers of their cash and jewellery at gunpoint. The Pakistani soldiers, incited by the Razakars, set fire to all the houses of the village. Then they rounded up 130 men in front of the Kamalamayee High School.
