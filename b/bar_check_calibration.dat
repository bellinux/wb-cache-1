The SPC charts secondary objective was not completed due to schedule constraints. It is hoped that this effort will be readdressed and completed in the near future...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} calibration {{errors of}} Goldmann applanation tonometers in ophthalmic clinics of Brasília, Brazil, and correlate the findings with {{variables related to}} tonometers model and utilization. METHODS: Tonometers from ophthalmic clinics in Brasília, Brazil, were <b>checked</b> for <b>calibration</b> errors. A standard Goldmann applanation tonometer checking tool was used to asses the calibration error. Only one trained individual made all verifications, with a masked reading of the results. Data on the model, age, daily use, frequency of <b>calibration</b> <b>checking</b> {{and the nature of}} the ophthalmic department - private or public - were collected and correlated with the observed errors. RESULTS: One hundred tonometers were <b>checked</b> for <b>calibration.</b> Forty seven percent (47 / 100) were out of 1 mmHg range at least at one point checking. Tonometers mounted to slit lamp, with less than 5 years, used in less than 20 patients daily, that had a <b>calibration</b> <b>check</b> on a yearly basis, and those from private office exhibit a lower rate of inaccuracy, but only the first variable was statistically significant. Sixty one percent of tonometers on public hospitals were out of calibration.

40|$|The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{recognizes that}} one of the {{greatest}} technical challenges to the implementation of the new Basel II Accord lies on the validation of the banks’ internal credit rating models (CRMs). This study investigates new proposals of statistical tests for validating the PDs (probabilities of default) of CRMs. It distinguishes between proposals aimed at <b>checking</b> <b>calibration</b> and those focused at discriminatory power. The proposed tests recognize the existence of default correlation, deal jointly with the default behaviour of all the ratings and, differently to previous literature, control the error of validating incorrect CRMs. Power sensitivity analysis and strategies for power improvement are discussed, providing insights on the trade-offs and limitations pertained to the calibration tests. An alternative goal is proposed for the tests of discriminatory power and results of power dominance are shown for them with direct practical consequences. Finally, as the proposed tests are asymptotic, Monte-Carlo simulations investigate the small sample bias for varying scenarios of parameters. ...|$|R

Methods This cross-sectional study included 31 professionals of a coronary care unit (86 % of the Nursing staff in the unit). Of these, 38. 7 % of professionals were nurses and 61. 3 % nurse technicians. A validated questionnaire was used to theoretical evaluation and for practice assessment the auscultatory technique was applied in a simulation environment, under a non-participant observation. Results To the theoretical knowledge of the stages of preparation of patient and environment, 12. 9 % mentioned 5 -minute of rest, 48. 4 % <b>checked</b> <b>calibration,</b> and 29. 0 % chose adequate cuff width.
