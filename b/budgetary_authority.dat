The purpose of the project is to study ways of ensuring that off-budget and tax expenditures do not impair the proper functioning of the budget. Four functions of the budget are involved: ● The authorisation function: that all money spent from the public treasury be subject to legislative authorisation. ● The allocative/distributive function: 2 that the <b>budgetary</b> <b>authorities</b> (executive and legislative branches) be able to compare and trade off all changes in expenditures and revenues. ● The macroeconomic function: that the <b>budgetary</b> <b>authorities</b> (executive an...|$|R

The literature on enlargement is pessimistic about the effects of enlargement, especially when dealing with EU funds where member states are expected to fight more.

40|$|Beyond {{traditional}} arguments {{justifying the}} introduction of fiscal rules, this paper analyses their potential contribution to an indirect budgetary coordination between the member countries of a monetary union. Indeed, thanks to appropriate fiscal penalties, the noncooperative and decentralized equilibrium could {{get closer to the}} optimal equilibrium where the <b>budgetary</b> <b>authorities</b> cooperate. Our macroeconomic model shows that whatever penalty on the structural budgetary deficit would be optimal in case of asymmetric shocks. A moderate penalty on the excessive indebtedness level would be optimal in “normal times,” or in case of asymmetric shocks if openness to trade and price flexibility are sufficiently high, whereas the share of public consumption in GDP, taxations rates, and indebtedness levels is sufficiently weak in the monetary union. Besides, in case of symmetric shocks, a fiscal penalty would be useful to decrease the excessive budgetary activism, even if it doesn’t allow reaching the optimal and first-best equilibrium. Furthermore, the fiscal penalty should always be an increasing function of the share of public consumption in GDP and of taxation rates but a decreasing function of the strength of automatic stabilizers, of openness to trade, and of price flexibility in the member countries of the monetary union...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{consensus on}} the role of central banks has eroded. The pursuit of the goal of price stability only is now insufficient to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability. A new paradigm emerges in which central banks should ensure price stability, growth and financial stability. Recent institutional developments of the ECB go in this direction since it will {{be in charge of the}} micro-prudential supervision. In addition, the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area shows that the ECB also remained attentive to the evolution of economic growth. But if the ECB implements its triple mandate, the question of the proper relationship between these missions still arises. Coordination between the different actors in charge of monetary policy, financial regulation and fiscal policy is paramount and is lacking in the current architecture. Besides, certain practices should be clarified. The ECB has played a role as lender of last resort (towards banks and, to a lesser extent, towards governements) although this mission was not allocated to the ECB. Finally, in this new framework, the ECB suffers from a democratic illegitimacy, reinforced by the increasing role it plays in determining the macroeconomic and financial balance of the euro area. It seems important that the ECB is more explicit with regard to its different objectives and that it fulfils the conditions for close cooperation with the <b>budgetary</b> <b>authorities</b> and financial regulators. Finally, we call for the ex nihilo creation of a supervisory body of the ECB, which responsibility would be to discuss and analyze the relevance of the ECB monetary policy...|$|R
