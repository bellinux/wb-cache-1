5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one missile launcher. They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E

5|$|In February 2015, {{a credit}} dispute between {{universal}} primer technology and DNA barcoding came to light. Verma {{has argued that}} DNA barcoding, a technique independently described by zoologist Paul D N Hebert in 2003, {{is essentially the same}} as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to assign the identity of an unknown biological sample to a particular species. Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> credited. However, Hebert argued that he was not aware of UPT because its patents were not visible to the broader scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filing in 2001 to grant in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{is common}} among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It {{has sometimes been}} observed in natural populations, where {{about a quarter of}} male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E

50|$|Greenops {{average size}} is about 1 to 1.5 in. They <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> common trilobites, and are easily identified. While {{it is rare}} to find a {{complete}} disarticulated body, segments and tails <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> common. They <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> common finds in Late Devonian limestones, especially storm deposits. They are identified by their tails, which sport several spines. They were medium to small sized trilobites, which were most likely preyed upon by ammonoids, straight cephalopods, sharks, and small placoderms, hence the defensive spines. All of these animals {{have been found in}} close association with this trilobite. Greenops can also be found in deep marine deposits, but there it <b>is</b> <b>fairly</b> rare. Greenops <b>was</b> a small, yet charmingly beautiful trilobite, like its close companion Phacops.|$|R

5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes {{in place of a}} foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will <b>be</b> <b>fairly</b> consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E
