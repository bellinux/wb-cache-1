25|$|As {{a general}} statement, one {{may say that}} {{whenever}} the classical equations of motion are integrable (e.g. rectangular or circular <b>billiard</b> <b>tables),</b> then the quantum-mechanical version of the billiards is completely solvable. When the classical system is chaotic, then the quantum system is generally not exactly solvable, and presents numerous difficulties in its quantization and evaluation. The general study of chaotic quantum systems is known as quantum chaos.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{during the}} long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, <b>billiard</b> <b>tables</b> were narrowed, with wooden pins or {{skittles}} {{at one end of}} the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as bagatelle.|$|E
500|$|Another {{factor in}} the decline was the change in Dawson City, which had {{developed}} throughout 1898, metamorphosing from a ramshackle, if wealthy, boom town into a more sedate, conservative municipality. Modern luxuries were introduced, including the [...] "zinc bath tubs and pianos, <b>billiard</b> <b>tables,</b> Brussels carpets in the hotel dining rooms, menus printed in French and invitational balls" [...] noted by historian Kathryn Winslow. The visiting Senator Jerry Lynch likened the newly paved streets with their smartly dressed inhabitants to the Strand in London. It was no longer as attractive a location for many prospectors, used to a wilder way of living. Even the formerly lawless town of Skagway had become a stable and respectable community by 1899.|$|E

500|$|Mechanization was {{gradually}} introduced to make most {{aspects of the}} industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine. The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860, powered by a single line shaft running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing, planing and dressing. In 1859, John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter, then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate. The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization, and continued {{to be done with}} a mallet and chisel. An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of [...] "slab", thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes, for example flooring, tombstones and <b>billiard</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Walter {{himself was}} born on 29 August 1898 in the Western Australian mining town of Kalgoorlie. He lost {{the tip of his}} index finger on his right hand in an {{accident}} in 1901, and his father taught him to play billiards left-handed. Much of his childhood was spent practising billiards for up to twelve hours per day, under his father's tutelage on his two <b>billiard</b> <b>tables</b> in the Palace Hotel in Kalgoorlie, and also guided by William (Billy) Weston, a former New Zealand Billiard Champion, who owned a billiard saloon at the corner of Brookman and Wilson Streets in Kalgoorlie. Standing on a crate to reach the table, Lindrum was [...] "polished" [...] by Weston, who taught him the technique of playing , a method to increase [...] The family were itinerant, and often moved from town to town. Lindrum's first professional game was played at the age of only 13 years.|$|E
40|$|Caustics are curves {{with the}} {{property}} that a billiard trajectory, once tangent to it, stays tangent after every reflection at {{the boundary of}} the <b>billiard</b> <b>table.</b> When the <b>billiard</b> <b>table</b> is an ellipse, any nonsingular billiard trajectory has a caustic, which can be either a confocal ellipse or a confocal hyperbola. Resonant caustics [...] -the ones whose tangent trajectories are closed polygons [...] - are destroyed under generic perturbations of the <b>billiard</b> <b>table.</b> We prove {{that none of the}} resonant elliptical caustics persists under a large class of explicit perturbations of the original ellipse. This result follows from a standard Melnikov argument and the analysis of the complex singularities of certain elliptic functions. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

2500|$|Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, {{for centuries}} Saddleworth was a centre of woollen cloth {{production}} in the domestic system. Following the Industrial Revolution, in the 18th and 19th centuries, Saddleworth became a centre for cotton spinning and weaving. By the end of Queen Victoria's reign, mechanised textile production had become {{a vital part of}} the local economy. One of the most famous mills, based in Friezland, was the Royal George Mill owned by the Whitehead family and manufactured felt used for many purposes including pianofortes, <b>billiard</b> <b>tables</b> and flags. The three brothers, Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead, James Heywood Whitehead and Francis Frederick Whitehead who owned the Mill were extremely philanthropic and amongst other bequests in the 1850s built Christ Church in Friezland along with the Parsonage, School and Headmaster's house.The land on which these were built was purchased in 1849 from L. & N.W. Railway Company. Christ Church, Friezland is still thriving today whilst the Church School has been rebuilt and the beguiling Parsonage and grounds, built in the Gothic Revival style, has become a Grade II listed building and as [...] "Friezland Grange" [...] is now in private hands. The boom in industry called for greater transport links, including the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and several railways.|$|E

40|$|Defocusing {{mechanism}} {{provides a}} way to construct chaotic (hyperbolic) billiards with focusing components by separating all regular components of the boundary of a <b>billiard</b> <b>table</b> sufficiently far away from each focusing component. If all focusing components of the boundary of the <b>billiard</b> <b>table</b> are circular arcs, then the above separation requirement reduces to that all circles obtained by completion of focusing components are contained in the <b>billiard</b> <b>table.</b> In the present paper we demonstrate that a class of convex tables [...] asymmetric lemons, whose boundary consists of two circular arcs, generate hyperbolic billiards. This result is quite surprising because the focusing components of the asymmetric lemon table are extremely close to each other, and because these tables are perturbations of the first convex ergodic billiard constructed {{more than forty years}} ago...|$|R

60|$|Forrest {{closed the}} door and went on along a passage that was like a tunnel. Narrow, iron-barred openings, like the slits for archers in medieval castles, dimly lighted the way.

60|$|One {{of these}} was a mere boy of {{nineteen}} or twenty, who, though it was yet barely ten o'clock, was drinking gin-and-water, and smoking a cigar--amusements to which, judging from his inflamed countenance, he had devoted himself pretty constantly {{for the last year}} or two of his life. Opposite him, engaged in stirring the fire with the toe of his right boot, was a coarse, vulgar young man of about thirty, with a sallow face and harsh voice; evidently possessed of that knowledge of the world, and captivating freedom of manner, which is to be acquired in public-house parlours, and at low <b>billiard</b> <b>tables.</b> The third tenant of the apartment was a middle-aged man in a very old suit of black, who looked pale and haggard, and paced up and down the room incessantly; stopping, now and then, to look with great anxiety out of the window as if he expected somebody, and then resuming his walk.|$|E
60|$|After {{divine service}} on {{election}} Sunday I {{went to the}} Croix Blanche for my coffee, {{to pass the time}} till the voting should begin. On the church door was posted a printed summons to the electors, and on the café <b>billiard</b> <b>tables</b> I found ballots of the different parties scattered. Gendarmes had also distributed them about in the church pews; they were enclosed in envelops, which were voted sealed. On a table before the pulpit the ballot-box--a glass urn--was placed; and beside it sat the judges of election, with lists of the registered voters. But in any precinct of the canton an elector who could prove that he had not voted at home might deposit his ballot in any other. The church bell rang for the people to assemble, and the voting began and ended in perfect quiet. But I could not witness an election of this ancient republic, where Freedom was so many centuries old, without strong emotion; it had from its nature and the place the consecration of a religious rite.|$|E
