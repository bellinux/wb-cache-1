25|$|The {{convertible}} {{featured a}} removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass window.

The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready <b>body</b> <b>assembly</b> as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|E
