50|$|Hall 1 {{was located}} on {{the eastern end of}} the site, and survived as the most clearly defined of the post-built structures. 26 ft (7.9m) in length and 13 ft 6in (4.1m) in breadth, there are gaps in the south and east side walls, {{suggesting}} the existence of two doorways. No hearth was found, although a patch of <b>burnt</b> <b>sand,</b> 2 ft (0.6m) in diameter, was found in the centre of the hall. No objects were found within the building, although four were uncovered from the post-holes: a Roman bronze coin from the era of Emperor Valens, a flat iron strip, a flat palette and a fragment of a pottery spindle-whorl.|$|E
50|$|Hall 2, {{which was}} {{probably}} {{the largest of the}} structures, was located on the crest of the hill, surrounded by SFBs. 32 ft (9.75m) in length and 14 ft (4.27m) in width, there was a partition down {{the eastern side of the}} building, creating a chamber 8 ft (2.44m) wide. East of the hall's centre was a patch of <b>burnt</b> <b>sand,</b> marking the position of a hearth. The position of the doorway is not entirely clear, although excavators believed that it was most likely on the south side, close to the partitioning wall. Items discovered in Hall 2 included a Roman bronze coin from the era of the Emperor Victorinus, bronze and iron strips, a bone pin, fragments of both glass and a loomweight, as well as a variety of iron objects, including a knife, nail, plate and key.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA Roman glass {{workshop}} situated {{near the}} German-Dutch {{border in the}} vicinity of the modern village of Goch-Asperden has been investigated archaeomagnetically. Archaeological evidence including potsherds, coins and fragments of glass vessels suggests that the workshop was in use from shortly before 400 CE to the first third of the 5 th century CE, though from archaeological point of view the period of operation cannot have covered more than a few years. The archaeomagnetic directions of the two superimposed glass furnaces are well defined while a feature of <b>burnt</b> <b>sand</b> gave relatively scattered directions. The mean direction of the upper furnace agrees well with that of the <b>burnt</b> <b>sand</b> but the results from the lower furnace are significantly different. This difference is likely to be due to a tilting of the lower furnace because of the sandy foundation. Archaeointensities obtained from classical Thellier and multiple-specimen paleointensity domain-state corrected experiments are in good agreement between methods as well as between the furnaces. This supports the hypothesis for contemporaneity of the furnaces. Archaeomagnetic dating evidence is in good agreement with the archaeological age indicators but is not able to refine it further. The well dated and reliable archaeomagnetic full vector contributes to the archaeomagnetic database of Europe...|$|E

Stucco {{is a composite}} material made of <b>burnt</b> limestone, <b>sand</b> and plant extracts [6]. Lithobiontic biofilms comprise a range of organisms including bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, filamentous fungi and yeasts. In the tropics, cyanobacteria are often the dominant organisms within biofilms [7].|$|R

5000|$|Thinking {{outside the}} box, Lytle {{came across a}} {{different}} style of painting. Using acrylics, she paints mostly in reverse {{on the back of}} 2 to 5 conservation grade acrylic sheets. The images then show through the front. Some of the surfaces are then scraped, <b>burnt,</b> scored, or <b>sanded,</b> depending on the effect needed. When assembled with space between, all sheets are visible from the front. This gives the viewer the opportunity to look into the piece, like into the looking glass. Most of her subjects depict ice or water. The result is engaging and different.|$|R
40|$|The oolitics {{formation}} of green sand {{is a significant}} composition which effects the sand property greatly. However the oolitics mechanism {{has not yet been}} clarified. Therefore in this study, we made green <b>sand,</b> <b>burnt</b> it to 1473 K, peeled off the oolitics which had adhered using a rammer, and observed the mechanism of oolitics formation. The results showed that oolitics adhered at 873 K are easy to peel off and those over 1073 K are difficult. The results also showed that the CO 2 process core sand increases oolitics and the core sand using organic binder decreases the {{formation of}} oolitics...|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built from 1903 to 1905. The house is made of tabby, a {{homemade}} concrete like mixture of <b>burnt</b> shell, ashes, <b>sand,</b> shell and water.

40|$|This project {{worked to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of the steel casting industry by reducing the variability that occurs because of process and product variation. The project focused on the post shakeout operations since roughly half of the production costs are in this area. These improvements will reduce the amount of variability, making it easier to manage the operation and improve the competitiveness. The reduction in variability will also reduce the need for many rework operations, which will result in a direct reduction of energy usage, particularly by the reduction of repeated heat treatment operations. Further energy savings will be realized from the reduction of scrap and reduced handling. Field studies were conducted at ten steel foundries that represented the U. S. steel casting industry, for a total of over 100 weeks of production observation. These studies quantified the amount of variability, and looked toward determining the source. A focus of the data collected was the grinding operations since this is a major effort in the cleaning room, and it represents the overall casting quality. The grinding was divided into two categories, expected and unexpected. Expected grinding is that in which the location of the effort is known prior to making the casting, such as smoothing parting lines, gates, and riser contacts. Unexpected grinding, which was approximately 80 % of the effort, was done {{to improve the}} surfaces at weld repair locations, to rectify <b>burnt</b> on <b>sand,</b> and other surface anomalies at random locations. Unexpected grinding represents about 80 % of the grinding effort. By quantifying this effort, the project raised awareness within the industry and the industry is continuing to make improvements. The field studies showed that the amount of variation of grinding operations (normalized because of the diverse set of parts studied) was very consistent across the industry. The field studies identified several specific sources that individually contributed to large process variation. This indicates the need for ongoing monitoring of the process and system to quantify the effort being expended. A system to measure the grinding effort was investigated but did not prove to be successful. A weld wire counting system was shown to be very successful in tracking casting quality by monitoring the quantity of weld wire being expended on a per casting basis. Further use of such systems is highly recommended. The field studies showed that the visual inspection process for the casting surface was a potentially large source of process variation. Measurement system analysis studies were conducted at three steel casting producers. The tests measured the consistency of the inspectors in identifying the same surface anomalies. The repeatability (variation of the same operator inspecting the same casting) was found to be relatively consistent across the companies at about 60 - 70 %. However, this is still are very large amount of variation. Reproducibility (variation of different operators inspecting the same casting) was worse, ranging between 20 to 80 % at the three locations. This large amount of variation shows that there is a great opportunity for improvement. Falsely identifying anomalies for reworking will cause increased expense and energy consumption. This is particularly true if a weld repair and repeated heat treatment is required. However, not identifying an anomaly could also result in future rework processing, a customer return, or scrap. To help alleviate this problem, casting surface comparator plates were developed and distributed to the industry. These plates are very inexpensive which enables them to be provided to all those involved with casting surface quality, such as operators, inspectors, sales, and management...|$|R
