5|$|When players deal enough {{damage to}} an enemy, they can {{activate}} an execution sequence. Once the execution sequence has been initiated, enemies {{involved in the}} execution are highlighted automatically with colors by the game, and players can perform a series of quick time events by pressing the appropriate buttons. These execution sequences serve to grant additional resources to players, depending on how well the execution is performed. At any time prior to initiating an execution, the player can select one of four categories of executions to perform upon weakened enemies; the selected type of execution determines the type of resource that will be granted when an enemy is executed. Upon completing a successful execution sequence, players are granted the type of execution that was selected. There are four perks available for players. One boosts the player's damage {{for a short period}} after the execution; one refills the player's Focus bar; one allows players to regain lost health, and the last significantly boosts the amount of experience points received from the kill. These experience points can be used to purchase upgrades for various attributes, such as health, damage, or Focus <b>bar</b> <b>capacity,</b> and to unlock additional execution moves. The game still automatically completes and finishes these execution sequences when players fail to press the highlighted buttons, but provides a much smaller reward. Lining up two or more weakened enemies in close proximity allows the player to perform a double execution sequence, which greatly increases the reward granted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the Behaviosite paradigm, a new {{approach}} to affecting the behavior of distributed agents in a multiagent system, which is inspired by biological parasites with behavior manipulation properties. Behaviosites are special kinds of agents that “infect ” a system composed of agents operating in that environment. The behaviosites facilitate behavioral changes in agents to achieve altered, potentially improved, performance of the overall system. Behaviosites need to be designed so that they are intimately familiar with the internal workings of the environment and of the agents operating within it, and behaviosites apply this knowledge for their manipulation, using various infection and manipulation strategies. To demonstrate and test this paradigm, we implemented a version of the El Farol problem, where agents {{want to go to a}} bar of limited capacity, and cannot use communication to coordinate their activity. Several solutions to this problem exist, but most yield near-zero utility for the agents. We added behaviosites to the El Farol problem, which manipulate the decision making process of some of the agents by making them believe that <b>bar</b> <b>capacity</b> is lower than it really is. We show that behaviosites overcome the learning ability of the agents, and increase social utility and social fairness significantly, with little actual damage to the overall system, and none to the agents. ...|$|E

From sustainable development, a need arise of using materials for compaction under given conditions that would normally be avoid due to unpredictable pathologies. The application of compaction on fine grained soils, without a change of gravimetric water content, lead to very important modifications of the void ratio and hence suction. Therefore the hydro-mechanical behaviour of fine grained soil need to be rendered around three variables: suction, void ratio, saturation degree or water content. The <b>barring</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soil is assessed through Penetrometers (In-situ manual penetrometer, CBR) {{in order to assess}} gains through compaction.

The calculated nitrogen and carbon contents in {{the bulk of}} the PEI- 10 k/MPS sorbent were similar to the XPS results measured {{on the surface of the}} foam, suggesting that the PEI was homo-geneously distributed throughout the MPS support. After CO 2 adsorptionthe N 1 s peak was bro-adened and could be resolved into two components: a high binding energy component (~ 401 eV) and a lower binding energy one (396 eV), respectively. The former nitrogen states are consistent with a protonated amine, presumably, due to carbamate formation. The lower binding energy component (~ 396 eV) could possibly be due to strongly chemisorbed CO 2. The maximum sorption capacity was about 4 mmole CO 2 /g sorbent at 85 ˚C and 1 <b>bar.</b> This <b>capacity</b> was doubled by raising the CO 2 pressure to 24. 95 bars.
