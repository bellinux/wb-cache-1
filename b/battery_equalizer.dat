40|$|With {{the global}} {{increase}} in the number of vehicles, environmental protection and energy issues had become increasingly prominent. People paid more and more attention to the electric vehicle as the future direction of the vehicle, but because the battery technology was relatively backward, it had become the bottleneck in the development of electric vehicles. So in the existing conditions, a perfect battery Monitoring technology had become more and more important. This paper firstly analyzed the characteristics of lithium battery residual capacity and effect factors, then put forward to a set of solutions according to the actual situation. The solution of the lithium battery Monitoring system adopted distributed structure, including detection of voltage, current, temperature and measurement module and the realization of monomer <b>battery</b> <b>equalizer</b> module. Using a single bus device DS 2438 produced by DALLAS on the battery voltage, current, temperature, power and other parameters, the system controlled DS 2438 by the STC 89 C 52 single-chip in data acquisition. Then it used the algorithm to predict state of charge(SOC) and displayed the battery status in the LCD 1602. This solution of the lithium battery Monitoring systemÂ  was reliable, economy, strong anti-interference ability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental verification}} {{of the impact}} of individual battery equalization on battery life and performance. A study of two battery systems, one equipped with PowerCheq <b>equalizers,</b> a new <b>battery</b> equalization device, and one without, was conducted over 450 charge and discharge cycles simulating an electric scooter drive routine. The data clearly shows that the batteries equipped with the PowerCheq devices (individual <b>battery</b> <b>equalizers)</b> outperformed those with no equalization as well as those employing string equalization. In fact, the <b>battery</b> without the <b>equalizers</b> reached its end of life (80 % of initial capacity) after 140 drive cycles while the one with the equalizers lasted more than 450 drive cycles, thus tripling battery life. The use of modular, real-time individual <b>battery</b> <b>equalizers</b> allows <b>batteries</b> to stay equalized during charge as well as discharge cycles thus improving battery life and longevity.

40|$|Due {{to the low}} cost, small size, {{and ease}} of control, the switched-capacitor (SC) <b>battery</b> <b>equalizers</b> are {{promising}} among active balancing methods. However, {{it is difficult to}} achieve the full cell equalization for the SC equalizers due to the inevitable voltage drops across Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) switches. Moreover, when the voltage gap among cells is larger, the balancing efficiency is lower, while the balancing speed becomes slower as the voltage gap gets smaller. In order to soften these downsides, this paper proposes a cell-to-cell battery equalization topology with zero-current switching (ZCS) and zero-voltage gap (ZVG) among cells based on three-resonant-state SC converters. Based on the conventional inductor-capacitor (LC) converter, an additional resonant path is built to release the charge of the capacitor into the inductor in each switching cycle, which lays the foundations for obtaining ZVG among cells, improves the balancing efficiency at a large voltage gap, and increases the balancing speed at a small voltage gap. A four-lithium-ion-cell prototype is applied to validate the theoretical analysis. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed topology has good equalization performances with fast equalization, ZCS, and ZVG among cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{stringent}} cost targets for electric, hybrid electric, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs, HEVs and PHEVs), a serious improvement in battery cycle-life and safety is undoubtedly essential. More recently, lithium batteries, in the form of lithium-ion, lithium-polymer or lithium iron phosphate have been profoundly explored. Despite critical research initiatives, lithium-based batteries have not yet been able to meet the steep energy demands, long lifetime and low cost, unique to vehicular propulsion applications. One of the most practical techniques of improving overall performance is to use suitable power electronics intensive cell voltage equalizers in conjunction with on-board energy storage devices. There have been some interesting developments in this area during the last few years, but cost constraints and high current specifications have prevented the complete deployment of this versatile technology. The purpose of this thesis is to introduce a novel configuration for a cell voltage equalizer, with the potential of fulfilling the expectations of low cost, high current-capability, and high efficiency. This thesis consists of six parts: the first part deals with an introduction to the battery problems in electric vehicle applications; the second part deals with a review of the available popular cell equalizer configurations; the third part deals with an economic and feasibility analyses of <b>battery</b> cell <b>equalizers.</b> Thereafter, a detailed analysis of the proposed novel <b>battery</b> cell <b>equalizer</b> configuration is presented, comparing the theoretical models, modeling and simulation results, and prototype measurements. A separate chapter is discusses {{from the point of view}} of power electronic converter control, considering practical issues. Finally, the thesis discusses the major motivating inferences drawn from this work, and suggests possible future directions and trends, based on those conclusions...|$|R
