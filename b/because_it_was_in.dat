5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the line {{has been converted}} to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the way of a new road.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the legislators}} would become {{prominent}} figures during the territorial years of Oregon. At first {{the body was}} a small committee of nine people, but the group was altered when the Organic Laws of Oregon were revised in 1845 with the legislative branch of the Provisional Government becoming the Oregon House of Representatives {{with a minimum of}} 13 members. Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> conflict with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E

25|$|A {{right-handed}} top order batsman, Lill {{was good}} enough to tour New Zealand in 1959/60 with the Australian national cricket team. He played two matches against New Zealand but they weren't given Test status. This was <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> effect a 'Second XI', with the first choice players given a rest after back to back tours of India and Pakistan. Lill fared poorly in his four innings, scoring 1, 15, 6 and 0.|$|E

25|$|The New York Constitution {{states that}} {{whenever}} {{the governor is}} out of state, the lieutenant governor becomes acting governor. Since there was no clear line of succession, it was unclear who would have become acting governor, which is a situation the Governor attempted to avoid. Paterson did not leave the state from June 8 until {{the resolution of the}} crisis, which required him to skip several events, including {{the annual meeting of the}} National Governors Association in July, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a transit}} of the Earth and Moon across the Sun {{as seen from}} Saturn/Titan just hours before the landing. Huygens entered the upper layer of Titan's {{atmosphere}} 2.7 hours {{after the end of}} the transit of the Earth, or only one or two minutes {{after the end of the}} transit of the Moon. However, the transit did not interfere with the Cassini orbiter or Huygens probe, for two reasons. First, although they could not receive any signal from Earth <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> front of the Sun, Earth could still listen to them. Second, Huygens did not send any readable data to the Earth; it transmitted data to the Cassini orbiter, which relayed the data received to the Earth later.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 {{the family}} left Arvier {{to work on}} the other side of the Alps, as most Valdotainians did at that time. The wish for a better life is a likely {{explanation}} but does not suggest why they travelled so far, almost to the Belgian border. Speculation surrounds the move, possibly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> secret. To emigrate needed authority and mayors had been told by the sub-prefect of Aoste to refuse or at least make permission difficult. If the family travelled separately, it would explain the legend that Maurice, then 14, was exchanged for a round of cheese: it could have been payment to a guide to lead him clandestinely over the mountains or payment in return for custody of the son.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s they {{prepared}} {{plans for the}} Milleara Estate (also known as City View) at Avondale Heights, and the Ranelagh Estate at Mount Eliza, in conjunction with surveyors Tuxen and Miller. During the financial hardship of the Depression in the 1930s Griffin was commissioned to design incinerators; Willoughby Incinerator in the Sydney suburb of Willoughby {{is a good example}} of this work and was only one of twelve designed between 1930 and 1938. It has been listed by the National Trust and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects as a building of significance. In 1999 it was listed in the New South Wales State Heritage Register. The Walter Burley Griffin Incinerator in Ipswich, Queensland is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and has been converted into a theatre. Another incinerator was built in the suburb of Pyrmont, not far from the centre of Sydney. This incinerator was considered for heritage listing but was demolished in 1992 <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> irredeemably bad condition. Another two surviving incinerators are also located in the Adelaide suburbs of Hindmarsh Incinerator and Thebarton.|$|E
500|$|Lewis entered Baron Byng High School in September 1924. [...] He {{soon became}} friends with A.M. (Abe) Klein, who became one of Canada's leading poets. [...] He also met Irving Layton, another future {{prominent}} Canadian writer, to whom he acted as political mentor. [...] Baron Byng High School was predominantly Jewish <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the heart of Montreal's non-affluent Jewish community, and was ghetto-like because Jews were forbidden from attending many high schools.|$|E
500|$|The London Power Company's {{first of}} these super power {{stations}} was planned for the Battersea area, on the south bank of the River Thames in London. The proposal was made in 1927, for a station built in two stages and capable of generating 400 megawatts (MW) of electricity when complete. The site chosen was a [...] plot of land which had been {{the site of the}} reservoirs for the former Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. The site was chosen for its proximity to the River Thames for cooling water and coal delivery, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the heart of London, the station's immediate supply area.|$|E

500|$|Dixon was {{enamored of}} the {{technique}} of binaural recording, and used it extensively on the album. Easter recalled that Dixon [...] "made this sort of fake binaural head out of a cardboard box and stuck two microphones in it" [...] to record the group. In Easter's opinion the method made drummer Bill Berry's parts [...] "fresher sounding". Binaural recording also allowed bassist Mike Mills' backing vocals to be loud without covering up Stipe's lead vocals. Dixon explained, [...] "Mike Mills was often singing 12 to 15 {{feet away from the}} microphones that were recording his part, but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a studio binaural field, we would tend to hear him as behind [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Edward II {{gave the}} castle to his half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton, the Earl of Norfolk. Records show that Framlingham was only {{partially}} furnished around this time, {{although it is}} unclear if this was <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> limited use, or because fittings and furnishings were moved from castle to castle with the owner as he traveled, or if the castle was simply being refurnished. The castle complex continued to thrive, however, and on Thomas' death in 1338 the castle passed first to his widow, Mary, and then in 1362 into the Ufford family. William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk, held the castle during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, {{with much of the}} revolt occurring close to Framlingham. From the Uffords, the castle passed first to Margaret Brotherton, the self-styled [...] "Countess-Marshall", and then to Thomas de Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk. The Mowbrays seem to have used Framlingham Castle as their main seat of power for most of the 15th century.|$|E
500|$|In November 2014, one {{day after}} current Apple Inc.

In September 2015, Apple became the subject of an investigation by officials in Kirov for implementing emoji on its operating systems which depict same-sex relationships, over whether they may constitute a promotion of non-traditional sexual relationships to minors. Roskomnadzor later ruled that by themselves, emoji depicting same-sex couples did not constitute a violation of the propaganda law, as whether they have a positive or negative connotation depends on their actual context and usage.|$|E

500|$|Following his San Francisco sojourn, Divine {{returned}} to Baltimore {{and participated in}} Waters's next film Pink Flamingos. Designed by Waters to be [...] "an exercise in poor taste," [...] the film featured Divine as Babs Johnson, a woman who claims to be [...] "the filthiest person alive" [...] and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary). In one scene, the Marbles send Babs a turd in a box as a birthday present, {{and in order to}} enact this scene, Divine defecated into the box the night before. Filmed in a hippie commune in Phoenix, Maryland, the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines, although all of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand. The final scene in the film proved particularly infamous, involving Babs eating fresh dog feces; Divine later told a reporter, [...] "I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole," [...] waiting for it to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. The scene {{became one of the most}} notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that [...] "I run around doing it all the time. I've received boxes of dog shit– plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it's what I want to talk about." [...] In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement that one time <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the script.|$|E
500|$|The team wrote each {{character}} to embody a game protagonist archetype; Michael embodies greed, Franklin ambition and Trevor insanity. Houser felt Michael and Trevor were written to juxtapose each other, with Michael [...] "like the criminal {{who wants to}} compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time" [...] and Trevor [...] "the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He considered that the three lead characters helped move the game's story into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising {{through the ranks of}} a criminal underworld. Ned Luke portrayed Michael, Shawn [...] "Solo" [...] Fonteno portrayed Franklin and Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor. Fonteno first became aware of the acting job through his friend DJ Pooh, who worked on San Andreas and was involved in Grand Theft Auto Vs music production. When Luke's agent advised him of the casting call, he initially did not want to audition for the part <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a video game. After reading the audition material and learning more about the project, he became interested. He reflected, [...] "I went immediately after reading the material from 'I'm not doing it' to 'nobody else is doing it'. It was just brilliant". During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Luke, which he felt helped secure them the roles. [...] "When [...] and I went in the room together we immediately had something", he explained. While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was not until they signed contracts that they learnt it was a Grand Theft Auto title.|$|E
