2500|$|For a {{lighting}} ballast, the ANSI [...] ballast {{factor is}} used in North America to compare the light output (in lumens) of a lamp operated on a ballast compared to the lamp operating on an ANSI reference <b>ballast.</b> <b>Reference</b> ballast operates the lamp at its ANSI specified nominal power rating. [...] The ballast factor of practical ballasts {{must be considered in}} lighting design; a low ballast factor may save energy, but will produce less light. [...] With fluorescent lamps, ballast factor can vary from the reference value of 1.0.|$|E
5000|$|Ballast Factor (BF): Compares {{the ratio}} of light output of a lamp working by a {{specific}} ballast to the light output of the same lamp working by a standard <b>reference</b> <b>ballast.</b> The BF is given in the ballast manufacturer data.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} study the {{vibration}} isolation performance of floating-slab track (FST), three track models are developed with different slab lengths. The ratio of root sum square of the force transmitted to the infrastructure to an assumed harmonic load on the rail is used as the criterion to evaluate vibration isolation performance for the FST. The {{results show that the}} FST has good ability to isolate the vibration transmitted from the track to the infrastructure, compared with the <b>reference</b> (<b>ballasted)</b> track. As expected, the lower the natural frequency of the slab-bearing system, the better vibration isolation performance. It is also found that the force transmitted to the infrastructure through the FST with short slab decays more rapidly along the track than [it does] through that with the long slab at low and higher frequencies. In addition, the perform-ance of the FST with medium length slab is greatly affected by the dynamic behaviour of the slab. Moreover, the FST shows different vibration isolation performance when the load acts at different positions relative to the slab...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a {{numerical}} model capable {{to predict the}} electromagnetic response of railway ballast aggregates under different physical conditions has been calibrated and validated by a simulation-based approach. The ballast model {{is based on the}} main physical and geometrical properties of its constituent material and it is generated by means of a random-sequential absorption (RSA) approach. A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulator is then employed to calculate the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) signal response to the scenario. The calibration of the model has been performed by taking into account the main physical properties and the grain size characteristics of both the <b>reference</b> <b>ballast</b> material and a fine-grained pollutant material, namely, an A 4 soil type material, according to the AASHTO soil classification. The synthetic GPR response has been generated by using the gprMax freeware simulator. Several scenarios have been considered, which in turn were reproduced in laboratory environment and used for the validation of the model. Promising results have demonstrated the high potential of such approach in characterizing the simulated response of complex coarse-grained heterogeneous materials...|$|R
5000|$|The {{trackbed}} remains remarkably intact, {{although some}} {{is now on}} private land. The most convenient {{place to start is}} near Coalville's Morrisons outlet (at [...] ) where the trackbed into Whitwick has been made a public right of way. This footpath meanders {{along the edge of the}} Hermitage Lake (a former clay quarry), past the modern leisure centre and then under the South Street bridge before passing the Whitwick station building and platform (although unfortunately the platform is unkempt and overgrown). This footpath along the trackbed ends at a T-junction just after Whitwick station, while the line went straight on over another bridge. The trackbed is less clear here, as it is now under someone's garden, who has carried out many alterations. At the other side of the garden however, the trackbed still retains its original ballast and is in remarkably good condition for a short distance, passing through an area known as 'Happy Valley', until the growth of vegetation starts again. It is still clear where it went, but less easy to follow due to vegetation. The line still has <b>ballast</b> here. For <b>reference,</b> we are now passing under Whitwick's [...] "Dumps Road" [...] bridge. The trackbed is still obvious here, yet it becomes less clear as we pass through Thringstone. Alterations to the surroundings make it hard to tell. The trackbed can be readily picked up near Thringstone Wood, which will take you across the aforementioned viaduct, and bring you past the priory and to the edge of a missing bridge, and a busy road below. The bridge here was demolished in 1967. Across this gap, the trackbed continues and soon turns into private land owned by a nearby farm. Large parts of the trackbed are used by the farm as roads for their machinery, though it is still an obvious railway trackbed (there is no ballast here). West of Shepshed the trackbed has been converted to a footpath, popular with dog walkers and boys practicing their skills on mountain bicycles. The footpath starts at Charnwood Road in Shepshed (...) and finishes in a dead-end about 2 km to the west (...) [...] In places along the way, derelict remains of the Charnwood Forest Canal can be identified ...|$|R
