50|$|On 3 October 1916 William Tritton, {{about to}} be knighted for {{developing}} the Mark I, proposed to the Tank Supply Committee that a faster and cheaper tank, equipped with two engines like the Flying Elephant, should be built to exploit gaps that the heavier but slow tanks made, an idea that up till then had been largely neglected. This was accepted on 10 November {{and approved by the}} War Office on 25 November. At that time the name for the project was the Tritton Chaser. Traditionally the name Whippet is attributed to Sir William himself. Actual construction started on 21 December. The first prototype, with a revolving turret taken from an Austin armoured car — the first for a British tank design, as Little Willie's original turret was fixed — was ready on 3 February 1917 and participated (probably without one) in the tank trials day at Oldbury on 3 March. The next day, in a meeting with the French to coordinate allied tank production, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces Field Marshal Haig ordered the manufacture of two hundred vehicles, the first to be ready on 31 July. Although he was acting beyond his authority, as usual, his decisions were confirmed in June 1917. The first production tanks left the factory in October and two were delivered to the first unit to use them, F Battalion of the Tank Corps (later 6th Battalion), on 14 December 1917. In December 1917 the order was increased from 200 to 385 but this was later cancelled in favour of more advanced designs, the Medium Mark <b>B,</b> <b>Medium</b> Mark C and Medium Mark D.|$|E
40|$|The {{examination}} of 6, 938 clinical specimens {{collected during the}} period January 1991 through December 1992 suggested that the Isolator blood culture system (Wampole) inhibited growth of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC) in BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium.</b> Of 162 MAC blood culture isolates, 94 % were recovered from Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium, while only 50 % were recovered from 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium.</b> The time to detection with LJ medium was 18 days, while that with 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> was 24 days. In contrast, 62 % of the 305 MAC nonblood culture isolates were recovered from the LJ medium, while 87 % {{were found in the}} 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium.</b> The time to detection for these cultures was also reversed, i. e., 28 days for LJ medium versus 15 days for 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium.</b> Dilution studies using the lysis-anticoagulant reagent from Isolator tubes demonstrated inhibition of both clinical and American Type Culture Collection strains of MAC, even at low concentrations of lysis-anticoagulant reagent. Washing the Isolator blood sediment prior to inoculating the 12 B bottles eliminated any growth inhibition. Clinical and experimental data suggest that the use of the Isolator blood culture tube with the BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> is contraindicated for mycobacterial blood cultures...|$|E

40|$|INTENDED USE BACTEC NAP TB Differentiation Test {{is a test}} to {{differentiate}} the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from other mycobacteria. Principal use is with the BACTEC 460 TB System instrument. BACTEC NAP (ρ-nitro-α-acetylamino-βhydroxy-propiophenone) TB Differentiation Test is recommended for use with BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>Medium</b> for rapid differentiation of the TB complex (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum and M. microti) from mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis (MOTT). This test {{should be used in}} conjunction with bacterial morphology on smear and growth characteristics in BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>Medium.</b> SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>Medium</b> does not allow observation of colonial morphology, however, the GI output can be characteristic for certain species of mycobacteria. M. tuberculosis and M. bovis exhibit slow growth with a 2 to 3 fold increase in the daily GI output while other mycobacteria (MOTT bacilli) may show daily increases as high as 10 fold. Visually, M. tuberculosis growth in BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>Medium</b> displays small specks or clumps with a clear medium. Other mycobacteria grow in very small particles and may give slight turbidity to the medium.

By HPLC, the half-life of amoxicillin (trihydrate and sodium) in combination with clavulanate in nonradiolabelled 7 H 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> was 6. 7 days, whereas the half-life of clavulanate in combination with amoxicillin was 2. 0 days. By bioassay, the half-lives of amoxicillin trihydrate and clavulanate in radiolabelled 7 H 12 <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> were comparable (7 and 2 days, respectively) to those determined by HPLC. When clavulanate was tested alone, the half-life {{was determined to be}} 1. 88 days by HPLC and 1. 87 days by bioassay. The relatively short half-life of clavulanate can be adjusted by a procedure of "topping up," or adding one-half the concentration of clavulanate every second day, in order to allow accurate amoxicillin-clavulanate MIC testing with the BACTEC mycobacterial susceptibility system...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{addition}} of 1. 2 % gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate {{has been shown to}} enhance detection of certain bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. Therefore, we studied BACTEC 6 <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> with and without gelatin in 6, 833 paired comparisons {{to examine the effects of}} supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. More aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6 B than in the 6 B-gelatin medium (P less than 0. 001), especially staphylococci (P less than 0. 01), Escherichia coli (P less than 0. 01), other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0. 05), and Acinetobacter spp. (P less than 0. 05).

40|$|BACTEC ™ PZA Test Medium (Middlebrook 7 H 12 Broth, pH 6. 0) is {{specially}} {{developed to}} perform susceptibility testing with Mycobacterium tuberculosis against pyrazinamide (PZA). Principal use {{is with the}} BACTEC ™ 460 TB instrument. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The BACTEC Radiometric Technique is used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of primary anti-mycobacterial drugs (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol). 1 - 4 In this technique, 14 CO 2 produced by mycobacteria from the metabolism of the 14 C-labeled substrate present in BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>Medium</b> is quantitatively measured. If an antimicrobial {{is added to the}} medium, mycobacterial isolates which are susceptible to the antimicrobial are inhibited and the amount of 14 CO 2 generated is reduced. Butler and co-workers 5 proposed an improved conventional method for susceptibility testing of PZA that required a special 7 H 10 Agar Medium at pH 5. 5. A limitation of this method is that at a pH of 5. 5, many isolates of M. tuberculosis either fail to grow or grow poorly. BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>Medium</b> cannot be used for susceptibility testing of PZA since this drug is active only at lower pH values. 5 Heifets et al. suggested a radiometric method for testing PZA susceptibility by using BACTEC 12 <b>B</b> <b>Medium</b> at pH 5. 5.

Equal volumes of each specimen were inoculated into BACTEC 6 B and 16 B media. The 16 <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> contained adsorbent and cationic resins for neutralizing {{the effects of the}} drugs. Of the 621 sets drawn, there were 72 positive cultures in 16 B and 52 positive cultures in 6 B. In 23 cases the organism was detected only in the 16 <b>B</b> <b>medium,</b> and in 3 cases the organism was detected in 6 B only. The remaining 49 positives were detected in both culture bottles. In 13 of these 49 cultures, detection in 16 B was made between 1 and 5 days earlier than in 6 B, whereas 3 of 49 specimens were detected 1 day earlier in 6 B; the remaining 33 cultures became positive at approximately the same time in both media. There were a total of 43 patients with positive cultures in this study. Of these patients, 28 had sepsis detected in both the 16 B and 6 B media. The 6 <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> alone detected an additional three cases of sepsis, and the 16 B resin medium alone identified 12 additional cases.

40|$|The {{relation}} of salmonella isolation efficiency {{and the size}} of inoculum introduced from a buffered peptone water culture of sewage polluted water into strontium chloride <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> was investigated. Two separate studies were made, one using enrichment at 37 degrees C, the other at 43 degrees C. From these trials, two inocula suitable for efficient salmonella isolation were determined. Using this information, strontium chloride <b>B</b> <b>medium</b> was compared with modified Rappaport's broth (R 25). The inoculum used with R 25 was 0. 005 ml, determined in an earlier study. Two incubation temperatures were employed with strontium chloride enrichment (37 and 43 degrees C). Rappaport's medium was incubated at 37 degrees C only. Elevated temperature enrichment at 43 degrees C improved the performance of strontium chloride B, but Rappaport's broth still gave significantly better results. This supports earlier studies on simplification of salmonella isolation and standardization of routine technique on a single enrichment medium: Rappaport broth (R 25) incubated at 37 degrees C...|$|E
