Accordingly, design used for weighing is called chemical <b>balance</b> (two <b>pans)</b> weighing design and spring <b>balance</b> (one <b>pan)</b> weighing design.

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) {{accounts}} for {{a substantial amount of}} the water flux in the arid and semi-arid regions of the World. Accurate estimation of ET has been a challenge for hydrologists, mainly because of the spatiotemporal variability of the environmental and physical parameters governing the latent heat flux. In addition, most available ET models depend on intensive meteorological information for ET estimation. Such data are not available at the desired spatial and temporal scales in less developed and remote parts of the world. This limitation has necessitated the development of simple models that are less data intensive and provide ET estimates with acceptable level of accuracy. Remote sensing approach can also be applied to large areas where meteorological data are not available and field scale data collection is costly, time consuming and difficult. In areas like the Rift Valley regions of Ethiopia, the applicability of the Simple Method (Abtew Method) of lake evaporation estimation and surface energy balance approach using remote sensing was studied. The Simple Method and a remote sensing-based lake evaporation estimates were compared to the Penman, Energy <b>balance,</b> <b>Pan,</b> Radiation and Complementary Relationship Lake Evaporation (CRLE) methods applied in the region.

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} power measurement, worldwide accepted, standard is the IEC 61161, presently in its 2 nd edition (2006), but under review. To fulfil its requirements, considering that a radiation force balance {{is to be}} used as {{ultrasonic power}} detector, a large amount of raw data (mass measurement) shall be collected as function of time to perform all necessary calculations and corrections. Uncertainty determination demands calculation effort of raw and processed data. Although it is possible to be undertaken in an old-fashion way, using spread sheets and manual data collection, automation software are often used in metrology to provide a virtually error free environment concerning data acquisition and repetitive calculations and corrections. Considering that, a fully automate ultrasonic power measurement system was developed and comprehensively tested. A 0, 1 mg of precision balance model CP 224 S (Sartorius, Germany) was used as measuring device and a calibrated continuous wave ultrasound check source (Precision Acoustics, UK) was the device under test. A 150 ml container filled with degassed water and containing an absorbing target at the bottom was placed on the <b>balance</b> <b>pan.</b> Besides the feature of automation software, a routine of power measurement simulation was implemented.

40|$|An Assaying Balance {{from the}} First Halfof the 19 th Century at the University ofTartu History MuseumThe University of Tartu History Museum’s {{collection}} of older analytical balances also includes an assaying balance probably {{from the first}} half of the 19 th century. The balance belonged to the Tartu State University department of inorganic chemistry and was handed over to the historymuseum in 1982, where it was first displayed in the same year during the exhibition of science history commemorating the 350 th anniversary of the University of Tartu. According to the lore of the department the assaying balance had once belonged to Carl Ernst Heinrich Schmidt (1822 – 1894), who was once a chemistry professor at the University ofTartu and had worked for the University in 1847 – 1892. The balance is placed inside a birch wood box finished with red lacquer and with the measurements of 14. 0 x 24. 5 x 2. 7 cm. The balance is complete and in working order. Six of the lighter weights are missing from the set of milligram weights that should consist of 16 pieces by regulation. The largest weight is 1, 000 milligrams, the smallest was 0. 1 mg. Two small separate and gilded <b>balance</b> <b>pans</b> have alsosurvived. The balance is assembled on top of the box of the balance. The balance beam is 17. 8 cm long, the pointer of the balance is 8. 0 cm long. The steel knife-edge bearing of the balance beam is supported by the steel bearing seat. The pointer of the balance faces upward and reaches the dioptric needle. The back of the vane is covered with milk glass. The balance beam is made of brass, the pointer of steel. The diameter of the <b>balance</b> <b>pans</b> is 3. 3 cm and depth 0. 3 cm. The <b>balance</b> <b>pans</b> are suspended from three silk threads. The length of the silk thread from the balancepan to the fastening hook is 11. 0 cm. The balance is suspended from a lifting mechanism that enables to lift the balance up for the time of weighing. The  balance may be lifted and lowered with the aid of a string; one end of it is attached to the coil fastened to the top of the balance box from whence the string runs through two sheaves, whilethe other end is fastened to the lifting mechanism holding the balance. The balance is equipped with a damper that reduces vibration. The balance has been measured in detail so that it would be possible to compare it with other similar balances elsewhere. The forerunner of this balance type is W. F. Lingke, master at the Freiberg Mining Institute’s portable assaying balance made in 1827 (Harkort’s scale). The balance belongs to Harkort’s blowpipe kit along with other items necessary for analyses. A balance made somewhat later by the same master which is nearly identical but equipped with abalance damper is called Plattner’s scale and it is placed in a separate balance box. Both balances have a pointer and a vane with a needle facing upwards. The description and drawing of a scale with a balance damper were published in the first volume of K. F. Plattner’s monograph published in 1835 (Die Probierkunst mit dem Lötrohre). The third andcomplemented issue of Plattner’s monograph (1853) includes a drawing of a balance made by the same master, which shows that a significant change has been made to the construction of the balance: the scale pointer and vane with the needle are facing downwards. Balances made later by the same company (see Burchard, The History and Apparatusof Blowpipe Analysis) have downward-facing scale pointer and the needle of the vane is replaced with a scale with divisions. Proceeding from the changes in the construction of balances we may presume that our assaying balance, the pointer of which faces upwards and which has a vane, could have been made before 1853. The dimensions of our balance and Plattner’s scale practically coincide. This article provides an overview of the developmental history of assaying balances, using a selection of contemporary overviews on that subject as well as available and more important original sources pertaining to assaying balances for that purpose. The drawings, descriptions and other information on scales are based on Georgius Agricola’s De re metallica libri XII (seventh volume of the 1974 German publication); Lazarus Ercker’s Der grosse Probierbuch von 1580 and Johann Andrea Cramer’s Anfangsgründe der Probierkunst published in 1746 and 1794.

40|$|Changing land-use {{and climate}} may alter {{emissions}} of biogenic isoprene, a key ozone (O 3) precursor. Isoprene {{is also a}} precursor to peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) and thus affects partitioning among oxidized nitrogen (NO y) species, shifting the <b>balance</b> towards <b>PAN,</b> which more efficiently contributes to long-range transport relative to nitric acid (HNO 3) which rapidly deposits. With a suite of sensitivity simulations in the MOZART- 2 global tropospheric chemistry model, we gauge {{the relative importance of}} the intercontinental influence of a 20 % increase in North American (NA) isoprene and a 20 % decrease in NA anthropogenic emissions (nitrogen oxides (NO x), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and NO x + NMVOC + carbon monoxide + aerosols). The surface O 3 response to NA isoprene emissions (ΔO 3 _ISOP) in surface air over NA is about one third of the response to all NA anthropogenic emissions (ΔO 3 _ANTH; although with different signs). Over intercontinental distances, ΔO 3 _ISOP is relatively larger; in summer and fall, ΔO 3 _ISOP in surface air over Europe and North Africa (EU region) is more than half of ΔO 3 _ANTH. Future increases in NA isoprene emissions could thus offset decreases in EU surface O 3 resulting from controls on NA anthropogenic emissions. Over the EU region, ΔPAN_ISOP at 700 hPa is roughly the same magnitude as ΔPAN_ANTH (oppositely signed). Outside of the continental source region, the percentage changes in PAN are at least twice as large as for surface O 3, implying that long-term PAN measurements at high altitude sites may help to detect O 3 precursor emission changes. We find that neither the baseline level of isoprene emissions nor the fate of isoprene nitrates contributes to the large diversity in model estimates of the anthropogenic emission influence on intercontinental surface O 3 or oxidized nitrogen deposition reported in the recent TF HTAP multi-model studies (TFHTAP, 2007) ...|$|R

[...] Regardless of the furnace programming, the sample is placed in a small, electrically heated furnace equipped with a thermocouple to monitor accurate measurements of the temperature by comparing its voltage output with that of the voltage-versus-temperature table stored in the computer’s memory.
