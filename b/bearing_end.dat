These modifications included tapered truncation of the thread crests and taper of the whole thread form {{for a portion of}} the nut length. The maximum stress in the bolt always occurred within one pitch of the load bearing face of the nut. Truncating threads increased the maximum bolt stresses.

The tests were carried out on five pad TPJ bear-ings with a diameter of 98. 6 mm (3. 8815 in), an L/d ratio of 0. 4, and a preload of 0. 3. The shaft rotational speed ranged from 3000 to 15, 000 rpm. Evacuation of the oil from the bearing cav-ity was achieved by enlarging the clearance of the <b>bearing</b> <b>end</b> seals. Steady state performance evaluation has been based on a comparison of the following operating parameters: relative bearing and shaft displacement bearing operating temperature, and power loss. Bearing operating temperatures and power loss have been significantly reduced as a result of oil evacuation. It has also been found that a reduction in the oil flow led to a lower power loss, most likely as a result of reduced churning loss. It has also been concluded that at a lower oil flow, oil evacuation led to a reduction in bearing stiffness and damping coefficients.

To solve these problems, this study proposes a high-pressure pre-tightening resin anchor with a compressed grouting body {{for use in}} soft and fractured rock surrounding a deep roadway. Using model experiments, we analyzed the anchorage performance of the proposed anchor and a conventional tensile-type anchor for three different values of the elastic modulus of the surrounding rock. The results showed that regardless of the surrounding rock type, the peak micro-strain (642 - 541) and displacement (6. 09 - 6. 5 mm) at the pull-out end of the proposed anchor were always smaller than the peak micro-strain (1433 - 1105) and displacement (8. 77 - 9. 2 mm) at the pull-out end of the conventional anchor. Furthermore, as the anchor's pre-tightening force increased from 20 kN to 120 kN, the anchor's strain remained concentrated over a length of 0. 4 m from the <b>bearing</b> <b>end.</b> Compared with conventional tensile-type anchors, the proposed high-pressure pre-tightening resin anchor with a compressed grouting body has a higher ultimate bearing capacity, allows the grouting length to be decreased to 0. 4 m, and provides initial support resistance...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of gas-lubricated journal bearings for microfabricated machines are performed with specialized tools. To maximize flexibility, an orbit method formulation is {{chosen for the}} primary tool. Its pseudospectral fluid equation solver enables run-time resolution adjustment while maintaining the efficiency advantage of spectral methods. A design framework is established for microfabricated bearings, including several new charts that reflect the unique constraints of MEMS. A duality between applied load and imbalance level is demonstrated and a method for experimentally determining appropriate loads for unknown imbalance is suggested. A large-amplitude whirling mode is shown to exist {{on both sides of}} the fixed-point threshold speed, in agreement with experimental observation. A quasi-static method for calculating shock tolerance is suggested and evaluated against unsteady simulations. Simulations of loads applied via non-circumferentially-uniform pressure at the <b>bearing</b> <b>end</b> are shown to increase the attitude angle and decrease the allowable nondimensional mass compared to the equivalent gravity-loaded case. Furthermore, the associated axial pressure gradients are shown to produce a hydrostatic stiffness via inertial effects. A nondimensional model is constructed for this stiffness and its dependence on various parameters is studied. It is shown that the load capacity advantage reported in the literature for noncircular bearings can be canceled by microfabrication constraints. The stability advantage, however, survives. Tapered axial clearance is shown to have an extremely deleterious effect on performance while bowed clearance proves less detrimental. Navier-Stokes solutions of infinite-length bearings with unity inertial parameters are performed using a second specially-built tool.

40|$|Polymer {{surfaces}} and interfaces {{are key to}} a number of technologically important areas: adhesion, lubrication, composites, etc. Surface and interfacial segregation have been shown to occur in polymer blends, polymer solutions, and block copolymers. In this work, the effect of polymer end groups on the surface and interface are examined. ^ Surface tension as a function of end group composition and molecular weight are studied in end functionalized poly(dimethyl siloxane), and found to depend on Mn- 1 and (γ e-γ r) where γ e and γ r are the surface energies of the end group and repeat unit. The interfacial tension between these materials and methanol or water also has an Mn- 1 dependence, but the end groups reorient to present the most energetically favorable species at the interface. Mean field lattice calculations support the experimentally observed trends and quantify the relative enthalpic and entropic contributions. ^ The surface of end fluorinated polystyrene is found to be highly enriched in the low energy end group. The surface induces an oscillating composition profile that propagates into the bulk in agreement with Fredrickson 2 ̆ 7 s mean field theory. The surface excess is predicted to go as Mn- 1 / 2, and this trend is observed experimentally. Surface rearrangement to expose the more energetically favored segments occurs in contact with saturated water vapor even below the glass transition temperature. The process has a (time) 1 / 2 dependence suggesting a diffusion controlled process. Diffusion coefficients and activation energies are calculated. The activation energies suggest that the process is related to the α and β relaxations of the polystyrene. ^ A fluorescence dequenching technique to monitor the interfacial reaction of two immiscible polymers <b>bearing</b> <b>end</b> groups capable of a specific interaction is investigated. While the experimental system did not have sufficient sensitivity to draw conclusions about the interfacial interaction, the technique shows promise for studying other systems that mimic reactive processing conditions. ^ End groups can significantly affect surface and interfacial properties. The effects must be understood as all polymers (except cyclic polymers) inherently have end groups that can change the surface or interfacial properties whether by default or design. These effects can potentially be exploited to accomplish desired goals. ...|$|E

40|$|Three field load {{tests of}} drilled shafts {{socketed}} in Burlington limestone were conducted using the Osterberg load cell. The objective {{of these tests}} was to compare the shaft capacities obtained from the field load tests with capacities predicted using analytical methods and with typi-cal presumptive design capacities. It was believed that the actual ca-pacities of the drilled shafts would be considerably greater than the capacities predicted from presumptive bearing capacity values. Based {{on the results of}} this testing, the following conclusions were drawn. Observed values of side resistance are comparable to the predicted val-ues obtained from empirical relationships. Observed values of <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> pressure greatly exceed the presumptive values of allowable bearing capacity commonly used for the design of shafts bearing on Burlington limestone.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to find a}} simple, {{practical}} and sufficiently accurate method for finding the natural frequencies of a propeller shaft assembly. The need for such methods is felt at the early design stages when sufficient data about the system is not available and the need to restrict the cost of analysis is of importance. Due to these facts {{it is clear that the}} methods based on the discretization of the continuum, which can estimate the natural frequencies accurately may not be advisable to go in for in the initial stages. [...] In the class of approximate methods, to which this work belongs, investigations done so far have crudely modelled the propeller, which was avoided in the present work. The propeller was considered to be a flexible rotor mounted with blades. [...] To solve the problem analysis was carried out in three parts. First the blade was studied for the natural frequencies, mode shapes, static deflections and the steady state stresses. The blade was assumed to be a cantilever and the results were cross-checked by a preliminary finite element analysis using beam elements. The assumption was found to be quite valid after doing the finite element analysis using 3 -D isoparametric 20 noded elements. For the airfoil blade effects of rotation, shear deflection, rotary inertia, pitch setting angle were taken into consideration. Second the shaft-rotor system was studied and the equation for the transverse vibrations was derived in the complex plane which was solved for the natural frequencies. Effects of forward and reverse whirl, fixed and simply supported forward <b>bearing</b> <b>end</b> conditions, tail shaft length variation, rotary inertia and shear deflection were investigated. Lastly the natural frequencies of the blades and the shaft-rotor system were coupled to give the resultant natural frequency of the propeller shaft assembly. The hydrodynamic effect has been taken into consideration by incorporating the added mass effects for the propeller. Two approximations for the natural frequency of the assembly were arrived at, the zeroth order and the first order. The true value of the frequency is supposed to lie in between the two limits. Effects due to change in the number of blades, blade geometry and the shaft parameters on the propeller shaft assembly were checked for. Agreement between the results obtained from the present work and with those available in the literature was found to be excellent. Finite element analysis comparisons also were very satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Current {{compression}} perpendicular-to-grain (c-perp) {{design values}} for wood members {{are based on}} mean stress using the ASTM D 143 specimen. Base design value, as determined from 0. 04 -in deformation in the ASTM specimen, is applied to all c-perp applications. While the standard ASTM test was presumably believed to adequately reflect relevant c-perp applications {{at the time it}} was developed (likely railroad cross-ties, wall plates and similar cross-sections), the specimen has limited applicability to many of today's c-perp bearing applications. Previous work has shown that wood-on-wood c-perp bearing is a more severe case as opposed to metal-on-wood <b>bearing.</b> <b>End</b> bearing conditions have been shown to represent a more severe c-perp loading scenario as opposed to load applied over central area. Research has shown that c-perp behavior of wood members is dependant on angle of applied load to annual ring orientation and that the most severe loading case is usually at an angle between 30 and 60 degrees to direction of applied load. Past studies also suggest that depth of member affects c-perp MOE and that higher aspect ratio may lead to instability of the member. As the c-perp behavior observed in the ASTM testing procedure is that of continually increasing stress with increasing deflection and densification, c-perp is generally believed to be serviceability rather than a life safety issue. However, in engineered wood applications, c-perp bearing may occur at areas where structural cohesiveness of a member is necessary to transmit forces through fasteners, such as truss plates. In such scenarios, c-perp has the potential to be a life safety issue. A study was designed to evaluate c-perp behavior of typical as-constructed assemblies in which members experience c-perp stresses near their longitudinal end through wood-on-wood contact. The study included both finite element analysis and experimental testing. Two as-constructed assemblies were evaluated in the study. These included assembly of the bottom chord of a truss bearing on the top plate of a wall (BC assembly) and assembly of the compression chord of a shear wall bearing on the bottom plate (BP assembly) of a wall. Finite element analysis modeled wood material as a composite with alternating earlywood and latewood layers with infinite radius of curvature. BC, BP and ASTM configurations were modeled both with load applied perpendicular and parallel to annual rings. Three BC assemblies were tested. These included BC- 2 X 4, BC- 2 X 8, and BC- 2 X 12, which had nominal 2 X 4, 2 X 8, and 2 X 12 members as bottom chord members, respectively. Therefore, within BC test assemblies aspect ratio of the bottom chord members varied greatly. The three BC geometries were each tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir top plate material. BP configuration was also tested with both Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir bottom plate material. For each test assembly, paired ASTM tests of the main member (bottom chord member in BC tests, and bottom plate member in BP tests) were conducted. Results were analyzed utilizing a variety of statistical methods. Finite element analysis revealed that strain was more uniform throughout depth of the bottom chord member when loaded perpendicular to annual rings than when loaded parallel to annual rings. In BC tests majority of deflection was found to occur in the bottom chord member. In BP test, the majority of deflection was found to occur within the bottom plate with only minimal deflection occurring in the longitudinally loaded compression chord. Due to varying assembly depths, 0. 04 -in, deflection was found to be a poor criterion for determining c-perp stress values. In order to account for assembly depth, stress values were based on system strain. As 0. 04 -in, deflection corresponds to two percent strain in the 2 -in, deep ASTM specimen, it was determined that stress determination be based on 2 -percent system strain. Due to large settlement effects observed in the tested wood-onwood assemblies, an offset strain was adopted as the method for determining and comparing stress values across differing assemblies and configurations tested. Within BC tests, the species of top plate material was not found to significantly affect assembly performance. This was due to the overwhelming influence of bottom chord behavior on system behavior. Within BP tests there was suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a significant difference between Douglas-fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir tests. It was recommended that further BP tests be conducted with larger sample sizes in order to determine the influence of wood species on c-perp behavior of bottom plate members. Mean stress values of BC and BP assembly tests were found to be significantly lower than that of corresponding ASTM tests of the main member. This finding lends justification to the Canadian 2 / 3 reduction factor for these scenarios as well as to the design procedures suggested by German researchers. It was determined that the ASTM c-perp test does not adequately represent these bearing scenarios. Adjustment factors are recommended for wood-on-wood bearing and opposite side end bearing. Aspect ratio was found to affect c-perp failure mode and led to high potential for sudden and catastrophic failure of members. Fifteen percent of 2 X 12 members tested failed prior to NDS design stresses due to premature failure of the nominal 2 X 12 bottom chord member. It was estimated that the odds of a 2 X 1 2 failing catastrophically are at least 16 times that of a 2 X 8 failing catastrophically. It was determined that as aspect ratio increases c-perp becomes a life safety as well as a serviceability issue and an adjustment factor for aspect ratio is recommended...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{mechanism}} of tapered piles and evidence obtained from small scale model tests, this paper proposes cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion theories to evaluate the skin friction by introducing a stress–dilatancy relationship, as well as the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of tapered piles by introducing a tapering factor. In general, in order to evaluate the skin friction, either the angle of internal friction or dilatancy angle is assumed to be constant.

At the mean time, the effect of angle of tapering is introduced to evaluate the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of tapered piles. The test results and proposed models show that a slight increase in the tapering angle of the pile results in higher skin friction and affects the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> resistance compared with conventional straight piles on different types of sands at different relative densities.
