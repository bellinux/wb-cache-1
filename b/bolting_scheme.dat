40|$|Stability of {{underground}} structures {{is critical in}} underground mining. Every effort {{must be made to}} preserve stability for the safety of mining operations. There are a number of techniques available for reinforcing unstable rock masses, of which rock bolting is the most widely used. D u e to the complexity of geological conditions and the variety of mining methods employed, reinforcement methods also vary widely. Rock bolting systems are designed to effectively utilise the capacity of the support elements and secure the safety of miners and the mining operation. The focus of this research was a study of discontinuities and their influence on stability of structures in a rock mass. T o determine the jointing system in a rock mass, a three dimensional scanline technique was used to collect the necessary data. This technique was used to eliminate the bias that occurs when using horizontal scanlines. The data were processed statistically and the modified K-mean method is used to cluster the data into groups. The data points in the groups are the elements of the clusters. A n assessment system treating the frequency, persistence, type and various mechanical properties of discontinuities was established to determine the major discontinuity sets which have a dominant influence on rock mass behaviour. When the major discontinuity sets were determined, the stability of the rock mass was then analysed based on an assessment of the competence of the rock mass using a modified geomechanics classification system. The magnitude and direction of the local stress field and the geometry of the opening were taken into consideration by introducing a correction to the rock mass rating. The initial design for the rock bolting system was then carried out. Due to the presence of the discontinuities, the rocks are separated into blocks weathering and infilling can occur between the walls of the discontinuities. The behaviour of a jointed rock mass may be governed by the discontinuities in sets and wedge failure m a y occur if the discontinuities intersect unfavourably. It is therefore necessary to identify potentially unstable wedges. The traditional stereographic projection technique {{is one of the most}} c o m m o n methods used and the major limitation of which is that it can only provide a graphical solution for those wedges defined by three discontinuity sets. It is also time consuming and tedious. In this project a computer aided stereographic projection technique was developed. The geometry of either tetrahedral or polyhedral wedges can now be determined. The removability of the wedges is then evaluated. If the wedge is removable the number of bolts required m a y then be calculated. Based on the initial design and the support requirements of potentially unstable wedges, a final decision on the rock bolting system to stabilise the area of interest can be made. The system developed here assists on-site designers by providing a reliable and on-going method of arriving at the primary roof <b>bolting</b> <b>scheme.</b> The applicability of the system has been tested and demonstrated in underground excavations at Pasminco Mining Broken Hill Operation and at C S A Mine, Cobar. The results obtained indicated that an enhanced rock bolting system should be adopted in the stopes in the N B H C Mine. The results agreed broadly with the current empirical design used at C S A Mine, Cobar. This research has shown that the discontinuities in a rock mass have a significant bearing on the rock mass behaviour. The rock bolting design is directly relevant to the safety and effectiveness of an underground mining operation. The design approach resulting from this research will provide a reliable rock bolting system for underground structures in a jointed rock mass...|$|E

50|$|A {{technology}} {{capable of}} harvesting lightning energy {{would need to}} be able to rapidly capture the high power involved in a lightning <b>bolt.</b> Several <b>schemes</b> have been proposed, but the ever-changing energy involved in each lightning bolt renders lightning power harvesting from ground based rods impractical - too high, it will damage the storage, too low and it may not work. Additionally, lightning is sporadic, and therefore energy would have to be collected and stored; it is difficult to convert high-voltage electrical power to the lower-voltage power that can be stored.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} mechanical {{model and}} a transcalent model of flange bolt joint were built, considering the nonlinearity of gasket and the contact problem, {{the effect of}} inhomogeneous temperature field and its variation to pressure of bolt and gasket was studied, and the joint parameters of two schemes were compared; based on the orthogonal text, two <b>bolt</b> system <b>schemes,</b> adding disc spring and adding sleeve, were experimentally studied. The investigation showed that the sealability of {{different parts of the}} gaskets is different, owing to the difference of each bolt in radial and axial displacement under the influence of inhomogeneous temperature field, and the fatigue of gasket and bolt is easily caused; the scheme of disc spring is better than sleeve, and the disc spring, whose thickness is 0. 9 mm, was selected to improve the mechanical performance of bolt system...|$|R
40|$|Joint schemes {{are very}} {{important}} {{in the design of}} bolted joints in huge composite structures. This article describes the scheme, manufacturing method, performance testing and simulation of a novel bolted joint configuration for top-hat stiffened composite plates. Firstly, a <b>bolted</b> joint <b>scheme</b> is proposed for use in top-hat stiffened composite plates, after which the manufacturing method of the joint scheme is presented, as is the fabrication of test specimens and their bending performance are tested. Then, a numerical method is proposed to analyze the performance of these specimens. Drawing on experimental and simulated results, seven failure modes are summarized with varied geometrical parameter. We change the angle of top clamp θ and the length of the foam block Lx, and discuss the relationship between the mutative design parameters and bending performance. Suitable design parameters are obtained and suggestions for the joint scheme are offered. It is found that good mechanical performances can be achieved with the proposed scheme through suitable parameter design, and it is also found the simulated result agrees the experiment well, which provides a useful method for the bolted joint design of foam inserted top-hat stiffened composite plates.

50|$|An early {{decision}} {{had been made to}} construct the primary structure largely from stainless steel rather than lightweight alloys such as duralumin. The design of the primary structure was shared between Cardington and the aircraft manufacturer Boulton and Paul, who had extensive experience in the use of steel and had developed innovative techniques for forming steel strip into structural sections. Working to an outline design prepared with the help of data supplied by the NPL, the stress calculations were performed by Cardington. This information was then supplied to J. D. North and his team at Boulton and Paul, who designed the actual metalwork. The individual girders were fabricated by Boulton and Paul in Norwich and transported to Cardington where they were <b>bolted</b> together. This <b>scheme</b> for a prefabricated structure entailed demanding manufacturing tolerances and was entirely successful, as the ease with which R101 was eventually extended bears witness. Before any contracts for the metalwork were signed, an entire bay consisting of a pair of the 15-sided transverse ring frames and the connecting longitudinal girders was assembled at Cardington. After the assembly had passed loading tests, the individual girders were then tested to destruction. The structure of the airframe was innovative: the ring-shaped transverse frames of previous airships had been braced by radial wires meeting at a central hub, but no such bracing was used in R101, the frames being stiff enough in themselves. However, this resulted in the structure extending further into the envelope, thereby limiting the size of the gasbags.|$|R
40|$|Strengthening {{structures}} through external bonding {{of advanced}} fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite {{is turning out}} to be exceptionally well known worldwide amid the previous decade on the grounds that it gives a more practical and in fact better option than the conventional procedures much of the time as it offers better strength, good fatigue resistance, low weight, corrosion resistance, easy and rapid installation along with minimal change in geometry of the structure. Although many in-situ RC beams are continuous in construction, there has been a limited research in the area of FRP strengthening of continuous beams. In the present study, an experimental investigation is carried out to study the behavior of continuous RC beams under static loading. The beams are strengthened with externally bonded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) sheets and also with unbonded GFRP using steel <b>bolt</b> system. Different <b>scheme</b> of strengthening have been employed. The experiment consists of six continuous (two-span) beams with overall dimensions equal to (150 × 250 × 2300) mm. All the beams will have similar longitudinal and transverse steel reinforcement. One beam was not strengthened and was considered as a control beam, whereas all other beams were strengthened in various patterns with externally bonded GFRP sheets and unbonded GFRP with end anchorage using the steel bolt system. The present study examines the responses of RC continuous beams, in terms of failure modes, enhancement of load capacity and load deflection analysis. The results indicate that the shear strength of RC beams can be significantly increased by gluing GFRP sheets to the shear face. In addition, the unbonded sheets with end anchorage also improved the cracking behaviour of the beams by delaying the formation of visible cracks and reducing crack widths at higher load levels...|$|R
