40|$|The eco-epidemiology of T. cruzi {{infection}} {{was investigated}} in the Eastern border of the Panama Canal in Central Panama. Between 1999 and 2000, 1110 triatomines were collected: 1050 triatomines (94. 6 %) from palm trees, 27 (2. 4 %) from periurban habitats and 33 (3. 0 %) inside houses. All specimens were identified as R. pallescens. There {{was no evidence of}} vector domiciliation. Salivary glands from 380 R. pallescens revealed a trypanosome natural infection rate of 7. 6 %, while rectal ampoule content from 373 triatomines was 45 %. Isoenzyme profiles on isolated trypanosomes demonstrated that 85. 4 % (n = 88) were T. cruzi and 14. 6 % (n = 15) were T. rangeli. Blood meal analysis from 829 R. pallescens demonstrated a zoophilic vector behavior, with opossums as the preferential blood source. Seroprevalence in human samples from both study sites was less than 2 %. Our results demonstrate that T. cruzi survives in the area in <b>balanced</b> <b>association</b> with R. pallescens, and with several different species of mammals in their natural niches.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} a food supplement containing forskolin, homotaurine, carnosine, folic acid, vitamins B 1, B 2, B 6, and magnesium in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) already in treatment and compensated by intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering drugs, during a period of 12 months. METHODS: Twenty-two patients (44 eyes) with POAG, with their IOP compensated by topical drugs, were enrolled and randomly assigned to the food supplement or control treatment group. The additional food supplement treatment consisted of 2 tablets per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening) given for 1 year of a <b>balanced</b> <b>association</b> of homotaurine, Coleus forskohlii root extract, L-carnosine, folic acid, vitamins B 1, B 2, B 6, and magnesium. Pattern Electroretinogram (PERG) amplitude, foveal sensitivity obtained with the visual field analyzer frequency doubling technology, and IOP were detected at enrollment (T 0), 3 months (T 1), 6 months (T 2), 9 months (T 3), and 12 months (T 4). RESULTS: We observed in treated patients a significant further decrease of IOP and an improvement of PERG amplitude at 6, 9, and 12 months, and foveal sensitivity at 12 months. All values remained substantially stable in control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present pilot study indicate that the components of the food supplement reach the eye in a detectable manner, as evidenced by the effects on the IOP. Moreover, they suggest a short-term neuroactive effect, as indicated by the improvement of PERG amplitude and foveal sensitivity in treated, but not in control patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Massive MIMO is {{expected}} to {{play a key role}} in coping with the predicted mobile-data traffic explosion. Indeed, in combination with small cells and TDD operation, it promises large throughputs per unit area with low latency. In this paper we focus on the problem of balancing the load across networks with massive MIMO base-stations (BSs). The need for load balancing arises from variations in the user population density and is more pronounced in small cells due to the large variability in coverage area. We consider methods for load balancing over networks with small and large massive MIMO BSs. As we show, the distinct operation and properties of massive MIMO enable practical resource-efficient load-balancing methods with near-optimal performance.

40|$|Abstract—WiFi clients must {{associate}} {{to a specific}} Access Point (AP) to communicate over the Internet. Current association methods are based on maximum Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) implying that a client associates to the strongest AP around it. This is a simple scheme that has performed well in purely distributed settings. Modern wireless networks, however, are increasingly being connected by a wired backbone. The backbone allows for out-of-band communication among APs, opening up opportunities for improved protocol design. This paper takes advantage of this opportunity through a coordinated client association scheme where APs consider a global view of the network, and decide on the optimal client-AP association. We show that such an association outperforms RSSI based schemes in several scenarios, while remaining practical and scalable for wide-scale deployment. We also show that optimal association is a NP-Hard problem and our max-flow based heuristic is a promising solution.

40|$|Rampant mobile traffic {{increase}} in modern cellular networks is mostly caused by large-sized multimedia contents. Recent advancements in smart devices {{as well as}} radio access technologies promote the consumption of bulky content, even for people in moving vehicles, referred to as vehicular heavy users. In this article the emergence of vehicular heavy user traffic is observed by field experiments conducted in 2012 and 2015 in Seoul, Korea. The experiments reveal that such traffic is becoming dominant, captured by the 8. 62 times increase in vehicular heavy user traffic while the total {{traffic increase}}d 3. 04 times. To resolve this so-called vehicular heavy user problem (VHP), we propose a cell association algorithm that exploits user demand diversity for different velocities. This user traffic pattern is discovered first by our field trials, which is convex-shaped over velocity, i. e. walking user traffic is less than stationary or vehicular user traffic. As the VHP becomes severe, numerical evaluation verifies the proposed user convexity aware association outperforms a well-known load <b>balancing</b> <b>association</b> in practice, cell range expansion (CRE).

40|$|Aims The aims were to (i) {{investigate}} initial {{construct validity}} of a tool for assessment of time allocation in occupational balance, and (ii) describe perceived occupational balance and its relationship with socio-demographics, well-being, and personal recovery among people with mental illness. Methods Satisfaction with Daily Occupations and Occupational Balance (SDO-OB) was administered to 226 persons. SDO-OB reflects balance in five occupational domains: work, leisure, home chores, self-care, and overall occupational balance. Indicators for assessing construct validity were: satisfaction with everyday occupations, occupational value, symptom severity, and psychosocial functioning. For the second aim, the data collection included socio-demographics, life quality, self-esteem, self-mastery, and personal recovery. Results Occupational balance ratings indicated the participants were either under-occupied or in balance. Few were over-occupied. Feeling in balance was related to greater well-being and recovery compared with being under-occupied. Risk factors for under-occupation were younger age (in relation to work), and higher education (in relation to overall <b>balance).</b> Conclusions <b>Associations</b> with the indicators suggest initial construct validity. The SDO-OB is promising for assessment of occupational balance among people with mental illness.
