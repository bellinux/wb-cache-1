40|$|The Neoproterozoic-age Mali Group of {{the southwestern}} Taoudéni Basin, NW Africa, represents, in the Walidiala Valley, a glaciogenic and post-glacial {{succession}} that brackets the Cryogenian-Ediacaran period boundary. At its base, debris flows and turbidite-like, sandy {{units of the}} Pelel Member pass upward into siltstone and shale of the Diagoma Member. These two units represent the progressive evolution from some portion of a fan delta fed by a nearby ice shelf to a more distal environment disturbed only by the occasional fallout from passing icebergs. The appearance of coarse-grained, cross-bedded sandstone beds and gravels of the overlying Tanagué Member heralds {{a return to a}} shallower, fluvially influenced environment before abrupt transgression caps the glaciogenic succession. The transgressive unit consists of a regionally extensive, 2 - 7 m-thick, silty dolostone, the <b>Bowal</b> Member, which is isotopically and petrographically indistinguishable from ca. 635 -Ma cap dolostone units elsewhere in NW Africa and worldwide. The <b>Bowal</b> Member comprises microcrystalline dolomite in turbidite-like depositional sheets disrupted by internal brecciation, fracturing and cementation by first chert and then dolomite. The stratigraphic succession in the Walidiala Valley closely resembles facies models relating to glacial retreat in a proximal glaciomarine environment affected by glacioeustasy. A large volcaniclastic debris flow has caused slumping and soft-sediment deformation within the cap dolostone of the <b>Bowal</b> Member. The widespread association of pyroclastic deposits with cap dolostone throughout the Taoudéni Basin implies that volcanism and deglaciation were roughly contemporaneous across a huge area. We consider that the volcaniclastic debris flow and soft-sediment deformation within the underlying Tanagué Member were possibly triggered by seismic activity during deglaciation, caused by isostatic relaxation of the lithosphere. However, fitted brecciation of cap dolostone beds here and elsewhere in the world is more consistent with pervasive dolomite cementation. © 2006 Académie des sciences...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Grass savannas on {{lateritic}} crusts {{are characteristic}} landscape {{elements of the}} Sudanian savannas. In the W Na-tional Park and its surroundings in SE-Burkina Faso, plant diversity of savannas on and adjacent to bowé was assessed by a survey of 19 <b>bowal</b> areas with relevés along transects in each of these. The vegetation structure and species composition of the herb and shrub strata, soil depth, particle size and the concentration of Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, H+, C and N were recorded on each <b>bowal</b> and its surroundings. Our results show that soils on lateritic crusts are rather shallow and acidic compared to the surrounding savanna woodlands. Nutrient availability is hence comparatively low. The observed flora comprises 130 species mainly belonging to the families Combretaceae, Cyperaceae, Leguminosae and Poaceae with a predominance of therophytes and a comparatively high share of C 4 species. In the pastures surrounding the National Park a higher species richness was found than inside the Park due to the occurrence of pioneers, ruderal and unpalatable plants. Savannas on lateritic crusts exhi-bit due to their extreme edaphic and hydrological conditions a specific flora distinct from their surroundings.
