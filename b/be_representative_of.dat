5|$|Brown {{published}} a formal description and {{name for the}} species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), {{in reference to the}} shape of its infructescences.|$|E
5|$|Early on July8, another brief {{burst in}} {{convection}} {{near the center}} of Blanca occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly dissipated and the winds were not considered to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of Blanca dissipated over open waters.|$|E

5|$|In 1966 the Museum's Southwark {{building}} {{was extended to}} provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum {{had moved to the}} site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of 15-inch naval guns. One had been mounted on the Royal Navy's HMS Ramillies and the other on both HMS Resolution and HMS Roberts. Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968. The acquisition of these guns, representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships, led the museum to seek to acquire a 6-inch triple turret that would <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> a number of classes of British cruisers. This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy light cruiser , which became a branch of the museum in 1978.|$|E

5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E
5|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets). The largest group that completely refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E

5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|E
5|$|With time, {{the idea}} that the differing skulls might <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> {{individual}} variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, Ostrom and Wellnhofer published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, Triceratops horridus. Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region (modern examples being the elephant and the giraffe in modern Africa). To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus lineage was composed of females, the T.calicornis-T.elatus lineage was made up of males, and the T. obtusus-T. hatcheri lineage was of pathologic old males. His reasoning was that males had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, forward-facing horns.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to <b>be</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
