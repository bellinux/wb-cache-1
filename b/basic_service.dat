Efficiency in managing and maintaining urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> ultimately dictates the quality of an urban government. In the last three decades, Dhaka‘s urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> governance has been tumbling behind the required standard. Specially, in the last five/six years the situation has reached to an alarming state— resulting to {{a high degree of}} inconvenience in urban living and loss of potentials in city economy. Frequent malfunctioning, limited capacity to expand, bureaucratic complexity in availing services, lack of public accountability etc. are some of the common characteristics of urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> in Dhaka. There is a general understanding in the concerned sphere that fragmented mode of governing these has attributed the service environment with a complex texture. In fact, fragmentation contributed in terms of multiparty involvement, overlapping of responsibility, obsolete organizational planning, monopoly management etc. Presently, Dhaka‘s urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> governance can‘t assure better living, competitive business environment and sustainable economic growth. As a potential remedy, adoption of a general purpose ?metropolitan government? mechanism with prerogatives to plan, develop, maintain service provisions; adequately command the service providers; govern development initiatives; realize taxes and revenues have been in discussion for quite a period within the concerned political and administrative domain. This article discusses the rationale, potentials of a general purpose ?metropolitan government? mechanism to improve Dhaka‘s present state of urban <b>basic</b> <b>services.</b> Additionally, the paper attempted to frame out the structure and operational mechanism of the proposed government.

25|$|At its launch, {{the package}} proved highly {{controversial}} mainly {{due to the}} relative unavailability of NFL Network at the time; the league used the games as leverage to encourage television providers to carry NFL Network on their <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> tiers, rather than in premium, sports-oriented packages that required subscribers to pay a higher fee; although, as with all other national cable telecasts of NFL games, the league's own regulations require the games to be syndicated to over-the-air television stations in the local markets of the teams. These issues were magnified in 2007, when a game that saw the New England Patriots close out a perfect regular season was simulcast nationally on both CBS and NBC, in addition to NFL Network and the local stations that the game was sold to, following concerns from politicians and other critics.|$|E

This devolution of management to the autonomous regions, provinces, and special municipalities meant local governments had more decision-making power {{and were able to}} develop basic education. State-owned enterprises, mass organizations, and individuals were encouraged to pool funds to accomplish education reform. Local authorities used state appropriations and a percentage of local reserve financial resources (basically township financial revenues) to finance educational projects.

40|$|M. A. Faculty of Humanities, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011. The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{critically}} examine the role of restructured intergovernmental transfers in assisting the local government to fulfil its commitment to provide free <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> to the poor. To meet this goal, the role of transfers was analysed by assessing how policies and legislation applicable to free <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> and indigent management influenced the provision of services to the poor in Mogale City, and by dissecting how commodification of services and non-payment of services affected the provision of these services. A comprehensive literature review showed how the transfer practices in South Africa have impacted on the provision of <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> at the municipal level. Findings obtained through in-depth interviews and content analysis demonstrated that transfers, despite the constitutional prescription and official aims to achieve equitability, have failed to boost Mogale City’s capabilities to provide <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> to most of its poor residents. A number of reasons for this are expounded here, but the key conclusion is that transfers are insufficient in helping the local government to provide free <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> to the poor...|$|R
