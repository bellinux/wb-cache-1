40|$|The {{existence}} of stable layered bulk allotropes {{can be an}} indication for the {{existence of}} corresponding stable tubular structures. Using a density functional tight binding method we demonstrate that charged <b>borocarbide</b> (BC) nanotubes, which are isoelectronic with layered lithium or copper <b>borocarbide,</b> are stable and energetically viable. The discussed structures are semiconducting with an energy gap which decreases with diameter. The size of the gap also depends on the helicity of the tubes, and is always smaller for tubes with armchair (n,n) and zig-zag (3 n, 0) symmetry than for tubes with other symmetries.

40|$|The metamagnetic {{transitions}} in single-crystal rare-earth nickel <b>borocarbide</b> HoNi_{ 2 }B_{ 2 }C and ErNi_{ 2 }B_{ 2 }C {{have been studied}} at 1. 9 K with a Quantum Design torque magnetometer. The critical fields of the transitions depend crucially on the angle between applied field and the easy axis [110] for HoNi_ 2 B_ 2 C and [100] for ErNi_ 2 B_ 2 C. Torque measurements have been made while changing angular direction of the magnetic field (parallel to basal tetragonal ab-planes) in a wide angular range (more than two quadrants). The results are used not only to check and refine the angular diagram for metamagnetic {{transitions in}} these compounnds, but also to find new features of the metamagnetic states. Among new results for the Ho <b>borocarbide</b> are {{the influence of a}} multidomain antiferromagnetic state, and ``frustrated'' behavior of the magnetic system for field directions close to the hard axis [100]. Torque measurements of the Er <b>borocarbide</b> clearly show that the sequence of metamagnetic transitions with increasing field (and the corresponding number of metamagnetic states) depends on the angular direction of the magnetic field relative to the easy axis.

40|$|To {{determine}} the superconducting gap {{function of a}} <b>borocarbide</b> superconductor YNi_ 2 B_ 2 C, the c-axis thermal conductivity kappa_zz was measured in a magnetic field rotated in various directions relative to the crystal axes.

The amplitude of this fourfold oscillation becomes very small when H is rotated conically around the c-axis with a tilt angle of 45 degrees.

40|$|We present here an {{overview}} of thermal conductivity behavior in magnetic superconductors: rare-earth nickel <b>borocarbide</b> intermetallic compounds, RNi_ 2 B_ 2 C, and the 2122 rare-earth rutheno-cuprates.

The rutheno-cuprate Eu_ 1. 5 Ce_ 0. 5 RuSr_ 2 Cu_ 2 O_ 10 -δ exhibits coexistence of weak ferromagnetism and superconductivity at a surprisingly high temperature (≈ 45 K) and onset of antiferromagnetic order near 200 K.

In the second route, powder metallurgy techniques, including consolidation of rapidly solidified powders by extrusion and hot isostatic pressing (HIP), were used.

We focus on Ce- and U-based heavy fermion superconductors, in addition we discuss the rare earth <b>borocarbide</b> and skutterudite superconductors. We show that heavy fermion behaviour in Ce- and U- compounds should be described differently. While the Kondo-lattice model with localised 4 f-electrons is appropriate for Ce-compounds, dual models including localised and itinerant 5 f-electrons are necessary for U-compounds. We demonostrate that this leads to consistent results for Fermi surface topology and mass enhancement in various U-compounds. We also show that virtual exchange of localised 5 f-electron excitations provides a new mechanism for unconventional superconductivity {{in addition to the}} known itinerant spin-fluctuation exchange mechanism. We discuss symmetry properties and coexistence of unconventional superconducting and density wave (hidden) order parameters and methods for their detection, notably the new angle resolved magntetotransport methods.
