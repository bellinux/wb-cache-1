2500|$|In {{an article}} in The New Yorker, Adelman said of Rumsfeld, a friend and {{associate}} of 36 years: “How could this happen to someone so good, so competent? This war made me doubt the past. Was I wrong all those years, or was he just better back then? The Donald Rumsfeld of today is not the Donald Rumsfeld I knew, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was wrong about the old Donald Rumsfeld. It’s a terrible way to end a career. It’s hard to remember, but he was once the future.” ...|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could make it as a doctor.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Thank you kindly,' says I. 'Just {{at present}} it is a one man job, <b>but</b> <b>maybe,</b> if <b>I</b> get them out, {{you will be}} able to give us some advice as to how we had best manage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{nothing for}} me to speak of," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Spinks. [...] "A man lives and learns. Maybe I've read a leaf or two in my time. I don't wish to say anything large, mind you; <b>but</b> nevertheless, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know exactly, sir, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> {{can find}} out," [...] {{answered}} the sneak. He felt much subdued, especially {{as he saw}} {{the eyes of many}} of the other cadets on him.|$|R
6000|$|Mackay smiled, {{though he}} {{answered}} dryly: [...] "They're both hard to manage, and ungrateful for their benefits; <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> would. Still, I am, ye see, neither judge nor jury. Would ye prefer a charge against them, Ormesby?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But ere {{the court}} of the Lady Elaine {{departed}} from that place Sir Lavaine, {{the brother of the}} Lady Elaine, came to Sir Launcelot and no one was present but they two. And Sir Lavaine said to Sir Launcelot: [...] "Messire, do you not go hence with your lady?" [...] and Sir Launcelot said: [...] "Nay, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> shall follow her anon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, Beorn, and I {{would gladly}} {{have you with}} me, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> shall be {{detected}} in attempting to escape and be slain, or I may {{fall into the hands}} of peasants and be brought back here, and if we were together all hope of letting the duke know of our lord's captivity would be at an end. Therefore it were best that I made the attempt first. If I fail, which is like enough, then do you in turn try to get away and bear the news to the duke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You bet we have," [...] piped Davy cheerfully, quite {{his own man}} again. [...] "I wasn't a bit scared either [...] . {{only just}} at the first. It come on a fellow so sudden. I {{made up my mind}} quick as a wink that I wouldn't fight Teddy Sloane Monday as I'd promised; <b>but</b> now <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> will. Say, Dora, was you scared?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{retorted}} {{that the}} idea would have occurred to me plenty soon enough, and without anybody's help. I was slow about thinking, <b>maybe,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> was sure.|$|R
5000|$|... "The exact {{release date}} hasn't been decided yet, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> in June? <b>I</b> {{think it might}} be {{unveiled}} before summer. There will be a song that I wrote on the new album, some of the tracks will be written by others though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} know why Lynde is acting so, I can't tell you, for I don't know either. I don't {{even know if}} she is angry. I only thought perhaps she was--that you had done or said {{something}} to vex her--plaguing {{her to go to}} church maybe. But if you didn't, it may not be anger at all. I don't understand that girl. She's been different ever since her mother died. She used to tell me everything before that. You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> can tell you something. Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, in Germany, is it {{the custom}} to put the {{letter-box}} up a tree? Why do they not fix it {{to the front door}} as we do? I should hate having to climb up a tree to get my letters. Besides, it is not fair to the postman. In addition to being most exhausting, the delivery of letters must to a heavy man, on windy nights, be positively dangerous work. If they will fix it to a tree, why not fix it lower down, why always among the topmost branches? <b>But,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>I</b> am misjudging the country," [...] he continued, a new idea occurring to him. [...] "Possibly the Germans, who are in many matters ahead of us, have perfected a pigeon post. Even so, I cannot help thinking they would have been wiser to train the birds, while they were about it, to deliver the letters nearer the ground. Getting your letters out of those boxes must be tricky work even to the average middle-aged German." ...|$|E
5000|$|The surrealist painter favours {{a utopian}} New Zealand: [...] "Most of my art {{is related to}} the ecology of the world," [...] Summerton says. [...] "I'm not a hippy, greenie painter who rants on, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am an environmentalist. New Zealand is a bit of an oasis like that and I've had that theme running through my work for a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, son, wait. I'm {{coming to}} that, <b>maybe.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> {{want to know}} some things first. Is it true--what I hear about your health, bad shape, you know--all cut up in the war? Worse than young Maynard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. Only {{sometimes}} {{it seems to me}} as if he hadn't read because he loved it, but because he thought it due to himself. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> I'm mistaken. <b>I</b> could imagine a delicate poem shutting up half its sweetness from his cold, cold scrutiny,--if you will excuse the floweriness of the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, piston-ring burnt off {{and put the}} exhaust-valve on the blink. That {{means one}} {{cylinder}} out of business," [...] growled Hawk Ericson. [...] "I could fly, <b>maybe,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't like to risk it in this wind. It was bad enough this morning when I tried it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Danny Seim {{stated in}} an October 2008 {{interview}} {{that a new}} Menomena album was tentatively expected to debut {{in the beginning of}} 2009. [...] "In a perfect world, we would have been done with a new record. Fall ’08 would have been great. But then that's moved to January ’09 … we hadn’t seen one another [...] and we’re seeing each other for some European dates, and a festival date here and there. We’re moving on a U2 time frame. ...We have a ton of material to use and we have to structure the stuff, pick up instruments and find songs. I’d love to say January ’09 <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> just like the way those words sound." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Hawking {{announced}} that he was conceding the bet, and that he now believed that black hole horizons should fluctuate and leak information, in doing so providing Preskill with a copy of Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia. [...] Comparing the useless information obtainable from a black hole to [...] "burning an encyclopedia", Hawking later joked, [...] "I gave John an encyclopedia of baseball, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should just have given him the ashes." [...] Thorne, however, remained unconvinced of Hawking's proof and declined to contribute to the award. As of 2008, Hawking's argument that he has solved the paradox has not yet been accepted by the community, and a consensus has not yet been reached that Hawking has provided a strong enough argument that this is in fact what happens.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} horse--know him well. You are a stranger, I take it, {{and so you}} might think he was an American horse, <b>maybe,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> assure you he is not. He is nothing of the kind; but--excuse my {{speaking}} in a low voice, other people being near--he is, without {{the shadow of a}} doubt, a Genuine Mexican Plug!" ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{remember}} being so knocked {{out by the}} [...] "Superduperman" [...] story that I immediately began thinking - I was 11, remember, so {{this would have been}} purely a comics strip for my own fun - <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could do a parody story about Marvelman. This thing is fair game to my 11-year-old mind. I wanted to do a super-hero parody story that was as funny as [...] "Superduperman", but I thought {{it would be better if}} I did it about an English superhero." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the (then) record low of {{the arctic}} sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the {{director}} of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated [...] "If you asked {{me a couple of}} years ago when the Arctic could lose all of its ice then I would have said 2100, or 2070 <b>maybe.</b> <b>But</b> now <b>I</b> think that 2030 is a reasonable estimate." ...|$|R
5000|$|While at the mall, Robbie and Julia {{meet up with}} Julia's {{cousin and}} best friend Holly, who convinces the [...] "faux duo" [...] that Julia needs to {{practice}} her wedding kiss. Robbie and Julia awkwardly and lovingly kiss, only to be interrupted by the reality that Julia is marrying Glen. After seeing the kiss, Holly decides that she should go out with Robbie. Julia, still shocked by the kiss, hastily agrees with Holly. Much later that night, Robbie, Holly, Julia, Glen, Sammy, and George go to a club in New York City ("Saturday Night in the City"). Here Robbie finally realizes that Glen is a cheater and that he, Robbie, loves Julia. Holly realizes this too and tells Robbie that Julia is marrying Glen because of his money and security. Upon hearing this, Robbie says, [...] "Well, I‘m in big trouble, then. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could change." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the death}} of his wife Annie, he closed La Tante Claire in 2003. The space became the {{flagship}} restaurant of Marcus Wareing. After taking a break from restaurants, he was briefly head chef at the Bleeding Heart pub in Clerkenwell. In 2009, he opened a pop-up restaurant at Selfridges in London for ten days as part of the London food festival. Koffmann decided to serve classic dishes from La Tante Claire instead of new dishes as he originally planned - [...] "... that's not what people want. They want the pig's trotter, the foie gras, the pistachio soufflé. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> do a new dish each day, as a special." [...] The ten days turned into two months. Koffmann described the first month as [...] "a kind of hell", but got used to the hours again during the second month, and began to ponder about opening a new restaurant; [...] "I started to think about a new restaurant. I thought: why not? I still enjoy it. When you are a chef, your place is in the kitchen.".|$|E
5000|$|His {{composition}} The Companion Guide to Rome was a runner-up for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Music. [...] A {{recording of}} Play by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project was later {{named one of}} the best classical music recordings of 2015 by David Allen of The New York Times and was nominated for the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition. He won the 2017 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for his symphonic work Play, which the music writer Will Robin suggested was [...] "the best orchestral work that the 21st century has seen thus far". In reference to the prize, {{he said in an interview}} with NPR: [...] "If I get more commissions, great, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> can use this moment to talk about things that are important to me. Like to call attention to the fact that there are problems. For instance, this award has been given to three women out of its 30-year history. And to me that's kind of an issue. And in all honesty, I'm a white man and I get lots of commissions and there are systemic reasons for that, reasons we should all be talking about. There are so many talented composers out there. Rather than giving me another commission, why aren't we giving those people a commission?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There hasn't {{been such}} a thing {{in the house for}} sixteen years, Master. There never was but three--one in the spare room, and a little one in the kitchen, and Margaret's own. She broke them all the day it first struck her that Kilmeny was going to be bonny. I might have got one after she died <b>maybe.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> didn't think of it; and there's no need of lasses to be always prinking at their looking glasses." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "'Holiday' is {{a totally}} cheesy but totally harmless, fun song. It's {{designed}} to give people that are on holiday a great excuse to dance madly and us folks back home in Britain who need that holiday an even greater one. This song hasn't got the explosive feel that 'Bonkers' has and thus it doesn't have {{the same sense of}} longevity, but what it does have is a very now feel (not least because this song wouldn't have worked so well in November...)Looking out the window now as I reach the end of this review, I'm amazed to see it has stopped raining and that the sun is trying to peep through the clouds. <b>But</b> then, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't be that surprised - after all, this has officially been Dizzee's summer and this song is a little ray of sunshine." [...] The song was awarded a 4 star.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a {{whole lot}} of things she'd {{certainly}} oughta have admired in you, lemme tell you. I suppose probably Maxine Elliott is better-looking than what you are, <b>maybe,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> always was crazy over your kind of girl--blond hair and nice, clear eyes and just shoulder-high--kind of a girl that could snuggle down beside a fireplace and look like she grew there--not one of these domineerin' sufferin' cats females. No, nor one of these overdressed New-York chickens, neither, but cute and bright--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Reutter {{competed in}} the semifinals for the 3000 m relay with {{teammates}} Alyson Dudek, Allison Baver and Kimberly Derrick. The U.S. team qualified for the final in second place behind South Korea {{with a time of}} 4:15.376. Reutter finished in fourth place in the 1500 m final, behind Zhou Yang of China, with Lee Eun-Byul of South Korea in second, and Park Seung-Hi of South Korea in third. Reutter got tangled up with Wang Meng in the semifinal, causing both skaters and Cho Ha-Ri of South Korea to fall, resulting in Meng being disqualified from the final. Reutter repeated the same move in the final, bumping into Park, and later expressed remorse for both mistakes, stating [...] "I think the room was there <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> just wasn't there. I don't know. But … I messed up and messed up some people around me, which I'm very sorry for." [...] In the heats of the 1000 m, Reutter set an Olympic record and finished first overall in the heats. About {{an hour and a half}} later, Reutter {{competed in the}} 3000 m relay (with Allison Baver, Alyson Dudek, Lana Gehring) and won bronze behind China and Canada due to the disqualification of South Korea. In the final of the 1000 m, Reutter was edged out for the gold medal by Wang Meng, finishing behind her 1:29.324 to 1:29.213.|$|E
5000|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.R: Your anger and wanting to see another sunset was a way you kept yourself alive through that critical day in spite of the doctors' predictions. But why do you call that an autohypnotic experience?E: I saw that vast sunset covering the whole sky. But I know there was also a tree there outside the window, but I blocked it out.R: You blocked it out? It was that selective perception that enables you to say you were in an altered state?E: Yes, I did not do it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see the fence and large boulder that were there. I blocked out everything except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days.

They were right. I am smart, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> don't put my brain to good use (giggles). The general academic education (HAVO) was so easy; I got all my exams by barely studying.” [...]...|$|E
5000|$|On July 22, 1935, Howard mailed the typescript of [...] "Red Nails" [...] to Weird Tales. At {{the time}} he shared his {{thoughts}} with Clark Ashton Smith, another colleague: [...] "Sent a three-part serial to Wright yesterday: 'Red Nails,' which I devoutly hope he'll like. A Conan yarn, and the grimmest, bloodiest and most merciless story of the series so far. Too much raw meat, <b>maybe,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> merely portrayed what I honestly believe would be the reactions of certain types {{of people in the}} situations on which the plot of the story hung..." ...|$|R

Did he never come back again I should be sorry indeed to see Colonel Leslie's son growing up a Glasgow tradesman, as my brother no doubt intends you to be, for I know he has long since given up any thought of hearing from your father; but in that you and I will have a say when the time comes. Until then you must treat Andrew as your natural guardian, and there is no need to anger him by letting him know that your heart is with the king over the water, any more than that you can wield a sword like a gentleman. Let us have peace as long as we can. You are getting on for sixteen now; another two years and we will think about going to Paris together.
