Investigating existing business models in Second Life, a virtual world, to see whether the avatar-based commerce is a hype or a real potential. In this preliminary study, based on the tool, Internet <b>Business</b> <b>Graph</b> Analysis Models (IBGAM) developed by the author in 2003, the analysis of the business models of 14 avatar-based business unveiled that the avatar-based commerce, though growing rapidly, it may not be roaring like the Internet businesses in the 1990 ’s due to a fundamental structural constraint in running avatar-based business, as they have to run with the restricted tools, services, and rules provided by the owners of virtual worlds. These restrictions are a major deviation from the Internet, which has no owner. The author also found that indirect business models such as brokerage, e-auction, etc. are hard {{to be found in the}} virtual worlds. Consequently, direct exchange business models will most likely flourish in virtual worlds and avatar-based business may face some constraints...|$|E

The most recent Higher Education Academy Employability paper (HEA, 2007) makes no mention of the need for visual literacy skills. By neglecting visual literacy, we run the risk of sending our students into the job market, and into society, ill equipped to consciously decode the images streaming towards them, and conversely, unable to create and encode visual data, whether it be for <b>business</b> <b>graphs</b> or to commission a website etc. Since 2004, the library at the University of Northampton has run a successful undergraduate Information Management module, which is available to all first years and has an annual cohort of around 80 students. In 2007, a strand dedicated to visual literacy was developed by the University’s arts library team and added to the module programme. From the favourable student response, the content awakened something within the students, and proved stimulating and timely. We now have a growing research interest in understanding the role librarians have to play in developing and delivering visual literacy programmes and the impact of visual literacy on student employability. The “Learning Dialogues” conference will enable us to share our research project whilst it is in progress in particular: the methods we are employing to understand the need for visual literacy to enhance employability (dialogue with students), how we are bench marking other UK institutions (through visiting these institutions) and comparing our role with that of information professionals in the USA and Australia (through interactive dialogue).

VisImpact reduces data complexity by analyzing operational data and abstracting the most critical factors, called impact factors, which influence business operations. The analysis may identify single nodes of the <b>business</b> flow <b>graph</b> as important factors but it may also determine aggregations of nodes to be important.

In particular, we apply Seidel’s all-pairs shortest-path algorithm for undirected and unweighted graphs to a basic problem in labeled paths. Seidel’s algorithm {{is applied to}} find unlabeled paths between any pairs of nodes in a labeled graph whose associated context-free grammar G can generate the empty string ɛ. Our result is a corollary of Seidel’s algorithm. Then we mention a number of diverse labeled path applications. Labeled path problems are then used to demonstrate some concepts and insights about research and development.

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the fact}} that Web service {{dynamically}} changes and rapidly increases in the Internet, a user-oriented service workflow constructing model is proposed. The same or similar function services are accumulated into a kind of service set in this model, which is organized by the spanning tree, and the <b>business</b> spanning <b>graph</b> is formed according to workflow’s business logic relation. At the same time, on the basis of redefining the position, velocity, addition, subtraction and multiplication of particle swarm algorithm, combining with the cross and mutation operations in genetic algorithm, the QoS (quality of service) scheduling algorithm based on hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm (HPSOA) is designed to satisfy different multi-QoS demands when Web service rapidly increases. Experimental results demonstrate that the constructing model could effectively shield the physical varieties and differences of Web service, and preferably combine the Web service resource in the Internet. It is suitable for the application demands in the virtual computing environment. Key words: Web service; workflow; business spanning graph; QoS (quality of service) scheduling; HPSOA (hybri...|$|R

This paper therefore explores how specific visual designs applied to column graphs influence effectiveness and efficiency by applying the technique of eye-tracking to make an accurate assessment of what the observer is looking at. The tested design elements show significant results and allow the deduction of the following design guidelines for column graphs: do not use a 3 D view for depicting two dimensional data, do not use non-zero or broken axes, do show label values, do not use horizontal gridlines or the label axis when showing label values and do align the label values depending on the available space (either horizontally or vertically) ...|$|R

This is the case of the semantic model of SRML, the service modeling language of the european project SENSORIA.

Roughly, at the lowest level, a state configuration is a graph consisting of interconnected components and, at the highest level, <b>business</b> configurations are <b>graphs</b> consisting of interconnected activities, where each activity is a graph of components. Then, a state configuration is the flattening of the corresponding business configuration.

Interest graphs may be applied to product development by using customer interests to help determine which new features or capabilities to provide in future versions of a product.Interest graphs have many other uses as well including simulation, research and other content discovery and filtering tasks, as input to recommendation engines for films, books, music, etc., and for learning and education.|$|R
40|$|Business {{processes}} require {{involvement of}} technical components {{as well as}} humans to achieve their objectives. However, humans are only predictable to a degree of certainty because, while guided by policies and regulations, they retain the freedom to ignore established procedures or positively react to unforeseen events. Since we cannot change people, {{we have to be}} able to recognize their unpredictable behaviour by organising processes in such a way as to benefit from the flexibility of their actions and deal with the problems that arise from it. Business processes tend to be a structured sequence of events; however the assignment of humans to scheduled cases is unstructured. Hence, it is difficult to accurately model and simulate the flexibility of human resource allocation without considering the impact of unpredictable human behaviour. While business processes often have a rigid structure, determining sequences of actions on each individual case, there is flexibility in the selection of cases to be processed as well as in the assignment of human resources. However, such a flexible use of resources poses its own challenges, making process execution difficult to model and predict. In this thesis I propose a methodology and language to support the modelling and evaluation of business process executions with flexible assignment of human resources. The main idea is to model configurations of a <b>business</b> process as <b>graphs</b> and use graph transformation rules in a UML-like syntax to describe the process execution. This model allows to define conditions to temporarily permit actors to exceed their roles in exceptional (escalated) situations, without causing legal repercussions. The evaluation of process execution models is supported by the use of stochastic graph transformations, which allow the qualitative analysis of different organizational policies through simulation. The methodology is presented in four stages of (1) business modelling, (2) process execution design, (3) process encoding and (4) performance evaluation. A case study of a pharmacy process is used to evaluate the approach...|$|R
