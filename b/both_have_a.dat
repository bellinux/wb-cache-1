5|$|Eyre {{is thought}} to have been passing through the Toolinna Cove sand patch at the time of writing. B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, and <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is {{impossible}} to determine what species he saw.|$|E
5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to the papacy for himself. He had sought to <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> public persona favourable to Leopold I, while also working to curry the favour of Louis XIV. The zelanti faction and Flavio Chigi opposed him, which was enough to stop his victory.|$|E
5|$|Other {{variations}} to {{the pattern}} {{can be observed}} at Islington and Warden stations, which <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tricolour design. The current terminus stations of Kipling and Kennedy stations resemble the second version of Union subway station. Since opening, Kipling and Kennedy stations are the only Bloor–Danforth line stations {{not to use the}} Toronto Subway font.|$|E

25|$|The Freescape games Driller and Dark Side <b>both</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> game map in {{the form}} of a rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E
5|$|The endings {{of the two}} {{poems are}} the same but have {{opposite}} results: they <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sunset and an exodus from the country, but the first deals with Wales and the second with the Aztec lands. The first is messianic and heralds a return of Wales's greatness, and the second deals with a new country being created.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. <b>Both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very high energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing {{the size of the}} weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
50|$|Bryzhina and her {{daughter}} Yelizaveta <b>both</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> best performance of 22.44 seconds over 200m as of December 2012.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. Marine Raider {{stiletto}} {{was similar}} to the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife. Both were designed hilt heavy, to lie in the hand, to prevent dropping the stiletto. <b>Both</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tapered, double-edge blade with stiletto sharp tip and diamond shaped cross section, sharpened on both cutting edges {{all the way to the}} oval crossguard. They <b>both</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> slender symmetrical grip of [...] "Coca-Cola bottle" [...] shape and both weighed the same 1.5 lb.|$|R
50|$|<b>Both</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{fixed lens}} {{but to the}} front of which could be {{attached}} a supplementary lens, called the Teleskop 1.7x.|$|R
5|$|Similarities {{between the}} humerus of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus northropi have been noted; <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long, smooth deltopectoral crest, and a {{thickened}} humeral head. These were initially {{the basis of}} the taxon's referral to the clade Azhdarchidae, but they are also similar enough to be a basis for the synonymy of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. However, this is likely due to the relatively non-diagnostic nature of the humerus in giant azhdarchid taxonomy, and the lack of a detailed description for the elements of Q. northropi. However, the neck and jaw anatomy of Hatzegopteryx is quite clearly distinct from the smaller Q. sp., which warrants the retention of Hatzegopteryx as a taxon separate from Quetzalcoatlus.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are {{the object of the}} majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetaseI; however, the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, and might not reflect the organismal relationship(s).|$|E
5|$|The {{two stars}} in Serpens Caput that {{form part of}} the Snake's body below the heart are Epsilon and Mu Serpentis, both third-magnitude A-type main-sequence stars. <b>Both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> peculiarity: Epsilon is an Am star, while Mu is a binary. Located {{slightly}} northwest of Mu is 36 Serpentis, another A-type main-sequence star. This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a Lambda Boötis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B-type giant and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a slowly pulsating B star, which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, BBC and Sky Sports <b>both</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> presence, with Peter Alliss and Ewen Murray {{being the}} lead {{broadcaster}} for each.|$|R

5|$|Westgate-on-Sea {{is located}} in {{northeast}} Kent, {{on the coast of}} the Thames Estuary. It is bordered by the town of Margate to the east and the village of Birchington-on-Sea to the west. The town is built beside the two sandy bays of St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, which <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sea wall and groynes to prevent coastal flooding. Chalk cliffs are present in between the bays and either side of the bays. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E

25|$|The {{tertiary}} structure is formed by two domains {{known as the}} large and the small, which are separated by a cleft centred around {{the location of the}} bond with ATP-ADP+Pi. Below this there is a deeper notch called a “groove”. In the native state, despite their names, <b>both</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> comparable depth.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{editions of}} this book. <b>Both</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{embossed}} {{picture on the}} front of Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Turtle at the door to the hollow tree being greeted by Mr. Crow. <b>Both</b> editions <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dark green background, with white snow and black outlines.The difference between the editions is that one <b>has</b> <b>an</b> orange sky in the background, and the other does not.|$|R
