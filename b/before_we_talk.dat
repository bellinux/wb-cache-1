60|$|Oh, yes, and I gave Tom Spink a {{thrashing}} yesterday. Since {{the disappearance}} of the mate he had had little faith in me, and had been showing vague signs of insolence and insubordination.

Certainly we have not strength sufficient to clear away those fallen stones, and probably the cave is blocked by a wall several feet thick.

6000|$|As I {{have already}} hinted, my {{attempts}} in the sleep line proved a failure, for whenever I did drop off I was pursued by bad dreams, which resulted from lying down {{so soon after}} supper. I heard the cries of desperate men in their mortal agony. I saw a rain-swollen river; its waters were red with blood. I beheld a vision of one who I knew by his dress to be a Zulu king, although I could not see his face. He was flying and staggering with weariness as he fled. A great hound followed him. It lifted its head from the spoor; it was that of Zikali set upon the hound's body, Zikali who laughed instead of baying. Then one whose copper ornaments tinkled as she walked, entered beside me, whispering into my ear.

6000|$|When {{the night}} came on again {{as dark as}} before, it was the eighth night I had been on deck. Nor had I taken more than a very little sleep in the day-time, my station being always near the helm, and often at it, while we were among the ice. Few but those who have tried it can imagine the {{difficulty}} and pain of only keeping the eyes open--physically open--under such circumstances, in such darkness. They get struck by the darkness, and blinded by the darkness. They make patterns in it, and they flash in it, {{as if they had}} gone out of your head to look at you. On the turn of midnight, John Steadiman, who was alert and fresh (for I had always made him turn in by day), said to me, [...] "Captain Ravender, I entreat of you to go below. I am sure you can hardly stand, and your voice is getting weak, sir. Go below, and take a little rest. I'll call you if a block chafes." [...] I said to John in answer, [...] "Well, well, John!

40|$|My remarks will {{primarily}} {{deal with}} the principles of disaster planning as these can be derived from systematic social science studies. But <b>before</b> <b>we</b> can <b>talk</b> about principles, <b>we</b> need to clarify what is mean be disaster and by planning. Unless we agree one what <b>we</b> are <b>talking</b> about when <b>we</b> refer to disaster preparedness planning, there is little sense in talking of principles. In fact, as we shall note, social science research indicates that many problems in disaster preparedness stem from: 1) a failure to grasp what is basically involved in a disaster, and 2) a lack of understanding what constitutes good planning...|$|R

40|$|Before {{we think}} about reality, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about it or remain silent, first {{we have some of}} the most basic images. What do {{philosophers}} brought up in the given culture have in mind when they use the term ‘reality’? In this article I attempt to identify and elaborate the intellectual context proper to Chinese (especially Confucian and Daoist) philosophical culture, by presenting its most general features. How deep must we probe to find the internal network of sense that is the basis of Confucian, and daoist images of reality? What we are looking for can be found by trying to think in a context that is broader than the merely linguistic context. This broader context is that provided by philosophical understanding of the terms: ‘world,’ ‘individual being,’ ‘thing,’ ‘truth,’ ‘wisdom. ...|$|E
40|$|Mentor: Prof. Dr. Alba DUMIHuman {{resources}} {{are the most}} important factor in defining the success or the of a organization, let that be profitable or unprofitable. In the economic study world, this is a closed discussion, because of the large consensus on this case.

Of course <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about the impact of human resources and we'll see how this selection is made, how these human {{resources are}} directed and according to which criteria. As the role of human resources is important in the progress of a company or firm, then we can say that the impact of HR in the economy of countries is huge. Finally we will handle the case of Kosovo, human resource policies for our country and will see an opportunity to verify the role that a company provides human resources...|$|E

End-of-life issues in Canada have recently been highlighted due to the ongoing related debate about Physician assisted death in Canada. Former Federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose (July 15, 2013 to November 4, 2015) has stated: [...] "I think the starting point for me is that we still don't have the best elderly care and palliative care yet… So let's talk about making sure we have the best end-of-life care <b>before</b> <b>we</b> start <b>talking</b> about assisted suicide and euthanasia." ...|$|R
40|$|In this lecture we prove a {{lower bound}} {{on the size}} of a {{constant}} depth circuit which computes the XOR of n bits. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about bounds {{on the size of}} a circuit, let us first clarify what we mean by circuit depth and circuit size. The depth of a circuit is defined as the length of the longest path from the input to output. The size of a circuit is the number of AND and OR gates in the circuit. Note that, for our purpose, we assume all the gates have unlimited fan-in and fan-out. We define AC 0 to be the class of decision problems solvable by circuits of polynomial size and constant depth. We want to prove the result that PARITY is not in AC 0. There are two known techniques to prove this result. In this class, we will talk about a proof which uses polynomials; in the next class we will look at a different proof which uses random restrictions. 1 Circuit Upper Bounds for PARITY Before we go into our proof, let us first look at a circuit of constant depth d that compute...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{gives you}} a step-by-step instruction as how a vehicle-based guided tour may be created using a software system called Guided Tour System. This system is created and distributed by the Guided Tour Company. Interested readers are encouraged to visit their Second Life (SL) location below for a test ride and more information. At the time of purchase, (late October 2007), a GTS system with a 6 -person balloon ride was priced at L$ 4, 600. Guided Tour Company: secondlife://Mocha/ 238 / 74 / 32 <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about {{how to create a}} guided tour, one needs to know a few key concepts within the system. There are two main concepts: the concept of a tour “vehicle ” and the concept of a tour “base”. A tour vehicle gives a tour to its passengers. A tour base generates tour vehicles periodically, therefore repeating the tour automatically. The way it works is that the base will store all of the necessary information to generate a new working tour vehicle. Once a tour vehicle is generated, {{it can be used to}} carry Avatars to visit places and give appropriate commentaries along the way...|$|E
40|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the}} {{appropriateness}} of the repeat cesarean section on patients with a previous cesarean delivery, it is necessary to review some of the historical points that enabled us to perform cesarean sections and even be in the position to argue in good faith about the appropriateness or not of the procedure. In 1932 N. J. Eastman, acknowledged dean of American obstetricians at mid-century, stated that, if asked in what respect obstetrics had advanced most conspicuously during the preceding five decades, he would point to the changes in the indications, technique, and prognosis of cesarean section. The cesarean operation has spared maternal and infant lives in the millions and prevented countless cases of cerebral palsy and other birth injuries of the newborn and myriads of maternal genital fistulas. [1] The first cesarean section in the United States, as recorded by Harris [2] was performed on a snowbank (packed hill of snow) in Nassau, New York, in 1822 by the patient herself, a 14 -year-old. She survived the operation after her L-shaped abdominal incision was dressed by a Dr. Bassett, her employer, and Drs. John W. Francis and John B. Beck, who reported the case (6). The first professionally performed cesarean section in America was credited by Harris and subsequent historians [3] to Dr. John Lambert Richmond of Newtown, Ohio, and was performe...|$|E
40|$|The size of {{the hidden}} economy stays an eternal unknown question. Economists {{specialized}} in this topic talk about a “passion for the unknown” {{as it is a}} phenomenon that we know exists but we cannot include it in our GDP since we do not know its exact size. The question of what the hidden economy consists of is also interesting, mainly due to its omnipresence. The aim of the project is to find out what influences the hidden economy, mainly in Denmark but also using examples from other countries. We naturally needed to define and explain what the hidden economy was and what it entailed <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about ways of measuring and estimating it, so that the reader knows what the hidden economy is and where the statistics and numbers about it come from. Analyzing documents about it and looking at statistics, we then find out what the hidden economy is about, its size and nature in Denmark and what influences it, i. e. policies that can decrease and prevent the hidden economy. As we go along, we include the sociological and political aspect of the hidden economy as it is affected by culture and politics. The project provides an overview of the hidden economy, its causes and effects along with a range of policies that can influence it...|$|R
