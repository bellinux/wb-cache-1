This technique {{is based on the}} so-called block-by-block approach, which is a common method for the integral equations. In our approach, the classical block-by-block approach is improved in order to avoiding the coupling of the unknown solutions at each <b>block</b> <b>step</b> with an exception in the first two steps, while preserving the good stability property of the block-by-block schemes. By using this new approach, we are able to construct a high order schema for FODEs of the order alpha, alpha > 0. The stability and convergence of the schema is rigorously established. We prove that the numerical solution converges to the exact solution with order 3 + alpha for 0 1. A series of numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical claims.

40|$|Pre-mRNA {{splicing}} {{takes place}} in two catalytic steps. The second step is poorly understood, especially in mammals. In yeast, the splicing factors, Prps 16, 17, 18 and Slu 7 function exclusively in step II. Here we report the isolation of cDNAs encoding human Prps 16 and 17 which are 41 and 36 % identical to their yeast counterparts. The Prp 16 gene is essential in yeast, and we show that a chimeric yeast-human Prp 16 protein rescues a yeast Prp 16 knockout strain. Immunodepletion of hPrp 16 from splicing extracts specifically blocks step II, and the activity can be fully restored with recombinant hPrp 16. Moreover, both hPrps 16 and 17 associate with the spliceosome late in the splicing pathway. Mutations at the 3 ' splice site that specifically <b>block</b> <b>step</b> II do not affect the association of hPrps 16 and 17 with the spliceosome, indicating that these factors may function at a stage of step II prior to recognition of the 3 ' splice site. Recently, the human homologs of Prp 18 and Slu 7 were identified. The observation that humans contain homologs of all four known step II proteins in yeast indicates that the mechanism for catalytic step II is highly conserved...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} {{reproducibility}} in measurement {{of physical activity}} performance using the ActiGraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer in children aged 8 – 16 years with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). Methods: Reproducibility of standardized tasks: Thirty-two children with ABI (12 years 1 month, SD = 2 years 4 months; 20 males; Gross Motor Function Classification System I = 17, II = 15) performed the following activities on 2 consecutive days while wearing an accelerometer and a heart rate monitor: quiet sitting, slow walking (SW), moderate walking (MW), fast walking (FW) and rapid stepping on/off a <b>block</b> (<b>STEP).</b> Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Performance variability: Fifty-one participants (12 years 1 month, SD = 2 years 5 months; 27 males; GMFCS I = 26, II = 25) wore an accelerometer for 4 days {{in the community and}} reliability coefficients were calculated using standardized 12 -hour time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results: Test–re-test reproducibility was excellent for all activities (SW, ICC = 0. 90; MW, ICC = 0. 83; FW, ICC = 0. 91; STEP, ICC = 0. 89). Three days of monitoring produced excellent variability estimates of MVPA (R = 0. 78). Conclusion: Therapists can confidently use accelerometry as a reproducible measure of physical activity under standardized walking and stepping conditions, {{as well as in the}} community for children with ABI...|$|E

This prompted us to prove, whether non-specific Ab binding may really lead to unwanted background staining in routinely processed cell and tissue probes. In this study, the probes were fixed and processed according to routine protocols with and without a <b>blocking</b> <b>step</b> (goat serum or BSA). Surprisingly, all Ab in probes processed without a <b>blocking</b> <b>step</b> did not show any propensity towards non-specific binding {{that might lead to}} background staining, thus implying that endogenous Fc receptors do not retain their ability to bind Fc portion of Ab after standard fixation. Likewise in routinely fixed probes, we did not find any non-specific Ab binding ascribed to a combination of ionic and hydrophobic interactions.

40|$|The current {{protocols}} for blocking background staining in immunohistochemistry {{are based}} on conflicting reports.

In this study, cell and tissue samples were processed according to routine protocols either with or without a <b>blocking</b> <b>step</b> (goat serum or BSA). Surprisingly, no Abs in samples processed without a <b>blocking</b> <b>step</b> showed any propensity for non-specific binding leading to background staining, implying that endogenous FcRs do not retain their ability to bind the Fc portion of Abs after standard fixation.

The results are consistent with the existence of an infrared fixed point (IRFP) for all investigated lattice volumes and number of <b>blocking</b> <b>steps.</b> We also compare different renormalization schemes, each of which indicates an IRFP at a slightly different value of the bare coupling, as expected for an IR-conformal theory.

40|$|U 6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is {{the most}} highly conserved of the five spliceosomal snRNAs that {{participate}} in nuclear mRNA splicing. The proposal that U 6 snRNA plays a key catalytic role in splicing [D. Brow and C. Guthrie, Nature (London) 337 : 14 - 15, 1989] {{is supported by the}} phylogenetic conservation of U 6, the sensitivity of U 6 to mutation, cross-linking of U 6 to the vicinity of the 5 ' splice site, and genetic evidence for extensive base pairing between U 2 and U 6 snRNAs. We chose to mutate the phylogenetically invariant 41 -ACAGAGA- 47 and 53 -AGC- 55 sequences of human U 6 because certain point mutations within the homologous regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae U 6 selectively block the first or second step of mRNA splicing. We found that both sequences are more tolerant to mutation in human cells (assayed by transient expression in vivo) than in S. cerevisiae (assayed by effects on growth or in vitro splicing). These differences may reflect different rate-limiting steps in the particular assays used or differential reliance on redundant RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. The ability of mutations in U 6 nucleotides A- 45 and A- 53 to selectively <b>block</b> <b>step</b> 2 of splicing in S. cerevisiae had previously been construed as evidence that these residues might participate directly in the second chemical step of splicing; an indirect, structural role seems more likely because the equivalent mutations have no obvious phenotype in the human transient expression assay...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obtaining deeper {{sections}} or step sections is {{a common}} practice for small skin biopsies. Much of the available literature {{highlights the importance of}} step sections in neoplastic diseases of skin. However, the routine dermatopathology practice in developing countries shows a predominant burden of nonneoplastic diseases, and the utility of step sections in this context has not been much reported. Objective: The study was aimed to evaluate the utility of prospective step sections in routine dermatopathology practice. Materials and Methods: The present study comprising 200 consecutive skin biopsies was carried out in a prospective manner. Three slides were prepared in each case: Slide 0 was prepared from the ribbon of tissue obtained from untrimmed <b>block,</b> <b>step</b> sections 1 and 2 were obtained at 50 μm and 100 μm depth, respectively. The diagnosis was rendered on slide 0 and subsequently reviewed after examining step section 1 and 2. Results: Of the 200 cases, additional findings on step sections were found in 18 cases (9 %) which led to change in diagnosis in 10 (5 %) cases. Step section 1 led to correct diagnosis in 6 cases (3 %). Step section 2 led to correct diagnosis in 10 cases (5 %); however, this was statistically not significant (P ≥ 0. 065) when comparing to step section 1. Additional findings which led to diagnosis was most commonly found in the cases of borderline tuberculoid leprosy (5 out of 10 cases) followed by bullous disorders. Conclusion: We therefore believe that step sections improve the diagnostic accuracy in skin biopsies and they are, especially useful in suspected cases of Hansen's disease. There is no statistical advantage of step section 2 versus step section 1; although, step section 2 had shown to include all the additional findings which led to a change in diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Unsupervised {{learning}} involves {{exploring the}} unlabeled data {{to find some}} intrinsic or hidden structures. Duplicate detection enables to identify the records that represent the same real world entity. In the field of Data mining, there is an exponential growth in the amount data available. Thus, linking or matching records from various web databases is a major challenge as it involves complexity of comparing, each record in one database with all the records in other databases. Supervised learning methods fail in web database scenario as the records to be matched are query dependent. In the previous work, to handle this context, an online based untrained record linkage method, UDD was suggested. UDD proficiently identifies corresponding record pairs that represent same entity, from multiple web databases but is time consuming. This paper focuses on enhancing the performance of UDD by adding a <b>blocking</b> <b>step.</b> A computationally cheap clustering approach, Canopy Clustering is deployed in <b>blocking</b> <b>step.</b> Thus, prior to classifying records into duplicates and non-duplicates, clustering is performed and blocks of candidate record pairs are generated. Experimental results show that blocking optimizes the working of UDD in web database scenario...|$|R
40|$|An immunoenzyme double-staining {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} detection of two cellular epitopes, using commercially available mouse monoclonal antibodies, is described. The method employs {{a combination of}} the suppression of endogenous biotin and two successive indirect techniques with a <b>blocking</b> <b>step</b> in between. The first indirect method involves an unlabelled monoclonal antibody followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin. After a <b>blocking</b> <b>step</b> with normal mouse serum, the second indirect method is applied using a biotinylated monoclonal antibody followed by the visualization of this antibody by avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC) or rabbit anti-biotin and peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin in successive steps. Using these methods in combination with the introduction of dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and tetramethylbenzidine as chromogens for peroxidase activity, two cellular epitopes could be distinguished clearly in tissue sections by the green- and violet-stained peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase activities, respectively. The expression of two epitopes on the same cellular constituent is outlined by the coappearance of both enzyme activities as a bluish-purple colour. This method allows for the simultaneous identification, localization and enumeration of two cellular epitopes. These can serve as parameters for a number of pathological processe...|$|R
