40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the smaller}} {{cross-sectional}} area, the flexural properties often become the controlling factor in PHC pile. Φ 500 PHC is widely used as an engineering design pile in the Yangtze River Delta region. On {{the basis of the}} analysis of pile soil interaction mechanism, the single Pile under different conditions is discussed. The parameters are discussed in this article are PHC pile’s wall thickness, horizontal loads, bending moments, pile elastic modulus and other engineering parameters. The studies show that, the distribution of bending moment and shear is significant in 2 ~ 4 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile, and after 6 m, the value of them closes to 0. The main sphere of influence of the single pile bending moment and shear is concentrated at 3 ~ 4 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile. Along with horizontal load enlargement, the maximum bending moment is mainly concentrated at 1. 5 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile, and the maximum pile shear is mainly concentrated at 1. 9 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile. Along with bending moment {{on the top of the}} pile enlarge, the maximum bending moment is mainly concentrated at 2. 5 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile, and the maximum pile shear is mainly concentrated at 3. 0 m <b>below</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile. Optimize sectional area of Φ 500 PHC should be selected as 0. 17, and the wall thickness should be selected as 170 mm...|$|R
50|$|The {{main part}} of a {{bladderwort}} plant always lies beneath <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> its substrate. Terrestrial species sometimes produce a few photosynthetic leaf-shoots which lie unobtrusively flat against <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> their soil, and in almost all species only the flowering stems rise above and are prominent.

5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend {{the shores of the}} lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E

5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

25|$|Unlike their pliosauroid cousins, plesiosauroids (with the {{exception}} of the Polycotylidae) were probably slow swimmers.

Their four-flippered swimming adaptation may have given them exceptional maneuverability, so that they could swiftly rotate their bodies as an aid to catching prey.|$|E
