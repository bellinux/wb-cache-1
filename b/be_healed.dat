Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account {{that can be}} withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items {{can be used for}} a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can <b>be</b> <b>healed</b> for a fee.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to <b>be</b> <b>healed.</b> The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} ofswitching {{from one}} type ofHz-receptor antag-onist (Hz-blocker) to another, {{in the treatment}} of Hz-blocker-resistant ulcers was investigated using Hz-blockers with five-membered rings (five-membered-ring agents) - such as cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine- and an Hz-blocker with a six-membered ring, roxatidine. By switching from a five-membered-ring agent to roxatidine {{in the treatment of}} five-membered-ring resistant ulcers (study I), gastric ulcers <b>were</b> <b>healed</b> in nine of 19 patients (47 %) and duodenal ulcers <b>were</b> <b>healed</b> in eight of nine patients (89 %). By switching from roxatidine to one of the five-membered-ring agents in the treatment ofroxatidine-resistant ulcers (study II), gastric ulcer <b>was</b> <b>healed</b> in six of 15 patients (40 %), and duodenal ulcer <b>was</b> <b>healed</b> in 4 of 10 patients (40 %).

5|$|In the 1880s Muller {{was active}} for his businesses, and {{travelled}} to the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In {{the same year}} he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the Gold Coast, for Hendrik Muller & Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out {{with his father and}} younger brother Abram Muller, about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never <b>be</b> <b>healed</b> and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career.|$|E
5|$|Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus are not {{the same}} character. Additionally, he stated that by playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to {{distinguish}} Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true personality. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection. The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus' heart entered Sora's body and Roxas' birth allowed Ventus to influence his appearance. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus' broken heart <b>be</b> <b>healed</b> by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned. Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English.|$|E
5|$|Over time, some {{attributes}} now {{regarded as}} integral became {{incorporated into the}} vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to <b>be</b> <b>healed</b> by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.|$|E

5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to <b>be</b> <b>healed</b> or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{has been}} often {{dismissed}} as a fable and Paul was conscious {{of the risk of}} disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king Ratchis. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed {{to be part of a}} shamanistic ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father <b>be</b> <b>healed</b> through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to <b>be</b> <b>healed.</b> While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this double-blind, {{multicentre}} {{study was to}} compare duodenal ulcer healing rates after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with either 20 mg omeprazole o. m. or 150 mg ranitidine b. d. One hundred and eighty-one patients were randomized: 91 received omeprazole and 90 received ranitidine. In a per protocol analysis at 2 weeks, 63 % of the patients <b>were</b> <b>healed</b> on omeprazole and 65 % of the patients <b>were</b> <b>healed</b> on ranitidine (N.

There were no differences in ulcer symptom relief between the two groups. There were no significant changes in laboratory values in either of the groups. Adverse events were few and mainly mild and transient. We conclude that both omeprazole (20 mg o. m.) and ranitidine (150 mg b. d.) result in rapid, ulcer healing rate...|$|R

25|$|Eco{{feminism}} is a {{term that}} links feminism with ecology. Its advocates say that paternalistic/capitalistic society {{has led to a}} harmful split between nature and culture. Early ecofeminists propagated that the split can only <b>be</b> <b>healed</b> by the feminine instinct for nurture and holistic knowledge of nature's processes. Modern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such essentialism and instead focuses more on intersectional questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.|$|E
