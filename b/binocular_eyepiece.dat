25|$|Aiming {{to produce}} an {{affordable}} virtual reality console, Nintendo released the Virtual Boy in 1995, designed by Gunpei Yokoi. The console consists of a head-mounted semi-portable system with one red-colored screen {{for each of the}} user's eyes, featuring stereoscopic graphics. Games are viewed through a <b>binocular</b> <b>eyepiece</b> and controlled using an affixed gamepad. Critics were generally disappointed with the quality of the games and the red-colored graphics, and complained of gameplay-induced headaches. The system sold poorly and was quietly discontinued. Amid the system's failure, Yokoi retired from Nintendo. During the same year, Nintendo launched the Satellaview in Japan, a peripheral for the Super Famicom. The accessory allowed users to play video games via broadcast for a set period of time. Various games were made exclusively for the platform, as well as various remakes.|$|E

50|$|The Mantis Elite is {{a stereo}} {{microscope}} developed by Vision Engineering Ltd (located in Send, Nr.

Heterophoria (as oculomotor function) and glare recovery time (time required for photochemical and neural recovery after {{exposure to a}} flash stimulus) are measured, in research aimed at developing automated objective measurement of dynamic vision functions.

50|$|The {{eye relief}} given in product {{specifications}} {{does not always}} give a realistic view of what a user can expect. Although eye-cups can usually be folded down to allow the spectacle wearer {{to get closer to}} <b>binocular</b> <b>eyepieces,</b> there are sometimes lens mountings that do not allow the theoretical eye relief to be obtained. A better measure for those with strict needs would be one that takes account of this available eye relief, the theoretical value less any thickness of the lens' rims. This point can account for confusion in performance and is rarely expressed clearly.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY We have {{constructed}} a new indirect ophthalmoscope. This instrument has a T-shaped housing composed of an illuminating tube and a viewing tube. A fiberoptic light source provides illumination. The inverted aerial {{image of the}} fundus coincides with {{the plane of the}} viewing window of the housing. This unit can be easily connected to a television camera for television ophthalmoscopy or to an image intensifier for infrared ophthalmoscopy. Conventional indirect ophthalmoscopes ' comprise a head band, which carries a light-projection system, and viewing optics, usually a <b>binocular</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> The projection system forms abeam oflight that is directed into the patient's eye through a hand-held condensing lens. The reflected light from the retinapasses through the same condensing lens and forms an inverted aerial image seen by the observer in the viewing optics. Such instruments are widely used but have a number of disadvantages. The light projector and viewin...|$|E
50|$|<b>Binocular</b> <b>eyepieces</b> usually {{consist of}} three or more lens {{elements}} in two or more groups. The lens furthest from the viewer's eye is called the field lens and that closest to the eye the eye lens. The most common configuration is that invented in 1849 by Carl Kellner. In this arrangement, the eye lens is a plano-concave/ double convex achromatic doublet (the flat part of the former facing the eye) and the field lens is a double-convex singlet. A reversed Kellner eyepiece was developed in 1975 and in it the field lens is a double concave/ double convex achromatic doublet and the eye lens is a double convex singlet. The reverse Kellner provides 50% more eye relief and works better with small focal ratios as well as having a slightly wider field.|$|R
