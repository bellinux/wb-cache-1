5000|$|Slava's own {{mechanical}} movements feature two mainspring <b>barrels</b> <b>coupled</b> {{together with}} an idler gear. There are many versions of the movement including manual wind 2414 and 2428 (double date)and self-winding 2416 and 2427 (double date). The movements are quite sensitive to shocks due to thin balance staff. Other frequent problems include premature wear of rotor bearing and the clutch driving the hands (not a typical cannon pinion). Also the date indicator malfunctions are common. The movements are thus considered unreliable, especially compared to other Russian calibres. Earlier the 2nd Moscow Factory produced movements derived from an old pre-war French movement, the Lip [...] "T-15" [...] (also some Poljot movements were derived from this French brand), and produced under license (brands Pobeda and Start). In addition to that, for relative brief periods, Slava also produced its own electronic movements using tuning fork and quartz systems. Some Slava watches were produced under Sekonda brand names.|$|R
40|$|Italy has {{the third}} largest public debt of the World in {{absolute}} terms and the eighth when it is GDP weighted. In addition, Italy presents {{the largest and most}} persistent development gap among its regional economies in the group of the advanced countries. Is there a link between these two facts? We present evidence in favor of a relationship between these two empirical facts by reconstructing the entire dynamics of national public deficit as a weighted sum of four macro regional deficits (Northeast, Northwest, Centre and South). We show that the ultimate cause of the accumulation of public debt in Italy lies in the extraordinary fiscal imbalance of the Southern regions. We then focus on the determinants of the regional public deficits and their persistence. Thanks to the reconstruction of the regional deficit time series we are able to test empirically many of the several theoretical approaches suggested in the literature, including the geographically dispersed interest approach not yet considered for the Italian case. This approach turns {{out to be one of}} the best candidates to account for the size and persistence of Southern regional deficits. The whole evidence suggests the existence of a pork <b>barrel</b> mechanism <b>coupled</b> with a complex geo-political equilibrium that has allowed the Southern regions of Italy to generate deficits so large and persistent that they hoard the entire Italian National debt...|$|R
50|$|Conversely, too-high {{a rate of}} twist {{can also}} cause problems. The {{excessive}} twist can cause accelerated <b>barrel</b> wear, and <b>coupled</b> with high velocities also induce a very high spin rate which can cause projectile jacket ruptures causing high velocity spin stabilized projectiles to disintegrate in flight. Projectiles made out of mono metals cannot practically achieve flight and spin velocities such that they disintegrate in flight due to their spin rate. Smokeless powder can produce muzzle velocities of approximately 1600 m/s for spin stabilized projectiles and more advanced propellants used in smoothbore tank guns can produce muzzle velocities of approximately 1800 m/s. A higher twist than needed can also cause more subtle problems with accuracy: Any inconsistency within the bullet, such as a void that causes an unequal distribution of mass, may be magnified by the spin. Undersized bullets also have problems, as they may not enter the rifling exactly concentric and coaxial to the bore, and excess twist will exacerbate the accuracy problems this causes.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} {{investigations have}} shown {{some of the}} differences between the behaviours of the barrel and the clamshell shapes of droplets on ?lter ?bres in ?ow ?elds. Realistic ?ow velocities (such as those used in many industrial ?lter systems) were utilised. The forces acting are air drag, interfacial tension and gravity. The properties of the interfacial restoring force are modelled, and show agreement with the experimental results, at least in the linear extension region before the onset of oscillatory behaviour of the droplets(induced by instability of the ?ow?eld). The model for the oscillatory behaviour is explored, and the natural frequencies of oscillation in the radial and transverse directions are shown to be the same, for the barrel shape. The clamshell shape also has the same natural frequencies, but they are different to those of the <b>barrel</b> shape. The <b>coupling</b> of the radial and transverse oscillation models is explored for both the barrel and clamshell shape. Some contact angle results are given, both without air?ow acting on the droplet and with increasing air?ow. No Full Tex...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{in spite}} of the {{benefits}} of the modern carbine, many armies are experiencing a certain backlash against the universal equipping of soldiers with carbines and lighter rifles in general, and are equipping selected soldiers, usually called Designated Marksmen, or DM, with higher-power rifles. Another problem comes from the loss of muzzle velocity caused by the shorter <b>barrel,</b> which when <b>coupled</b> with the typical small, lightweight bullets, causes effectiveness to be diminished; a 5.56mm gets its lethality from its high velocity, and when fired from the 14.5" [...] M4 carbine, its power, penetration, and range are diminished. Thus, there has been a move towards adopting a slightly more powerful round tailored for high performance from both long and short barrels. The US has done experiments regarding adopting a new, slightly larger and heavier caliber such as the 6.5mm Grendel or 6.8mm Remington SPC, which are heavier and thus retain more effectiveness at lower muzzle velocities, but has for the time decided to retain the 5.56mm NATO round as standard issue.|$|R
2500|$|The History of Conecuh Ridge Whiskey {{begins with}} Clyde May, a legendary Alabama moonshiner and bootlegger. From the 1950s to the 1980s Clyde managed to produce around 300 gallons {{a week in}} a still of his own design in the woods near Almeria, Alabama in Bullock County, {{southeast}} of Montgomery. His product was known for its high quality relative to typical moonshine. According to his son, Kenny, the reason was his painstaking insistence on using the best equipment he could fabricate and taking extra steps during production to maintain the purity and quality of the product. While much of it was sold, unaged, as corn liquor, a certain amount would be casked in charred <b>barrels</b> with a <b>couple</b> of dried apples for flavor. This would be aged for about one year. Clyde claimed that the hot Alabama summers accelerated the effect of aging, requiring only one year instead of the minimum of two given to Kentucky Bourbons. This would be bottled and given to friends and valued customers as [...] "Christmas Whiskey". Always operating outside the state liquor laws, Clyde May served an 18-month sentence at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1973. He gave up his cell to the man who convicted him, Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who was convicted in 1974 on charges from the Watergate scandal.|$|R
5000|$|He {{approached}} Theodore Havemeyer, {{whose family}} controlled {{much of the}} sugar refining industry, to secure backing for his invention. However, Havemeyer insisted that Friend reveal his process before providing any financial backing. Friend refused, since he had no machine to show. Friend turned to other potential investors, setting up [...] "demonstrations" [...] and telling investors they would become rich beyond their wildest dreams. Friend and Howard set up demonstrations at their home in New York, hoping to lure investors. The potential investors would bring in a barrel of dirty, unrefined sugar, along with a clean, empty barrel for the refined sugar. The potential investors {{had to leave the}} room while he used his so-called secret machine to turn raw sugar into refined sugar. In fact, Olive or someone else was upstairs with bags of pure white refined sugar. [...] "Prof." [...] Friend would empty the unrefined sugar into a pipe leading into the river. Olive poured the clean sugar {{through a hole in the}} floor, filling the clean <b>barrel.</b> After a <b>couple</b> hours or so, Friend invited the prospective investors into his room where they could admire the results of his wonderful machine—a clean barrel full of beautiful white refined sugar. Friend's supposed refining always took place in a secret room, where he simply switched a barrel of refined sugar for a barrel of raw sugar, and claimed that his machine had done the refining.|$|R
5000|$|Scamper was a bay American Quarter Horse gelding foaled in 1977 {{and given}} the {{registered}} name Gills Bay Boy. Walter [...] "Buddy" [...] Draper raised Scamper in Wetmore, Colorado. The gelding could be tracked to Three Bars on his sire's side. When Scamper bucked Buddy off, sending him to the hospital, he sent the horse to an auction. Scamper was resold several times via auction before landing in the James family's feedlot in Clayton, New Mexico. Charmayne's father picked up the gelding from a cowboy who worked there, paying $1,100. One of the cowboys in the James' feedlot, Ron Holland, expertly and patiently retrained the horse so there were no issues with him any longer. They used Scamper to sort cattle; the horse was so nimble he excelled at it. However, Charmayne, had been searching quite some time for a replacement for her last barrel racing horse, Bardo, who had broken his leg, and appealed to her father for help. Her father then mentioned the little horse in his feedlot. He said the horse was cold backed, so [...] "do not lope him right off." [...] Nonetheless, 12 year old Charmayne took the horse where no could see him and loped him. The horse bucked a little, and she laughed. The horse looked at her, and Charmayne later stated that {{she knew that he}} loved her. Somehow, she felt the horse would never hurt her. When she first started him running him around the barrels, he took right to it. When her father was watching, he commented, “He sure wants to scamper around those barrels”. That was how he got his nickname. Scamper was 4 years old when he started <b>barrel</b> racing. A <b>couple</b> weeks after James started running Scamper, they took their first win at a small playday.|$|R
