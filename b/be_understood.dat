5|$|Advocates of {{changing}} the team's name say that stereotypes of Native Americans must <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{in the context of}} a history that includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts by federal and state governments to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding mirror symmetry was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996. According to their conjecture, {{now known as}} the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> by dividing a Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces and then transforming them to get the mirror Calabi–Yau.|$|E

25|$|When Buddhism was {{introduced}} in China it <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> in native terms. Various sects struggled to attain {{an understanding of the}} Indian texts. The Tathāgatagarbha sūtras and the idea of the Buddha-nature were endorsed because of the perceived similarities with the Tao, which <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. Śūnyatā at first <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> as pointing to the Taoist wu.|$|R

5|$|General {{relativity}} can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{by examining}} its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The {{first step is}} the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{as a physical}} principle that could be {{described in terms of}} the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E
5|$|Rule 184 can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{in terms}} of {{ballistic}} annihilation, a system of particles moving both leftwards and rightwards through a one-dimensional medium. When two such particles collide, they annihilate each other, so that at each step the number of particles remains unchanged or decreases.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cognitive}} linguistics, the {{invariance principle}} {{is a simple}} attempt to explain {{similarities and differences between}} how an idea <b>is</b> <b>understood</b> in [...] "ordinary" [...] usage, and how it <b>is</b> <b>understood</b> when used as a conceptual metaphor.|$|R

5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} {{the subject matter of the}} poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} Perl can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> as a {{response}} to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the Book of the Dead was known {{as early as the}} Middle Ages, well before its contents could <b>be</b> <b>understood.</b> Since it was found in tombs, it was evidently a document of a religious nature, and this led to the widespread misapprehension that the Book of the Dead was the equivalent of a Bible or Qur'an.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} layers {{deposited}} varies with {{location in the}} Lake Lewis basin. This can best <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{as the result of}} multiple floods; the variable levels correspond to Lake Missoula breaching the ice dam at varying lake levels, releasing different volumes of flood waters. This would suggest the time between floods is variable.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{relating the}} two radial forces can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular momenta) causes {{a difference in}} the centripetal force requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.|$|E

5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of {{political}} organization, including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international {{organizations such as the}} United Nations.

5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkakus Zeros stayed behind {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not <b>be</b> <b>understood.</b> This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E
