30|$|Collaborations: There {{are several}} ways to {{understand}} the concept collaboration. For example, Briggs et al. [53] identify seven different layers within the concept. Nunamaker et al. [54] distinguish three levels of collaboration, i.e. collective, coordinated, and concerted. Collective collaboration happens when people work individually towards a common goal. More careful coordination of (still individual) work becomes necessary, as soon as dependencies of work increase. When any <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> synchronization endanger the common undertaking, concerted collaboration is required.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: to {{determine}} influence of health related technology on physical condition level of primary school pupils. Material: {{in the research}} two groups of first form pupils participated: control group (n= 28) and experimental group (n= 26). Level of children’s physical fitness was determined {{with the help of}} isolated motor tests. At home pupils fulfilled independently and with parents the learned at classes exercises for prophylaxis of posture disorders and for stretching. During fulfillment home tasks or other work in sitting position children were involved by parents in practicing of the worked out by us physical exercises’ breaks. Results: we observed rising of pupils’ physical fitness level: flexibility, ability to keep static balance, power endurance of back and abdomen muscles. To the highest extent yoga aerobic means influenced on flexibility and static balance indicators. Conclusions: when choosing physical exercises for short <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> we considered content of pupils’ learning functioning at definite lesson. All complexes of exercises are to be fulfilled reading texts of the worked out by us verses. It facilitates pupils to better memorize sequence of exercises’ fulfillment and gives emotional coloring to physical exercises...|$|E

50|$|Baiju was {{transmitted}} {{only by the}} laboring people. It {{started from}} workers in brocade workshops. As a derivative of cloud-pattern brocade, the entertainment during <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> at the cloud-pattern brocade loom rooms {{marked the beginning of}} the baiju art. The brocade workers lived a painful life. It is a complex and monotonous job to weave cloud-pattern brocades, and a journeyman must spend years to finish one. Due to Nanjing's climate, cold in winter and hot in summer, the workers labored in harsh conditions for low pay. To divert themselves from the monotony of their jobs, workers started singing popular ditties, which developed into baiju. At that time, these workers sang about history, folktales and social news, to the tunes of Ming and Qing dynasty folk songs.|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} {{substantial}} {{changes in the}} costs and benefits of investment in tertiary education in Australia in the past twenty years. This paper compares the ex ante private rate of return to investment in a university education based on cross section data, for cohorts studying at the time of the 1986 and 1991 Population Censuses, with the ex post results estimated from tracking a synthetic cohort over time between Censuses. Private rates of return have been estimated for both males and females. These two cohorts have achieved rates of return that are at least as high and often better than those predicted on the basis of ex ante calculations using cross-section data. This is an interesting result for individuals and policy makers evaluating past investment in higher education. The higher ex post return reflects the increasing returns to skill in the Australian labour market over the 1990 s that have been documented in other studies. The paper also presents hypothetical results to illustrate the effects of the introduction of HECS and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> history on the private rate of return. 1...|$|R
5000|$|A {{comparison}} with another innovation such as Ajax (programming) is justified. The name Ajax could regularly {{be found in}} the media in 2005, as Google used its asynchronous communications paradigm in interactive applications such as Google Maps.

The IBM 3270 terminals from the 1970s also worked with [...] "forms" [...] (actually screens) that needed to be completed leading to delays and disturbing <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> the <b>work.</b> Maestro remedied these delays, similarly to Ajax some thirty years later.|$|R
