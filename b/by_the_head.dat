The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New. The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society, chaired by Cyril Alington.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been turned}} down by several {{professional}} clubs, including Newcastle United, Sunderland, Derby County and Southport, Bruce {{was about to start}} work as an apprentice plumber at the Swan Hunter dockyard when he was offered a trial by Third Division club Gillingham, whose manager Gerry Summers had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament. He travelled down to Kent with another player from the Wallsend club, Peter Beardsley, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. At the time Bruce was playing as a midfielder, but he was switched to the centre of defence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of Gillingham's youth scheme, Bill Collins, whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Gens {{was named}} the {{commander}} of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of the ghetto. Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the single most important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in the ghetto.|$|E

5|$|In this context, Castelli and Álzaga plotted to oust Liniers and {{constitute}} a local government Junta, {{similar to those}} of the metropoli. This project was not shared by most of the natives or <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the Regiment of Patricians, Cornelio Saavedra. Manuel Belgrano proposed as an alternative to support the plans of Princess Charlotte, which were supported by Castelli and other criollos. Belgrano, who held monarchist ideas, argued that the Carlotist project would be the most practical means of achieving independence from Spain in the circumstances. On September 20, 1808, Castelli wrote a letter to Charlotte, with the signatures of Antonio Beruti, Hipólito Vieytes, Belgrano, and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August, Quwatli {{established}} a long-term {{agreement with the}} USSR, entailing a long-term Soviet loan to fund development works in Syria and the Soviet purchase of {{a large portion of}} Syrian agricultural and textile surpluses. US fears that Syria was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attaché from Damascus. The US, which denied the coup plot, responded by expelling the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador from Syria.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg {{was granted}} {{a room in the}} palace to use for fortune telling, which the king made sure was stocked with alcohol, as they enjoyed {{drinking}} together. In late January, the king appointed Rosenberg as a customs appraiser in Honolulu, although the appointment was controversial; by mid-February he was fired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of customs. One month later, Rosenberg was reappointed by order of the king and the following month the head of customs resigned. Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the king's brother-in-law, was appointed as the new head of customs. Between March and May 1887, Rosenberg was paid $300, ostensibly for working as a guard at the Customs Office, although it was alleged that Rosenberg's position was a sinecure.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Daruvar Agreement, {{mediated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the United Nations (UN) Civil Affairs in Sector West Gerard Fischer, {{was negotiated}} in secrecy.

The agreement itself was labeled as treasonous by the central RSK authorities. Fischer and other UN officials, who were involved in mediation of the agreement, were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive in the matter. Fischer soon left the area.|$|E

5|$|The first {{permanent}} Russian {{settlements in}} what is today the US state of Alaska were set down in the 1790s, forming Russian Alaska, after Tsar Peter I called for expeditions across the Bering Strait in 1725, with the region administered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the Russian-American Company as the Emperor's representative. Another Russian outpost, Fort Ross, was established in 1812 {{in what is}} now California. The colonies, however, were never profitable enough to maintain Russian interest in the area, with the population only ever reaching a maximum of 700. Fort Ross was sold in 1841, and in 1867, a deal was brokered whereby Tsar Alexander II sold his Alaskan territory to the United States for $7,200,000, and the official transfer took place on 30 October that year.|$|E

Mizushima was repeatedly harassed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> employees at Aniplex to speed up work on the storyboards. The artwork for the film was produced once Kaneko was finished and cel-animation was used to produce several characters or items in the film. Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.|$|E
