40|$|AbstractLet H be a Hilbert {{space and}} B(H) the algebra of all bounded linear {{operators}} on H. It {{is known that}} {{there are two kinds of}} maximal abelian sub-algebras in B(H), to one of which there exists a unique faithful normal projection of norm one from B(H) and to the other any projection of norm one is singular. Any maximal abelian subalgebra A contains a projection e such that Ae is a maximal abelian subalgebra <b>of</b> <b>B(eH)</b> <b>of</b> the first kind and A(1 − e) is the one of the second kind in B((1 − e) H). This will be generalized to an arbitrary von Neumann algebra together with the existence problem of those kinds of maximal abelian subalgebras...|$|R
40|$|A scheme {{has been}} {{proposed}} to classify valence bond (VB) wave functions for the calculations of ground and excited states, according to the symmetry properties of one-electron orbitals which {{are involved in the}} construction of VB wave functions. This scheme is illustrated by the examples <b>of</b> <b>BeH</b> and BH. Ab initio VB computations of these two test molecules in combination with the present classification scheme give reliable results. For example, calculation results show that the state C(2) Sigma(+) <b>of</b> <b>BeH</b> is stable, with the bonding energy 0. 87 eV and bond length 0. 238 nm, which are in good agreement with those obtained by Gerratt et al.

30|$|Because the TrEffeR data {{provide only}} sparse {{information}} on employment periods, we add {{information on the}} characteristics of the job – in particular on wages – from the employment history files (<b>BeH)</b> <b>of</b> the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). These files provide more detailed information on wages and on the establishment; they are based on notifications of employment to social security bodies. Daily wages are computed by dividing the entire payment during an employment spell by the duration of the spell in days (including days without work). However, there is an upper bound on the wage information at the social security thresholds. For the merged data set, we had to correct several smaller inconsistencies within and between both underlying data sets. Regarding the duration of subsidization, the data provide information on factual, but not on planned program duration. Regrettably, the data do not provide information on working times of individual workers, whether an employer applies a collective contract, on the individual caseworker involved and on mean tenure within firms.|$|R

Main results of this study are summarized as follows; 1) Forms of the reef blocks on the sea bed can be classified in three types referred to they as column type, rectangular post type and semispheric type, respectively. 2) Experimentally, it have been clarified that wave damping effects of the sea bed with reef blocks depend upon not only usual frictional effect of the sea bed, but also the effects of form resistance of reef blocks due to wakes occurred in <b>behing</b> <b>of</b> each blocks. 3) Thoretical values of coefficients of wave transmition on the reef were shown good agreement with the experimental ones...|$|R
