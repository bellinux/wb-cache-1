25|$|Meanwhile, Chan was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{frustrated}} {{at the lack}} of progress. Following a round of negotiations in Cairns, Australia, in September and December 1995, between the BRA, BTG and the PNG government, in January 1996 the BRA/BIG representatives, including Kabui, were fired on by PNGDF forces after returning to Bougainville. Later, the home of the BIG's representative in the Solomon Islands, Martin Mirori, was firebombed. The BRA subsequently undertook retaliatory action in northern Bougainville and on Buka. Chan decided to abandon attempts at peace, and on 21 March 1996, approved the lifting of the ceasefire on Bougainville. In an address to the nation, he subsequently resolved to achieve a military solution.|$|E
500|$|In April 1998, Walker charted {{with a live}} {{rendition}} of Earl Thomas Conley's 1983 single [...] "Holding Her and Loving You". This rendition spent nine weeks on the charts and peaked at number 68. One month later, he debuted his sixteenth single, [...] "Ordinary People". Peaking at number 35, {{it was one of}} two new songs included on his Greatest Hits album; the other new track, [...] "You're <b>Beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> to Me", made its debut in August 1998 and peaked at number 2 on the country chart and number 39 on the Hot 100 in January 1999, the same month in which Greatest Hits was certified gold. Also in 1998, Walker performed a sold-out show at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the seventh season for DVD Talk, Ian Jane wrote that the series [...] "is {{one of those rare}} {{animated}} shows that can be enjoyed equally as much by both adults and children." [...] He described the concept of the show as [...] "utterly ludicrous." [...] He cited the episodes [...] "SpongeBob's Last Stand" [...] and [...] "Tentacle-Vision" [...] as [...] "interesting stand outs," [...] while the episodes [...] "The Inside Job", [...] "Back To The Past", [...] "Gary in Love", and [...] "The Abrasive Side" [...] as [...] "memorable episodes this time around." [...] However, Jane said that the season is not as good as the previous seasons, writing [...] "It's not that this more recent material isn't fun, because it is, but by this point in time storylines are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a little repetitive and as such, the series doesn't seem quite as fresh and original as it once did." [...] Jane [...] "recommended" [...] the DVD set, writing [...] "This latest collection of episodes is not a high point in the series but it's still decent enough family friendly entertainment, even if it does get too repetitive for its own good." ...|$|E

500|$|Nurmi stated to a Swedish {{newspaper}} that [...] "this is absolutely my last {{season on the}} track. I am <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it." [...] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he [...] "won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2005, Snow Patrol {{played two}} charity shows {{in one day}} in Dingle {{to raise money for}} some local charities. This show marked the live debut of Paul Wilson, {{replacement}} for bassist Mark McClelland, who was fired from the band in mid-March. The show is also notable for being the first where touring keyboardist Tom Simpson played as an official band member. The first show (for all ages) began at 5 in the evening, and the second (for over-18s) began at 10. Lightbody also DJed after the second show. New songs like [...] "Your Halo" [...] "Chasing Cars" [...] and [...] "It's <b>Beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> to Me" [...] got played live the first time, and received good reviews from NME. The band played two concerts at Live 8, a string of benefit concerts organized by Bob Geldof. The first of these was on 2 July 2005 in London and the second was in Edinburgh a few days later.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 April 1912, {{the night}} of the sinking, Lowe had been {{relieved}} at 8.00 PM by Sixth Officer Moody and was asleep in his quarters when the ship hit the iceberg at 11.40PM. He remained asleep through the collision and did not wake up until as much as half an hour had passed; as he explained later, [...] "We officers do not have any too much sleep, and therefore when we sleep, we die." [...] When Lowe finally awakened and realised the situation, he immediately got dressed, grabbed his revolver, and went to work. Third Officer Pitman charged him with loading lifeboat No. 5. Around 1.30AM, Lowe engaged in a conversation with Sixth Officer Moody: While launching lifeboat Nos. 14 and 16 on the port side of the ship, the two junior officers felt that this group of boats needed to have an officer with them. Moody insisted that Lowe should get onto lifeboat No. 14 and that he would get on another one. By the time lifeboat 14 was being launched, things were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> precarious on the boat deck as the majority of passengers began to realise that the giant ship was foundering. As lifeboat 14 was descending, Lowe used his revolver to fire three shots into the air in order to frighten away a group of men attempting to leap into the lifeboat.|$|E
