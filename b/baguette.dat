5|$|The <b>baguette</b> {{sandwiches}} {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the <b>baguette</b> sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt <b>baguette</b> and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public interest group Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT <b>Baguette</b> sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK <b>Baguette</b> line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked <b>baguette</b> roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed <b>Baguette</b> line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, BK {{introduced}} its BK <b>Baguette</b> line of sandwiches designed {{to replace the}} Chicken Whopper. The sandwiches were introduced {{at the insistence of}} the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories. The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK <b>Baguette</b> line of sandwiches, that replacing the Chicken Whopper sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Baguette</b> {{sandwiches}} {{failed to}} catch on in the American market, {{and as a result}} they were discontinued as part of a menu reorganization. In 2005, they were replaced by the TenderGrill sandwich. The new sandwich was one of several products that were designed to appeal to a group of customers Burger King identified as adult males, 24–36 years old that desired a larger, meatier product.|$|E

5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a <b>baguette</b> which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as <b>baguette.</b>|$|E
5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK <b>Baguette</b> product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.|$|E
50|$|Many {{new types}} of bread have reached the market in recent years. A high {{percentage}} of people reported eating bread types such as spelt, specialty, gourmet, and fibre/bran bread, as well as ciabattas and <b>baguettes,</b> regularly, although very few reported doing so on a daily basis. Norwegian bakers now have competition from abroad. The wholegrain bread from local bakers must give way to huge lorry loads of <b>baguettes</b> and frozen dough offering cheaper products.|$|R
50|$|Outside France, <b>baguettes</b> {{are also}} made with other doughs. For example, the Vietnamese bánh mì uses a high {{proportion}} of rice flour, while many North American bakeries make whole wheat, multigrain, and sourdough <b>baguettes</b> alongside French-style loaves. In addition, even classical French-style recipes vary from place to place, with some recipes adding small amounts of milk, butter, sugar, or malt extract, depending on the desired flavour and properties in the final loaf.|$|R

5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the <b>Baguette</b> sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. Franchitti was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 3.0885 seconds; Dixon was second and Power third. Hélio Castroneves was fourth-fastest, ahead of Justin Wilson and Paul Tracy. Ryan Briscoe, Ryan Hunter-Reay, E. J. Viso and Takuma Sato rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was stopped twice: firstly for Milka Duno who lost control of her car and went into the turn ten tire barrier damaging her front wing, and then Bertrand <b>Baguette</b> spun after hitting a chicane kerb which caused to him to drive through an advertising billboard. In the second practice session, Power set the fastest time of the day with a lap of one minute and 1.6689 seconds, with his teammates Briscoe in second and Castroneves third. Franchitti recorded the fourth-quickest time; Sato was fifth and Dixon sixth. Wilson, Viso, Tracy and Tony Kanaan followed in the top ten. Three caution flags came out; Baugette crashed, Duno stalled after she spun and Tomas Scheckter slid into a tire barrier.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the current}} vogue for {{brilliant}} and brilliant-like cuts, step cut diamonds may suffer somewhat in value; stones that are deep enough may be re-cut into more popular shapes. However, the step cut's rectilinear form was very popular in the Art Deco period. Antique jewelry of the period features step-cut stones prominently, {{and there is a}} market in producing new step-cut stones to repair antique jewelry or to reproduce it. The slender, rectangular <b>baguette</b> (from the French, resembling a loaf of bread) was and is {{the most common form of}} the step cut: today, it is most often used as an accent stone to flank a ring's larger central (and usually brilliant-cut) stone.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of nutritional information on the willingness to pay for bread. Four French <b>baguettes</b> were presented to 123 consumers who firstly gave liking scores in three evaluation conditions, and who then gave their maximum price (reservation price) they were ready to pay in two information steps. In the first step, the <b>baguettes</b> were presented without any information about their composition. Following this, half the participants received information about the potential health benefits of fibre. In the second step, two <b>baguettes</b> were presented with a ‘source of fibre' label. A similar product hierarchy was observed between hedonic scores and reservation prices. In addition, a significant effect was found on the reservation prices when the ‘source of fibre' label was presented, but no effect was observed when the information concerning the potential health benefits of fibre was given...|$|R
25|$|The {{staple of}} the Parisian diet was bread; unlike rural France, where peasants ate dark bread, baked weekly, Parisians {{preferred}} a spongy white bread with a firm crust, fresh from the oven, which they commonly ate by soaking it in a meat bouillon. It {{was similar to the}} modern <b>baguette,</b> not invented until the 20th century, but took longer to make. Parisians ate an average of 500 grams of bread, or two loaves a day; laborers consumed four loaves a day. Napoleon wanted to avoid the popular uprisings of 1789 caused by bread shortages, so the price of bread was strictly controlled between 1800 and 1814, and was much lower than outside the city. Parisians were very attached to their variety of bread; in times of grain shortages, when the government attempted to substitute cheaper dark breads, the Parisians refused to buy them.|$|E
25|$|Garlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, mild curry, {{and salt}} {{are the most}} common {{ingredients}} used to flavor dishes, and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk, vanilla, cloves or turmeric may also be used. A variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked. The most common and basic condiment, sakay, is a spicy condiment made from red or green chili pepper. Indian-style condiments made of pickled mango, lemon, and other fruits (known as achards or lasary), are a coastal specialty; in the highlands, lasary often refers to a salad of green beans, cabbage, carrots and onion in a vinaigrette sauce, popular as a side dish or as the filling of a <b>baguette</b> sandwich.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, UAC {{announced}} that a new next-generation integrated avionics suite has started flight-testing. The new avionics suite—called the ИМА БК, the Russian acronym for Интегрированная модульная авионика боевого комплекса (integrated modular avionics combat systems)—replaces a system designed in 2004 called Багет (<b>Baguette)</b> used on previous Su-35. The still-in-development system has more than 4 million lines of code. The IMA BK makes use of indigenous Russian multi-core microprocessors and a new indigenous real-time operating system. The new avionic suite also makes use of fiber-optic channels with a throughput of the more 8 Gbit/s, which is up from 100 Mbit/sec for traditional copper wires. The new IMA BK integrated avionics suite designed to automatically detects, identifies and tracks the most dangerous targets and offers the pilot the best solution to engage an enemy. “The new system takes control of {{almost all of the}} key sensors of the aircraft—radar, navigation and communication that in previous aircraft were controlled by separate computers,” the company says.|$|E

25|$|After {{disagreement}} regarding Stalin's {{demand to}} move Red Army troops through Poland and Romania (which Poland and Romania opposed), on 21 August, the Soviets proposed adjournment of military talks using the pretext {{that the absence}} of the senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces, though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet-German negotiations. That same day, Stalin received assurance that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would grant the Soviets land in Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Romania, after which Stalin telegrammed Hitler that night that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August. Regarding the larger issue of collective security, some historians state that one reason that Stalin decided to abandon the doctrine was the shaping of his views of France (hon hon hon <b>baguette</b> fromage oui oui) and Britain (England is my city) by their entry into the Munich Agreement and the subsequent failure to prevent German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Stalin may also have viewed the pact as gaining time in an eventual war with Hitler in order to reinforce the Soviet military and shifting Soviet borders westwards, which would be militarily beneficial in such a war.|$|E
