We construct an instrument for language skills using age at arrival in the United Kingdom, exploiting the fact that young children learn languages more easily than older children and adults. Using a unique individual-level dataset that links 2011 census data to life event records for the population living in England and Wales, we find that <b>better</b> <b>English</b> language skills significantly lower the probability of having no qualifications and raise that of obtaining academic degrees, but do not affect child health and self-reported adult health. The impact of language on fertility outcomes is also considerable: <b>Better</b> <b>English</b> skills significantly delay {{the age at which}} a woman has her first child, lower the likelihood of becoming a teenage mother, and decrease fertility...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{following}} table, each verb is given {{with a third}} person singular subject, and if a verb is transitive, with a third person object or objects (primary and secondary). The pronouns used in the English translations are imprecise due to an imprecise correspondence of Cree categories with English categories. “He/she" [...] in a subject and “him/her" [...] in an object refer to Cree animate gender even when “it" [...] might be a <b>better</b> <b>English</b> translation. So for example the verb “he/she kills him/her/them", might describe a bear killing a moose, in which case [...] "it kills it" [...] would be a <b>better</b> <b>English</b> translation. In the table, “it" [...] in a subject or an object refers to Cree inanimate gender. The presence of “they" [...] or “them" [...] indicates that the subject or object could be either singular or plural. And finally, the designation “him/her/it/them" [...] indicates that the object could be either animate or inanimate and either singular or plural.|$|R
