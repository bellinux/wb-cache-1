50|$|The SMI sends {{no clear}} signal whether {{the market is}} bullish or bearish. There are also no fixed {{absolute}} or relative readings signaling about the trend. Traders {{need to look at}} the SMI dynamics relative to that of the market. If, for example, SMI rises sharply when the market falls, this fact would mean that smart money is buying, and the market is to revert to an uptrend soon. The opposite situation is also true. A rapidly falling SMI during a <b>bullish</b> <b>market</b> means that smart money is selling and that market is to revert to a downtrend soon. The SMI is, therefore, a trend-based indicator.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of fight of supply and high {{operating}} rates in May 1997, two chlorine producers took the bold initiative of calling for an average price rise of $25 per short ton. Other producers were considering bringing the total price increase for the 1997 product year to date of up to $80 per short and fob ton, from $45-$50 per short and fob ton in May 1996. This occurred as both rapidly ascending demand from the vinyl polymer chain market and the unusually strong seasonal demand and no new production capacity on the immediate horizon coincided. The price increase had its firm foundations in the incumbent <b>bullish</b> <b>market</b> dynamics of the mid-2000s. Occidental Chemical Corporation suggested a minor rise as other firms took a [...] "wait-and-see approach" [...] and Russia raised production slightly to ease the cost of domestic bleach and swimming pool chloro-tablet costs.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the pricing efficiency of Nifty BeES in <b>bullish</b> and bearish <b>market</b> conditions using high frequency data {{for a period of}} seven years. It seeks to address three questions. First, does the portfolio manager of Nifty BeES follow its benchmark replication strategy across different market conditions? Second, whether the portfolio manager minimizes the portfolio return volatility relative to the benchmark volatility. Third, whether the magnitude of premiums/discounts varies in <b>bullish</b> and bearish <b>market</b> conditions. Our findings suggest a significant difference in alpha-generation abilities of fund manager between the two market conditions. Tracking error was found to be relatively high in bearish conditions. The average premium is higher in bearish markets characterized with highest volatility. On the other hand, the average discount is higher in <b>bullish</b> <b>markets</b> characterized with least volatility.

50|$|The {{price of}} lead rose sharply in early 2007, then {{collapsed}} to nearly their original starting price {{by the end}} of the next year. Lead prices began to rise in early 2007 due to increased worldwide demand. Prices were about $1,200 per tonne of lead in the July, then rose to $2,220 per tonne by September and collapsed back down to $1,200 per tonne in the October of that year. Despite the <b>bullish</b> <b>market</b> condition, the price had collapsed by the July 2009 and was only worth about $1,400 per tonne of lead. The lead and zinc markets became rather bearish for several months afterwards. Prices were hovering at between $1,770 and $2,175 per tonne as the markets became more bullish and increased prices after China's car scrapping scheme had caused a general upturn in lead, zinc, cadmium and aluminium production. By the June 2010, prices stood at only $870 per tonne, and were back to about $2,200 in the July 2010.|$|E

40|$|Prior studies {{indicate}} that institutional investors are informed, {{in the sense that}} their trades predict price changes. In this study we show that return predictive ability of institutions arises (after controlling for size, book-to-market, and momentum) mainly from institutional sales of hard-to-value stocks during periods of positive market sentiment.

The issue which the authors investigate is generally related to excess volatility caused either by market over-reaction or by changes in the market regime accompanied by changes in the systematic risk (beta) or by short-period non-informational 'noise' accompanied by violations of the classical assumptions on the residuals of the market model. The results of this work highlight and reveal several sides of relatively unknown and empirically confused areas regarding market efficiency and appropriateness and adequacy of the market model, as well as certain unusual features of investor behaviour. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} the impact of transaction costs on the trading strategy of informed institutional investors in a sequential trading market where traders can choose to transact a large or {{a small amount of}} stock. The analysis shows how the trading strategy of informed investors and the price impact of their trades depends on market conditions. The main prediction of the model is that institutional buyers are, on average, more aggressive than institutional sellers in bearish markets and less aggressive in <b>bullish</b> <b>markets.</b> Hence, the price impact is higher for purchases when market conditions are bearish, while it is higher for sales when <b>market</b> conditions are <b>bullish.</b> However, this asymmetry vanishes during strongly bearish or bullish phases, when information-based orders stop because the informational advantage of institutional investors becomes too small with respect to the transaction costs...|$|R

Contrary to the prior literature, this paper estimates the sample separated from different market states, including bullish, bearish, and range-bound markets, and finds that the affecting patterns of the determinants of initial returns indeed exhibit some significant differences under different market states. For instance, the stronger the auditor reputation effect, the lower are the initial returns under a range-bound market, and the market momentum effect is stronger under a <b>bullish</b> <b>market.</b> In addition, the risk perception effect is stronger under a bearish market.

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} {{relations}} between market fundamentals and US natural gas prices is {{carried out in the}} regime-switching framework. To test the hypothesis that US natural gas market may switch between two states of market: <b>bullish</b> <b>market</b> and bearish market, a 2 -state regime-switching model with Markov transition chain is carried out. GARCH effects are also built into the model to account for the conditional heteroskedasticity. Short-term forecasts based on the regime-switching model are also provided. Empirical results suggest that real world natural gas price behavior is far more complicated than that predicted by fundamental models. Volatility which cannot be explained by fundamentals plays an essential role in natural gas price behavior. The major contribution of this study lies in the effort to ease the deficiency of current fundamental-based models on commodity pricing due to high volatility by applying regime-switching models.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate about individual and institutional investors' trading behaviour with new evidence from the Polish stock market. While most existing studies focus on institutional investors' trading in developed markets, we test {{for the presence of}} herding during market up- and downswings on an emerging market. Our unique approach is to combine an established method relying on daily prices with institutional features of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It enables us to separate individuals from institutions by examining two trading mechanisms with different investor structures. The empirical results suggest that individuals engage in herding during market downswings, while there is less evidence of imitating trading behaviour in <b>bullish</b> <b>markets.</b> Regardless {{of the state of the}} market, institutions' trading behaviour does not appear to exhibit herd behaviour. Further evidence suggests that herding by individuals becomes less pronounced over time. Herding Behavioural finance Market microstructure Polish stock market...|$|R

In <b>bullish</b> <b>markets</b> savings plans with a high equity ratio perform the best, in bearish markets the classic insurance concept shows better returns. A stop loss strategy suffers from gap risk, whence a CPPI strategy combines the strength of both gap risk minimization and equity ratio maximization. The effect of fees on the savings plans dominates the performance, especially in typical fee structures found in the German Riester-Rente.

40|$|Traditional {{portfolio}} optimization {{uses the}} standard deviation of the returns {{as a measure of}} risk. In recent years, the Target-Shortfall-Probability (TSP) was discussed as an alternative measure. From the utility-theoretical point of view, the TSP is not perfect. Furthermore it is criticized due to the insufficient description of the risk. The advantages of the TSP are the usage independent of the distribution and the intuitive understanding by the investor. The use of a TSP-vector reduces an utility-theoretical disadvantage of a single TSP and offers an sufficient description of risk. The developed Mean-TSP-vector model is a mixed-integer linear program. The CPU-Time of the program to get a solution demonstrates that the model is suitable for practical applications. A test of the performance shows, that the average return of the model when used in bear markets is equal to the results of the traditional portfolio optimization but - due to skewness - in <b>bullish</b> <b>markets</b> can achieve better returns. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{discrepancy}} between financial transactions and activities in the real economy has widened. At the same time, the instability of exchange rates, commodity prices and share prices has increased: In 2007 the volume of financial transactions was 73. 5 times higher than global nominal GDP. Since 1990, it has expanded almost 5 {{times faster than the}} global economy. This expansion is driven by derivative markets, in particular futures and options trading on exchanges. In 2007, its volume was 43. 4 times higher than global GDP. The hike in such transactions was steepest in Germany: in 2007, they were already 52. 6 times higher than GDP. Exchange rates, commodity prices and share prices fluctuate in a sequence of medium-term trends ("bulls and bears").

Based on Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini social performance ratings, the study constructs and evaluates different sets of equity portfolios that differ in social performance. The high-ranked portfolios provide, in most cases, higher average returns than their low-ranked counterparts over the 1995 - 2006 period. In addition, we observe that the relation social-financial performance depends also on the economic cycle and consequently, on the market performance. Socially responsible investments {{seem to be more}} popular during bearish market periods and less popular during <b>bullish</b> <b>market</b> periods. Finally, our results suggest that in some industries, the differences of performances are more significant than in others. In other words, the relation social-financial performance seems to be considerably affected by the nature of firms’ activities.

Several interesting results are obtained. We find that, {{for the entire sample}} period, most buyer-initiated large trades have larger permanent price effects than seller-initiated large trades and vice versa for liquidity effects. However, we find that the permanent price effects of large sells are larger than the effects of large purchases in bearish markets and the reverse pattern is found for <b>bullish</b> <b>markets.</b> These results are consistent with the current economic condition hypothesis which is used to explain the asymmetry between total price impacts, information and liquidity effects of large buys and sells.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine how the {{dynamics}} of correlations between two emerging countries (Brazil and Mexico) and the US evolved from January 2003 to December 2013. The main contribution of this study is to explore whether the plunging stock market in the US, in the aftermath of global financial crisis (2007 - 2009), exerts contagion effects on emerging stock markets. To this end, we rely on a multivariate fractionally integrated asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity dynamic conditional correlation framework, which accounts for long memory, power effects, leverage terms, and time-varying correlations. The empirical analysis shows a contagion effect for Brazil and Mexico during the early stages of the global financial crisis, indicating signs of "recoupling. " Nevertheless, linkages show a general pattern of "decoupling" after the Lehman Brothers collapse. Furthermore, correlations between Brazil and the US are decreased from early 2009 onwards, implying that their dependence is larger in bearish than in <b>bullish</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

Three models, one created by Christie and Huang (1995) {{and the others}} created by Chang, Cheng and Khorana (1999), are applied to detect herd behavior from 1998 to 2009. Herd behavior is found in up-going market days, measuring on daily bases over the entire time frame.

In days with the most extreme market movements herd behavior is found in large cap stocks but not in the small cap. The result indicates a tendency of an increasing level of herd behavior over the measured period, which {{can be attributed to the}} increased influence of institutional ownership. Moreover, the data was adjusted for thinly traded stocks and the result is contradictive to previous studies.
