5|$|Patty Hearst guest {{stars in}} the episode, {{something}} that was planned since July 2006. Hearst {{did not know that}} she would be appearing on the show until after she was chosen {{due to a lack of}} communication <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> agent. She was reluctant to appear as a character similar to herself, but she eventually agreed. In addition, Hearst's character was initially scheduled to have a lesbian kiss with Keri Lynn Pratt's character, but the scene was vetoed by the network for unknown reasons.|$|E

She volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center.

After their mother died, Sharon took it upon herself to act as the woman of the house after, mostly when it comes to doling out chores <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> brother and the cooking (which, at least {{according}} to Virgil, Sharon is not good at).|$|E
5|$|The close platonic {{relationship}} between Karim and the Queen led to friction within the Royal Household, {{the other members}} of which felt themselves to be superior to him. The Queen insisted on taking Karim with her on her travels, which caused arguments <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> other attendants. Following Victoria's death in 1901, her successor, Edward VII, returned Karim to India and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the Munshi's correspondence with Victoria. Karim subsequently lived quietly near Agra, on the estate that Victoria had arranged for him, until his death at the age of 46.|$|E

5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was {{successful}} enough for Lehmann to commission David {{to write a}} sequel, to show the dishes of rural France. This was French Country Cooking, which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live {{for a short time}} in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> husband. She left London in March 1951 for Ménerbes, Provence. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially cold and wet, it soon turned warmer and she enjoyed herself so much that she considered buying a house there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of Capri to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the Italian Riviera researching for an article for Go, before returning to London.|$|E

5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E

The narrator then reminisces about Aya's childhood and family life, particularly dwelling upon how her maturity and independence had created distance <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> father, who is increasingly lonely yet happy for her. Later that night, Aya awakes to another phone call from her father. Having learned of Mii's death, she visits her father and has lunch with him, an experience that brings the two closer together.

25|$|In 1619, Marie de Médicis {{escaped from}} her {{confinement}} in the Château de Blois, becoming the titular leader of an aristocratic rebellion. The King and the duc de Luynes recalled Richelieu, believing {{that he would}} be able to reason with the Queen. Richelieu was successful in this endeavour, mediating <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> son. Complex negotiations bore fruit when the Treaty of Angoulême was ratified; Marie de Médicis was given complete freedom, but would remain at peace with the King. The Queen-Mother was also restored to the royal council.|$|E

25|$|As Empress Zewditu's reign progressed, the {{difference}} in outlook gradually widened <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> appointed heir, Ras Tafari Makonnen. Tafari was a moderniser, believing that Ethiopia needed to open itself {{to the world in}} order to survive. In this, he had the backing of many younger nobles. Zewditu, however, was a conservative, believing in the preservation of Ethiopian tradition. She had the strong backing of the church in this belief. Slowly, however, Zewditu began to withdraw from active politics, leaving more and more power to Tafari. Under Tafari's direction, Ethiopia entered the League of Nations, and abolished slavery. Zewditu busied herself with religious activities, such as the construction of a number of significant churches.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, four {{children}} became ill when the attraction failed {{to stop at}} the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a limit switch failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an emergency stop switch due to a miscommunication <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the limit switch were to fail.|$|E
