5|$|Growth control– <b>bacteriostatic</b> toxins, as {{mentioned}} above, restrict growth rather than killing the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be <b>bacteriostatic</b> rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin has a {{primarily}} <b>bacteriostatic</b> effect. It is {{a bacterial}} protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, {{in a similar}} way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as <b>bacteriostatic</b> agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or <b>bacteriostatic</b> if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline, {{like other}} {{tetracycline}} antibiotics, is <b>bacteriostatic.</b> It works by preventing bacteria from reproducing through the inhibition of protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|At the {{concentrations}} achieved in urine (>100 μg/ml), nitrofurantoin is a bactericide. It is <b>bacteriostatic</b> against most susceptible organisms at concentrations less than 32 μg/ml.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic action {{is thought to be}} inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). It also appears to exhibit <b>bacteriostatic</b> activity by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|At high concentrations, {{triclosan}} {{acts as a}} biocide {{with multiple}} cytoplasmic and membrane targets. However, at the lower concentrations seen in commercial products, triclosan appears <b>bacteriostatic,</b> and it targets bacteria primarily by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Zinc pyrithione (or pyrithione zinc) is a {{coordination}} {{complex of}} zinc. It has fungistatic (that is, it inhibits {{the division of}} fungal cells) and <b>bacteriostatic</b> (inhibits bacterial cell division) properties and {{is used in the}} treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|The cIII protein acts {{to protect}} the cII protein from {{proteolysis}} by FtsH (a membrane-bound essential E. coli protease) by acting as a competitive inhibitor. This inhibition can induce a <b>bacteriostatic</b> state, which favours lysogeny. cIII also directly stabilises the cII protein.|$|E
25|$|In bacteria, {{antibacterial}} sulfonamides act {{as competitive}} inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), an enzyme involved in folate synthesis. Sulfonamides are therefore <b>bacteriostatic</b> and inhibit growth and multiplication of bacteria, {{but do not}} kill them. Humans, in contrast to bacteria, acquire folate (vitamin B9) through the diet.|$|E
25|$|Minocycline is a broad-spectrum {{tetracycline}} antibiotic, and has {{a broader}} spectrum than {{the other members of}} the group. It is a <b>bacteriostatic</b> antibiotic, classified as a long-acting type. As a result of its long half-life it generally has serum levels 2–4 times that of the simple water-soluble tetracyclines.|$|E
25|$|Some {{nanoparticle}} products {{may have}} unintended consequences. Researchers {{have discovered that}} <b>bacteriostatic</b> silver nanoparticles used in socks to reduce foot odor are being released in the wash. These particles are then flushed into the waste water stream and may destroy bacteria which are critical components of natural ecosystems, farms, and waste treatment processes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{theoretical}} reasons for supporting combination therapy. The different {{drugs in the}} regimen have different modes of action. INH are bacteriocidal against replicating bacteria. EMB is <b>bacteriostatic</b> at low doses, but is used in TB treatment at higher, bactericidal doses. RMP is bacteriocidal and has a sterilizing effect. PZA is only weakly bactericidal, but is very effective against bacteria located in acidic environments, inside macrophages, or in areas of acute inflammation.|$|E
25|$|These {{peptides}} {{are excellent}} candidates for development as novel therapeutic agents and complements to conventional antibiotic therapy because they generally {{have a broad}} range of activity, are bactericidal as opposed to <b>bacteriostatic</b> and require a short contact time to induce killing. A number of naturally occurring peptides and their derivatives have been developed as novel anti-infective therapies for conditions as diverse as oral mucositis, lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), cancer, and skin and wound infections. Pexiganan {{has been shown to be}} useful to treat infection related diabetic foot ulcer.|$|E
25|$|Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with no need of {{protection}} from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain <b>bacteriostatic</b> levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as <b>bacteriostatic</b> therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|The {{modes of}} action by which {{antimicrobial}} peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills E. coli and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane {{is a frequent}} target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, {{such as in the}} antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of <b>bacteriostatic.</b> In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.|$|E
500|$|Linezolid is {{considered}} <b>bacteriostatic</b> against most organisms—that is, it stops their growth and reproduction without actually killing them—but has some bactericidal (killing) activity against streptococci. Some authors have noted that, despite its <b>bacteriostatic</b> effect in vitro, linezolid [...] "behaves" [...] as a bactericidal antibiotic in vivo because it inhibits {{the production of}} toxins by staphylococci and streptococci. It also has a post-antibiotic effect lasting one to four hours for most bacteria, meaning that bacterial growth is temporarily suppressed even after the drug is discontinued.|$|E
500|$|Interest in {{metformin}} resumed {{at the end}} of the 1940s. In 1950, metformin, {{unlike some}} other similar compounds, was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals. That year, Filipino physician Eusebio Y. Garcia used metformin (he named it Fluamine) to treat influenza; he noted the drug [...] "lowered the blood sugar to minimum physiological limit" [...] and was not toxic. Garcia believed metformin to have <b>bacteriostatic,</b> antiviral, antimalarial, antipyretic and analgesic actions. In a series of articles in 1954, Polish pharmacologist Janusz Supniewski was unable to confirm most of these effects, including lowered blood sugar. Instead he observed antiviral effects in humans.|$|E
500|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed that so-called [...] "deep" [...] infections—such as osteomyelitis or infective endocarditis—should {{be treated with}} bactericidal antibiotics, not <b>bacteriostatic</b> ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid {{appears to be a}} reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. Low- to medium-quality evidence is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic osteomyelitis, although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 1989, the {{standard}} treatment for acute melioidosis was a three-drug combination of chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline; this regimen {{is associated with}} a mortality rate of 80% and is no longer be used unless no other alternatives are available. [...] All three drugs are <b>bacteriostatic</b> (they stop the bacterium from growing, but do not kill it) and the action of co-trimoxazole antagonizes both chloramphenicol and doxycycline.|$|E
2500|$|Erythromycin {{displays}} <b>bacteriostatic</b> {{activity or}} inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations, but the mechanism {{is not fully}} understood. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial [...] rRNA complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited. Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing {{the transfer of the}} tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} of the quinolones began following introduction of the related, but structurally distinct naphthyridine-family nalidixic acid in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. Nalidixic acid was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a chemical distillate during an attempt at synthesis of the chloroquinoline antimalarial agent, chloroquine. Naphthyridone and quinolone classes of antibiotics prevent bacterial DNA replication by inhibition of DNA unwinding events, and can be both <b>bacteriostatic</b> and bacteriocidal. (See Mechanism of Action later.) The majority of quinolones in clinical use belong to the second generation class of [...] "fluoroquinolones", which have a true quinoline framework, maintain the C-3 carboxylic acid group, and add a fluorine atom to the all-carbon containing ring, typically at the C-6 or C-7 positions.|$|E
2500|$|Tetracyclines {{have a broad}} {{spectrum}} of antibiotic action. Originally, they possessed some level of <b>bacteriostatic</b> activity against almost all medically relevant aerobic and anaerobic bacterial genera, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, with a few exceptions, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp., which display intrinsic resistance. However, acquired (as opposed to inherent) resistance has proliferated in many pathogenic organisms and greatly eroded the formerly vast versatility of this group of antibiotics. Resistance amongst Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, anaerobes, members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and several other previously sensitive organisms is now quite common. Tetracyclines remain especially useful in the management of infections by certain obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Rickettsia. They are also of value in spirochaetal infections, such as syphilis, leptospirosis, and Lyme disease. Certain rare or exotic infections, including anthrax, plague and brucellosis, are also susceptible to tetracyclines. These agents also have activity against certain eukaryotic parasites, including those responsible for diseases such as malaria and balantidiasis. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: ...|$|E
5000|$|... 3. <b>Bacteriostatic</b> activity, causing {{cells to}} become unable to enter {{exponential}} growth {{even though they}} are not killed. Transient <b>bacteriostatic</b> activity can cause lag times, increasing Tt.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bacteriostatic</b> {{antibiotics}} {{limit the}} growth of bacteria by interfering with bacterial protein production, DNA replication, or other aspects of bacterial cellular metabolism. They must work together with the immune system to remove the microorganisms from the body. However, there {{is not always a}} precise distinction between them and bactericidal antibiotics; high concentrations of some <b>bacteriostatic</b> agents are also bactericidal, whereas low concentrations of some bactericidal agents are <b>bacteriostatic.</b> This group includes: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between bactericidal and <b>bacteriostatic</b> agents {{appears to be}} clear according to the basic/clinical definition, but this only applies under strict laboratory conditions {{and it is important}} to distinguish microbiological and clinical definitions. The distinction is more arbitrary when agents are categorized in clinical situations. The supposed superiority of bactericidal agents over <b>bacteriostatic</b> agents is of little relevance when treating the vast majority of infections with gram-positive bacteria, particularly in patients with uncomplicated infections and noncompromised immune systems. <b>Bacteriostatic</b> agents have been effectively used for treatment that are considered to require bactericidal activity. Furthermore, some broad classes of antibacterial agents considered <b>bacteriostatic</b> can exhibit bactericidal activity against some bacteria on the basis of in vitro determination of MBC/MIC values. At high concentrations, <b>bacteriostatic</b> agents are often bactericidal against some susceptible organisms. The ultimate guide to treatment of any infection must be clinical outcome.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bacteriostatic</b> {{agent or}} bacteriostat, {{abbreviated}} Bstatic, is a biological or chemical agent that stops bacteria from reproducing, while not necessarily killing them otherwise. Depending on their application, <b>bacteriostatic</b> antibiotics, disinfectants, antiseptics and preservatives can be distinguished. When <b>bacteriostatic</b> antimicrobials are used, {{the duration of}} therapy must be sufficient to allow host defense mechanisms to eradicate the bacteria. Upon removal of the bacteriostat, the bacteria usually start to grow again. This {{is in contrast to}} bactericides, which kill bacteria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bacteriostatic</b> agents, such as sulfonamides, target dihydropteroate {{synthetase}}. The {{effect of}} dihydropteroate synthetase inhibition {{is comparable to}} that of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition by trimethoprim, another <b>bacteriostatic</b> agent. Together these two drugs - trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole TMP-SMX - are commonly used to treat recurrent urinary tract, Shigella, Salmonella, and Pneumocystis jivoreci infections.|$|E
