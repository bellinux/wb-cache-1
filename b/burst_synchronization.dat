In general, if a network of bursting neurons is linked it will eventually synchronize for most types of bursting. Synchronization can also appear in circuits containing no intrinsically bursting neurons, however its appearance and stability can often be improved by including intrinsically bursting cells in the network. Since synchronization is related to plasticity and memory via Hebbian plasticity and long-term potentiation the interplay with plasticity and intrinsic bursting is very important.|$|E

40|$|Many {{networks}} {{of physical and}} biological interest are characterized by a long-range coupling mediated by a chemical which diffuses through a medium in which oscillators are embedded. We considered a one-dimensional model for this effect for which the diffusion is fast enough {{so as to be}} implemented through a coupling whose intensity decays exponentially with the lattice distance. In particular, we analyzed the <b>bursting</b> <b>synchronization</b> of neurons described by two timescales (spiking and bursting activity), and coupled through such a long-range interaction network. One of the advantages of the model is that one can pass from a local (Laplacian) type of coupling to a global (all-to-all) one by varying a single parameter in the interaction term. We characterized <b>bursting</b> <b>synchronization</b> using an order parameter which undergoes a transition as the coupling parameters are changed through a critical value.

In this paper, we study fast <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> for power line communication (PLC) systems operating below 500 kHz and transmitting data rates of up to about 500 kbps as it is typical in various PLC network applications. In particular, we are concerned with the receiver processing of the preamble signal and the actual design of preambles suitable for fast <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> in such PLC systems. Our approach is comprehensive in that it takes into account the most distinctive characteristics of the power line channel, which are multipath propagation, highly varying path loss, and disturbance by impulse noise, as well as important practical constraints, especially the need for spectral shaping of the preamble signal and fast adjustment of the automatic gain control (AGC). In fact, we regard the explicit incorporation of these various requirements into the preamble design as the main contribution of this work. We devise an optimization criterion and a stochastic algorithm to search for suitable preamble sequences. A comprehensive performance comparison of a designed and two conventional preambles shows that the designed sequence is superior in terms of (a) fast <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> in various transmission environments, (b) fast AGC adjustment, and (c) compliance of its spectrum with the spectral mask applied to the data transmit signal. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Efficient {{random access}} {{is one of}} the key designs in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) {{cellular}} systems. Random access is used by user equipment for initial access, requesting dedi-cated channels and transmitting short packet data to a base station. In random access, a preamble part is usually devised for fast and reliable <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization,</b> which is essential in order to avoid excessive access delay and/or repeated transmissions that may re-duce the overall system capacity.

40|$|We {{consider}} an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which cannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths {{governed by the}} spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of subthreshold neurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise intensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying the noise intensity D in the Barabási-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for the case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a power-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a few "hubs" (i. e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a "Matthew" effect in synaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing D, {{in contrast to a}} relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In the presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network architecture on the SBS for a fixed D. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic strengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).

40|$|We {{investigate}} the chaotic phase synchronization {{in a system}} of coupled bursting neurons in small-world networks. A transition to mutual phase synchronization takes place on the bursting time scale of coupled oscillators, while on the spiking time scale, they behave asynchronously. It is shown that phase synchronization is largely facilitated by a large fraction of shortcuts, but saturates when it exceeds a critical value. We also study the external chaotic phase <b>synchronization</b> of <b>bursting</b> oscillators in the small-world network by a periodic driving signal applied to a single neuron. It is demonstrated that there exists an optimal small-world topology, resulting in the largest peak value of frequency locking interval in the parameter plane, where <b>bursting</b> <b>synchronization</b> is maintained, even with the external driving. The width of this interval increases with the driving amplitude, but decrease rapidly with the network size. We infer that the externally applied driving parameters outside the frequency locking region can effectively suppress pathologically synchronized rhythms of bursting neurons in the brain.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIt {{is widely}} held that single cells in {{anterior}} cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) coordinate their activity during attentional processes, although cellular activity that may underlie such coordination across ACC/PFC has not been identified. We thus recorded cells in five ACC/PFC subfields of macaques {{engaged in a}} selective attention task, characterized those spiking events that indexed attention, and identified how spiking of distinct cell populations synchronized between brain areas. ResultsWe found that cells in ACC/PFC increased the firing of brief 200  Hz spike bursts when subjects shifted attention and engaged in selective visual processing. In contrast to nonburst spikes, burst spikes synchronized over large distances to local field potentials at narrow beta (12 – 20  Hz) and at gamma (50 – 75  Hz) frequencies. Long-range <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> was anatomically specific, functionally connecting those subfields in area 24 (ACC) and area 46 (PFC) that are key players of attentional control. By splitting cells into putative excitatory (pE) and inhibitory (pI) cells by their broad and narrow spikes, we identified that bursts of pI cells preceded and that bursts of pE cells followed in time periods of maximal beta coherent network activity. In contrast, gamma bursts were transient impulses with equal timing across cell classes. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that processes underlying burst firing and <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> are candidate mechanisms to coordinate attention information across brain areas. We speculate that distinct burst-firing motifs realize beta and gamma synchrony to trigger versus maintain functional network states during goal-directed behavior...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} network architecture on burst and spike synchronization in a directed scale-free network (SFN) of bursting neurons, evolved via two independent α- and β-processes. The α-process corresponds to a directed version of the Barabási-Albert SFN model with growth and preferential attachment, while for the β-process only preferential attachments between pre-existing nodes are made without addition of new nodes. We first consider the "pure" α-process of symmetric preferential attachment (with the same in- and out-degrees), and study emergence of burst and spike synchronization by varying the coupling strength J and the noise intensity D for a fixed attachment degree. Characterizations of burst and spike synchronization are also made by employing realistic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures. Next, we choose appropriate values of J and D where only the <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> occurs, and {{investigate the}} effect of the scale-free connectivity on the <b>burst</b> <b>synchronization</b> by varying (1) the symmetric attachment degree and (2) the asymmetry parameter (representing deviation from the symmetric case) in the α-process, and (3) the occurrence probability of the β-process. In all these three cases, changes in the type and the degree of population synchronization are studied in connection with the network topology such as the degree distribution, the average path length L_p, and the betweenness centralization B_c. It is thus found that not only L_p and B_c (affecting global communication between nodes) but also the in-degree distribution (affecting individual dynamics) are important network factors for effective population synchronization in SFNs.
