The store is divided into 19 specialist departments (e.g. coffee, pralines, wine, sausage & ham, fruit & vegetable, fish, cheese, bread, pasta, meat, cold & warm buffet, tea etc.). Due to the television advertisement for the brand Prodomo, the coffee department is the best-known of the departments: Just as in the advertisement, the coffee is still weighed with <b>beam</b> <b>scales</b> today. In {{the centre of the}} shop is the Putten (cherubs) fountain, in which crayfish wait to be sold. To a large extent, the goods offered in the Stammhaus are self-produced: On the second floor, there is a production kitchen, in which 70 chefs create gourmet salads, dishes for the warm buffet and cream cakes. The wine department, in which wines in particular from France, Italy, Germany and Austria are sold, was re-designed in 2008. What Dallmayr cannot produce on-site for reasons of space - such as smoked salmon or chocolate - is produced in their own factories in and around Munich. In Dallmayr’s praline factory near Munich, more than 40 tonnes of handmade pralines and fruit jellies are produced annually in around 70 different varieties. Furthermore, on the 29th June 2003, Dallmayr opened a shop in Terminal 2 of Munich airport , to which a café is also attached. This shop is located behind the security checks, and is only open to air passengers with valid boarding cards.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} effect of oral {{contraceptives}} (OC) on body weight, fat mass, percent body fat, and lean mass in young female distance runners. METHODS: The study population consisted of 150 female competitive distance runners aged 18 - 26 yr who had participated in a 2 -yr randomized trial of {{the effect of}} the OC Lo/Ovral (30 microg of ethinyl estradiol and 0. 3 mg of norgestrel) on bone health. Weight and body composition were measured approximately yearly by balance <b>beam</b> <b>scales</b> and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, respectively. RESULTS: Women randomized to the OC group tended to gain slightly less weight (adjusted mean difference (AMD) = - 0. 54 +/- 0. 31 kg. yr, P = 0. 09) and less fat (AMD = - 0. 35 +/- 0. 25 kg. yr, P = 0. 16) than those randomized to the control group. OC assignment was associated with a significant gain in lean mass relative to controls among eumenorrheic women (those who had 10 or more menstrual cycles in the year before baseline; AMD = 0. 77 +/- 0. 17 kg. yr, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) but not among women with fewer than 10 menstrual cycles in that year (AMD = 0. 02 +/- 0. 35 kg. yr, P = 0. 96). Treatment-received analyses yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: This randomized trial confirms previous findings that OC use does not cause weight or fat mass gain, at least among young female runners. Our finding that this OC is associated with lean mass gain in eumenorrheic runners, but not in those with irregular menses, warrants examination in other studies...|$|E

With two parameters, the amplitude and frequency of the resulting oscillations, step models improve the fit by Δχ^ 2 = - 11. 4. Evidence for oscillations damping before the Planck <b>beam</b> <b>scale</b> is weak: damping only improves the fit to Δχ^ 2 = - 14. 0 for one extra parameter, if step and cosmological parameters are jointly fit, in contrast to analyses which fix the latter. Likewise, further including the sound speed as a parameter only marginally improves the fit to Δχ^ 2 = - 15. 2 but has interesting implications for the lowest multipole temperature and polarization anisotropy. Since chance features in the noise can mimic these oscillatory features, we discuss tests from polarization power spectra, lensing reconstruction and squeezed and equilateral bispectra that should soon verify or falsify their primordial origin.

Through numerical simulations, the self-accelerating dynamics of the Airy-like refracted and reflected beams are observed. Of special interest are the cases of critical incidence at Brewster and total-internal-reflection (TIR) angles. In the former case, we find that the reflected beam achieves self-healing, despite the severe suppres-sion of a part of its spectrum, while, in the latter case, the beam remains nearly unaffected except for the Goos– Hänchen shift. The self-accelerating quality persists even if the beam is trapped bymultiple TIRs inside a dielectric film.

A prominent example is electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) where the transmission of a probe beam through an optically dense medium is manipulated {{by means of a}} control <b>beam.</b> <b>Scaling</b> such experiments into the quantum domain with one, or just a few particles of both light and matter will allow for the implementation of quantum computing protocols with atoms and photons or the realisation of strongly interacting photon gases exhibiting quantum phase transitions of light. Reaching these aims is challenging and requires an enhanced matter-light interaction as provided by cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). Here we demonstrate EIT with a single atom quasi-permanently trapped inside a high-finesse optical cavity. The atom acts as a quantum-optical transistor with the ability to coherently control the transmission of light through the cavity. We furthermore investigate the scaling of EIT when the atom number is increased one by one. The measured spectra are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model. Merging EIT with cavity QED and single quanta of matter is likely to become the cornerstone for novel applications, e. g. the dynamic control of the photon statistics of propagating light fields or the engineering of Fock-state superpositions of flying light pulses.

40|$|I {{suggest that}} the beaming factor in bright ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) varies as b ∝ ṁ− 2, where m ̇ is the Eddington ratio for accretion. This is {{required}} by the observed universal Lsoft ∝ T− 4 relation between soft-excess luminosity and temperature, and is reasonable on general physical grounds. The <b>beam</b> <b>scaling</b> means that all observable properties of bright ULXs depend essentially only on the Eddington ratio ṁ, and that these systems vary mainly because the beaming is sensitive to the Eddington ratio. This suggests that bright ULXs are stellar-mass systems accreting at Eddington ratios {{of the order of}} 10 – 30, with beaming factors b 0. 1. Lower luminosity ULXs follow bolometric (not soft-excess) L ∼ T 4 correlations and probably represent sub-Eddington accretion on to black holes with masses ∼ 10 M. High-mass X-ray binaries containing black holes or neutron stars and undergoing rapid thermal-or nuclear-time-scale mass transfer are excellent candidates for explaining both types. If the b ∝ ṁ− 2 scaling for bright ULXs can be extrapolated to the Eddington ratios found in SS 433, some objects currently identified as active galactic nuclei at modest redshifts might actually be ULXs (‘pseudo-blazars’).

40|$|The known {{population}} of pulsars contains objects with {{four and five}} component profiles, for which the peak-to-peak separations between {{the inner and outer}} components can be measured. These Q and M type profiles can be interpreted as a result of sightline cut through a nested cone beam, or through a set of azimuthal fan beams. We show that the ratio R_W of the components' separations provides a useful measure of the beam shape, which is mostly independent of parameters that determine the <b>beam</b> <b>scale</b> and complicate interpretation of simpler profiles. In particular, the method does not depend on the emission altitude and the dipole tilt distribution. The different structures of the radio beam imply manifestly different statistical distributions of R_W, with the conal model being several orders of magnitude less consistent with data than the fan beam model. To bring the conal model into consistency with data, strong effects of observational selection need to be called for, with 80 % of Q and M profiles assumed to be undetected because of intrinsic blending effects. It is concluded that the statistical properties of Q and M profiles are more consistent with the fan-shaped beams, than with the traditional nested cone geometry.

40|$|Representation of {{two-dimensional}} optical signals on {{the orbital}} angular Poincarý sphere {{is useful for}} beam analysis, synthesis and comparison. This mapping {{is based on the}} measurement of the second-order moments, which are widely used for beam characterization. It is well known that two second-order moments invariants allow dividing two-dimensional signals into two classes: isotropic and anisotropic. Using the modified Iwasawa decomposition of the ray transformationmatrix and bringing the second-order moments matrix to its diagonalized form, we are able to associate the anisotropic signal with a certain point on the sphere. The latitude of this point describes the vorticity of the signal, while its longitude corresponds to the orientation of the beam's principal axes. Apart from that, the <b>beam's</b> <b>scaling</b> and its curvature can be defined. Before beam comparison, it is thus appropriate to perform first its normalization and mapping on the Poincarý sphere. There are many very different beams associated with the same point and therefore this procedure makes sense for fine analysis of beams whose intensity distributions have similar forms. Moreover, every point on the sphere is associated with an orthonormal set of Hermite-Laguerre-Gaussian modes, which can be used for the corresponding beam decomposition that is important for its synthesis and analysis.

A dimensional analysis was performed on the composite beam-column loading configuration to determine a model law governing the system response. An experimental program was developed to validate the model law under both static and dynamic loading conditions. Laminate stacking sequences including unidirectional, angle ply, cross ply, and quasi-isotropic were tested to examine a diversity of composite response and failure modes. The model beams were loaded under scaled test conditions until catastrophic failure. A large deflection beam solution was developed to compare with the static experimental results and to analyze beam failure. Also, the finite element code DYCAST (DYnamic Crash Analysis of STructure) was used to model both the static and impulsive beam response. Static test results indicate that the unidirectional and cross ply <b>beam</b> responses <b>scale</b> as predicted by the model law, even under severe deformations.

Classical laws of similitude {{were applied to}} fabricate and test replica model <b>beams</b> to identify <b>scaling</b> effects in the load response, strength, and mode of failure. Experiments were conducted using graphite-epoxy composite beams having different laminate stacking sequences {{and a range of}} scaled sizes. Results indicated that the elastic response of <b>scaled</b> composite <b>beams</b> was independent of specimen size. However, a significant scale effect in strength was observed. In addition, a transition in failure mode was observed among <b>scaled</b> <b>beams</b> of certain laminate stacking sequences. Weibull statistical and fracture mechanics based models were applied to predict the strength scale effect since standard failure criteria cannot account for the influence of absolute specimen size in failure...|$|R
