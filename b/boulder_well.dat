40|$|It has rather been {{a problem}} whence the Tasmanian Aborigines {{obtained}} the material for their implements. The discovery of certain localities where the rock suitable for implements occurred in situ, and which were unquestionably worked by the Aborigines, has partly solved the problem. It is unquestionable that the Aborigines obtained {{a certain amount of}} the raw material from these so-called quarries, but it is equally certain that a large portion was obtained from different sources. One of the best-known "native quarries" is that situated on Coal Hill, near Melton-Mowbray. However, it was conclusively proven that, though the quarry on Coal Hill was conveniently situated and easily reached from the camping grounds near the river, only 6. 1 per cent, of the implements found were derived from it. A number of interesting facts and questions arise from the study of this specimen. Though not completely restored to its entire shape, we can state with absolute certainty that the original was a pebble or <b>boulder,</b> <b>well</b> worn and smooth all over its surface, of deep black colour, weighing not less than 10 lb. As there are no gravel deposits or conglomerate anywhere near the place wdiere it was found, it must have been picked up at a considerable distance, and been carried to the camping ground to be used for the manufacture of implements...|$|E

50|$|The {{geography}} of Princemarch varies from ice-capped mountains and thick forests to rich soil in green valleys that can grow nearly anything. The South boasts the cropland and valleys, producing fruits, grains, and vegetables {{as well as}} meats, cheese, and nuts. To the east are the Vere Hills, which borders the Desert, then to the north are the Great Veresch Mountains. The mountains rise quickly over the lowlands, the tallest peak covered in snow even through the summer. Lower peaks sprouted conifers, which rose to heights of ten or twenty men with needles the length of an arm. Twinning throughout the mountains, streams flow into lakes of pure water. In the valley meadows flowers of every color grow, sheltered by thick forests. Scattered throughout the forests and above the snowline were jutting granite stones and <b>boulders</b> as <b>well</b> as caves.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the last glaciers in the British Isles disappeared {{at the end of}} the Younger Dryas stadial (12. 9 - 11. 7 cal. kyr BP). Here, we use a glacier-climate model driven by data from local weather stations to show for the first time that glaciers developed during the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the Cairngorm Mountains. Our model is forced from contemporary conditions by a realistic difference in mean annual air temperature of - 1. 5 degrees C and an increase in annual precipitation of 10 %, and confirmed by sensitivity analyses. These results are supported by the presence of small <b>boulder</b> moraines <b>well</b> within Younger Dryas ice limits, and by a dating programme on a moraine in one cirque. As a result, we argue that the last glaciers in the Cairngorm Mountains (and perhaps elsewhere in upland Britain) existed in the LIA within the last few hundred years, rather than during the Younger Dryas.

40|$|Limestone {{boulders}} of Early and Middle Ordovician age occur {{along the}} Baltic coast of Sweden from c. 59 degrees N to c. 62. 5 degrees N, apparently at a considerable distance from any known source rocks on land. We have investigated a limestone block from Lake Kultebo, at 61 degrees N, not far inland. The conodont elements enclosed {{in the rock}} are of Mid-Ordovician age and show that the block {{could not have been}} transported any considerable distance from the west, as has previously been suggested. The new finds of presumed glacially transported boulders of Early Ordovician age confirm earlier reports of such rocks in the area. The conodont faunas here indicate that the <b>boulders</b> could <b>well</b> have been derived locally, e. g., from the floor of the SW Gulf of Bothnia, {{the northern part of the}} Baltic Sea.

40|$|<b>Boulder</b> is <b>well</b> {{known as}} one of the {{obstruction}} material and problematic to the underground excavations and constructions. Although the presence of boulder in weathered rock mass was revealed and reported by many researchers, but the occurrence and physical characteristics of boulders in weathering profile are still not clearly understood. This paper attempts to revise the issues and characteristics of boulder formed in weathered granite which include the formation, distribution, properties and location of boulders found in tropical weathering profile. As a weathering product, boulder is dominantly found in moderately to completely weathered zone of rock mass (Grade III to V). Boulder consists of corestone Grade I or II and surrounded by some concentric sheet of weathered rock Grade III to V or rindlets which formed due the reaction of spheroidal weathering. The rindlets with thickness ranges 0. 2 mm to 2. 0 m is the zone of decomposition and dissolution of biotite and feldspar that gradually transforming to saprolite. This information is useful to geotechnical engineers and researchers for engineering purposes and weathering zone classification especially in underground excavation and structure design...|$|R
