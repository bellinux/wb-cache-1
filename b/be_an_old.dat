25|$|The grey-headed canary-flycatcher {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the grey-headed flycatcher (Culicicapa ceylonensis) is a species of small flycatcher-like bird found in tropical Asia. It has a square crest, a grey hood and yellow underparts. They are found mainly in forested habitats where they often join other birds in mixed-species foraging flocks. Pairs are often seen as they forage for insects by making flycatcher-like sallies and calling aloud. Several subspecies are recognized within their wide distribution range. In the past the genus Culicicapa was considered to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> World flycatcher but studies have found them {{to belong to a}} new family designated as the Stenostiridae or fairy flycatchers that include the African genera Stenostira and Elminia.|$|E

25|$|The {{music video}} for Manson's cover was {{a gateway to}} {{popularity}} for the band, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video, and contains several clips of Manson and band members in what appears to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old,</b> decrepit asylum whilst wearing a variety of strange costumes. The overall video was shot with unusual filters: {{this was one of}} the first videos shot with director Dean Karr's initial vision intact, not based solely on whatever ideas the band had come up with prior. In between these clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving dropping on his body, and footage of him riding a pig wearing a cowboy hat whilst covered with mud which Manson rides during the song's climax.|$|E

It was unveiled in 1986 during Gateshead Sculpture Week.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{periodic}} comets discovered in earlier decades or previous centuries are now lost comets. Their orbits were never known {{well enough to}} predict future appearances or the comets have disintegrated. However, occasionally a [...] "new" [...] comet is discovered, and calculation of its orbit shows it to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> [...] "lost" [...] comet. An example is Comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, discovered in 1869 but unobservable after 1908 because of perturbations by Jupiter. It was not found again until accidentally rediscovered by LINEAR in 2001. There are at least 18 comets that fit this category.|$|E
