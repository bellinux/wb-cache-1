40|$|Phytoplankton {{studies using}} samples {{concentrated}} by settling revealed population dcnsitics several timcs {{higher than those}} rcportcd previously, based on centrifuge and <b>bolting</b> <b>cloth</b> concentrates. Clear and dark bottle experiments employing natural population densities rcvcaled photosynthetic yields averaging 1. 6 ~molcs of CO 2 absorbed per microlitcr of plant volume per hour. This yield is three times higher than previously reported yields based on artificially conccntratcd populations. Colnparison of daily photosynthetic yields per square meter of water as computed from bottle data with yields measured under completely natural conditions indicated an additional twofold discrepancy, with the natural condition yielding the highcr value. The reduction of turhulcncc in bottles may be operating to reduce the photosynthetic yield. Ecldy diffusivity in western I,akc Eric, computed from pFI change in the dysphotic zone, and vertical pH gradients, is about 25 cnP/sec. Simultaneous detcr-minations of CO 2 and 02 changes showed that 0 ~ changes usually were lower than CO 2 changes, suggesting that proccsscs other than photosynthesis arc influencing the CO 2 and O 2 budgets. During the past 30 years the aquatic com-munities of western Lake Erie have received rather intensive study. Until 1956, however, the phytoplankton studies utilized centri-fuge and <b>bolting</b> <b>cloth</b> to concentrate the organisms before counting, and average standing crops observed were less than one microliter of plant matter per liter (Verduin 1951, 1954). In the summer of 1956 Davis (1958) used a direct count method which avoided the losses inherent in centrifuge and <b>bolting</b> <b>cloth</b> methods. His average standing crop for the summer amounted to 6 PI/L {{which is similar to}} the maxima 1 crops reported during the previous 30 years, and is 10 times the previous averages. Much of the previous research in photosynthesis was also based on concentrated samples (Verduin 1956 a). The present paper presents the results of a research program using natural population densities. During the period June, 1957, to Septem-ber, 1958, the National Science Foundation subsidized a study of phytoplankton a...|$|R

40|$|Let {{me start}} by telling a fable [...] perhaps a fable {{you have heard}} often before, but then {{entertaining}} stories bear repeating. There once was a country named Portugal. Portugal had labor time, and grape vines, and sheep. Portugal needed to choose how much wine she wanted to produce, and how much woolen cloth. To be both well-clothed and well-drunk, {{she wanted to be}} able to consume a hundred <b>bolts</b> of <b>cloth</b> and a hundred barrels of wine. Alas, however, if she tried to produce a hundred <b>bolts</b> of <b>cloth,</b> she would use up all her resources and be able to produce no wine at all! And if she produced a hundred barrels of wine, she would only have enough resources left over to produce 50 <b>bolts</b> of <b>cloth.</b> Poor Portugal! We have a picture of poor Portugal in Figure 1. It was painted by economists, who aren’t very artistic, but it shows Portugal’s important features for this fable. The Production Possibilities Frontier shows how much wine and cloth Portugal could produce with her resources: she could produce anywhere on the line, or to the southwest of the line. Point A shows what she would have liked to consume. Point A was, alas, out of reach...|$|R

40|$|Early larval {{development}} of edible oyster Crassostrea madrasensis (Perston) mature {{male and female}} edible oyster Crassostrea madrasensis selected from the Tuticorin oyster farm were stripped and the eggs were artificially fertilized in glass containers. 91. 5 to 92. 2 percentages of eggs underwent successful fertilization and the larvae were reared up to umbo stage in one experiment. The size of the mature egg varied from 49 to 59 µ,. A method of filtering and washing the eggs using centrifugation was devised as the eggs could not be retained even by the finest sieve (nylobolt <b>bolting</b> <b>cloth</b> 30 HD) available. The fertilized eggs were cultured in different vessels of size ranging from 1 liter to 80 liters containing filtered ultraviolet treated sea water. 85 % of the fertilized eggs successfully reached the straight hinge-stage in 18 to 24 hours.

50|$|Separating the bran {{and other}} parts of the grain from the desired flour was {{historically}} a difficult and time-consuming process to carry out manually. Efforts to automate the process began early on. Edmund Brunt filed a provisional patent on a 'bolting machine' in 1614. John Milne patented a machine in 1765 which used several grades of wire mesh or cloth to separate flour from bran. A machine for manufacturing <b>bolting</b> <b>cloth,</b> used to filter the flour from bran {{and other parts}} of the grain, was patented in 1783 by Benjamin Blackmore. And in 1850, James Bell devised a means of separating flour by pushing the feedstock (or 'stock') against a vertical cloth ('bolting sleeve') while Joseph Foot patented a means of making the filter sleeve from silk instead of wool. Development continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, increasing the speed and efficiency of the process through improvements such as the addition of beaters and brushes to force the fine flour through the filters and to continuously clean the filters as they rotated.|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} a redescription of the little known Chaetognatha Sagitta bombayensis Lele and Gae (1936) "first {{described}} from the Bombay Harbour and subsequently recorded by Rao and Kelly (1962) from Lawsori's Bay, Waltair, {{is evident from the}} recent review of 'Chaetognaths' by Alvarino (1965). George (1949, 1952) considered S. bombayensis a synonym of S. robusta Doncaster (1903), but Rao and Kelly (1962) have drawn attention to a few differences between these two species, at the same time also recognising three stages of maturity which are inadequately described. Apparently the types, one mature and two immature specimens, have not been saved, as Lele and Gae (1936) do not mention of these being deposited in any recognised collection. Hence, in November 1966 one of us (E. G. S.) made special plankton collections from the Bombay Harbour using a half-metre ringnet of No. 20 Swiss Silk <b>Bolting</b> <b>cloth</b> for obtaining topotypes of S. bombayensis to enable a redescription of the species as well as for a taxonomical reappraisal of it.
