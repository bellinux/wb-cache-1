5|$|Opened in 1987, Missoula's Bayern <b>Brewing</b> is {{the oldest}} active brewery in Montana. Big Sky <b>Brewing</b> opened in 1995 and with a {{production}} of over 38,000 barrels , it is by far Montana's largest brewery, and produces the best-selling beer brewed in Montana, Moose Drool Brown Ale. Missoula has also been home to Kettle House <b>Brewing</b> since 1995 and Draught Works opened in 2011. Big Sky, Bayern, and Kettlehouse represent the first, second, and third largest breweries respectively {{in the state of}} Montana. Also in 2011, Tamarack <b>Brewing</b> and Flathead Lake <b>Brewing</b> Company from nearby Lake County opened pub houses at downtown Missoula locations. The city also holds annual the Garden City Brewfest and Winterfest, and also periodically hosts the Montana Brewers Festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} making beer is known as <b>brewing.</b> A {{dedicated}} building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer {{can be made in}} the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a <b>brewing</b> company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. <b>Brewing</b> beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted <b>brewing</b> to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E
5|$|Utica {{has long}} had ties to the <b>brewing</b> industry. The family-owned Matt <b>Brewing</b> Company {{resisted}} the bankruptcies and plant closings {{that came with the}} industry consolidation under a few national brands. As of 2012, it was ranked the 15th-largest brewery by sales in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Various {{commercial}} beers are <b>brewed</b> in Angola, {{the oldest}} of which is Cuca, <b>brewed</b> in Luanda. Others include Eka (<b>brewed</b> in Dondo in Cuanza Sul), N'gola (<b>brewed</b> in Lubango), and Nocal (<b>brewed</b> in Luanda).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Brew</b> emulator, named <b>Brew</b> Simulator, {{does not}} emulate handset hardware. Instead, the <b>Brew</b> {{application}} is compiled to native code and linked with a compatible <b>Brew</b> runtime library. Because of this, applications cannot {{be tested for}} platform bugs related to memory alignment and various firmware related glitches without a <b>Brew</b> handset operating in test mode.|$|R

5|$|While {{there are}} many types of beer brewed, the basics of <b>brewing</b> beer are shared across {{national}} and cultural boundaries. The traditional European <b>brewing</b> regions—Germany, Belgium, England and the Czech Republic—have local varieties of beer.|$|E
5|$|William Stones {{had started}} <b>brewing</b> in 1847 in Sheffield with Joseph Watts. Following Watts' death in 1854, Stones {{continued}} <b>brewing</b> by himself. In 1868, he purchased the lease of the Neepsend Brewery and renamed it the Cannon Brewery. He continued to brew there {{until his death}} in 1894. Stones' success saw him die as one of the richest men in Sheffield, although he lived a modest life. The company was taken over by Bass in 1968. In 2000, Bass sold its <b>brewing</b> operations to the Belgian brewer Interbrew who were ordered by the Competition Commission to sell the Stones brand. In 2002, the brand was purchased by the American Coors <b>Brewing</b> Company, who merged to become Molson Coors in 2005.|$|E

50|$|For {{software}} developers, <b>Brew</b> MP is a {{full set}} of application programming interfaces (API) that enables making software and applications in C, C++, Java, and is supported (platform) by an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It has a memory footprint of about 15,900 K (15.9 MB), From <b>Brew</b> 1.x until 2.x (before 2004), it has less memory footprint (around 60kb). <b>Brew</b> also features direct hardware access. Versions before <b>Brew</b> MP ran/relied on REX OS (Qualcomm's own RTOS), while <b>Brew</b> MP uses <b>Brew</b> RTOS (another RTOS for advanced feature phones). Rather than using an interpreter-based code, <b>Brew</b> also relied on its own mobile hardware.|$|R

5|$|Most modern breweries use a {{continuous}} sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, {{it is possible}} to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. <b>Brewing</b> with several runnings is called parti gyle <b>brewing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hartley began <b>brewing</b> in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for <b>brewing</b> the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his <b>brewing</b> and malting enterprise.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2011, Jeremiah Weed {{launched}} two <b>Brews</b> {{into the}} UK: Jeremiah Weed Sour Mash <b>Brew</b> {{which has a}} bourbon taste and Jeremiah Weed Root <b>Brew</b> which has a ginger taste.|$|R
25|$|Generally, 4grams of tea per 200 ml of water. Unlike green teas, which turn bitter when <b>brewed</b> {{at higher}} temperatures, black tea should be steeped in water {{brought up to}} 90–95°C. The first <b>brew</b> should be 60 sec., the second <b>brew</b> 40 sec., and the third <b>brew</b> 60 sec. If your tea is of high quality, you can {{continue}} to <b>brew</b> by progressively adding 10 sec. to the <b>brew</b> time following the third infusion (note: when using a larger tea pot the ratio of tea to water {{will need to be}} adjusted to achieve similar results).|$|R
50|$|Oskar Blues Brewery <b>brews</b> eight year-round {{production}} beers, <b>brewed</b> in 100 and 200 barrel batches. The original <b>brew</b> pub {{provides a}} variety of smaller batches for consumption at the Lyons and Longmont locations.|$|R

5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the <b>brewing</b> trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town's <b>brewing,</b> baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre.|$|E

50|$|Tuborg Red was {{the first}} beer the company <b>brewed</b> in 1875. Tuborg Red is not <b>brewed</b> {{on a regular basis}} but is <b>brewed</b> once a year in May to salute the company's birthday.|$|R
40|$|Green teas in leaf form are <b>brewed</b> {{multiple}} times, {{a common}} selling point. However, the flavor changes, both sensory and volatile compounds, of green teas {{that have been}} <b>brewed</b> multiple times are unknown. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine how the aroma and flavor of green teas change as they are <b>brewed</b> multiple times, to determine if a relationship exists between green tea flavors and green tea volatile compounds, and to suggest the number of times that green tea leaves can be <b>brewed.</b> The first and second <b>brews</b> of the green tea samples provided similar flavor intensities. The third and fourth <b>brews</b> provided milder flavors and lower bitterness and astringency when measured using descriptive sensory analysis. In the <b>brewed</b> liquor of green tea mostly linalool, nonanal, geraniol, jasmone, and β-ionone volatile compounds were present at low levels (using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The geraniol, linalool, and linalool oxide compounds in green tea may contribute to the floral/perfumy flavor. Green teas in leaf form may be <b>brewed</b> up to four times: the first two <b>brews</b> providing stronger flavor, bitterness, and astringency whereas the third and fourth <b>brews</b> will provide milder flavor, bitterness, and astringency...|$|R
50|$|For testing {{applications}} {{during the}} development process, the SDK includes a <b>Brew</b> emulator, or starting with <b>Brew</b> version 3.1.5 and above, the <b>Brew</b> Simulator. The <b>Brew</b> environment provides for multiple levels of application signatures. One signature authenticates the developer. Another signature verifies that an application has passed True <b>Brew</b> testing and is bestowed through Intertek. The individual telecommunications operators configure the handsets to either enforce or ignore the presence and verification of this second signature. <b>Brew</b> enabled handsets have a test mode that allows applications to bypass verification of the signature. Qualcomm makes applications that have passed testing available to <b>Brew</b> enabled wireless network operators. The operators are then able to choose which of these applications to make available to end-users on their catalog.|$|R

5|$|Bass moved {{production}} of Stones to its Burton upon Trent and Tadcaster breweries. In 2000, Bass sold its <b>brewing</b> interests, including their breweries and the Stones brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew contracted the {{production of}} cask conditioned Stones to Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew to sell off certain brands in December 2001, including Stones Bitter, which was bought by the American Coors <b>Brewing</b> Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg Stones Bitter at their brewery in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton brewery. The cask product was initially contract brewed at the Highgate Brewery in Walsall, West Midlands, before moving to Everards of Leicester in 2005. The cask product ceased production in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the <b>brewing</b> process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial <b>brewing,</b> the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
50|$|GU {{produces}} two brews: the GU Electrolyte <b>Brew</b> Drink (launched in 2001 and {{formerly known}} as Guo) and the GU Recovery <b>Brew</b> Drink.
