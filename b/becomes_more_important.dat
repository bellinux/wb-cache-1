With increasing importance of design for the company, design management also <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} {{chlorine}} radioisotope is 36Cl. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 35Cl is electron capture to isotopes of sulfur; that of isotopes heavier than 37Cl is beta decay to isotopes of argon; and 36Cl may decay by either mode to stable 36S or 36Ar. 36Cl occurs in trace quantities in {{nature as a}} cosmogenic nuclide in a ratio of about (7–10)×10−13 to 1 with stable chlorine isotopes: it is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of 36Ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons. In the top meter of the lithosphere, 36Cl is generated primarily by thermal neutron activation of 35Cl and spallation of 39K and 40Ca. In the subsurface environment, muon capture by 40Ca <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> {{as a way to}} generate 36Cl.|$|E

25|$|As {{either the}} Lewis acidity {{of the base}} or the {{coordinating}} ability of the substituent decrease, a mechanism involving purely inductive effects <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> For instance, the lithiation of 1 with lithium di(isopropyl)amide (LDA) affords only the product of benzylic metalation 2; none of the ortho-lithiated product 3 is observed. This result is explained by a mechanism in which the amide substituent affects the acidity of the para benzylic position solely through inductive effects and coordination of the base is not operative. Deprotonation occurs to afford the most thermodynamically stable product.|$|E
25|$|Bruxism {{can cause}} {{significant}} tooth wear {{if it is}} severe, and sometimes dental restorations (crowns, fillings etc.) are damaged or lost, sometimes repeatedly. Most dentists therefore prefer to keep dental treatment in people with bruxism very simple and only carry it out when essential, since any dental work is likely to fail in the long term. Dental implants and complex bridgework for example are relatively contraindicated in bruxists. In the case of crowns, {{the strength of the}} restoration <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> sometimes at the cost of aesthetic considerations. E.g. a full coverage gold crown, which has a degree of flexibility and also involves less removal (and therefore less weakening) of the underlying natural tooth may be more appropriate than other types of crown which are primarily designed for esthetics rather than durability. Porcelain veneers on the incisors are particularly vulnerable to damage, and sometimes a crown can be perforated by occlusal wear.|$|E

25|$|Eating {{times are}} variable. Foraging trips can occur {{at any time}} and are very coordinated: either the entire colony forages or no one does. A small {{proportion}} of starved individuals is enough to reach agreement and start group movement. However, this organized behavior and the high fidelity of caterpillars to pheromone hormone trails imply conservative foraging, which may trap caterpillars to poor food sources even if a better one is close by. Some plasticity in this behavior has been reported, which is modulated by the presence of caterpillars that are behaviorally more exploratory or that simply become more adventurous because they are starved, increasing foraging flexibility. With age, competition for food <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> especially as resources become scarce. Grouping decreases growth rate via a decrease in food intake so ontogenetic changes toward more mobility and independence can be viewed as simple “scaling” relationships between caterpillars and food sources evolved to increase the benefits of individual foraging in later stages.|$|E
500|$|Suillus bovinus is mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. Field work in pine forests in Sweden analysing the population structure of Suillus bovinus found that mushrooms were more abundant in younger forests and forests with disturbed areas, which contained {{a higher number}} of genets (colonies)—700 to 5700 per hectare—compared with 30 to 120 genets per hectare in mature stands. Older colonies in mature forests could be [...] in diameter against [...] diameter in young forests. Spore-bearing mushrooms (sporocarps) produce {{a huge number of}} spores (estimated in a Finnish study at 240 million to 1.2 billion per mushroom), of which only a small number grow successfully; this large number is thought to explain the larger numbers of colonies in disturbed and young forests, while the fungus' vegetative spread <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> in established forests. Colonies of S.bovinus do not overlap, which indicates they suppress each other's growth. The median lifespan of a colony was estimated to be 36 years. Field work conducted in Swedish pine forests suggested that S.variegatus suppressed the growth of S.bovinus, as there was a negative correlation in occurrence.|$|E

Vivian Baxter cares for Rita's young son as Rita attempts to make a living. Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that [...] "one gets a strong sense throughout Gather Together of [...] dependence on her mother". Critic Lyman B. Hagen remarks that Angelou's relationship with her mother <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> in Gather Together, and that Vivian is now more influential in the development of Angelou's attitudes. Lupton calls Clyde's kidnapping a [...] "powerful sequence of mother-loss" [...] and connects it to the kidnapping of Clyde's son in the 1980s. Angelou has compared the production of this book to giving birth, an apt metaphor given the birth of her son at the end of Caged Bird. Like many authors, Angelou views the creative writing process and its results as her children.|$|E

2500|$|When a rider {{is added}} to the horse's natural balance, the {{question}} of the lead <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> When riding in an enclosed area such as an arena, the correct lead provides the horse with better balance. The rider typically signals the horse which lead to take when moving from a slower gait into the canter. In addition, when jumping over fences, the rider typically signals the horse to land on the correct lead to approach the next fence or turn. The rider can also request the horse to deliberately take up the wrong lead (counter-canter), a move required in some dressage competitions and routine in polo, which requires a degree of collection and balance in the horse. The switch from one lead to another without breaking gait is called the [...] "flying lead change" [...] or [...] "flying change". This switch is also a feature of dressage and reining schooling and competition.|$|E
2500|$|The narrowest {{definition}} would be: {{a system}} with unpaired spins that do not interact with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is a dilute gas of monatomic hydrogen atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting unpaired electron. Of course, the latter could be said about a gas of lithium atoms but these already possess two paired core electrons that produce a diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> {{and in the case}} of metallic gold it dominates the properties. Of course, the element hydrogen is virtually never called 'paramagnetic' because the monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to form molecular H2 and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (quenched), because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore diamagnetic and the same holds true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching is very much the rule rather than the exception. The quenching tendency is weakest for f-electrons because f (especially 4f) orbitals are radially contracted and they overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms. [...] Consequently, the lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or magnetically ordered.|$|E

The ritual of the holy bulls (Hapi, Apis) makes its official appearance under the fourth king of the first, and the first king of the second dynasties.* Mr. Le Page Renouf, admitting this, thinks the great development of bull-worship later.** In the third dynasty the name of Ra, sun, comes {{to be added to}} the royal names of kings, as Nebkara, Noferkara, and so forth.*** Osiris <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the jackal-god as the guardian of the dead.

With the successes of the eighteenth dynasty in Thebes, the process of syncretism, by which various god-names and god-natures are mingled, so as to unite the creeds of different nomes and provinces, and blend all in the worship of the Theban Ammon Ra, is most notable. Now arise schools of theology; pantheism and an approach to monotheism in the Theban god become probable results of religious speculations and imperial success. These tendencies are baffled by the break-up of the Theban supremacy, but the monotheistic idea remains in the esoteric dogmas of priesthoods, and survives into Neo-Platonism. Special changes are introduced--now, as in the case of worship of the solar disk by a heretic king; earlier, as in the prevalence of Set-worship, perhaps by Semitic invaders.**** ...|$|E
