2500|$|By {{the early}} 2nd century, Christians had {{agreed on a}} <b>basic</b> <b>list</b> of {{writings}} that would serve as their canon, see Development of the New Testament canon, but interpretations of these works differed, often wildly. [...] In part to ensure a greater consistency in their teachings, {{by the end of}} the 1st century many Christian communities evolved a more structured hierarchy, with a central bishop, whose opinion held more weight in that city. [...] By 160, most communities had a bishop, who based his authority on the chain of succession from the apostles to himself.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>basic</b> <b>list</b> {{of topics}} {{to be covered}} was prescribed, but {{it was up to}} the schools to develop this into a three-month {{instructional}} program. Mandatory topics included the following: advanced d-c and a-c circuit theory, electrical motors and generators, vacuum-tube characteristics, power supplies, amplifiers, oscillators, modulation techniques, filters and wave-shaping, receiver circuits, transmitter circuits, transmission lines and antennas, and basic electromagnetic propagation theory. Mathematical topics (mainly trigonometry and elementary calculus) were taken up when necessary for developing theoretical equations. Each student built a superheterodyne receiver, and fault-finding was taught using systematic signal-tracing.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{development}} of Improv, the Lotus team discovered that these sorts of formulas were both difficult to use, and resistant to future changes in the spreadsheet layout. Their solution {{was to make the}} user explicitly define the semantic content of the sheets - that the B column contained [...] "cars sold". These data ranges were known as [...] "categories". Formulas were written by referring to these categories by name, creating a new category that could be (if desired) placed in the sheet for display. Using the car example, the formula in Improv would be average per car = total income / cars sold. Changes to the layout of the sheet would not affect the formulas; the data remains defined no matter where it is moved. It also meant that formulas calculating intermediate values {{did not have to be}} placed in the sheet and normally did not take up room. The downside to Improv's approach is that it demanded more information from the user up-front, and was considered less suitable for [...] "quick and dirty" [...] calculations or <b>basic</b> <b>list</b> building.|$|E
