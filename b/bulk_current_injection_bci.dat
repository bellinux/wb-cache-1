40|$|Radiated {{emissions}} and susceptibility requirements imposed in bands where intentional RF reception or transmission {{does not occur}} is problematical. It is often desired to compare radiated emissions with radiated susceptibility performance to assess system level compatibility. For reasons purely theoretical and because of practical measurement limitations, this not realistic. McCollum and Clark proposed a limit and test method that provided a direct comparison of radiated {{emissions and}} radiated susceptibility performance in those cases where only unintentional emissions and reception are of interest (non-tunable electronics). This test method, referred to as <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> emissions (BCE) testing, and its associated limit is a complementary test method to <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> testing and radiated susceptibility testing. Previous work utilized victim and culprit circuits with low common-mode loop impedance.

40|$|International audienceThe {{use of a}} fixed {{forward power}} as {{obtained}} during the calibration phase in a <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> test, without monitoring the current, may cause damage on the equipment under test (EUT) with low impedances. In this paper, an accurate EUT model has been designed based on impedance investigation. This model {{can be used to}} predict the conducted susceptibility of a generic EUT. The model is first based on black-box approach; then, an interaction model is added to provide flexibility of several geometric parameters, which can be changed from one setup to another. This methodology leads to the combined approach, which shows a satisfactory agreement between simulations and measurements. According to the developed equations, the impedance matrix of the described model can be readily switched to modal one. Afterward, asymmetric dummy EUTs were investigated and the analytical equations used to predict differential mode due to common-mode voltage injection were validated...|$|R

It is highlighted that, above 100 MHz, the injected bulk current estimated by the calibration procedure described in the standard is significantly different from the actual bulk current injected into the connector of the equipment under test (EUT) during BCI tests. Such a discrepancy gives rise to unreliable BCI immunity test results highlighting susceptibility issues that are not related with the actual susceptibility of the EU...|$|E

General results are obtained, which are not affected by any assumptions on the equipment under test. It is shown that, from the theoretical point of view, injection by means of two current probes allows equivalence with any radiated plane wave excitation.

40|$|In this paper, {{common mode}} (CM) and {{differential}} mode (DM) voltages induced by <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> at the terminations of a differential interconnection are predicted and correlated {{to the degree}} of unbalance of the terminal units. This is done by extending a previously derived lumped-parameter representation of the injection probe and by combining modal analysis with a multiconductor transmission line theory. Under nonrestrictive assumptions on termination unbalance, it is shown that CM and DM voltages can be readily predicted by two equivalent circuits. The circuit for CM prediction is independent on termination unbalance and directly excited by the injection probe. The circuit for DM prediction does not involve any of the probe model parameters, and is driven by two voltage sources related to the induced CM voltages through the common-mode rejection ratio of each termination. Model accuracy was proven by measurements carried out on a test bench setup according to the BCI Standards...|$|R

In particular, a transmission line (TL) {{model of a}} commercial TWC mounted in the calibration fixture provided by the manufacturer is developed. The proposed model of the calibration setup provides accurate prediction of the measured insertion loss up to 2 GHz. Measurement data and outcomes of three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation of the TWC are used to obtain estimates {{of some of the}} involved model parameters, whose direct evaluation is not possible due to partial knowledge of the geometrical/electrical characteristics on the one side, and nonuniform distribution of current and voltage on the TWC cross section on the other. The proposed TL model is used to explain the fundamental phenomena responsible for RF-energy transfer through the TWC. Particularly, it is shown that, differently from <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> probes where inductive coupling is the dominant phenomenon, injection through the TWC involves both inductive and capacitive coupling. This determines a certain amount of directivity of the injection device, and is expected {{to play a role in}} RF injection onto complex cable bundles...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{possible}} {{applications of}} double <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> for susceptibility testing of spacecraft are investigated and discussed. Two test procedures are proposed: one {{is suitable for}} system-level (i. e., onboard) testing, the other for unit-level assessment of avionic equipment interconnected by multiwire shielded bundles. By enforcing equivalence between radiation and injection, both procedures are designed to inject expected electromagnetic interference (EMI) levels in the equipment under test (EUT), connected at the terminations of a wiring harness. The procedure for system-level testing requires amplitude and phase control of the radio-frequency power sources used to feed the injection probes. It allows to correlate the susceptibility effects obtained by injection with those due to a nonuniform electromagnetic field (such as the field generated by internal EMI sources in metallic enclosures). It is, therefore, suited for radiated intrasystem verifications. The procedure for unit-level testing exploits equivalence between radiation and injection {{in terms of the}} current distribution along the overshield, and applies to bundles with an arbitrary number of inner conductors. In the case of vertical polarization, this procedure allows for the reconstruction of the interference effects produced in the EUT by conventional radiated-susceptibility tests (e. g., DO- 160), requiring direct radiation of the system...|$|R

Subsequently, such unknown and uncontrolled setup parameters are treated as random variables, and a statistical rationale is developed to correlate the outcome of CS and RS tests. In particular, the proposed BCI test levels (probe calibration current versus frequency) are related to cumulative distribution functions which quantify the probability of overtesting (i. e., the excess of injected interference) with respect to RS...|$|E

Standard injection profiles are considered, and a virtual procedure for calibration is exploited to retrieve the forward power required for the test. It is shown that the difference between expected and actually injected RF current levels is significantly influenced by both EUT (input impedance and balancing) and setup characteristics (e. g., length of the cable harness). Additionally, comparison of theoretical power levels with those measured during real calibration of the injection device allowed for excluding the occurrence of non linear effects due to probe saturation...|$|E
