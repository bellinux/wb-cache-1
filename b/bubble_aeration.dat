The unit expels coarse bubbles (more than 2mm in diameter), which release oxygen when they come into contact with the water, which also contributes to a mixing of the lake's stratified layers. With the release of large bubbles from the system, a turbulent displacement of water occurs which results in a mixing of the water. In comparison to other aeration techniques, coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> is very inefficient in the way of transferring oxygen.

40|$|Conventional {{submerged}} membrane bioreactors (MBRs) rely on {{the coarse}} <b>bubbles</b> <b>aeration</b> to generate shear at the liquid membrane interface to limit membrane fouling. Unfortunately, {{it is a very}} energy consuming method, still often resulting in a rapid decrease of membrane permeability and consequently in higher expenses. In this paper, the feasibility of a novel magnetically induced membrane vibration (MMV) system was studied in a labscale MBR treating synthetic wastewater. The effects on membrane fouling of applied electrical power of different operation strategies, of membrane flux and of the presence of multiple membranes on one vibrating engine on membrane fouling were investigated. The filtration performance was evaluated by determining the filtration resistance profiles and critical flux. The results showed clear advantages of the vibrating system over conventional MBR processes by ensuring higher fluxes at lower fouling rates. Intermittent vibration was found a promising strategy for both efficient fouling control and significant energy saving. The optimised MMV system is presumed to lead to significant energy and cost reduction in up-scaled MBR operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{control of}} fouling, as {{previously}} mentioned, is primarily undertaken using coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration.</b> The distribution of bubbles around the membranes, the shear at the membrane surface for cake removal {{and the size}} of the bubble are greatly influenced by the mixing/hydrodynamics of the system. The mixing within the system can also influence the production of possible foulants.

50|$|The {{breakthrough}} for the MBR came in 1989 with Yamamoto {{and co-workers}} idea of submerging the membranes in the bioreactor. Until then, MBRs were designed with the separation device located {{external to the}} reactor (sidestream MBR) and relied on high transmembrane pressure (TMP) to maintain filtration. With the membrane directly immersed in the bioreactor, submerged MBR systems are usually preferred to sidestream configuration, especially for domestic wastewater treatment. The submerged configuration relies on coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> to produce mixing and limit fouling. The energy demand of the submerged system can be up to 2 orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} the sidestream systems and submerged systems operate at a lower flux, demanding more membrane area. In submerged configurations, aeration is considered as one of the major parameters in process performance both hydraulic and biological. Aeration maintains solids in suspension, scours the membrane surface and provides oxygen to the biomass, leading to a better biodegradability and cell synthesis.|$|E

50|$|Fine <b>bubble</b> {{diffused}} <b>aeration</b> is able {{to maximize}} the surface area of the bubbles and thus transfer more oxygen to the water per bubble. Additionally, smaller bubbles take more time to reach the surface so {{not only is the}} surface area maximized but so are the number of seconds each bubble spends in the water, allowing it more time to transfer oxygen to the water. As a general rule, smaller bubbles and a deeper release point will generate a greater oxygen transfer rate.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study {{a model for the}} oxygen {{concentration}} profiles in a mobile bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) is proposed. By using a material with a large specific surface area (m 2 /m 3) high biological activity can be maintained using a relatively small reactor volume. Small parts made of special materials with density close to the water density, are immersed in the bioreactors. The biofilm carriers are kept in suspension and even mixed with the help of air bubbles generated by the aeration system. Water oxygenation is a mass transfer process of oxygen from gas/air to the liquid mass. It can be used in wastewater treatment in order to remove the organic matter, in the biological stage. The functioning of aerobic processes depends on the availability of sufficient quantities of oxygen. In wastewater treatment plants, submerged <b>bubbles</b> <b>aeration</b> is most frequently accomplished by dispersing air bubbles in the liquid.

5000|$|Fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> is an {{efficient}} way to transfer oxygen to a water body. A compressor on shore pumps air through a hose, which is connected to an underwater aeration unit. Attached to the unit are a number of diffusers. These diffusers come in the shape of discs, plates, tubes or hoses constructed from glass-bonded silica, porous ceramic plastic, PVC or perforated membranes made from EPDM (ethylene propylene diene Monomer) rubber. [...] Air pumped through the diffuser membranes is released into the water. These bubbles are known as fine bubbles. The EPA defines a fine bubble as anything smaller than 2mm in diameter. This type of aeration has a very high oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE), sometimes as high as 15 pounds of oxygen / (horsepower * hour) (9.1 kilograms of oxygen / (kilowatt * hour)). On average, diffused air aeration diffuses approximately 2-4 cfm (cubic feet of air per minute) (56.6-113.3 liters of air per minute), but some operate at levels as low as 1 cfm (28.3 L/min) or as high as 10 cfm (283 L/min).|$|E

The characteristics of the solid phase of the biomass were affected by the biomass state (unstabilised, stabilising and stabilised) and by the SRT and HRT, whereas {{the characteristics of the}} liquid phase appeared to be more dependent on inuent composition and strength. Under operating conditions at constant SRT and HRT, the biomass characteristics reached their stabilised state aer 1. 0 ± 0. 3 SRT. The impact of membrane aeration, permeate flux and biomass characteristics was determined for biomass at unstabilised state and at stabilised state. A transitional permeate flux was observed between 16. 5 and 22 l. m` 2. h`l, below which no significant fouling was observed regardless of the permeate flux, membrane airflow velocity and biomass characteristics. Above transitional flux, membrane fouling increased and was affected by the permeate flux, the membrane aeration velocity and parameters either characterising the liquid or the solid phase of the biomass depending on the carbohydrate concentration of the liquid phase. A comparison of ne and coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> efficiency for biomass at unstabilised state and at several airflow rates established that ne <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> was more efficient in tem of oxygen transfer rate, but led to similar values to coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> for ot-factor.

40|$|What is aeration? Aeration {{is a step}} in {{wastewater}} treatment where air is added to wastewater for mixing purposes and to enhance biological growth. The purpose of aeration is to dissolve oxygen into wastewater so that the microorganisms can utilize it while they break down organic material. What is fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration?</b> Fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> is a subsurface form of diffusion in which air is introduced in the form of very small bubbles to aid or enhance the treatment of wastewater. Air flows from a pipe into diffusers located {{at the bottom of a}} tank. These diffusers have numerous small openings (known as pores) through which air flows into the wastewater in the tank. In the past, various diffusion devices have been classified as either fine bubble or coarse bubble based on how efficiently they transferred oxygen to the wastewater. Since it is difficult to clearly distinguish between fine and coarse bubbles, diffused aeration systems have been classified based on the physical characteristics of the equipment. In a fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> system, several diffusers are mounted or screwed into a header pipe that may run along the length or width of the tank or on a short manifold mounted on a movable pipe. These diffusers come in various shapes and sizes, such as discs, tubes, domes, and plates. The common types of coarse bubble diffusers are fixed orifices, valved orifices, and static tubes. The bubble size of these diffusers is larger than the porous diffusers, thus, lowering the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE). Fine pore diffusers (discs, tubes, domes, and plates) are usually made from ceramic, plastic, or flexible perforated membranes. Although many materials can be used to make fine pore diffusers, only these few are being used due to cost considerations, specific characteristics, market size, and other factors.

However, information on {{modeling of}} N 2 O emissions from full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is still sparse. In this work, a mathematical model based on currently known or hypothesized metabolic pathways for N 2 O productions by heterotrophic denitrifiers and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) is developed and calibrated to describe the N 2 O emissions from full-scale WWTPs. The model described well the dynamic ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, dissolved oxygen (DO) and N 2 O data collected from both an open oxidation ditch (OD) system with surface aerators and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system with <b>bubbling</b> <b>aeration.</b> The obtained kinetic parameters for N 2 O production {{are found to be}} reasonable as the 95 % confidence regions of the estimates are all small with mean values approximately at the center.

While clearly showing that the NH 2 OH related pathways could well explain N 2 O production and emission in the two full-scale plants studied, the modeling results do not prove the dominance of the NH 2 OH pathways in these plants, nor rule out the possibility of AOB denitrification being a potentially dominating pathway in other WWTPs that are designed or operated differently...|$|R
40|$|Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a melt-processable, semi-crystalline {{thermoplastics}} made by biological fermentation. A {{key feature}} of this plastic is its biodegradability. PHB is currently produced by bacterial fermentation, and is constrained by its high production costs compared to the more conventional petroleum derived polymers with comparable properties. PHB is also produced within certain species of microalgae. These photosynthetic microoganisms use CO₂ as their sole carbon source and so offer a potentially cheaper method for producing PHB, as well as sequestering what would otherwise be a contributor to global warming. For this process to be successful {{it is necessary to}} find a species of cyanobacteria that has a high occurrence of PHB within the cells and is also suitable for commercial production. In this research, selection criteria were developed for the screening of microalgae for PHB accumulation and suitability for culture in a novel closed photobioreactor (CPBR), developed by CSIRO using a “top-down” approach. The selection criteria were developed, through a series of preliminary experiments, and economic and environmental considerations. Preliminary experiments were conducted in the CPBR using Synechoccous PCC 7002, a species of cyanobacteria thought to produce PHB, to identify any system specific selection criteria. The experiments were conducted at several different light and temperature boundary conditions of the CPBR to determine the characteristics of the microalgae. From these experiments it was found that for the alga to be successfully cultivated in the CPBR it must be able to withstand <b>bubbling</b> <b>aeration</b> and not form microbial mats. From the economic considerations it was determined that high productivity, high final cell density, and high PHB content are desirable. Looking at the environmental considerations, it is also necessary that a native species of microalgae is used. Following a literature review many species of microalgae that produce PHB were found however there was a paucity of literature concerning the potential of Australian species to produce PHB. The following six species of microalgae were identified as possible PHB producers, as they were similar to species already known to prduce PHB: Anabaena flosaquae, Anabaena solitaria, Nodularia spumigenia, Pseudanabaena, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Microcystis flos-aquae. These species were tested against the selection criteria to choose a species for growth in the CPBR. Initial gross screening was conduced in aerated flasks to identify if the species were able to produce PHB and met the system specific selection criteria; rigorous screening was then conducted on the remaining species that passed the initial gross screening. Rigorous screening was conducted in flasks under different nutrient conditions to determine which species had the highest productivity, cell density, and PHB content. From these experiments a final candidate was selected, Anabaena solitaria. The methodology was then validated by cultivating the selected species in the CPBR; this was successful with Anabaena solitaria accumulating 8. 5 mg Lˉ¹ PHB under the balanced conditions. Thesis (M.

The industry is presently consuming the same amount of energy as it was originally, however, it is treating 30 % more organic load with the industry continuing to increase its production.

The main problem of these installations {{is that they}} do not operate at the maximum of their potential, mainly because of membrane fouling. Experimental research with this kind of installation requires resources and is time consuming. The use of a computer simulator, as in the present work, allows the fouling behaviour in a bench-scale submerged membrane bioreactor to be investigated over a wide range of operating parameters: average specific aeration intensity (0. 041 – 0. 277 L m− 2 s− 1), filtration flux (0. 032 – 0. 160 m 3 m− 2 d− 1) and filtration and coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> cycles (filtration and aeration times: 60 – 1080 s, with/without ratio: 0. 33 / 10). A quadratic optimization method applied to the energy consumption (EC) was first carried out: minimum values of 0. 27 and 0. 32 kW h m− 3 were obtained for EC in the sequential and non-sequential operating modes, respectively. Using the optimal operating conditions and the most influent parameters found in the first part, the second part details their influence on both membrane fouling and EC for each operating mode. The mean filtration flux and the mean aeration intensity have opposite effects on fouling and EC, which implies that a more global, economic optimization, including chemical cleaning, is needed. The detailed study of filtration and coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> cycles showed that they had little influence for a with/without ratio superior to 1.

This work focuses on the use of Biomass Monitor for the monitoring of biomass. Two dual frequency settings and 2 temperatures were examined. The effects of interferences when the Biomass Monitor probe is present in a bioreactor are also investigated. The feasibility of constructing a prediction model for viable cell density and viable cell volume for in-line use is examined as there is an increased focus on monitoring techniques that adhere to the guidance in the United States Food and Drug Administration’s Process Analytical Technology framework. It was found that interferences to the Biomass Monitor include proximity of the biomass probe to vessel walls, pO 2 probe and sparger with the <b>bubbles</b> from <b>aeration</b> having a significant effect on the signal. The three prediction models were a high cell density suspension serially diluted to a low cell density, real time culture suspension data and combination of the high cell density and real time data. From the prediction models, capacitance versus viable cell density at the dual frequency of 0. 2 and 10 MHz at 30 °C showed best predictions with error of all three models between 0. 26 - 0. 36 × 106 cells/ml. All models for viable cell volume were accurate at the lower ranges, with error increasing as the viable cell volume increased.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the growth and}} productivity of a tobacco line of hairy roots that produces murine interleukin 12 (mIL- 12) grown in three different culture systems: shake flasks, an airlift reactor, and a scalable mist reactor. Of the total mIL- 12 produced by cultures grown in shake flasks (similar to 434. 8 mu gL(- 1)), almost 21 % was recovered from the medium. In contrast to roots harvested from shake flasks and the mist reactor, roots were not uniformly distributed in the airlift reactor. Roots formed a dense ring around {{the wall of the}} reactor and surrounding the central rising column of fine <b>aeration</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Root quality was also better in both the shake flasks and mist reactor than in the airlift reactor. There were more pockets of dark roots in the airlift reactor suggesting some of the roots were nutrient starved. Although the best root growth (7 g DW L(- 1)) was in the shake flasks, both reactors produced about the same, but less dry mass, nearly 5 g DW L(- 1). Total mIL- 12 concentration was highest in the mist reactor at 5. 3 mu g g(- 1) FW, but productivity, 31 mu g g(- 1) FW day(- 1) was highest in shake flasks. Roots grown in the mist reactor produced about 49. 5 % more mIL- 12 than roots grown in the airlift reactor. Protease activity in the media increased steadily during culture of the roots in all three systems. The comparisons of protease activity, protein and mIL- 12 levels done in the shake flask system suggest that the increase in proteases associated with progression into stationary phase is most detrimental to mIL- 12 concentration. This is the first description of the design and operation of a scalable version of a mist bioreactor that uses a plastic bag. This also the first report of reasonable production levels of functional mIL- 12, or any protein, produced by hairy roots grown in a mist reactor.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{laboratory experiments}} of bubble plumes in crossflows and field measurements in managed lakes aerated by bubble plumes {{to better understand}} the behavior of bubble plumes in natural environments. The laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the detailed time-average and turbulent fluctuating velocity field in the wake region behind the bubble column and above the separation height, at which fluid entrained {{at the base of the}} plume separates from the bubbles. These measurements are important for developing predictive models for bubble plume dynamics and for quantifying their mixing characteristics. Two field campaigns, at Carvins Cove in Virginia and at Lake Hallwil in Switzerland, were conducted to measure the detailed bottom boundary currents and oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface for different diffuser operations. These lakes have different bubble plume diffuser types, and they span a range of shape, bathymetry, and environmental forcing. These field data are useful to elucidate the physical mechanisms by which currents resulting from both natural forcing (e. g., seiches) and artificial forcing (e. g., bubble plumes) affect oxygen uptake at the sediment-water interface, with the ultimate goal of better management of aeration systems in drinking water reservoirs. Experimental techniques applied in the laboratory experiments include Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF). Crossflows were generated in two ways: by towing the source and by forcing a recirculation current. A combination of field equipment was used in the field campaigns, including a microprofiler for temperature and oxygen; point and profiling acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV); thermistor chains; conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) profiles; and a meteorological station. During the field experiments, the bubble plume flow rate was varied to produce different dynamic and chemical conditions in the lakes. The laboratory experiments present a cohesive view of the flow dynamics in the wake of a bubble plume in crossflow. Using the forced and towed plume validates the analogy of the towed plume to that of the real current. The observations showed that no secondary bubble plume forms above the separation height, but rather the bubble column becomes a continuous source of vertical momentum to the wake region. The resulting vertical velocities impart a rising frame of reference on the separated plume so that its trajectory scales like a buoyant jet despite the absence of buoyancy in the separated fluid. Maximum values of the Reynolds stresses and mixing occur at the base of the separated plumes, and the bubble column elevates both the turbulence intensity and the kinetic energy throughout the wake region. The in situ field measurements provide insight into the role of <b>aeration</b> <b>bubble</b> plumes on the oxygen dynamics at the sediment-water interface. Detailed, simultaneous measurements of turbulence and oxygen uptake in the bottom boundary layer allowed the direct validation of boundary exchange models. The measurements also showed that unsteady operation of the bubble plume results in generation of basin-scale internal waves that drive measurable currents in the bottom boundary layer. Moreover, measurements showed that it is the oxygen concentration outside the diffusive boundary layers that is the dominant mechanism for controlling the uptake at the sediment-water interface...|$|R

40|$|The aerobic {{biodegradation}} of toxic organic volatile contaminants is always {{limited by the}} low aqueous solubility of O 2. Therefore, intensive <b>bubbling</b> or surface <b>aeration</b> is required to supply the bacterial community with sufficient O 2 to carry out pollutant mineralization. This can cause the hazardous volatilization of toxic volatile contaminants. Photosynthetic oxygenation overcomes these limitations by in-situ O 2 generation via photosynthesis. More precisely, microalgae produce the O 2 required by the aerobic bacteria to mineralize organic pollutants, which in turn use the CO 2 released by the bacteria. This oxygenation mode is both safer {{because there is no}} risk of volatilization due to air bubbling, and less expensive, because sunlight is used as the main energy source. The potential of photosynthetic oxygenation to support the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants was investigated. Photosynthetic oxygenation was able to support the complete removal of salicylic acid, phenol, phenanthrene and acetonitrile under continuous artificial illumination in enclosed photobioreactors without any external O 2 supply. Microalgae activity often limited the biodegradation process due to their low growth rate and their low tolerance towards toxic pollutants. Special attention was therefore given to the selection of microalgae. Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus, Selenastrum capricornutum and Scotiellopsis oocystiformis were compared in combination with pollutant-specific degrading bacteria for their ability to support the biodegradation of salicylate and acetonitrile. In both cases, C. sorokiniana exhibited the highest O 2 production rates and highest tolerance and therefore supported the fastest removal. The inhibition of microalgae was especially problematic when treating highly concentrated toxic effluents as process inhibition occurred, even with pollutant resistant microalgae. In this regard, two liquid phase bioreactors were shown to bring process stability, by allowing a self-regulated delivery of the toxic organic pollutant to the microbial community. Thus, the addition of silicone oil or tetradecane into the culture medium permitted the biodegradation of phenanthrene at concentrations of up to 500 mg. l- 1. Maximum phenanthrene degradation rates up to 24 mg. l- 1. h- 1 were achieved in test tubes under continuous illumination at 17. 000 lux with silicone oil as organic phase. In addition, the presence of the microalgae enhanced phenanthrene mass transfer to the cells by releasing biosurfactants that increased the interfacial area between the organic and the aqueous phase. The inoculation strategy was very important to favor the start-up in batch photobioreactors. Thus, at the early stages of biodegradation, microalgal density limited the process up to a certain algal density where the process became limited by light supply to the photosynthetic cells. Therefore, a sufficient initial microalgal density must be present in order to avoid excessively long lag phases. The continuous photosynthetically oxygenated biodegradation of salicylate was efficient and stable for over 1 year of operation. Under optimised conditions sodium salicylate was removed at a maximum constant rate of 87 mg. l- 1. h- 1, corresponding to an estimated oxygenation capacity of 77 mgO 2. l- 1. h- 1. Process efficiency was significantly influenced by temperature, light intensity, pollutant concentration, and wastewater flow rate. The control of microalgal concentration by biomass settling and subsequent recirculation into the photobioreactor significantly enhanced pollutant biodegradation. When increasing biomass concentration from 0. 4 to 0. 6 g. l- 1 salicylate removal efficiency increased from 56 to 100 %. One of the main advantages of algal-bacterial systems was the possibility to combine the removal of several pollutants. Indeed, the use of microalgae was specially advantageous for the degradation of organonitriles for two reasons; first it reduced their hazardous volatilisations and secondly a significant amount of the NH 4 + generated during their biodegradation was assimilated by microalgae. During continuous acetonitrile biodegradation at 3. 5 days of HRT, up to 83 % of the NH 4 + produced was removed using a C. sorokiniana in combination with an acetonitrile degrading mixed culture. In addition, the residual biomass produced during pollutant mineralisation exhibited good properties with regards of Cu 2 + removal, with specific adsorptions of up to 8. 5 mgCu. g- 1 at 20 mg. l- 1 of initial Cu concentration. This study showed that the implementation of a process configuration based on an adsorption column packed with the residual biomass and placed before the photobioreactor enhanced the stability of a photosynthetically oxygenated salicylate biodegradation process. This study clearly demonstrated the broad potential of photosynthetic microorganisms in environmental biotechnology...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the effect of fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> on the relative amounts of N species, specifically NH 3 and NI-I 4 within cattle slurry. Research into farm waste treatment systems has mainly concentrated on pig waste, yet cattle slurry treatment presents a challenging and relatively neglected research area. Farrell (1996) developed a fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> treatment system and studied the effects of aeration on physical, chemical and fertiliser quality of slurry. He noted substantial loses of total Kjeldahl N from aerated slurry. This is a major concern as stripped NH 3 can present a significant atmospheric pollutant. Here aeration treatment was studied at laboratory-scale (1 litre) and pilot-scale (100 litres). Air was externally supplied to tubular fine bubble diffusers. Initially a settleable floculative microbial culture was developed using batch-to-batch aeration that was continuously aerated for a maximum of 5 days. Treatment conditions were varied to study effects of aeration rate, temperature, pH and the addition of an adapted microbial culture upon N species within the slurry. The exhaust gases from the aeration bioreactors passed through a chemical capture system. Slurry samples were obtained during treatment to establish the chemical and biological changes. Finally, the effect of aeration on the fertiliser value of the treated slurry was studied. Experiments at laboratory-scale showed that N was released as NH 3 within the exhaust gases and that there were major changes in the amount and type of N species within the slurry. Increasing the pH of the slurry increased the quantity of NH 3 released. Similar increases in rates of NH 3 release were shown for aeration rates up to 0. 2 vvm and temperature up to 60 °C. The optimum conditions for NH 3 stripping were found to be alkaline pH, high aeration rate and high temperature. At low aeration rates and low temperatures, there was a 96. 59...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the report the {{influence}} of plastic media modules with regard to oxygen transfer in clean water was investigated. Different types of plastic media modules were fixed within the aeration tank of a common fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> systems above the diffusers. The height of the media modules and the distance between diffusers and the lower border of the media modules were important experimental variables with respect to the modules configuration. During all oxygen uptake runs the oxygen transfer rate, the diameter and velocity of bubbles, and the movement velocity of the water were determined. On the basis of extensive experiments the influence of the type of plastic media modules, of the distance between diffusers and modules, of the arrangement of the modules and the diffusers in the tank (single and double spiral flow) and of the air flow rate on the oxygen transfer rate, on the diameter and velocity of the bubbles and on the water velocity was determined. In the second part of the report the influence of surfactants on the oxygen transfer rate in clean water was examined in order to simulate the reducing influence of surfactants in activated sludge plants on the rate of oxygen transfer of fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration.</b> After characterizing the different types of surfactants and their concentrations in typical wastewater their influence on the properties of water is discussed. Based on the fundamentals of oxygen transfer, the present knowledge of the properties and behaviour of air bubbles in water with and without surfactants is compiled, mainly with respect to those parameters that influence the rate of oxygen transfer. The influence of type and concentration of surfactants is extensively investigated varying the properties of the applied pure water (content of electrolytes, hardness). On the basis of the experimental results it is shown that the well known hypotheses describing the influence of surfactants on the coalescence of bubbles and the corresponding inhibition of oxygen transfer are incorrect. A new hypothesis could not be formulated, however. Finally, suggestions are made for improving the technique of measuring the rate of oxygen transfer essentially. These results can be applied in practice directly. (orig.)

40|$|Fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> and biomass {{characteristics}} were studied for {{their impact on}} oxygen transfer in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Ten biomass samples from both municipal and industrial pilot and full scale submerged MBRs with {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} concentrations (MLSS) ranging from 7. 2 to 30. 2 g. L- 1 were studied at six air flow rates (0. 7, 1. 3, 2. 3, 3, 4. 4 and 6 m 3. m- 3. h- 1). Graphical and statistical analyses were applied to the results to identify the relative impacts of the various bulk biomass characteristics on oxygen transfer, the former being solids concentration, 2 viscosity, particle size distribution, concentrations of COD, protein and carbohydrate in the soluble microbial product, SMP, and in the extracellular polymeric substances, EPS. Of the biomass characteristics studied, only solids concentration (correlated with viscosity), the carbohydrate fraction of the EPS (EPSc) and the COD concentration of the SMP (SMPCOD) were found to affect the oxygen transfer parameters kLa 20 (the oxygen transfer coefficient) and -factor. The relative influence on kLa 20 was MLSS> aeration> EPSc> SMPCOD and on -factor was MLSS> SMPCOD> EPSc> aeration. Both kLa 20 and -factor increased with increasing aeration and EPSc and decreased with increasing MLSS and SMPCOD. MLSS was found to be the main parameter controlling the oxygen transfer.

40|$|Silicone oils were {{microencapsulated}} within polyamide (nylon) membranes cross-linked with polyethylenimine. Solubility {{of oxygen}} within the silicone oils, whether encapsulated or not, was approximately 6 mM, representing solubilities 20 fold {{higher than that}} of oxygen in water. Assuming that the bioreactor volume consists of 10 to 20 % microencapsulated silicone oil, this represents an enhancement of the oxygen reservoir by a factor ranging from 4 to 7. The use of 20 %(v/v) microcapsule dispersions also enabled a 4 to 5 times increase of volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (k$ sb{ rm L}$a), calculated on a per-litre aqueous phase basis, with or without the presence of cells. The improvement in oxygen transfer rates was due to the greatly increased specific surface area in comparison to conventional <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration.</b> These oxygen transfer enhancements were directly translatable into enhancements in overall productivity in a culture of Gluconobacter suboxydans (ATCC 621). The production rate of dihydroxyacetone was increased from 1. 5 to 9 mM DHA/hr with the introduction of 20 % of microcapsules in a batch fermentation and also from 6 to 8 mM DHA/hr in a fluidized bed fermentation. Thus, the oxygen permeable polymeric membrane coating the silicone oils as oxygen carrier should reduce the toxic or inhibitory effects previously observed in other oxygen carriers during use with live cells while providing an efficient alternative to bioreactor oxygenation with shear sensitive cell systems, or in fermentations with high oxygen requirements...|$|E
40|$|While most {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) {{research focuses on}} improving membrane filtration through air scour, backwashing and chemical cleaning to physically counteract fouling, relatively few studies have dealt with fouling prevention, e. g. minimizing the impact of operational settings that negatively impact sludge filterability. To evaluate the importance of those settings, the effects of bioreactor aeration intensity variations on membrane fouling have been studied in a lab-scale MBR setup while simultaneously monitoring {{a unique set of}} key sludge parameters. In particular, this paper focuses on the impact of shear dynamics resulting from fine air bubbles on the activated sludge quality and flocculation state, impacting membrane fouling. When augmenting the fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> intensity both the total and irreversible fouling rate increased. Major indications for sludge filterability deterioration were found to be a shift in the particle size distribution (PSD) in the 3 - 300 μm range towards smaller sludge flocs, and increasing concentrations of submicron particles (10 - 1000 nm), soluble microbial products and biopolymers. When lowering the aeration intensity, both the sludge characteristics and fouling either went back to background values or stabilized, respectively indicating a temporary or more permanent effect, with or without time delay. The shift in PSD to smaller flocs and fragments likely increased the total fouling through the formation of a less permeable cake layer, while high concentrations of submicron particles were likely causing increased irreversible fouling through pore blocking. The insights from the performed fouling experiments can be used to optimize system operation with respect to influent dynamics. </p...|$|E
40|$|The energy {{consumption}} of a small-scale membrane bioreactor, treating high strength domestic wastewater for community level wastewater recycling, has been optimised using a dynamic {{model of the}} plant. ASM 2 d was chosen as biological process model {{to account for the}} presence of phosphate accumulating organisms. A tracer test was carried out to determine the hydraulic behaviour of the plant. To realistically simulate the aeration demand, a dedicated aeration model was used incorporating the dependency of the oxygen transfer on the mixed liquor concentration and allowing differentiation between coarse and fine <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration,</b> both typically present in MBRs. A steady state and dynamic calibration was performed, and the calibrated model was able to predict effluent nutrient concentrations and MLSS concentrations accurately. A scenario analysis (SCA) was carried out using the calibrated model to simulate the effect of varying SRT, recirculation ratio and DO set point on effluent quality, MLSS concentrations and aeration demand. Linking the model output with empirically derived correlations for {{energy consumption}} allowed an accurate prediction of the energy consumption. The SCA results showed that decreasing membrane aeration and SRT were most beneficial towards total energy consumption, while increasing the recirculation flow led to improved TN removal {{but at the same time}} also deterioration in TP removal. A validation of the model was performed by effectively applying better operational parameters to the plant. This resulted in a reduction in energy consumption by 23 % without compromising effluent quality, as was accurately predicted by the model. This modelling approach thus allows the operating envelope to be reliably identified for meeting criteria based on energy demand and specific water quality determinants...|$|E
40|$|Intensive {{depuration}} {{plants have}} often shown low reliability and economic sustainability, when utilised for agro-industrial wastewater treatment, {{due to the}} particular wastewater properties: high organic load and essential oil concentrations, acidity, nutrient scarcity and qualitative-quantitative variability of effluents. Aerated lagooning systems represent a suitable alternative, because {{they are able to}} assure good reliability and low energy requirements, avoiding the drawbacks shown by the intensive depuration plants. In order to optimize performance of the lagooning systems, particularly in terms of energy requirements, depuration processes of aerobic-anaerobic aerated lagoons were investigated, both at full- and laboratory-scale. Citrus processing wastewater were subject to <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> with low flow rates and limited time; the removal rate of organic load was evaluated and energy requirements of different depuration schemes were compared. The experimental investigations in full-scale aerated lagoons showed a low energy supply (0. 21 - 0. 59 kWh per kg of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) removed with an average value of 0. 45 kWh kgCOD – 1), an adequate equalisation capability and constantly good depurative performance also with high concentrations of essential oil (500 - 1000 ppm). The experimental investigations in lab-scale aerated tanks under controlled conditions indicated the possibility of decreasing energy requirements (down to 0. 16 kWh kgCOD – 1) by reducing aeration power (down to 0. 6 W m– 3) and limiting aeration time to night 12 hours only, when energy price is lower. In spite of the low aeration, the COD removal rates were on the average six-fold higher compared to the anaerobic tank. Other outcomes indicated an ability of the spontaneous microflora to adapt to high concentrations of essential oils, which however did not provide an increase of the removal rate of the organic load in the experimented scheme...|$|E
40|$|Biofilms {{grown on}} {{free-floating}} attachment surfaces, as in integrated fixed film activated sludg (IFAS) and moving bed bioreactors (MBBRs) {{are commonly used}} in wastewater treatment, but {{little is known about}} how media geometry affects the biofilms and process performance. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare nitrification and growth of biofilms grown on different length media in bench-scale MBBRs. The carriers were cut from high density polyethylene tubing with one media type one-third the length of the other, but with inner and outer diameter dimensions identical. Each bioreactor was continuously operated with coarse <b>bubble</b> <b>aeration</b> and provided with a high ammonium loading to promote greatly active nitrifying communities. Biomass measurements were taken regularly to observe growth. A series of variable velocity gradient (G) batch tests was executed to determine the effect of mixing on mass transfer through the biofilms of each media type. High ammonium and variable pH batch tests were also conducted to assess inhibition effects on nitrifiers. Greater biomass was consistently measured on the longer media despite both media types having similar ammonia uptake during continuous operation. Lower G values consistently produced greater ammonia utilization in the short media biofilm than in the long media biofilm. However, at mid to high range G values, ammonia consumption was similar between both biofilms. Ends of media typically had greater biomass and greater nitrate production than middle sections, while ammonia consumption was similar along carrier length. Abrupt changes in ammonium concentration and pH produced significantly greater inhibition effects in the short media biofilm than in the long media biofilm, suggesting greater protection in the biofilm grown on the longer media.
