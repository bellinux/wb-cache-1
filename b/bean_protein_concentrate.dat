30|$|Foamability {{is linked}} with {{flexible}} protein molecules that reduce the surface tension which keeps air bubbles in suspension and slows down {{the rate of}} coalescence. Globular proteins are relatively stable to surface denaturation which gives low foam. Previously, foaming capacity of winged <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> (36  %), soya isolates (235  %) and mucuna <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> (58  %) were reported. In this study, the microalgae protein concentrate had an FC of 95  %. FS is important since the usefulness of whipping agents depends {{on their ability to}} maintain the whip as long as possible. In the case of microalgae protein concentrate, foaming stability was 97  % after 180  min of storage. This excellent FS suggests that the native proteins that were soluble in the continuous phase (water) were very surface-active in microalgae proteins (Kaur and Singh 2007).|$|E

Jack bean flour milled from the seed nibs was defatted with n-hexane {{and part of the}} defatted flour (DJF) extracted in acid medium (pH; 4. 5) for protein concentrate (JPC). Both the DJF and JPC were analysed for nutrient composition, and then used to fortify bread. Five bread samples with 0 %, 10 % and 20 % of DJF or JPC were prepared using straight dough procedure, and then analysed for quality characteristics. The DJF and JPC had 28. 8 % and 49. 47 % protein, 46. 44 % and 30. 22 % carbohydrate, 0. 61 % and 1. 00 % crude fibre respectively; and were rich in Ca, Fe, Zn and P. Both DJF and JPC improved quality of bread but JPC conferred better quality. The 20 % DJF and JPC respectively improved protein content of bread from 9. 45 % to 10. 97 % and 11. 16 %, crude fibre from 2. 39 % to 5. 20 % and 5. 32 %, fat from 2. 35 % to 7. 00 % and 6. 55 %, and ash content from 1. 35 % to 2. 05 % and 2. 10 % but decreased carbohydrate content from 72. 12 % to 50. 45 % and 50. 39 % in the bread samples.

Casein-coated oil droplets enriched with lutein were highly unstable to flocculation near their isoelectric point due to the reduction in electrostatic repulsion. However, casein-dextran-coated droplets were stable, which was attributed to strong steric repulsion by the dextran moiety. The casein-coated droplets were unstable to aggregation in the gastric phase of a simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT), whereas the casein-dextran-coated ones were still stable, which was again attributed to increased steric repulsion.

AIbumins and globulins accounted for 21. 18 and 73. 40 percent, respectively, of the total <b>bean</b> <b>proteins.</b> The <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> were fractionated and <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> and <b>protein</b> isolates were prepared. The <b>bean</b> flour <b>proteins,</b> albumins, globulins, <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates,</b> and <b>protein</b> isolates (heretofore referred to as fractions) were studied electrophoretically. Several functional properties of the fractions were investigated. <b>Protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> had the highest water and oil absorption capacity (5. 93 and 4. 12 g/g, respectively) and emulsion capacity (72. 6 g oil emulsified/g). Albumins registered the highest emulsion stability (780 hours at 21 °C). Foaming performance of the Great Northern <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> was fair and concentration dependent. Sorption isotherms studies indicated that the bean flour had higher equilibrium moisture content at corresponding temperature and equilibrium relative humidity than other fractions. Buffer capacity of the <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> over a pH range of 4 - 8 was modest. Modification (succinylation and oxidation) improved the water and oil absorption capacity of the <b>bean</b> <b>proteins.</b> Globulins registered the highest stickiness (92 N) among all the fractions. Alkali solubilization of the <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> resulted in significant reduction in trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities and elimination of hemagglutinating activity. <b>Protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were essentially void of flatulence activity. Amino acid profiles indicated that the <b>bean</b> flour <b>proteins,</b> albumins, and protein isolates contained high acidic amino acids, while globulins and <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were characterized by high proportions of hydrophobic amino acids. Sulfur containing amino acids and leucine were {{the first and second}} limiting amino acids in the Great Northern <b>bean</b> <b>proteins.</b> Heat treatment of the fractions improved the in vitro protein digestibility. Baking studies indicated that replacement of wheat flour by the bean flour and the <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> for improved nutritionality of cookies and bread was possible without adversely affecting the sensory quality attributes. In cookie preparation, <b>bean</b> flour and <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> could replace wheat flour up to 30 percent and 20 percent (by weight), respectively; the corresponding figures for the wheat flour replacement in breadmaking were 10 percent and 10 percent (by weight). Fermentation of the Great Northern beanrice blends suggested the potential for these beans in developing fermented foods. The beans contained 59. 20 percent (on a dry weight basis) of starch. Starch granule size ranged from 12 X 12 μm to 58 X 40 μm (length X width) and the granule shape was round to oval to elliptical, and in certain cases, concave as well. Lamellae were present on all the starch granules observed. Amylose {{content of the}} starch was 10. 20 percent (on starch basis). Stable gel formation by the bean starch was observed at concentrations of 7 percent and above (w /v). The viscoamylographic studies of the isolated starch indicated the restricted swelling character of the bean starch. Solubility and swelling of the bean starch was both pH and temperature dependent. The addition of free fatty acids to the isolated starch reduced the viscosity and raised the gelatinization temperature of the bean starch. Modifications (acetylation and oxidation) of the isolated starch resulted in altered solubility and swelling characteristics. Replacement of wheat flour by the bean starch caused an increase in alkaline water retention capacity.

For a number of nutritional, strategic and economic reasons, the use of plant proteins has steadily increased over the years, however a major limitation is associated with the presence of anti-nutritional factors and the nutritional profile of the protein concentrate. Investigating novel raw materials involves understanding the physiological consequences associated with the dietary inclusion of protein concetrates. The primary aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the metabolic response of salmon to increasing inclusion of air-classified faba <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> (BPC) in feeds as a replacement for soy protein concentrate (SPC). Specifically, we tested treatments with identical contents of fishmeal (222. 4 g kg- 1) and progressively higher inclusion of BPC (0 g kg- 1, 111. 8 g kg- 1, 223. 6 g kg- 1, 335. 4 g kg- 1, 447. 2 g kg- 1) substituting SPC. This study demonstrated a dose-dependent metabolic response to a plant ingredient and was the first to compare the nutrigenomic transcriptional responses after substitution of terrestrial feed ingredients such as BPC and SPC without withdrawal of marine ingredients. It was found that after eight weeks a major physiological response in liver was only evident above 335. 4 g kg- 1 BPC and included decreased expression of metabolic pathways, and increased expression of genes regulating transcription and translation processes and the innate immune response. Furthermore, we showed that the nutritional stress caused by BPC resembled, at least at hepatic transcriptional level, that caused by soybean meal (included as a positive control in our experimental design). The outcomes of the present study suggested that Atlantic salmon parr might efficiently utilize moderate substitution of dietary SPC with BPC, with the optimum inclusion level being around 120 g kg- 1 in the type of feeds tested here...|$|E

40|$|The limited {{availability}} of marine ingredients means that {{new and improved}} raw materials with high potential to replace fishmeal (FM) are required.

The trial investigated the performance of 16 feeds formulated with varying FM/SPC/BPC proportions using a mixture design approach. Salmon parr of average weight 1. 47 g were used as a model. The trial lasted eight weeks and also included high FM (560 g kg- 1) and high defatted soybean meal (360 g kg- 1) feeds as negative and positive controls respectively, {{for the assessment of}} gut inflammation. The results demonstrated conclusively that total inclusion levels of BPC ranging from 50 to 200 g kg- 1, partially replacing SPC and/or FM, displayed the greatest potential to be beneficial in terms of fish performance and nutrient composition with increased growth, protein content, fat content and ash. In addition to favourable whole-body composition parameters, it was found that inclusions of BPC below 340 g kg- 1 of feed did not cause detrimental effects such as the gut inflammation observed in fish fed the high soybean meal control. High Inclusion level (450 g kg- 1) of BPC caused a mild gut inflammation that was not as severe as that caused by the feed with high soybean meal.

However, for carnivorous species such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), protein levels in legumes are generally too lowand require to be concentrated to be direct replacements for FM. Previouslywe showed that a faba <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate,</b> produced by air classification, containing 55 % protein could partially replace FM and/or soy protein concentrate (SPC) in feeds for parr and post-smolt salmon. In the present study, a faba bean protein isolate (BPI), produced by a wet process, with almost ~ 80 % crude proteinwas investigated in feeds for Atlantic salmon in seawater. Four dietary treatments were tested including one with high inclusion of FM (400 g kg− 1) and three with low FM (216 g kg− 1) and increasing inclusions of BPI (0, 70 and 140 g kg− 1) substituting for SPC (236, 125 and 45 g kg− 1). Growth performance in fish was unaffected with the lower level of dietary BPI, butwas reduced in fish fed the higher level, mainly due to feed intake being reduced initially. Histological analysis of the distal intestine showed inflammation in fish fed both diets containing BPI, but especially at 140 g kg− 1. The high dietary level of BPI affected the transcriptome of pyloric caeca with almost 2000 differentially expressed genes (DEG) compared to fish fed FM, whereas fish fed SPC or the lower level of BPI showed no DEG compared to fish fed FM. In contrast, the liver transcriptomewas generally affected similarly by both BPI and SPC.

40|$|Background The {{potential}} for alternative plant protein sources to replace limited marine ingredients in fish feeds {{is important for}} the future of the fish farming industry. However, plant ingredients in fish feeds contain antinutritional factors (ANFs) that can promote gut inflammation (enteritis) and compromise fish health. It is unknown whether enteritis induced by plant materials with notable differences in secondary metabolism is characterised by common or distinct gene expression patterns, and how using feeds with single vs mixed plant proteins may affect the gut transcriptome and fish performance. We used Atlantic salmon parr to investigate the transcriptome responses of distal gut to varying dietary levels (0 - 45 %) of soy <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> (SPC) and faba <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba) <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> (BPC) following an 8 -week feeding trial. Soybean meal (SBM) and fish meal (FM) were used as positive and negative controls for enteritis, respectively. Gene expression profiling was performed using a microarray platform developed and validated for Atlantic salmon.   Results Different plant protein materials (SPC, BPC and SBM) generated substantially different gut gene expression profiles, with relatively few transcriptomic alterations (genes, pathways and GO terms) common for all plant proteins used. When SPC and BPC were simultaneously included in the diet, they induced less extensive alterations of gut transcriptome than diets with either SPC or BPC singly, probably due to reduced levels of individual ANFs. The mixed plant protein diets were also associated with improved body composition of fish relative to the single plant protein diets, which may provide evidence for a link between the magnitude of changes in gut transcriptome and whole-animal performance.   Conclusions Our results indicate that gut transcriptomic profiling provides a useful tool for testing the applicability of alternative protein sources for aquaculture feeds and designing diets with reduced impact of ANFs on fish health. Ultimately, understanding diet-gut interactions and intestinal homeostasis in farmed fish is important to maximise performance and to ensure that aquaculture continues to be a sustainable source of food for a growing world population...|$|R

Based on the results in parr in freshwater, the present study tested the hypothesis that BPC can effectively replace SPC and/or FM as a dietary protein source in post-smolt Atlantic salmon in seawater. The trial was designed to test nine different combinations of BPC, SPC and FM around the ideal mixture proportions modelled from data on parr (20 % BPC, 46 % SPC and 34 % FM as percent of the total dietary protein). Somatic, physiological, biochemical and molecular parameters were assessed to determine fish performance. On average, fish grew from ~ 1. 28 kg to 2. 80 kg over the course of the 17 week trial. Results demonstrated that a mixture of BPC, SPC and FM (208 gkg− 1, 193 gkg− 1 and 85 gkg− 1, respectively) resulted in the highest weight gain of post-smolts without significantly altering the FCR. Specifically, fish fed the highest inclusion of BPC and lowest level of FM had final weights on average 0. 24 kg more than those with the lowest inclusion of BPC and highest FM. Improved weight gain was not achieved at the expense of poorer FCR, which was lower in fish fed diets with higher content of BPC and lower FM.

40|$|The {{protein quality}} and physico-functional {{properties}} of Australian sweet lupin <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates,</b> prepared by isoelectric precipitation or ultrafiltration, were assessed. The ultrafiltration process {{resulted in a}} higher yield of protein than did the isoelectric precipitation process. The lupin kernel and the two lupin <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> had similar essential amino acid compositions that were inferior to ideal human requirements. True digestibilities of the isoelectrically precipitated (ISO) and the ultrafiltered (UF) lupin <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were similar but significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that of casein. Net protein utilisations (NPU) of the ISO and UF <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were similar but significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than that of casein.

40|$|Background: Mung bean is {{well known}} as a starch source, but the {{physiological}} effects of mung <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> have received little attention. In this study, we isolated mung <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> from de-starched mung bean solutions, and investigated its influence on lipid metabolism. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} is to clarify the influence of the lipid metabolism by consumption of mung <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> isolate (MPI) Methods: Diets containing either mung <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> isolate (MPI) or casein were fed to normal rats for 28 days. Results: Both groups ate the same amount of food, but the plasma triglyceride level, relative liver weight and liver lipid contents (cholesterol and triglyceride pool) in the MPI group were significantly lower than in the casein group. In the MPI group, the expression of sterol regulatory-element binding factor 1 (SREBF 1) mRNA in the liver was significantly different when compared with the casein group. The significantly lower levels of insulin and free fatty acids in the MPI-fed rats may be due to the regulation of genes related to lipid metabolism in th...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the use of rapeseed (Brassica napus) protein from oil industry waste for food applications, two rapeseed cultivars (Express, Lion) were pretreated to remove the hulls and oil. Rapeseed <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were then prepared by washing with 450 ml/l isopropanol. A portion of each <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> was steamed before undergoing isopropanol treatment to deactivate myrosinase. Deactivation of myrosinase prevents glucosinolate decomposition and improves the extractability of sinapin acids. Lion rapeseed <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> showed higher water and oil binding capacities than Express <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates.</b> The steaming process reduced the oil binding capacity, emulsification capacity and protein solubility. When steamed rapeseed <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> was added to sausage preparations in place of casein, sensory analysis showed that the rapeseed protein sausage had improved taste, good texture and a characteristic aroma. Hydrolysed de-oiled rapeseed and <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were prepared using gastrointestinal enzymes. The cholate binding capacity, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and DPPH radical scavenging activity were then investigated. Pepsin-hydrolysed <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> showed the strongest ACE inhibition.

The obtained results indicated that swelling of hydrogel in these solutions had different effects on their mineral, trace element and total protein content. Total protein and phosphorus content increased in milk <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> and whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> solutions after swelling of hydrogel without changes in their protein compositions. On the other hand, the protein content in BSA solution decreased after swelling. The content of Na did not change in milk <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> solution, whereas it significantly increased in whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> solution after hydrogel swelling. The content of Ca and Mg was reduced after the swelling in milk <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> and whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> solutions for 20. 3 – 63. 4 %, depending on the analysed sample and the mineral. The content of Zn did not change during swelling, whereas the content of Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb significantly decreased after hydrogel swelling in all analysed samples. According to the obtained results, the addition of polyacrylic hydrogel to milk and whey <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> solutions can significantly decrease the content of heavy metal ions without affecting their protein composition. Therefore, this work could be useful in developing a new technological process for heavy metal purification of milk protein-based products...|$|R

The nutritional and functional properties of milk <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> {{can be used}} to enhance food products. However, the use of milk <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> in high-protein nutrition bars contributes to crumbly texture and rapid hardening during storage. Milk <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> with 80 % protein was extruded or toasted to modify its molecular structure and resulting functional properties. Modified samples had reduced protein solubility and surface hydrophobicity whereas gelation was relatively unaffected. Extruded, and toasted milk <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> were used to manufacture model high-protein nutrition bars at 30 % protein. Hardness along with other textural parameters, water activity, and color were measured over 42 day storage at 22 °C, 32 °C, and 42 °C.
