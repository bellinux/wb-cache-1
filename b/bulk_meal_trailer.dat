40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the consequences of developing obesity on glucose homeostasis in animals showing hyperphagia plus vagal hyperinsulinemia and rats that were normophagic and hyperinsulinemic. Male rats were lesioned in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and kept either under ad libitum or absolute (oral or intragastrical) pair-feeding conditions for 4 weeks. Hyperphagic rats, as well as normophagic VMH rats, became obese, but only ad lib-fed obese rats displayed glucose intolerance to intravenous (IV) glucose infusions. Orally pair-fed VMH rats also showed normal oral and intragastric glucose tolerance, but in intragastrically fed VMH animals and controls, oral and intragastric glucose tolerance was decreased. These results indicate that (1) obesity {{as a consequence of}} VMH lesions is not dependent on hyperphagia, confirming earlier reports, and also independent of the ingestion of <b>bulk</b> <b>meals.</b> (2) β-cell release of insulin to IV glucose infusion is not sufficient when hyperphagia and vagally mediated hyperinsulinemia coincide, and is therefore dependent on several factors; and (3) oral glucose intolerance develops when preabsorptive reflexes are blunted, irrespective of whether the animals were hyperinsulinemic or not. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{classical}} {{force field}} approach {{was used to}} characterize the solvation dynamics of high-density CO 2 (g) by monoethanolamine (MEA) at the air–liquid interface. Intra- and intermolecular CO 2 and MEA potentials were parameterized according to the energetics calculated at the MP 2 and BLYP-D 2 levels of theory. The thermodynamic properties of CO 2 and MEA, such as heat capacity and melting point, were consistently predicted using this classical potential. An approximate interfacial simulation for CO 2 (g) /MEA(l) was performed to monitor the depletion of the CO 2 (g) phase, which was influenced by amino and hydroxyl groups of MEA. There are more intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions notably identified in the interfacial simulation than the case of <b>bulk</b> <b>MEA(l)</b> simulation. The hydroxyl group of MEA was found to more actively approach CO 2 and overpower the amino group to interact with CO 2 at the air–liquid interface. With artificially reducing the dipole moment of the hydroxyl group, CO 2 –amino group interaction was enhanced and suppressed CO 2 (g) depletion. The hydroxyl group of MEA was concluded to play dual but contradictory roles for CO 2 capture...|$|R
40|$|Plate {{waste in}} {{hospitals}} {{refers to the}} served food that remains uneaten by patients. High levels of plate waste contribute to malnutrition-related complications in hospital, {{and there are also}} financial and environmental costs. Plate waste is typically measured by weighing food or by visual estimation of the amount of food remaining on the plate, with results presented as the percentage by weight of the served food, or by calculating the protein, energy or monetary value of the waste. Results from 32 studies in hospitals show a median plate waste of 30 % by weight (range: 6 - 65 %), much higher than in other foodservice settings. Levels are lower in hospitals using a bulk food delivery system compared to plated meal delivery. Reasons for these high levels can relate to the clinical condition of patients, food and menu issues (such as poor food quality, inappropriate portion sizes, and limited menu choice), service issues (including difficulty accessing food and complex ordering systems), and environmental factors (such as inappropriate meal times, interruptions, and unpleasant ward surroundings). Strategies to minimize waste include reduced portion sizes with food fortification, <b>bulk</b> <b>meal</b> delivery system, feeding assistance, provision of dining rooms, and protected meal times...|$|R

40|$|Using {{non-invasive}} techniques, {{we investigated}} how varying the size or composition {{of a meal}} altered {{the rate at which}} it passed through the stomach and small intestine in normal volunteers. Increasing the size of the meal by doubling the absorbable components delayed gastric emptying, did not significantly influence the time taken for the head of the meal to reach the caecum, but retarded the entry of the <b>bulk</b> of the <b>meal</b> residues into the caecum. Incorporating fat in the meal slowed gastric emptying, but did not significantly affect small bowel transit time. The addition of the unabsorbable disaccharide lactulose (in place of an equivalent amount of sucrose) accelerated small bowel transit time, but did not significantly influence gastric emptying. Thus, our results indicated that changes in small bowel transit time could occur independently of changes in gastric emptying in normal healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{mainstream}} of studies of industrial innovations, the focus has primarily been at parameters such as firm size, equity, networks and clustering. Regulation has traditionally been regarded as the antagonism to innovation where removal of regulations {{has been seen as}} a condition for innovations. In this paper we take the opposite stance, and emphasise the interconnection between political regulation and the capability to innovate. Here we choose to analyse regulations as arrangements that can facilitate as well as restrict innovations. The pelagic sector within the Norwegian fisheries has increased their share of the total value landed fish in the industry from around 25 % in 1993 to about 40 % in the fist part of this century. The pelagic fleet target mainly species such as marcel, herring and capelin. The sector comprises a relatively homogenous fleet of large purse-seiners and smaller coastal seiners, and a relatively diversified processing industry. Over the past decade the industry has been through huge transformations. There have also been significant changes in the political regulation of the industry. The sector has traditionally produced <b>bulk</b> products (<b>meal</b> and oil), but now however, the industry produce for a consumer market. This implies a huge raise in per kilo value, but also that the industry is confronted with a new set of regulations. How have the rules and directives trickled down in the industry, and what has been the industry’s response...|$|R
40|$|Dietary lipids are {{incorporated}} in food products under {{different types of}} structures, e. g., as dispersed lipid droplets (in oil -in -water emulsions, like creams) or as a continuous lipid phase (in water -in -oil emulsions, like butter for example). The crystallization, melting behavior and polymorphic stability of fats {{are determined by the}} behavior of the TAGs they contain. In clinical studies, {{there is a need to}} add some 13 C TAGs as tracers to the ingested fats in order to track their metabolic fate. However, this procedure could modify the physicochemical properties of the fat. The present study was conducted in the framework of a clinical trial aiming at highlighting the effect of the physical structure of a fat (droplets in 0 /W emulsion or <b>bulk)</b> in a <b>meal</b> on the absorption, chylomicron transport and further metabolic handling of dietary fatty acids (1). We therefore monitored the thermal and polymorphic behavior of anhydrous milk fat (AMF) enriched in tracers (a mixture of tripalmitin, triolein and tricaprylin; at 2 different concentrations: 1. 5 and 5. 7 wt%) using DSC and XRD and further compared it to the native AMF. The addition of 13 C TAGs modified the AMF melting profile, especially at high concentration. The enriched AMF was completely melted at around 37 °C, i. e. close to the body temperature. However, under some conditions, the AMF enriched in high 13 C TAGs concentration remained crystallized at 37 °C. Similar trends were observed in both systems (bulk vs emulsified). Moreover, AMF polymorphic behavior was also modified upon tracer addition. While only β’ form was observed in the native AMF, the 13 -form was detected in the AMF containing high 13 C TAGs concentration. Importantly, low concentration of tracers should not have high impact on human digestive physiology. However more attention should be paid to physicochemical structure when high concentrations are added. (1) Vors et al. 2013.
