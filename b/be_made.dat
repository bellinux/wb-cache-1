5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from the satellite communications. The first deduction that can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from the satellite communications {{is that the}} aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so {{it can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
