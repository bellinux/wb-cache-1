40|$|AbstractVibration fatigue {{of small}} <b>branch</b> <b>pipes</b> usually induces weld toe cracks. Some cracks will cause advertently {{shutdown}} of the Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Moreover, {{to judge the}} vibration fatigue failure is the bottle neck in structure health monitoring of the small <b>branch</b> <b>pipes</b> in NPPs. In order to solve this problem, a socket weld pipe was simplified as the cantilever beam model, and the stress intensity factor (SIF) was calculated by the ABAQUS software and ZENCRACK software in this paper. The effects of crack depth, circumferential crack size and working load on SIF were discussed. The analysis {{results show that the}} SIF for outer surface circumferential crack distributes as an upside down “U” alphabet. And the maximum value of SIF is at the deepest point of the crack and is a linear increasing function of external load P. Basing on the plane strain fracture criterion, critical crack sizes bearing different external loads were calculated. With the increasing of loads, the critical crack size decreases. These critical values can be applied as the benchmark for evaluating the vibration fatigue failure in the structure health monitoring of small <b>branch</b> <b>pipes</b> in NPPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of ice growth {{that occurs in}} <b>branched</b> <b>pipes</b> (<b>branch</b> angle θ= 45 ° and 90 °) containing water flow was investigated experimentally. The experiments were carried out under various experimental conditions over the range of Reynolds number (based on pipe i. d.) Re= 420 - 12500 and cooling temperature ratios of the freezing parameter T(= T_f - T_w) /(T_∞ - T_f), T_f= 0 ℃,T_w= cooling water pipe wall temperature, T_∞= flowing water temperature) = 1. 3 - 11. 1. From the visualization of ice formation in the <b>pipes,</b> the <b>branched</b> <b>pipe</b> with flowing water was first blocked by ice formation : subsequently, the main pipe downstream of the branched portion was frozen off, and eventually the main pipe upstream of the branched portion was blocked by ice formation. As a result, freezing of the remaining water in the branched portion resulted in a pipe rupture at around the branched portion of the pipe. The transient behavior of ice formation, according to time proceeding, was expressed as {{a relationship between the}} pressure loss coefficient f and the Reynolds number Re for various cooling temperature ratios T. In addition, the critical condition of the complete ice blockage in <b>branched</b> <b>pipes</b> was obtained with experimental correlation equations in terms of T and Re. 水道管の凍結問題は、寒冷地域に住む住民の生活安定上解決しなければならない重要な課題である。従来より直円管内の凍結問題に関する研究は、理論的および実験的に数多くなされ、その凍結機構の全容は明らかにされつつある。著者らは、水道曲がり管の凍結現象解明の実験研究を種々の曲がり管を対象として行ってきた。その結果曲がり部の局所熱伝達率の大きい領域での凍結の進行が遅れ、曲がり部前後の直管部においてまず最初に凍結により管閉そくが起こり、最終的に曲がり部の停留水が密閉状態にて凍結し、曲がり部での管破壊が起こる機構とその凍結限界条件を解明した。水道管網においては、直管部、曲がり部以外に多数の配管分岐部より構成されているが、分岐管部の凍結に関する情報は、皆無に等しい。分岐管部は、曲がり部と同様に流れ状態の複雑な局所熱伝達率の大きい領域であり、凍結挙動も複雑となることが予想される。本研究は、水道管分岐部における基本的な凍結挙動に関する情報をえることを目的として、 45 °および 90 °分岐管を対象に、可視化実験による流れ作業、凍結層の進行状態の定性的把握および凍結層による分岐管前後の圧力差、温度差などの測定より、凍結による管閉そくの限界条件、管閉そくまでの時間そして主管と分岐管との相互干渉を実験的に検討したものである...|$|R

The exhaust passages would then be isolated from the blast pipe and air would be admitted to the steam chests. The air would enter the cylinders though the exhaust ports and therefore reversed operations in the cylinders.

40|$|Creep {{failure of}} welds in {{high-temperature}} power plant steam piping systems {{is known to}} be a potential cause of plant failure. Creep behaviour of plain pipes with circumferential welds and cross-weld specimens have received fairly extensive attention. However, research into the creep behaviour of welded thick-walled <b>branched</b> steam <b>pipes</b> has received less attention. Consequently, this thesis addresses improving the understanding of the creep behaviour for this type of geometry. Numerical and analytical methods are used to assess the creep behaviour of typical power plant <b>branched</b> <b>pipe</b> geometries. The effects of various geometric and material parameters on the creep stress and creep life behaviour of the connections are studied. In particular, the effect of the differing creep properties associated with the various material regions of the weld are investigated. The importance of incorporation of weld properties in creep life assessments is thus assessed. Finite element steady-state and continuum damage mechanics creep analyses have been used to identify the relative creep strength of typical connections compared to plain pipes. The work identifies typical creep rupture locations within <b>branched</b> <b>pipe</b> welds and the associated damage accumulation at and around these positions. Various creep life assessment methods/procedures are used in practise: these are mainly the British Standard codes, British Energy's R 5 procedure, steady state creep approaches and continuum damage mechanics approaches. The relative accuracy and conservatism of these distinct approaches are addressed for the application to typical <b>branched</b> <b>pipes.</b> The general formulation of steady-state creep stress is applied to the parametric study of weld materials in a typical multi-material welded <b>branched</b> <b>pipe.</b> An approximate interpolation technique for power-law creep is implemented {{to reduce the number of}} analyses needed to span a wide range of material parameters. The method is used to estimate the creep stresses and lives at several critical regions within the various material zones of the weld. The advantages of the technique are related to the small number of analyses required and the simple and compact way of presenting the results for weld design and life assessment purposes.

The second development was a level crossing arrangement for the pipe: a hinged cover plate lay across the pipe for road usage, but when the traction pipe was exhausted, a <b>branch</b> <b>pipe</b> actuated a small piston which raised the cover, enabling the piston carriage to pass safely, and acting as a warning to road users.

40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) {{is known as}} one of the most effective irrigation methods capable of improving water use efficiency through providing small amounts of water at short irrigation intervals and causing little or no water loss in terms of deep percolation, runoff and soil evaporation. However, temporal waterlogging within the root zone during and after irrigation events adversely affects root respiration, water and nutrient uptake and consequently plant growth. Therefore, irrigation of plants with hyper-aerated, or oxygenated, water could alleviate the impacts of waterlogging in the rhizosphere. Recent studies reportedly showed that aeration of irrigation water by means of venturi air injector in SDI systems (known as oxygation) enhanced crop performance in hypoxic soils. However, there was evidence of non-uniform improvement in crop yield along lateral pipes which might be ascribed to non-uniform distribution of air flow along irrigation pipes. Moreover, under pipe inclinations ranging from 5 º to 15 º, preferential flow of air was reportedly observed in <b>branching</b> <b>pipe</b> systems (containing no emitters) for ratio of water to air flow in the range of 0. 1 – 0. 3. In the current study, preliminary investigation on preferential flow of air into <b>branching</b> horizontal <b>pipe</b> layouts suggested that delivery of air bubbles from the first emitter on the lateral pipe closest to the junction of main pipe and manifold might have formed a zone of relative low pressure.
