5|$|At Strangways' house, Bond sees a {{photograph}} of a <b>boatman</b> with Strangways. Bond locates the <b>boatman,</b> named Quarrel, whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, Felix Leiter, a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica, but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.|$|E

In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite <b>boatman</b> and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue.

40|$|Abstract Background Mobile {{population}} {{groups are}} at high risk for contracting HIV infection. Many factors contribute to this risk including high prevalence of risky behavior and increased risk of violence due to conflict and war. The Naf River serves as the primary border crossing point between Teknaf, Bangladesh and Mynamar [Burma] for both official and unofficial travel of people and goods. Little is known about the risk behavior of <b>boatmen</b> who travel back and forth between Teknaf and Myanmar. However, we hypothesize that <b>boatmen</b> may act as a bridging population for HIV/AIDS between the high-prevalence country of Myanmar and the low-prevalence country of Bangladesh. Methods Methods included initial rapport building with community members, mapping of <b>boatmen</b> communities, and in-depth qualitative interviews with key informants and members from other vulnerable groups such as spouses of <b>boatmen,</b> commercial female sex workers, and injecting drug users. Information from the first three stages was used to create a cross-sectional survey that was administered to 433 <b>boatmen.</b> Results Over 40 % of the <b>boatmen</b> had visited Myanmar during the course of their work. 17 % of these <b>boatmen</b> had sex with CSW while abroad. There was a significant correlation found between the number of nights spent in Myanmar and sex with commercial sex workers. In the past year, 19 % of all <b>boatmen</b> surveyed had sex with another man. 14 % of <b>boatmen</b> had participated in group sex, with groups ranging in size from three to fourteen people. Condom use was rare { 0 to 4. 7 % during the last month}, irrespective of types of sex partners. Regression analysis showed that <b>boatmen</b> who were 25 years and older were statistically less likely to have sexual intercourse with non- marital female partners in the last year compared to the <b>boatmen</b> aged less than 25 years. Similarly deep-sea fishing <b>boatmen</b> and non-fishing <b>boatmen</b> were statistically less likely to have sexual intercourse with non- marital female partners in the last year compared to the day long fishing <b>boatmen</b> adjusting for all other variables. Boatmen's knowledge regarding HIV transmission and personal risk perception for contracting HIV was low. Conclusion <b>Boatmen</b> in Teknaf {{are an integral part of}} a high-risk sexual behaviour network between Myanmar and Bangladesh. They are at risk of obtaining HIV infection due to cross border mobility and unsafe sexual practices. There is an urgent need for designing interventions targeting <b>boatmen</b> in Teknaf to combat an impending epidemic of HIV among this group. They could be included in the serological surveillance as a vulnerable group. Interventions need to address issues on both sides of the border, other vulnerable groups, and refugees. Strong political will and cross border collaboration is mandatory for such interventions. </p...|$|R
25|$|Recklessness {{among the}} <b>boatmen</b> was common. Many {{accidents}} {{were due to}} excessive speed.

In July 1855, a freight boat collided with a packet boat which sank. One of the most frequent problems was careless <b>boatmen</b> in their rush to lock through, hitting lock gates.|$|R

5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's <b>boatman,</b> Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 27 June 2002, Pedra Branca was {{declared}} a protected area within {{the meaning of}} the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. Consequently, a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island, and unauthorised presence there is a criminal offence. On 6 October 2008, a Singaporean man, Roger Lee, was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca. In court documents, he said he had gone to Batam, Indonesia, in 1998. He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman, but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job. As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia, and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend, Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman {{in the hope that the}} Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore. On 5 February 2008 he paid a <b>boatman</b> to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan. As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there. Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place. A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. In mitigation, Lee's pro bono lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca warning against trespassing on the island. Lee was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment.|$|E
