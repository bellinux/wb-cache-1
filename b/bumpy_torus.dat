[...] One in particular has been described: [...] "Imagine a series of magnetic mirror machines placed end to end and twisted into a torus. An ion or electron that leaks out of one mirror cavity finds itself in another mirror cell. This constitutes a bumpy torus." [...] These demonstrated problems and most research on the concept has ended.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bumpy</b> <b>torus</b> is a {{class of}} {{magnetic}} fusion energy devices that consist {{of a series of}} magnetic mirrors connected end-to-end to form a closed torus. Such an arrangement is not stable on its own, and most <b>bumpy</b> <b>torus</b> designs use secondary fields or relativistic electrons to create a stable field inside the reactor. The main disadvantage of magnetic mirror confinement, that of excessive plasma leakage, is circumvented by the arrangement of multiple mirrors end-to-end in a ring. It is described as [...] "bumpy" [...] because the fuel ions comprising the plasma tend to concentrate inside the mirrors at greater density than the leakage currents between mirror cells.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relativistic}} electron ring {{also played}} a part in the <b>bumpy</b> <b>torus</b> design. This was another attempt to [...] "plug the ends" [...] of mirrors, by linking a number of mirrors end-to-end to form a torus.

5000|$|The 120-cell can be {{decomposed}} {{into two}} disjoint tori. Since {{it is the}} dual of the 600-cell, this same dual tori structure exists in the 600-cell, although it is somewhat more complex. The 10-cell geodesic path in the 120-cell corresponds to a 10-vertex decagon path in the 600-cell. Start by assembling five tetrahedra around a common edge. This structure looks somewhat like an angular [...] "flying saucer". Stack ten of these, vertex to vertex, [...] "pancake" [...] style. Fill in the annular ring between each [...] "saucer" [...] with 10 tetrahedra forming an icosahedron. You can view this as five, vertex stacked, icosahedral pyramids, with the five extra annular ring gaps also filled in. The surface {{is the same as}} that of ten stacked pentagonal antiprisms. You now have a torus consisting of 150 cells, ten edges long, with 100 exposed triangular faces, 150 exposed edges, and 50 exposed vertices. Stack another tetrahedron on each exposed face. This will give you a somewhat <b>bumpy</b> <b>torus</b> of 250 cells with 50 raised vertices, 50 valley vertices, and 100 valley edges. The valleys are 10 edge long closed paths and correspond to other instances of the 10-vertex decagon path mentioned above. These paths spiral around the center core path, but mathematically they are all equivalent. Build a second identical torus of 250 cells that interlinks with the first. This accounts for 500 cells. These two tori mate together with the valley vertices touching the raised vertices, leaving 100 tetrahedral voids that are filled with the remaining 100 tetrahedra that mate at the valley edges. This latter set of 100 tetrahedra are on the exact boundary of the duocylinder and form a clifford torus. They can be [...] "unrolled" [...] into a square 10x10 array. Incidentally this structure forms one tetrahedral layer in the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.There are exactly 50 [...] "egg crate" [...] recesses and peaks on both sides that mate with the 250 cell tori. In this case into each recess, instead of an octahedron as in the honeycomb, fits a triangular bipyramid composed of two tetrahedra.|$|E

Since inward pointing electric fields should enhance confinement of the hot ions in this device, knowledge of the direction of the spoke rotation could give valuable information on the mechanism of plasma confinement and radial transport.

40|$|The paper aims at {{showing that}} the density and {{confinement}} time of a toroidal plasma can be enhanced by radial electric fields far stronger than the ambipolar values, and that, if such electric fields point into the plasma, radially inward transport can result. The investigation deals with low-frequency fluctuation-induced transport using digitally implemented spectral analysis techniques and {{with the role of}} strong applied radial electric fields and weak vertical magnetic fields on plasma density and particle confinement times in a <b>Bumpy</b> <b>Torus</b> geometry. Results indicate that application of sufficiently strong radially inward electric fields results in radially inward fluctuation-induced transport into the toroidal electrostatic potential well; this inward transport gives rise to higher average electron densities and longer particle confinement times in the toroidal plasma...|$|E

The emission was detected using a spectrum analyzer and a 50 -ohm miniature coaxial probe. The radiation appeared as a broad amplitude peak that shifted in frequency as the plasma parameters were varied. The observed radiation scanned an average plasma density ranging from 20 billion to 800 billion per cu cm. A linear relation was observed between the density calculated from the emission frequency and the average plasma density measured with a microwave interferometer. With the aid of a relative density profile measurement of the plasma, it was determined that the emissions occurred from the outer periphery of the plasma...|$|E
40|$|The {{modified}} Penning discharge in the NASA Lewis <b>Bumpy</b> <b>Torus</b> {{is normally}} produced by an anode ring at high voltage {{in each of}} the 12 magnetic mirror midplanes. For this investigation, the plasma was run with 12, 6, 3, and 1 anode rings. When 3 anode rings were used, the spectroscopically determined relative electron density and mean ion residence time increased by factors of 10 and 5, respectively, in one mode of operation. The discharge is observed to uniformly fill all bumps around the torus regardless of the anode arrangement and number. A plasma density on axis of 100 billion per cu cm is estimated for the 3 -anode case in one mode of operation based on an observed discharge current to ion loss rate correlation and a measured mean ion residence time of. 5 msec...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of applied dc radial electric fields on particle transport in a <b>bumpy</b> <b>torus</b> plasma is studied. The plasma, magnetic field, and ion heating mechanism are operated in steady state. Ion kinetic temperature {{is more than}} a factor of ten higher than electron temperature. The electric fields raise the ions to energies on the order of kilovolts and then point radially inward or outward. Plasma number density profiles are flat or triangular across the plasma diameter. It is suggested that the radial transport processes are nondiffusional and dominated by strong radial electric fields. These characteristics are caused by the absence of a second derivative in the density profile and the flat electron temperature profiles. If the electric field acting on the minor radius of the toroidal plasma points inward, plasma number density and confinement time are increased...|$|E
40|$|The {{stabilization}} of low-frequency density fluctuations is evidenced in the Nagoya <b>Bumpy</b> <b>Torus</b> (NBT- 1 M) [Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research (IAEA, Vienna, 1985), Vol. 2, p. 551] {{in the presence}} of microwave-heated hot-electron rings. Flute-type fluctuations, which are considered to be stabilized by the charge-uncovering effect of the rings, are found to cause large plasma losses, and to affect radial density profiles {{in the way that the}} lower fluctuation level yields the steeper density gradient. The particle confinement is, therefore, improved by the hot-electron rings to some extent, but is mainly determined by the plasma convection, which is expected from the discrepancy between density and potential profiles. It is also found that fluctuations in a toroidal plasma inside the ring grow when a weak negative ambipolar potential and a steep density gradient are formed, and are reduced to a low level when a deep potential well is achieved...|$|E

During the initial tens of minutes of discharge operation large quantities of a component with mass number 28, believed to be nitrogen, were released. The decrease with time of the nitrogen density after its initial maximum, indicated a diffusion controlled outgassing from cryodeposits or wall material. When cold surfaces were allowed to warm up, large quantities of gas were released.

40|$|The {{performance}} of NASA Lewis fusion experiments (SUMMA and <b>Bumpy</b> <b>Torus)</b> is {{compared with other}} experiments and that necessary for a power reactor. Key parameters cited are gain (fusion power/input power) and the time average fusion power, both {{of which may be}} more significant for real fusion reactors than the commonly used Lawson parameter. The NASA devices are over 10 orders of magnitude below the required powerplant values in both gain and time average power. The best experiments elsewhere are also as much as 4 to 5 orders of magnitude low. However, the NASA experiments compare favorably with other alternate approaches that have received less funding than the mainline experiments. The steady-state character and efficiency of plasma heating are strong advantages of the NASA approach.

40|$|A {{heavy ion}} beam probe (HIBP) {{is a unique}} {{diagnostic}} method to measure the electric potential in magnetically confined high temperature plasmas. Its fine probing beam and well-collimated secondary beam detector give this diagnostic good spatial resolution, which together with the good time resolution make it powerful in probing plasma interior both in steady state and transient state. There are many excellent review papers [for example, 1, 2], but these mostly concentrate on HIBP applications in tokamak research. The radial electric field or space potential structure is more important in stellarators or other non-axisymmetric tori, because particle fluxes are intrinsically non-ambipolar in these devices.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} of ELMO <b>Bumpy</b> <b>Torus</b> (EBT) {{stability}} show that conflicting results can emerge when different distribution functions for the hot‐electron component are used. In this paper {{the role of the}} distribution function is established by examining the stability of various modes with the aid of two models. In the ‘‘slab’’ model where the magnetic field curvature is simulated by a gravitational force it is shown that the stability of the compressional Alfvén wave is insensitive to the distribution function while the interacting interchange mode is sensitive. In the ‘‘local’’ approximation in which the curvature effects enter in a natural way it is seen that the interchange modes are insensitive so long as the anisotropy of the hot electrons is large, while other modes reflect dependence on the distribution function. Finally it is demonstrated that in the ‘‘deep well’ case the results for both modes are independent of the model and of the distribution function...|$|E
