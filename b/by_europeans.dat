5|$|Lacrosse is a {{traditional}} Indigenous people's game which was first encountered <b>by</b> <b>Europeans</b> when French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley witnessed {{the game in the}} 1630s. Lacrosse for centuries was seen as a key element of cultural identity and spiritual healing to Native Americans. It originated as a field game and was adopted first by Canadian, American, and English athletes as a field game, eventually settling on a 10 v 10 format.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade. Once traded, items and goods were shipped {{to other parts of the}} world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run <b>by</b> <b>Europeans,</b> increasing their global power.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{uninhabited}} <b>by</b> <b>Europeans</b> until after World War II, when a severe drought caused white Afrikaans speaking farmers (Boers) to move in.

5|$|The {{history of}} Grand River Avenue, and US16 in Michigan, {{dates back to}} before the {{earliest}} settlement of Michigan <b>by</b> <b>Europeans.</b> The route has been the basis for an Indian trail, a pathway for European settlers, a state highway, {{a part of the}} US Highway System, and a section of the Interstate Highway System.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} <b>by</b> <b>Europeans</b> in the 17th century, {{though it was}} likely earlier explored by aboriginals.

The burial ground for prisoners was on the adjacent Deadman's Island.|$|E

5|$|The trade route {{on which}} Thistle lies {{was used by}} Native American tribes {{before the arrival of}} European settlers; two Ute chiefs, Taby and Peteetneet, led {{seasonal}} migrations through the canyon each spring and fall. The first recorded journey <b>by</b> <b>Europeans</b> to modern Thistle was the Dominguez–Escalante Expedition, which was escorted through the territory by Indian guides. A small group of Utes inhabiting the canyon frequently clashed with newcomers, and as a result were forcibly relocated in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Though Marco Polo never {{produced}} a map that illustrated his journey, his family drew several maps to the Far East {{based on the}} wayward's accounts. These collection of maps were signed by Polo's three daughters: Fantina, Bellela and Moreta. Not only did it contain maps of his journey, but also sea routes to Japan, Siberia's Kamchatka Peninsula, the Bering Strait and even to the coastlines of Alaska, centuries before the rediscovery of the Americas <b>by</b> <b>Europeans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{participation}} {{in the civil rights}} movement, King was criticized by many groups. This included opposition by more militant blacks such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X. Stokely Carmichael was a separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. Omali Yeshitela urged Africans to remember the history of violent European colonization and how power was not secured <b>by</b> <b>Europeans</b> through integration, but by violence and force.|$|E

5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were {{uninhabited}} {{at the time}} of their discovery <b>by</b> <b>Europeans.</b> Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E
5|$|Controversy exists {{over the}} Falklands' {{discovery}} and subsequent colonisation <b>by</b> <b>Europeans.</b> At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, although Argentina maintains {{its claim to}} the islands. In April 1982, Argentine forces temporarily occupied the islands. British administration was restored two months later {{at the end of}} the Falklands War. Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory, but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|First settled <b>by</b> <b>Europeans</b> in the 1790s, Scarborough {{has grown}} from a {{collection}} of small rural villages and farms to become fully urbanised with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. Scarborough is an administrative district in Toronto and has its own community council. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city hall, is still used by the municipal government of Toronto.|$|E

It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Following {{accusations of}} forced labour {{on the large}} American-owned Firestone rubber {{plantation}} and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced <b>by</b> <b>Europeans</b> or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.|$|E
5|$|Her name {{given at}} birth was Yalurrngali: Peggy Rockman was a name {{subsequently}} {{given to her}} by white administrators. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and {{may be associated with}} particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used <b>by</b> <b>Europeans.</b> Thus 'Peggy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.|$|E
