It requires a greater leap of faith than I am willing to undertake to think that people are brighter in the year 2003 than they were in 1903 or 1803 or 1703. There are some things which have changed, but I don't think there have been any major new innovations in human intelligence or human emotions.

If so, {{the most important thing you}} should do *NOW * is start maintaining an “AboutMe” document that is nothing but a giant list of your qualifications (or a reminder of the gaps in your qualifications that need attention). This is not a resume. An “AboutMe” document is for your own record keeping, so don’t worry about fancy formatting. Simply enter information (with dates) as you proceed through your education and career. When you need to write a resume, you can refer to your “AboutMe ” document to make sure that you don’t forget anything that is important to your prospective employer. If you start collecting this information only a month or two before you need a job, it will be too late. Frequently update your “AboutMe ” document, and take corrective action if you’re weak in any category. Your “AboutMe ” document should cover the areas listed below (adapted from the 2009 National Defense Fellowship Application as well as numerous employment application forms). When you add items in each section, you should list them in reverse chronological order (i. e., most recent first) since that’s the way that they should be listed in a résumé.

40|$|On many {{traditional}} theories of <b>belief,</b> <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state {{is represented by}} an assignment of credences to propositions, or sets of possible worlds. If you are rational, your credence distribution will be a probability measure. Traditional theories of belief fit with a standard Bayesian theory of rational belief change: on learning a proposition, you must update <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state by conditionalizing your credence distribution on the proposition you learn. That is, you must update by assigning 0 credence to those worlds incompatible with what you learn, and re-normalizing your credence distribution over the remaining worlds. Following Quine 1969, Lewis 1979 argues that we should instead represent <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state by an assignment of credences to sets of centered worlds: world-timeindividual triples. For instance, if you have. 5 credence that it is 3 : 00 pm, <b>your</b> <b>belief</b> state should be represented by a measure that assigns. 5 to the set of centered worlds with that time coordinate. Unlike traditional theories of belief, Lewis’s theory does not fit with a standard Bayesian theory of rational belief change. For instance, Bayesian conditionalization preserves certainties...|$|R
