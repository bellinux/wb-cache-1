5|$|A {{decompression}} stop is {{a period}} a diver must spend at a relatively shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from the <b>body</b> <b>tissues</b> to avoid decompression sickness. The practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression, as opposed to continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its role}} in facilitating iron uptake, copper {{deficiency}} can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism.

5|$|There {{have been}} debates {{about whether the}} {{original}} gene duplication events occurred in a salivary gland or in <b>body</b> <b>tissues</b> themselves. The prevailing idea for many years is the birth-and-death model described above, in which genes in other <b>body</b> <b>tissues</b> are duplicated and then recruited to the venom gland before natural selection for toxicity. However, in 2014 a new model {{was proposed in which}} salivary protein genes are duplicated and then restricted to the venom gland. This model does away with the recruitment hypothesis and cites the homology between certain venom and body genes as unrelated in the linear fashion described in the traditional birth-and-death model.|$|E

5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to <b>body</b> <b>tissues</b> caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|In large doses, {{silver and}} {{compounds}} containing {{it can be}} absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various <b>body</b> <b>tissues,</b> leading to argyria, which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person's health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis.|$|E
5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in <b>body</b> <b>tissues</b> of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the <b>body</b> <b>tissues,</b> forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and <b>body</b> <b>tissues</b> when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of <b>body</b> <b>tissues,</b> these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of gases in <b>body</b> <b>tissues,</b> {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain catches up with ambient pressure within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in <b>body</b> <b>tissues.</b> The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E

40|$|We {{purified}} a novel protein with {{a molecular}} mass of 34 kDa from the Sarcophaga larval fat body. This protein, named AFP (anterior fat body protein), was restricted {{almost exclusively to}} the anterior fat body. The AFP content decreased after pupation on disin-tegration of the fat <b>body</b> <b>tissue.</b> cDNA analysis revealed that this protein consists of 306 amino acid residues and exhibits significant structural similarity with mBmnmlian regu-calcin (senescence marker protein- 30), a calcium-binding liver protein. However, AFP {{did not seem to}} exhibit strong affinity with calcium. These results suggested that a seemingly uniform fat <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> exhibits a regional difference in its function along the anterior-posterior axis.

40|$|Background: the {{increased}} mining of Cd {{over the last}} hundred years has stimulated a number of ecotoxicological studies on its potential drawbacks when released in the environment. Various researches have highlighted the importance of considering food sources (sediment and preys) when assessing the risk for marine deposit feeders. Aim: the aim of this project was to investigate which source of Cd contamination (surrounding water, sediment, or prey Capitella teleta) influence the most Cd concentration in a marine deposit feeder polychaeta Nereis virens. Method: we exposed N. Virens to Cd contaminated water (0. 288 μg Cd/l), contaminated sediment (15. 2 μgCd/g dw) + water and contaminated prey. After separation of gut tissue {{from the rest of the}} body, Cd concentration was monitored with Atomic Absorbance Spectroscopy (AAS). Results: there was a trend of higher Cd concentration in N. virens exposed to contaminated water only treatments as compared to control in both gut (p= 0. 064) and rest of <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> (p= 0. 155). Higher Cd contamination from contaminated sediment + water was statistically significant as compared to controls for both gut (p= 0. 001) and rest of <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> (p< 0. 001). N. virens in contaminated sediment + water experiment showed about 2 - 3 times higher Cd concentration in both gut (p= 0. 094) and rest of <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> (p= 0. 008) as compared to water only exposure. For both water only and sediment + water experiments BCF and BAC in gut tissue was 2 - 3 times higher as compared to rest of <b>body</b> <b>tissue.</b> We did not detect trophic transfer from the prey C. teleta to the predator N. virens (p= 0. 483 for gut tissue, p= 0. 294 for rest of <b>body</b> <b>tissue)</b> Conclusion: we support the idea that sediment should be considered when assessing risk for marine polychaete since we found greatest contamination on N. virens from contaminated sediment exposure...|$|R
