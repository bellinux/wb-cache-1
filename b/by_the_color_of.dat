A fifteen-card Booster Pack will typically contain one rare (gold), three uncommons (silver), ten commons (black), and one basic land (colored black, as commons). Sets prior to Shards of Alara contained eleven commons instead of a basic land.|$|E
5|$|With its short stipe {{and sticky}} cap, S.quiescens {{is similar to}} S.brevipes. It may be {{distinguished}} from the latter species <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the young (light-brown) cap, the glandular dots {{at the top of}} stipes in mature specimens, and the yellowish color {{at the top of the}} stipe.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E

5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil {{special-purpose}} ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a white flag with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is emblazoned with the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken {{in the middle and}} does not touch the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the middle stripe.|$|E

25|$|Because it {{was written}} to {{entertain}} the Japanese court of the eleventh century, the work presents many difficulties to modern readers. First and foremost, Murasaki's language, Heian period court Japanese, was highly inflected and had very complex grammar. Another problem is that naming people was considered rude in Heian court society, so none of the characters are named within the work; instead, the narrator refers to men often by their rank or their station in life, and to women often <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> their clothing, or by the words used at a meeting, or by the rank of a prominent male relative. This results in different appellations for the same character depending on the chapter.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactors}} {{that became}} known as SAPHIR was a 10-100kW-range swimming-pool reactor of demonstration brought to Switzerland by the U.S. delegation to the First Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy {{that took place in}} Geneva in August 1955. It has been the first reactor ever shown in operation to the public, worldwide. After the conference the reactor was purchased by the Swiss government on behalf of Reaktor AG, a consortium interested in the development of nuclear energy in Switzerland. The reactor was moved to Würenlingen on the location of the future Paul Scherrer Institut and received its name, SAPHIR, on 17 May 1957. (The name of the reactor was inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the Cherenkov radiation which was visible when the reactor was in operation.) Operable until 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} Louis XIII Comes of Age {{represents the}} historical {{scene of the}} transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means. Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang {{on the side of}} the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a trumpet. Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphical}} bar below gives a {{brief overview}} of storm activity during the season. Each storm's maximum intensity is represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> its bar. Tropical Storm Zeta persisted into 2006 necessitating the addition of January 2006 in both the graphical and text timelines. The timeline also makes use of information which was not operationally released. [...] Every year, the National Hurricane Center re-analyzes all of the systems of the previous hurricane season and revises their storm histories. New data that was not available while the storm was active is incorporated into these revisions. In this season the revisions were very significant, as an unnamed subtropical storm that went entirely unnoticed was discovered during the post-season review.|$|E

The dedication in the album reads, [...] "Michael Jackson gives 'special thanks': This album {{is dedicated}} to Benjamin 'Benny' Hermansen. May we continue to remember not to judge man <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> his skin, but the content of his Character. Benjamin ... we love you ... may you rest in peace."

40|$|Color {{has been}} a unique way to {{distinguish}} different nations. When a nation emerges, its most prominent symbol is its flag, with each color meant to represent a different ideal. A group of people forms a nation to distinguish themselves from “others. ” These “others” could be ethnically, linguistically, religiously, or culturally separate – they are distinguished as different. What is {{the relation between the}} nascent Arab nationalist movement and those not represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag? In particular, how did this affect other ethnic minorities within Arab regions of the Ottoman Empire and others who were represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag <b>by</b> virtue of their Arab ethnicity, but who came from religiously distinct backgrounds such as Christians, Druze, and Shi’ites...|$|R

500|$|Suillellus amygdalinus (formerly Boletus amygdalinus) is {{a fungus}} of the bolete family found in western North America. [...] The fruit bodies, or mushrooms, are {{characterized}} by their thick, red to brown caps, red pores, and the strong bluing reaction observed when the mushroom tissue is injured or cut. The cap can reach diameters of up to [...] and the stipe [...] long by [...] thick at maturity. This mushroom {{has been found in}} manzanita and madrone woodlands of central California north to southern Oregon. Although the edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, it may be poisonous, and is not recommended for consumption. Other similar red-pored, bluing boletes from North America, including Rubroboletus eastwoodiae, Boletus luridiformis, and B.subvelutipes, can be distinguished from S.amygdalinus either <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the cap, the degree of reticulation (a network of raised ridges) on the stipe, or by location.|$|E
500|$|Turn Based - Much like in Dungeons and Dragons {{this method}} of {{conflict}} resolution is taken in turns. This combat format is the primary system used in Theater-style LARPs. How turns work {{and what can be}} done during each turn is determined by the creator's of the game. Generally, who goes first is determined by some form of indicator and in the case of LARPs it is usually who acts first, this begins the engagement, essentially giving them an opportunity attack. Movement during a turn is determined by that character's movement speed, while actions are can be either consistent and unchanged rules or character specific. Each individual in the conflict has certain actions they can take on their turn. Chess is an example of a turn based game where who goes first is determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the pieces. That player now gets to make their movement, which in this case movement is synonymous to action. After their action resolves the other player's turn begins. This differs from the 'No-Touch' System, because a Turn Based LARP does not also mean no touching, although it can. An action from one character could end with their hand on the other character's shoulder. An example of a LARP that utilizes this system is the Otakon convention which also has its [...]|$|E
