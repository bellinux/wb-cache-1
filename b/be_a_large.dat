The bottle {{required}} multiple blows to shatter on a bow that later became famous. Signifying the ship's importance the launch had been planned to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> elaborate festive event, however as the court was still in mourning for Queen Alexandra's father who had died twelve days before, she did not attend and a more sober event occurred.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially assumed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known}} as Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Project 86 {{announced}} that Alex Albert had parted {{with the band}} on friendly terms to pursue other interests. Instead of searching for a full-time replacement, the band recruited Jason Gerken, formerly of Shiner, to play drums on the record. Production of their sixth album, entitled Rival Factions, followed suit with Deftones engineer Ulrich Wild. The album proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> departure from their edgier material by sporting a distinct 1980s sound influenced by goth rock.|$|E
5|$|The genus was {{formerly}} considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> one with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences {{showed that the}} most species belonged in the family Psathyrellaceae, distinct from the type species {{that belonged to the}} Agaricaceae. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this and other species were moved to the new genus Coprinopsis.|$|E

5|$|World {{demand for}} {{palladium}} increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222tonnes in 2006 {{according to the}} United States Geological Survey. Many are concerned about {{a steady supply of}} palladium in the wake of Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports; any restrictions on Russian palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> palladium deficit in 2014.|$|E

During development of the design, a flame positioned over his head alongside flaming eyes were considered, but were cut from the finished product. Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> ape in the forest. The other team members investigate {{for a couple of}} days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{pterosaur}} researcher Alexander Kellner revisited H.W. Miller's classification. Kellner followed Miller's {{opinion that}} {{the differences between the}} Pteranodon species were great enough to place them into different genera. He placed P. sternbergi into the genus named by Miller, Geosternbergia, along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> male P. longiceps. Kellner argued that this specimen's crest, though incompletely preserved, was most similar to Geosternbergia. Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known Geosternbergia, he assigned it to the new species Geosternbergia maysei. Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period, and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as G. maysei, but because they lack skulls, he could not confidently identify them.|$|E
5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily mean that there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yel√º clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept that there should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E

5|$|When the 1864 {{treaty was}} signed, the Klamath Tribes, with much less land, became short on the stream water needed for fishing. Although from the 1950s to the 1970s {{they were not}} federally recognized, the tribes never lost their water rights, and in 2001, when Klamath Basin farmers twice sued the U.S. Department of the Interior for more access to {{irrigation}} water, their rights were upheld. The tribes' water allotments for fishing continue to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> factor in Klamath Basin water disputes in the 21stcentury. In 2013, the Tribe's water rights were enforced for the first time, in {{what is known as}} a 'Water Call'. The Klamath Tribe called upon their in-stream water right, which was enforced by the Water Master. This resulted in almost all upper-basin irrigation being denied water, except for groundwater irrigators. The Klamath Project, however, was not called upon.|$|E
