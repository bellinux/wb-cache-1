25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the <b>bottom</b> <b>gate</b> is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E

40|$|Aluminium-silicon {{castings}} {{are typically}} produced by gravity casting. <b>Bottom</b> <b>gated</b> systems are usually required if surface turbulence {{is to be}} eliminated. Latest research has demonstrated, that for every liquid metal there is critical velocity above which the surface will fold over and entrain itself in {{the bulk of the}} metal. Therefore the strength properties the aluminium castings are largely determined by microstructural defects, particularly pores and oxide films which are created by surface turbulence. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate tensile properties and microstructure of aluminium alloy in a casted state two different designs of gating system. The first is the usual <b>bottom</b> <b>gating</b> system and the second is novel design of gating system named a vortex-gate introduced by Campbell [1].

2500|$|A [...] "real" [...] {{staircase}} can {{be thought}} of as a [...] "compressed" [...] flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the upper gate of one lock is also the lower gate of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms staircase and flight interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a single lock with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the <b>bottom</b> <b>gate).</b> As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the bottom chamber) before a boat starts to ascend, or empty (except for the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend. By building a pair of such lock sets (one used to climb and the other to descend) these difficulties are avoided, as well as enabling a greater traffic volume and reduced wait times.|$|E
50|$|Double dump valves {{have two}} trap-door flap plates which {{open and close}} on an {{alternating}} cycle.

50|$|An organic field-effect {{transistor}} (OFET) is a {{field-effect transistor}} using an organic semiconductor in its channel.

The most commonly used device geometry is <b>bottom</b> <b>gate</b> with top drain and source electrodes, because this geometry is similar to the thin-film silicon transistor (TFT) using thermally grown SiO2 as gate dielectric.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} study of one-dimensional (1 D) electronic transport in an InSb semiconducting nanowire. Three <b>bottom</b> <b>gates</b> are used to locally deplete the nanowire creating a ballistic quantum point contact {{with only a few}} conducting channels. In a magnetic field, the Zeeman splitting of the corresponding 1 D subbands is revealed by the emergence of conductance plateaus at multiples of $e^ 2 $/h, yet we find a quantized conductance pattern largely dependent on the configuration of voltages applied to the <b>bottom</b> <b>gates.</b> In particular, we can make the first plateau disappear leaving a first conductance step of 2 $e^ 2 /h$, which is indicative of a remarkable two-fold subband degeneracy that can persist up to several Tesla. We conclude that the subband energy spacings and g-factors are strongly affected by the tunable landscape of the local electrostatic potential. Finally, our measurements reveal the presence of discrete resonant states that, for certain gate voltage settings, produce conductance features resembling those expected from the opening of a helical gap in the subband structure.

50|$|The ring {{continues}} through Brighouse and past some worked-out gravel pits {{which are now}} flooded and used for water skiing. There are three locks at Salterhebble.

Above the top lock is the Salterhabble Branch, which was once part of the heavily-locked branch into Halifax. The final section is narrow, and runs along the side of a wooded hill, to reach Sowerby Bridge. Nearby is another tall building, designed as a chimney for a dyeworks in 1875, but used instead as a viewing platform. It is 253 ft tall and known as the Wainhouse Tower. From Fall Ings, the distance covered is 21.5 mi, and the navigation has risen through 26 locks, six flood locks and 2 sets of flood gates. Sowerby Bridge was a transshipment point for the longer boats of the Rochdale Canal.|$|E

50|$|The final {{miles of}} the river flowing to the River Irwell have been {{extensively}} modified. The river is culverted underneath the car park of the City of Manchester Stadium (the site of a former gasworks). It is visible under a bridge on Baring Street, close to Piccadilly Station, before running again in a culvert beneath the former UMIST campus (London Road (A6) to Princess Street), then under Hulme Street, until it appears briefly at Gloucester Street before flowing under the former gasworks at Gaythorn, reappearing at City Road East. At the point where Deansgate and Chester Road (A56) meet (under the Bridgewater Viaduct) the river meets the Bridgewater Canal head on, where a sluice gate (a listed structure) allowed water to feed the canal, until the water quality of the Medlock became too polluted for canal use.
