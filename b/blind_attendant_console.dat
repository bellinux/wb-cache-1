50|$|In April 2007, TalkSwitch {{introduced}} its <b>Attendant</b> <b>Console</b> application, the first software application built to augment its line of phone systems. The <b>Attendant</b> <b>Console</b> {{allows users to}} monitor and manage calls directly from their PCs, without requiring any additional hardware.|$|R
5000|$|In larger PBXs the <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> {{may also}} be used to perform certain {{administrative}} tasks. Smaller systems may have all programming of the phone system done from the <b>attendant</b> <b>console.</b> As the <b>attendant</b> typically knows more about the phone system than other users, the <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> may be used to alert users to a problem with the phone system. As an example should a Definity ECS PBX have a problem, such as a hardware failure, it may activate an alarm light on the <b>console</b> so the <b>attendant</b> can call for repair.|$|R
50|$|An <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> is a {{telephone}} station that is generally {{part of a}} private branch exchange (PBX) or Centrex or other private telephone system. An <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> generally is a regular PBX telephone station {{with one or more}} additional modules each bearing numerous buttons that can be programmed to be associated with particular lines in the private telephone system, or with particular specialized functions.|$|R

5000|$|In telephony, a Switched loop is {{a circuit}} that {{automatically}} releases a connection from an <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> or switchboard, once the connection {{has been made}} to the appropriate terminal.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> {{may also}} be sent other calls that the PBX may not {{otherwise}} know how to handle, such as direct inward dialed calls that are not associated with a valid extension. The <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> typically has no restrictions about the types of calls that may be made from it so the attendant may complete calls for restricted extensions. This is typically the case where a phone is placed in a public location, such as a lobby, but is set up so that it cannot dial long distance or international calls. Callers using the public phone must dial the attendant, who can complete the call for them.|$|R
50|$|Selsius {{designed}} an IP PBX system {{consisting of}} a line of IP phones, a server-based call control application - the Selsius-CallManager, a line of voice over IP gateways and voice applications including voicemail, an automated <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> and a softphone.|$|R
50|$|A call {{transfer}} is a telecommunications mechanism that enables a user to relocate an existing telephone call to another phone or <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> using a transfer button or a switchhook flash and dialing the required location. The transferred call is either announced or unannounced.|$|R
40|$|Cisco WebAttendant is a {{client-server}} {{application that}} {{enables you to}} set up Cisco IP Phones as <b>attendant</b> <b>consoles.</b> The Cisco WebAttendant client provides a graphical user interface for controlling a Cisco IP Phone as an <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> including speed dial buttons and quick directory access for looking up phone numbers, monitoring line status, and directing calls. Cisco WebAttendant {{can be used by}} a receptionist or administrative assistant to handle calls for a department or company or by an individual. The Cisco WebAttendant client is a plug-in application that is installed on a PC that has IP connectivity to the Cisco CallManager system. The client works in conjunction with a Cisco IP Phone that is registered to a Cisco CallManager (one client for each phone that will be used as an <b>attendant</b> <b>console).</b> Multiple clients can be connected to a single Cisco CallManager. The Cisco Telephony Call Dispatcher (TCD) service running on the Cisco CallManager communicates with Cisco WebAttendant clients for call routing and control, monitors and reports line state, and services client database requests. Administrative tasks such as adding users, configuring pilot points and hunt groups for call routing, and starting and stopping the TCD service are performed 8 - 1 allManager Administration Guide Chapter 8 Understanding Cisco WebAttendant The following table provides an overview of the steps you will need to complete to set up Cisco WebAttendants...|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{groups may}} also be {{assigned}} a button with an indicator light so the attendant can monitor their use. If {{nearly all of the}} trunks in a trunk group are in use, the light illuminates. The attendant may push the button forcing all calls that would normally use the trunk to be routed to the <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> thus allowing the attendant to decide how to ration the remaining free trunks.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft Lync is {{the primary}} client {{application}} released with Lync Server. This client is used for IM, presence, voice and video calls, desktop sharing, file transfer and ad hoc conferences. With Lync 2013 {{there will be a}} release of Lync Light Client with fewer features.Microsoft also ships the Microsoft <b>Attendant</b> <b>Console.</b> This is a version of the Lync more oriented towards receptionists or delegates / secretaries or others who get a large volume of inbound calls.|$|R
5000|$|In {{land-line}} telephony, AIOD leads are Terminal equipment leads used {{solely to}} transmit automatic identified outward dialing (AIOD) {{data from a}} PBX to the {{public switched telephone network}} or to switched service networks (e.g., EPSCS), so that a vendor can provide a detailed monthly bill identifying long distance calling usage by individual PBX stations, tie trunks, or the <b>attendant</b> <b>console.</b> [...] It resembles common channel signalling in that the AIOD leads provide data for all trunks, but is used only for billing, thus resembling automatic number identification.|$|R
50|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{automatic telephone}} exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, gradually replaced manual switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world. In 1919, the Bell System in the United States also adopted automatic switching as its future technology, {{after years of}} reliance on manual systems. Nevertheless, many manual branch exchanges remained operational into {{the second half of}} the 20th century in many enterprises. Later electronic devices and computer technology gave the operator access to an abundance of features. A private branch exchange (PBX) in a business usually has an <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> for the operator, or an auto-attendant, which bypasses the operator entirely.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of Internet {{telephony}} (Voice over IP) technologies, PBX development has tended toward the IP PBX, which uses the Internet Protocol to carry calls. Most modern PBXs support VoIP. ISDN PBX systems also replaced some traditional PBXs in the 1990s, as ISDN offers features such as conference calling, call forwarding, and programmable caller ID. As of 2015 ISDN is being phased out by most major telecommunication carriers throughout Europe in favour of all-IP networks, with some expecting complete migration by 2025 Originally having started as an organization's manual switchboard or <b>attendant</b> <b>console</b> operated by a telephone operator or just simply the operator, PBXs have evolved into VoIP centers that are hosted by the operators or even manufacturers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operator}} or [...] "attendant" [...] had a {{large and}} complex <b>attendant</b> <b>console,</b> replacing the old, larger and even more complex switchboard and giving additional control of a connection. Its buttons and lights needed approximately fifty pairs of wires. Incoming calls arrived on an Attendant Trunk which, for customers {{with more than one}} console, waited for one to become idle and then connected to it, initially via Step by Step switches arranged as a Trunk Finder and Position Finder making up a small Automatic call distributor some years before that term was invented. Customers who preferred the old cord switchboards could use an adapted [...] "608" [...] board. In either case the console communicated with the incoming trunk with coded plus and minus 130 VDC signals on Tip, Ring or both wires.|$|R
50|$|Bell Labs {{took over}} Centrex {{development}} in the late 1960s. The NYTel version was designated Centrex I, and the Bell Labs revision Centrex II with additional features. The unreliable Step switches were replaced by a Centrex Position Link Circuit (CXPL), a small, dedicated two stage crossbar network. In the early 1970s Centrex III arrived, a complete redesign bringing more versatility to the old 5XB system. Rather than incoming trunks having appearances on the ordinary Line Link Frame for transfer purposes, Centrex III (or Phase 3 Centrex) had a separate four stage Transfer Network of six-wire crossbar switches to connect to a Transfer Trunk. CXPL continued in use for connecting to consoles. Among other changes, the Phase 3 consoles used DTMF rather than multifrequency pulsing. The Centrex product line was also extended down-market, with Centrex Small Business for customers having mere dozens of lines and no <b>attendant</b> <b>console.</b>|$|R

50|$|Philip {{used her}} to play a joke on the Hieronymite friars at El Escorial. In the autumn of 1584, he {{arranged}} first for an Indian elephant (which he had also inherited from the Portuguese menagerie) to be driven {{up the steps and}} into the cells of the friars and the following week repeated the trick with the rhinoceros. While the elephant did not baulk at the strange events, Abada was stubborn and complaining, grunted bad-temperedly and refused to eat the food presented to her. At some point in her captivity she may have been <b>blinded</b> because the <b>attendants</b> had difficulty managing her and it was thought that this would make her less likely to attack them.|$|R
50|$|Protesters found {{life inside}} the {{building}} for 26 days both difficult and life-changing. Because {{of the need to}} keep the occupation secret at the beginning, most arrived with only a toothbrush and necessary medications. Some people with disabilities had medical needs that required special attention such as eating and taking medications at set hours and being turned at regular intervals during the night to avoid getting bedsores. Because many had entered the building without their usual care-takers, they turned to their fellow occupiers to assist them in the tasks of daily living. <b>Blind</b> people became <b>attendants</b> to quadriplegics who in turn read printed information to the blind people. This created strong bonds among the protesters and educated them about disabilities other than their own.|$|R
25|$|The {{first line}} of the prologue {{recalled}} Laius' hubristic action of conceiving a son against Apollo's command. At {{some point in the}} action of the play, a character engaged in a lengthy and detailed description of the Sphinx and her riddle – preserved in five fragments from Oxyrhynchus, P.Oxy. 2459 (published by Eric Gardner Turner in 1962). The tragedy featured also many moral maxims on the theme of marriage, preserved in the Anthologion of Stobaeus. The most striking lines, however, state that in this play Oedipus was <b>blinded</b> by Laius' <b>attendants,</b> and that this happened before his identity as Laius' son had been discovered, therefore marking important differences with the Sophoclean treatment of the myth, which is now regarded as the 'standard' version. Many {{attempts have been made to}} reconstruct the plot of the play, but none of them is more than hypothetical, because of the scanty remains that survive from its text and of the total absence of ancient descriptions or résumés – though it has been suggested that a part of Hyginus' narration of the Oedipus myth might in fact derive from Euripides' play. Some echoes of the Euripidean Oedipus have been traced also in a scene of Seneca's Oedipus (see below), in which Oedipus himself describes to Jocasta his adventure with the Sphinx.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the section}} [...] "How to Read this Book," [...] L. Ron Hubbard {{suggests}} to read right on through. An [...] "Important Note" [...] appeared in later {{editions of the}} book advising the reader to understand every word read. In the book, Hubbard uses two different and contradictory definitions for the word engram. In Book One, the Goal of Man, chapter 5, summary, Hubbard states the Fundamental Axioms of Dianetics, among which is [...] "... The engram {{is a moment of}} 'unconsciousness' containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions and is not available to the analytical mind as experience." [...] Later in the text, Hubbard writes of the engram in a footnote on page 74 of Book Two, chapter two, of the 2007 edition of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. The footnote reads: [...] "... The word engram in Dianetics is used in its severely accurate sense as a 'definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm of a tissue'. It is considered as a unit group of stimuli impinged solely on the cellular being." [...] In other words, Hubbard takes a definition previously debunked by biology and calls it a Dianetics definition. Dianetics, in and of itself, thus presents nothing that was not already known to science in that area, while adding phenomena and functional systems that have no basis in fact. The very manner of [...] "scientific method" [...] displayed by Hubbard in his works has indeed been called [...] "anti-science," [...] in that the claims made in the books are based not on peer-reviewed observation of phenomena, with its <b>attendant</b> <b>blind</b> testing, control groups etc., but rather on deciding a priori that a phenomenon exists-followed by an attempt to prove its validity.|$|R
40|$|On the {{gangplank}} {{of one of}} {{the large}} ocean liners leaving New York is shown an old gentleman kissing his wife and daughter good-bye before leaving on a tour abroad for a much needed rest from business cares and troubles. A great crowd of people are next shown waving farewells to departing friends and relatives as the big steamer leaves the pier. We now accompany our old friend on his trip and show in succession his varied experiences. As the steamer glides down the Hudson River a panorama is shown of the lower section of New York, with its numerous sky-scrapers, Battery Park, and the Aquarium. Next the pilot is shown leaving the ship at Sandy Hook and the course is now clear for a run across the Atlantic. The scene now changes to a view of the ocean and the bow of the vessel, taken from the bridge. It shows the way a modern ocean greyhound plows her way through the water, and the spray dashing over the deck. The seas are high during the voyage and as our tourist is a poor sailor he suffers severely from the rolling of the ship, and is compelled to keep in his stateroom most of the time. Our next scene shows him rolling around the floor of his room in dreadful agony. He finally gets on his feet and by holding on to anything within reach he finally manages to reach his berth. After reaching the berth a monstrous wave strikes the ship and the unfortunate man is thrown out on the floor. Suddenly the porthole cover is thrown open by the force of a wave and our friend gets a ducking. Landed in Europe, he makes several new acquaintances, and decides to pay his first visit to Ireland. He reaches Blarney Castle and the guides show him where the Blarney Stone is located. Having heard a great deal of this wonderful stone, he wishes {{to be one of the}} party to kiss it, and arranges with a couple of Irish attendants to lower him over the roof of the castle. They take hold of him by the heels, and swing him down along the side of the building, head first. As he is about to kiss the stone, the Irishmen's grip on his feet relaxes and they let him drop. Eventually he gets over his injuries and leaves Ireland for France. Reaching Paris, he leaves his friends and starts to do up the concert halls. We now show him in one of the gayest of these resorts. Upon entering the place, he takes a seat at a table and orders a drink. His attention is soon attracted by a couple of gay young women at another table, and he soon joins them. The wine begins to flow and soon the women and the old tourist become very gay, and they all start to dance and have a good time. Suddenly the old fellow is surprised by his friends, who, having missed him, started to search for him. They soon hurry him out of the place and upbraid him for getting into such questionable company. Leaving Paris, the party go to Switzerland, and visit the Alps. Of course these famous mountains must be climbed, so guides are engaged to point out the paths and give assistance. The party manages to reach a great height without mishap, but the trip must be spoiled by our seeker for rest. One treacherous section of the mountain is reached, and climbing is quite difficult. The guides assist each of the tourists over the great rocks, but when our friend's turn comes the inevitable happens, and he drops into one of the great crevices of the mountain. The guides lower ropes and haul him up. He gets a bad shaking up but comes around all right, with the assistance of stimulants administered by one of the party. From Switzerland they travel to Italy and view the ruins of ancient Rome. In some way the old tourist is left behind by his party, and as he stands alone wondering what has become of his friends, he is pounced upon by a couple of Italian bandits and relieved of all his valuables. His next stop is in Egypt. The party view the Pyramids and Sphinx, and are finally induced by the natives to climb one of the pyramids. Two of the black guides take care of our friend and aid him to climb, but as usual something happens. When near the top down he comes, landing in a heap at the bottom. To get over his injuries takes a little time, but hearing of the wonderful curative powers of Germany's mud baths, he sets off for that country. He is next seen in the care of two corpulent bath attendants. They help him into a tub and soon cover him with mud, which gets into his eyes and almost <b>blinds</b> him. The <b>attendants</b> scour him with the mud until the skin peels off and then clean him off by throwing ice water on him. By the time they get through with him he is hardly able to move and decides that he has had enough rest and that home is the best place. The trip across the ocean is made, and he finally lands back in New York. A cab is waiting outside the pier shed and the old fellow is assisted into it by his wife and daughter and two porters. He is driven home, where his final rest is taken" [...] Edison films catalog. Copyright: Thomas A. Edison; 1 Sept 1904; H 49807. Joseph Hart. Includes footage from other Edison films: S. S.
