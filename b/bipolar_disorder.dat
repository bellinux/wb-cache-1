5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder.</b> Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder</b> in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder,</b> while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; it is her sister who suffers from <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder</b> (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder</b> is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder</b> in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorder</b> and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials (LDAEP) is {{considered}} {{as an indicator}} of central serotonergic activity. Alteration of serotonergic neurotransmission was reported in <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> and schizophrenia. In line with previous reports on clinically manifest disorders, we expected a weaker LDAEP in subjects at risk for <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> and schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. METHODS: We analyzed LDAEP of individuals at risk for developing <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> (n= 27), with high-risk status (n= 74) and ultra-high-risk status for schizophrenia (n= 86) and healthy controls (n= 47). RESULTS: The LDAEP did not differ between subjects at risk for schizophrenia or <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> and controls. Among subjects without medication (n= 122), the at-risk-bipolar group showed a trend towards a weaker LDAEP than both the high-risk and the ultra-high-risk groups for schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: The LDAEP did not appear as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia or <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders.</b> This suggests that an altered LDAEP may not be measurable until the onset of clinically manifest disorder. However, the hypothesis that pathogenic mechanisms leading to <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> may differ from those leading to schizophrenia is supported. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study investigating LDAEP in a population at risk for <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess new {{treatment}} options for <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders.</b> METHOD: Controlled studies of {{new treatment}}s for <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> {{were identified by}} computerized searches and reviews of scientific meeting proceedings, and were compiled by drug category. RESULTS: Two main categories of medications, newer anticonvulsants and newer antipsychotics, are yielding emerging new treatment options for <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders.</b> Newer anticonvulsants have diverse psychotropic profiles, and although not generally effective for acute mania, may have utility for other aspects of <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> (e. g. lamotrigine for maintenance or acute bipolar depression), or for comorbid conditions (e. g. gabapentin for anxiety or pain, topiramate for obesity, bulimia, alcohol dependence, or migraine, and zonisamide for obesity). In contrast, newer antipsychotics generally appear effective for acute mania, and some may ultimately prove effective in acute depression (e. g. olanzapine combined with fluoxetine, quetiapine) and maintenance (e. g. olanzapine). CONCLUSION: Emerging research is yielding new treatment options for <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> and comorbid conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background:The {{analysis}} of eye movements (EM) by eye-tracking {{has been carried}} out for several decades to investigate mood regulation, emotional information processing, and psychomotor disturbances in depressive disorders. Method:A systematic review of all English language PubMed articles using the terms saccadic eye movements OR eye-tracking AND depression OR <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. The aim of this review was to identify the specific alterations of EM in unipolar and <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders.</b> Results:Unipolar depression has been characterized by an increase in reaction time in prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, and a specific attraction for negative pictures. <b>Bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> have been associated with an increase in reaction time in prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, and an attraction for threatening images. Methodological limitations include mixed samples sometimes undifferentiating unipolar and bipolar patients, or an absence of specification regarding the polarity of the episode in <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders.</b> Moreover, we found no study explicitly comparing EM in both unipolar depression and <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders.</b> Conclusion: Unipolar depression and <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> can be characterized by different psychomotor alterations and affective regulation strategies. Eye movement analysis could be a useful tool as a potential biomarker to distinguish between the two diseases. However, {{further research is needed to}} directly and systematically compare eye movement data in both diseases under strictly identical experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyroid {{disorders}} {{have long}} been associated with psychiatric illness, often with symptoms suggestive of mood disorders. The most common clinical features associated with hyperthyroidism are anxiety and depression. The risk of <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders,</b> especially <b>bipolar</b> mania, among patients with thyroid disorders has not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: We explored the relationship of hyperthyroidism and the subsequent development of <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders,</b> and examined the risk factors for <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> in patients with hyperthyroidism. METHODS: We identified patients who were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism between 2000 and 2010 in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A comparison cohort without hyperthyroidism was matched based on age, sex, and comorbidities. The occurrence of <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> was evaluated in both cohorts based on diagnosis {{and the use of}} mood stabilizer drugs. RESULTS: The hyperthyroidism cohort consisted of 21, 574 patients, and the comparison cohort consisted of 21, 574 matched control patients without hyperthyroidism. The incidence of <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2. 31, 95 % CI 1. 80 - 2. 99, P<. 001) was higher for the hyperthyroidism patients than the control patients. Multivariate, matched regression models showed that women (HR 2. 02, 95 % CI 1. 34 - 3. 05, P = . 001), patients with alcohol use disorders (HR 3. 03, 95 % CI 1. 58 - 5. 79, P = . 001), and those with asthma (HR 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 18 - 2. 43, P = . 004) were independent risk factors for the development of <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> in hyperthyroidism patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although a possibility that the diagnosis of <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders</b> in this study actually includes "bipolar disorders due to hyperthyroidism" cannot be excluded, this study suggests that hyperthyroidism may increase the risk of developing <b>bipolar</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion.

However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis.
