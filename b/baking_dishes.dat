The Scottish legacy on food could be seen through a traditional preference of sweet foods, and a wealth of <b>baking</b> <b>dishes</b> to celebrate important occasions, reflected through cakes, scones, muffins and other mainly sweet <b>baking</b> <b>dishes.</b> The country's most iconic recipe book, the Edmonds Cookery Book, originally began as publicity material for a baking powder company, and contains a high proportion of baking recipes.|$|E

Students slowly add saltwater that has been tinted with food coloring to a glass <b>baking</b> <b>dish</b> that contains freshwater. The students then see that the saltwater sinks, and learn the reasons behind the increased density of saltwater. The activity then explains how sinking saltwater creates currents in the ocean.

50|$|Tepsi baytinijan (التبسي) is {{a popular}} Iraqi {{casserole}} dish consisting of aubergine, which are sliced and fried before placing in a <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> accompanied with meatballs, tomatoes, onions and garlic. Potato slices are placed {{on top of the}} mixture, and the dish is baked.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic {{cookware}} (as in pans, not <b>baking</b> <b>dishes)</b> is {{not made}} of a solid ceramic, but rather is a metal pan, typically aluminum, with a nano-particle ceramic coating. This makes the surface rough on a small-scale and causes solutions to bead up more and not stick to the surface.|$|E
50|$|Patinas {{can also}} be found in woks or other metal <b>baking</b> <b>dishes,</b> which form when {{properly}} seasoned. The patina on a wok is a dark coating of oils that have been burned onto it to prevent food sticking and to enhance the flavor of the foods cooked in it. Steaming foods or using soap on a wok or other dishware could damage the patina and possibly allow rust.|$|E
50|$|A shallow {{roasting}} pan is normally used for roasting small cuts of meat, but large-size {{roasting pan}}s {{are also used}} for cooking large poultry such as turkey or goose, or for larger cuts of meat. A deep roasting pan can hold vegetables and other ingredients that meat can sit on rather than a rack, letting the vegetables absorb the fat and juice from the meat while cooking. A deep roasting pan {{can also be used}} as a baking dish or basin, holding smaller <b>baking</b> <b>dishes</b> that must be surrounded by boiling water.|$|E
50|$|A special double <b>baking</b> <b>dish</b> made {{of copper}} called la cocotte à pommes Anna is still {{manufactured}} in France for the cooking of this dish. It consists of {{upper and lower}} halves which fit into each other so that the whole vessel with its contents can be inverted during cooking.|$|R
50|$|Spoon bread, {{also called}} batter bread or egg bread, {{is made of}} cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy, and is mixed with milk, eggs, {{shortening}} and leavening to such a consistency {{that it must be}} served from the <b>baking</b> <b>dish</b> with a spoon. This is popular chiefly in the South.|$|R

5000|$|As inheritor of both Brown and Stewart pottery traditions Brown {{produced}} utilitarian stoneware in {{the nineteenth}} and early twentieth century styles as well as to create innovations for more modern usages, such as his apple <b>baking</b> <b>dishes,</b> chicken cookers and microwave bacon cookers. However much of his critical acclaim centered on recognition of his unique style of whimsical art, especially face jugs. (According to his mother he had learned the basics of whimsical pottery making from his father, as the Stewarts did not have a face jug tradition.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{nearly all}} Indo-Aryan {{languages}} such as Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu tawaa means cooking pan {{and is used}} in South Asia, including India and Pakistan. It is cognate with the Persian word tāve (...) , which is used in Iran, and with the Georgian tapa (ტაფა); while the name saj ( [...] (...) in Arabic, lit. sheet-metal) and written saç or sac in Turkish is used in Southwest Asia, with overlap in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The word tava is also used in Bosnian, Croatian, Romanian and Turkish and refers {{to any kind of}} frying pan. In Bulgaria, flat ceramic сач or сачѐ (sach/sache) are used for table-top cooking of thin slices of vegetables and meat; тава (tava), on the other hand, are metal <b>baking</b> <b>dishes</b> with sides. In Pashto it is more popularly known as Tabakhey (تبخے/طبخی).|$|E
5000|$|Most bare {{cast-iron}} {{pots and}} pans are cast as {{a single piece of}} metal, including the handle. This allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Many recipes call for the use of a cast-iron skillet or pot, especially so that the dish can be initially seared or fried on the stovetop then transferred into the oven, pan and all, to finish baking. Likewise, cast-iron skillets can double as <b>baking</b> <b>dishes.</b> Cornbread in particular is seen as a food item that is best prepared in a cast-iron skillet: the iron pan is heated beforehand in the oven, the ingredients are first combined and mixed in a mixing bowl, then added to the heated pan, and the dish is then placed directly into the oven for fast baking. This differs from many other cooking pots, which have varying components that may be damaged by the excessive temperatures of [...] or more.|$|E

2500|$|Gratin (...) is a {{widespread}} culinary technique in which an ingredient is topped with a browned crust, often using breadcrumbs, grated cheese, egg and/or butter.

50|$|When {{made in the}} oven, {{the pudding}} rice is placed into a <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> and the milk, cream and sugar are mixed in.

50|$|A hotdish is a {{casserole}} which typically contains a starch, a meat, and a canned or frozen vegetable mixed with canned soup. The dish originates from the Upper Midwest {{region of the}} United States, where it remains popular, particularly in Minnesota and North Dakota. Hotdish is cooked in a single <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> and served hot (per its name). It commonly appears at communal gatherings such as family reunions, potlucks and church suppers.|$|R
50|$|The baked {{dumpling}} {{is popular}} in American cuisine. These sweet dumplings {{are made by}} wrapping fruit, frequently a whole tart apple, in pastry, then baking until the pastry is browned and the filling is tender. As an alternative to simply baking them, these dumplings are surrounded by a sweet sauce in the <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> and may be basted during cooking. Popular flavours for apple dumplings include brown sugar, caramel, or cinnamon sauces.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally in Bulgaria {{the filling}} {{is made of}} rice steamed in advance, onions, minced meat and spices, {{heat-treated}} and crammed into pre-cleaned, washed and riddled with needle peppers. After filling of peppers, they are put in a <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> water is added and the dish is baked in the oven. If raw egg {{is added to the}} cooled stuffing, filled peppers can be cooked in a pan, as the pods are boiled almost steamed.|$|R
2500|$|To make pommes de terre gratinées, or [...] "potatoes with cheese", {{according}} to the recipe of Marcel Boulestin, large floury potatoes are baked in the oven, then halved and the flesh scooped from the skins.

This preparation is also called twice-baked potatoes.|$|R
50|$|A {{slightly}} different variety, cooked {{in a simple}} <b>baking</b> <b>dish,</b> is associated with northern U.S. cuisine; {{it tends to be}} sweeter and lighter than southern-style cornbread; the batter for northern-style cornbread is very similar to and sometimes interchangeable with that of a corn muffin. A typical contemporary northern U.S. cornbread recipe contains half wheat flour, half cornmeal, milk or buttermilk, eggs, leavening agent, salt, and usually sugar, resulting in a bread that is somewhat lighter and sweeter than the traditional southern version.|$|R
50|$|Eve's pudding, {{also known}} as Mother Eve's pudding, {{is a type of}} {{traditional}} British pudding now made from apples and Victoria sponge cake mixture. The apples are allowed to stew {{at the bottom of the}} <b>baking</b> <b>dish</b> while the cake mixture cooks on top. The name is a reference to the biblical Eve. It is a simplified version of Duke of Cumberland's pudding. The earliest known version dates from 1824, predating baking powder, and therefore uses grated bread and shredded suet.|$|R
2500|$|Salkuuyaq or Sal'kuuyaq (Yup'ik), Cal'kuuyaq (Cup'ik) (also, {{casserole}} of meat or {{fish with}} potatoes, onions, etc.) is fresh fish baked whole or filleted after the entrails are removed.
