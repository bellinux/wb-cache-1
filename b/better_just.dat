5|$|The end {{of silent}} {{film in the}} West and in Japan was imposed by the {{industry}} and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where {{there was always the}} human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not <b>better,</b> <b>just</b> more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.|$|E
500|$|For {{their second}} and final album with Arista, Brothers of the Road (1981), they collaborated with a [...] "name producer" [...] (John Ryan, of Styx and the Doobie Brothers), who pushed the band {{even harder to}} change their sound. [...] "Straight from the Heart" [...] was the album's single, which became a minor hit but heralded the group's last {{appearance}} on the top 40 charts. The band, considering their post-reunion albums [...] "embarrassing", subsequently broke up in 1982 after clashing with Clive Davis, who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album, including Tom Dowd and Johnny Sandlin. [...] "We broke up in '82 because we decided we <b>better</b> <b>just</b> back out or we would ruin {{what was left of}} the band’s image," [...] said Betts. The band's final performance came on Saturday Night Live in January 1982, where they performed [...] "Southbound" [...] and [...] "Leavin'." [...] The members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years; in 1986, Betts and Allman toured together, with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set. Allman's solo career began looking up when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987, I'm No Angel. The title track became a surprise hit on radio, garnering heavy airplay.|$|E
500|$|On {{the back}} of two {{consecutive}} playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor. On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled {{with the fact that}} the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions. Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: [...] "I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes." [...] Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as [...] "phenomenal" [...] and criticized his supporting cast, stating Duncan [...] "made 11-of-23 shots and 12-of-14 free throws, adding four assists and two blocks nd once again, he did not have enough help." [...] Also, Robinson said [...] "Tim [...] was like Superman out there", and conceded that the Lakers were simply <b>better,</b> <b>just</b> like in the last playoffs campaign.|$|E
