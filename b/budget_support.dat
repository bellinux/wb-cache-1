500|$|Kagame's image amongst {{international}} observers is varied. Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Freedom House, {{claim that}} Kagame hamstrings his opposition by restricting candidacies in elections to government-friendly parties, suppressing demonstrations, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists. Human Rights Watch and Freedom House have accused Kagame of using strict laws criminalizing [...] "divisionism" [...] (ethnic hatred) and genocide ideology to silence his critics, {{to the point}} that Rwanda is a de facto one-party state. [...] It has praised some aspects of Kagame's rule, such as the progress made in the delivery of justice and the abolition of the death penalty. Other progressive initiatives include supporting a UN declaration on LGBT rights, as well as the world's highest representation of women in parliament. Kagame's image amongst foreign leaders was very positive until the late 2000s. He was credited with ending the genocide, bringing peace and security to Rwanda, and achieving development. Since 2010, the international community has increasingly criticized Kagame following a leaked United Nations report alleging Rwanda's support for the rebel M23 movement in Congo. In 2012, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and several other countries suspended programmes of <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> to Rwanda, with many redirecting their aid to project-based assistance.|$|E

As president, Kagame has been critical of the West's lack of response to the genocide, and the UK and US have responded by admitting guilt over the issue: Bill Clinton, who was President of the United States during the genocide, has described his failure to act against the killings as a [...] "personal failure". During the 2000s, Clinton and UK prime minister Tony Blair praised the country's progress under Kagame, citing it as a model recipient for international development funds, and Clinton referred to Kagame as [...] "one of the greatest leaders of our time".

[...] Next, subtract the aid given to middle income countries, $16 billion. [...] The remainder, $43 billion, is the amount that developing countries received in 2002. [...] But only $12 billion went to low-income countries in a form that could be deemed <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> for basic needs.
