50|$|Trihalomethanes {{are formed}} as a {{by-product}} predominantly when chlorine is used to disinfect water for drinking. They represent one group of chemicals generally referred to as disinfection by-products. They result from the reaction of chlorine or bromine with organic matter present in the water being treated. The THMs produced have been associated through epidemiological studies with some adverse health effects. Many governments set limits on the amount permissible in drinking water. However, trihalomethanes are only one group of many hundreds of possible disinfection by-products - {{the vast majority of}} which are not monitored - and it has not yet been clearly demonstrated which of these are the most plausible candidate for causation of these health effects.

An indoor swimming pool was equipped with two medium-pressure UV lamps. We collected eight samples of water daily over a four-weeks period and measured total and free chlorine, pH, water temperature, bacteriological parameters, total organic carbon and trihalomethanes. During the first week, which served as control, medium-pressure UV lamps were turned off. During the next three weeks, medium-pressure UV lamps were kept on 24 h per day. The third week, we reduced the level of the injected chlorine into water, and the last week we also reduced the water renewal volume by 27 %. Our results showed that bacteriological parameters remained within allowable french limits. When medium-pressure UV lamps were kept on, total, free and active chlorine levels were significantly increased (P< 0. 001), whereas combined chlorine level were significantly decreased (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 05, respectively).

Questionnaires were administered to one participant in each house to determine demographics and drinking water consumption rates. Oral exposure and risks were estimated for each participant and İzmir population by deterministic and probabilistic approaches, respectively. The four trihalomethane (THM) species (i. e., chloroform, <b>bromodichloromethane,</b> dibromochloromethane, and bromoform), benzene, toluene, p-xylene, and naphthalene were the most frequently detected VOCs with concentrations ranging from below detection limit to 35 μg/l.

40|$|During water treatment, {{chlorine}} {{reacts with}} naturally occurring organic matter in surface water {{to produce a}} number of by-products. Of the by-products formed, trihalomethanes (THMs) are {{among the highest in}} concentration. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between the level of total THM and specific THMs in public water supplies and risk for stillbirth. The cohort was assembled from a population-based perinatal database in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia and consisted of almost 50, 000 singleton deliveries between 1988 and 1995. Individual exposures were assigned by linking mother’s residence at the time of delivery to the levels of specific THMs monitored in public water supplies. Analysis was conducted for all stillbirths and for cause-of-death categories based on the physiologic process responsible for the fetal death. Total THMs and the specific THMs were each associated with increased stillbirth risk. The strongest association was observed for <b>bromodichloromethane</b> exposure, where risk doubled for those exposed to a level of ≥ 20 µg/L compared to those exposed to a level < 5 µg/L (relative risk = 1. 98, 95 % confidence interval, 1. 23 – 3. 49). Relative risk estimates associated with THM exposures were larger for asphyxia-related deaths than for unexplained deaths or for stillbirths overall. These findings suggest a need to consider specific chlorination by-products in relation to stillbirth risk, in particular <b>bromodichloromethane</b> and other by-product correlates.

The breath samples were collected at regular intervals before, during, and for 3 hr after a moderately intense training workout. Integrated and grab whole-air samples were collected during the training period to help determine inhalation exposures, and pool water samples were collected to help assess dermal exposures. Resulting breath samples collected during the workout demonstrated a rapid uptake of two THMs (chloroform and <b>bromodichloromethane),</b> with chloroform concentrations exceeding the natatorium air levels within 8 min after the exposure began. Chloroform levels continued to rise steeply until they were more than two times the indoor levels, providing evidence that the dermal route of exposure was relatively rapid and ultimately more important than the inhalation route in this training scenario. Chloroform elimination after the exposure period was fitted to a three compartment model that allowed estimation of compartmental half-lives, resulting minimum bloodborne dose, and an approximation of the duration of elevated body burdens. We estimated the dermal exposure route to account for 80 % of the blood chloroform concentration and the transdermal diffusion efficiency from the water to the blood to in excess of 2 %. <b>Bromodichloromethane</b> elimination was fitted to a two compartment model which provided evidence of a small, but measurable, body burden of this THM resulting from vigorous swim training. These results suggest that trihalomethane exposures for competitive swimmers under prolonged, high-effort training are common and possibly higher than was previously thought and that the dermal exposure route is dominant.

We examined the effect of town-average concentrations of TTHM and additional exposure metrics in relation to mean birth weight, mean gestational age, small for gestational age (SGA) infancy, and preterm delivery. Trihalomethane data (TTHM, chloroform, and <b>bromodichloromethane)</b> from 1995 - 1998 were available for 109 towns in Massachusetts. Data from 1997 - 1998 on haloacetic acid (total haloacetic acids, dichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid), 3 -chloro- 4 -(dichloromethyl) - 5 - hydroxy- 2 (5 H) -furanone (MX), and mutagenicity were available for a limited number of towns. We observed reductions in mean birth weight (12 - 18 g) for maternal trihalomethane exposures > the 90 th percentile compared with those 20 microg/L and TTHM exposures > 40 microg/L. Elevated trihalomethanes were associated with increases in gestational duration and a reduced risk of preterm delivery.

In accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 551. 1, samples were taken using ammonium chloride as de-chlorinating agent and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as solvent extractant during samples’ analyses. Concentrations of the four regulated trihalomethanes (trichloromethane – CHCl 3, tribromomethane – CHBr 3, tribromochloroomethane and <b>bromodichloromethane)</b> were analysed using Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) model 19091 - 413 with Chemstation software. From the study, only tribromomethane was detected immediately after chlorination while trichloromethane and <b>bromodichloromethane</b> were detected at storage in the booster station. Peak values of these analytes were also obtained at the booster station. Maximum permissible levels of the analytes are set only as total mean trihalomethanes. In the study, total mean trihalomethanes (TTHMs) values ranged from zero in the raw water and water after sedimentation to 1. 3140 E- 02 ± 1. 4614 E- 05 mg/L in the booster station water samples but decreased to 1. 0601 E- 02 ± 1. 6625 mg/L at household level.

The other brominated species (dibromomethane, bromochloromethane, <b>bromodichloromethane,</b> dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) showed little or no long-term trend in Antarctic firn and therefore are evidently of entirely natural origin in the Southern Hemisphere. A clear seasonal trend was observed in the upper firn for the shortest-lived halocarbons (notably bromoform and methyl iodide). The same species were present at lower abundance at the higher altitude and more inland Antarctic site, possibly due to their origin from more distant oceanic sources. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{detection}} of the carcinogenic trihalomethanes (THM) in {{public water supply}} systems using low-cost equipment has become an essential feature, since these compounds may be generated as by-products of water-treatment processes. Here we report on a sensor array that extends {{the concept of an}} “electronic tongue ” to detect small amounts of bromoform, <b>bromodichloromethane</b> and dibromochloromethane, with detection limits as low as 0. 02 mg L- 1. The sensor array was made up of 10 sensing units, in which nanostructured films of conducting and natural polymers were deposited onto gold interdigitated electrodes. The principle of detection was impedance spectroscopy, with measurements carried out in the range between 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Using data at 1 kHz, at which the electrical response varied considerably by changing the analyte, we demonstrated with principal component analysis (PCA) that samples with the 3 brominated trihalomethanes can be distinguished from each other and for various concentrations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bromodichloromethane</b> (BDCM) and {{chloroform}} (CHC 13) are by-products {{of drinking}} water chlorination and {{are the two most}} prevalent trihalomethanes (THMs) in finished drinking water. To date, no comprehensive comparison of the acute renal and hepatic effects of BDCM and CHC 13 following oral gavage in an aqueous dosing vehicle has been conducted. To characterize BDCM- and CHCl 3 -induced nephro- and hepatotoxicity following aqueous ga-vage and compare directly the responses between these THMs, 95 -day-old male F- 344 rats were given single oral doses of 0. 0, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, or 3. 0 mmol BDCM or CHClj/kg body wt in an aqueous 10 % Emulphor solution. Compound-related hepatic and renal damage was evaluated by quantitating clinical toxicity mark-ers in the serum and urine, respectively. Both THMs appear to be equally hepatotoxic after 24 h, but BDCM caused significantly greater elevations in serum hepatotoxicity markers than CHC 13 a...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studied the}} effect of {{chlorination}} disinfection by-products (CDBPs) in drinking water on {{the risk of developing}} pancreatic cancer. The study was based on the case-control component of the National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System. Incident cases and frequency-matched population controls recruited between 1994 and 1997 from six Canadian provinces were used to estimate pancreatic cancer risks associated with exposure to CDBPs. Residence history collected from subjects was linked to two sources of water quality data to estimate historical exposure. The first source provided a lifetime average estimate of known exposure to trihalomethane (THM), <b>bromodichloromethane</b> (BDCM), and chloroform (TCM), while the second provided residence-specific estimates of THM exposure. Adjusted risk estimates were based on the most recent 30 years of exposure with missing data imputed using Observed Control Mean Imputation. Overall, no consistent significant increase (or decrease) in pancreatic cancer risks was observed with 30 -year exposure to THM, BDCM, and TCM after adjusting for potential confounders...|$|E
40|$|Several halocarbons {{have been}} shown to cause full-litter {{resorption}} (FLR) in Fischer- 344 rats when administered orally in corn oil. Since halocarbons often occur as contaminants of drinking water, we sought to determine the influence of the vehicle, aqueous versus lipid, on the developmental toxicity of two of these agents. In separate assays, <b>bromodichloromethane</b> (BDCM) and carbon tetrachloride (CCI 4) were administered by gavage to Fischer- 344 rats on gestation days (GD) 6 - 15 at 0, 25, 50, or 75 mg/kg/day in either corn oil or an aqueous vehicle containing 10 % Emulphor EL- 620. Dams were allowed to deliver and the litters were examined postnatally. Uteri of females that did not deliver were stained with 10 % ammonium sulfide to detect FLR. Effects of both agents on maternal weight gain were slightly more pronounced in the aqueous vehicle at lower doses, but at the highest dose, CCL, was more maternally toxic in corn oil. Developmentally, both agent...|$|E
