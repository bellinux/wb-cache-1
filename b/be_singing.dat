5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not <b>be</b> <b>singing,</b> and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E

25|$|In addition, it {{is common}} for the Gregory Brothers to alter footage by {{superimposing}} their own mouths or arms onto individuals who were in the original video clip; compare Syncro-Vox. This effect is often used to make those individuals appear to <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> along or enthusiastically getting into the music. The Gregory Brothers sometimes use this technique to make people appear to play percussion (such as drums, the tambourine and the cowbell) or other instruments (such as the theremin) along with the music.|$|E

But with no definite arrangements having been made to compose for the Italian house—and Bellini essentially not wishing to proceed with an offer from Turin to stage Norma—he began to getting settled in a new, small apartment.

25|$|Cameras {{follow the}} finalists during their day, and in early series {{some of the}} footage was aired in a {{spin-off}} show called The Xtra Factor: The Aftermath, which was broadcast {{in the middle of}} the week on ITV2. The Xtra Factor: Xcess All Areas was a live show in which there were interviews, games and trips around the contestants' homes. The show also let viewers know which songs the contestants would <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> in the next live show. Both shows were axed after series 3 due to ITV2 cutting back on spin-off programing. For the series 12 live shows, both formats were revived under a single Thursday night live edition of The Xtra Factor as a replacement for the Saturday edition.|$|E
25|$|A devadasi's {{life after}} {{dedication}} was obviously very different centuries ago. Nowadays After dedication {{of a girl}} to the temple, she has to take bath every day {{early in the morning}} and should present herself at the temple during morning worship of Yellamma. She is not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum. But she will bow to the deity from outside. Thereafter she sweeps compound of the temple. Every Tuesday and Friday she goes for yoga along with senior jogatis (yoga teachers). During this period she learns innumerable songs in praise of Yellamma and her son Parashurama. If she shows some aptitude to learn playing instruments she will be given training by her elder jogatis. In Yellampura and other villages Devadasis do not dance but this is performed by eunuch companions. The main functions of Devadasis would <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> and playing stringed musical instruments and Jagate. They form a small group and go for joga, from house to house on every Tuesday and Friday (Jogan Shankar, 1990).|$|E
25|$|The clerk, {{standing}} in {{the centre of the}} portrait and uniting the two-halves, holds the music he is singing from, possibly entitled 'Farewell my Judy'. Jeremy Barlow speculates that this might be a sentimental love song. The two servants frame the picture, the black servant playing a pipe and tabor. The combination of these musical instruments had a popular accompaniment to dancing for several centuries, but was in decline in England by the eighteenth century. Barlow considers Hogarth's representation of the tabor pipe a poor one, arguing that it is too short and has too many holes to be the usual three-holed tabor pipe, the boy holds it too far up its length and does not cover all the holes. Barlow points out that Hogarth may have intended the instrument to be a flabiol instead. He also notes that the lively music the instruments would have produced would be unlikely to complement a sentimental ballad that the clerk appears to <b>be</b> <b>singing,</b> and instead suggests the painting combines and conflates a number of typical activities in the cabin into one scene.|$|E

25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

[...] "We have decided that [...] should never appear in sketches and never play any character but herself. And she'll <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> more songs, more medleys, more standards. Songs are her babies. We told her what we think and she's listening. She's far too insecure about television to exercise her own judgment. She knows what's good for her." ...|$|E

500|$|Jam and Lewis {{also asked}} the boy band 98 Degrees to join Carey and Joe on the track, as they wanted male harmonies. Carey talked about the {{collaboration}} {{in an interview with}} MTV. [...] "It's like when I was writing 'One Sweet Day'. It really cried out for a group to <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> with me and for a strong male-female thing in terms of going back and forth, vocally.

The track was mixed by Supa Engineer Duo at Right Track Recording and mastered by Herb Powers.|$|E
500|$|A music video, co-directed by Neil Pollock and Jonathan Bekemeier, {{to promote}} the single shows the band playing its {{instruments}} through a distorted fish-eye lens, the camera variously panning horizontally across the performance space and vertically over the individual band members. Keeping {{in the spirit of}} the mimed performance, Francis and bassist Kim Deal open and shut their mouths in time with their prerecorded vocals, yet make no attempt to articulate their lips in synch with the words that they are supposed to <b>be</b> <b>singing.</b> Instead, they simply keep their mouths wide open with blank expressions for the duration of each verse. Francis stated that [...] "Water on the brain" [...] was the theme of the clip.|$|E
500|$|MercyMe began {{recording}} the album over Christmas 2004, {{and put the}} [...] "finishing touches" [...] on it over the following summer. The band brought in rock producer Brown Bannister, who had previously recorded albums for artists like Amy Grant and Steven Curtis Chapman, to produce both The Christmas Sessions and their next studio album, which would also utilize a rock sound. In selecting songs for The Christmas Sessions the band wanted to cover Christmas songs they had grown up with, but they did write and record one original song, [...] "Joseph's Lullaby". Millard had initially written it as [...] "Mary's Lullaby" [...] but changed the lyrics and key upon suggestion from Bannister's wife, who noted that, being male, it was odd for him to <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> {{from the perspective of}} Mary as opposed to Joseph.|$|E

500|$|Fernández {{has stated}} that the album was {{conceived}} as a banda album with original music by Sebastian, a first for the singer; before this, in 1993, he included a cover of a song written by Sebastian titled [...] "Verdad Que Duele" [...] ("It Hurts") on his album Lástima Que Seas Ajena (A Shame You Belong to Another). Fernández' fans kept asking to record banda songs and written by Sebastian, prompting him to record the album. Fernández was not pleased {{with the idea of}} trading his classic mariachi style for banda, but agreed to record with Sebastian as a [...] "thank you" [...] to his fans.

500|$|The {{popular music}} video for [...] "The Scientist" [...] was notable for its {{distinctive}} reverse narrative, which employed reverse video.

[...] The reverse video style had first been seen in 1989 for the video for the song [...] "The Second Summer of Love" [...] by Scottish band Danny Wilson. In order for Martin to appear to <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> the lyrics in the reversed footage, he {{had to learn to}} sing the song backwards, which took him a month. The video was filmed at various locations, including London and at Bourne Woods in Surrey, before the first leg of the A Rush of Blood to the Head tour. It was directed by Jamie Thraves. The video was shot between 30 September – 3 October 2002, premiering on 14 October.|$|E

Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times described it as an [...] "old-school pop" [...] song and picked it as a standout track, whilst John Marrs of Gay Times claimed that [...] "the mid-tempo track underpinned by a dirty bass bears {{little resemblance to the}} sparse, pedestrian demo," [...] also noting that [...] "when the melody is lush as this, she could <b>be</b> <b>singing</b> a recipe from Mary Berry's cookbook as far as we care."
