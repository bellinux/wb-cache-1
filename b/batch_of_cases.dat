40|$|This {{symposium}} contribution considers five recurring {{themes in}} the application of tort law to new technologies. First, the initial <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> presented to courts may be atypical of later lawsuits that implicate the innovation, yet relate rules with surprising persistence. Second, these cases may be identified, and resolved, by reference to analogies that rely on similarities in form, and which do not wear well over time. Third, {{it may be difficult to}} isolate the unreasonable risks generated by an innovation from the benefits it is perceived to offer. Fourth, potential claims by early adopters of the technology may be more difficult to identify and recover upon than those that arise later, once the technology develops a mainstream audience. Fifth, and finally, uncertainty among potential plaintiffs (and their counsel) regarding the existence of a cause of action and the likelihood of recovery may beget a dearth of claims that involve an innovation for a significant period of time after its initial appearance. In introducing and explaining these themes, this article considers the initial application of tort law to technologies such as automobiles, airplanes, radio and television, and Tasers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nested {{workflow}} nets {{were introduced}} to model separation of concerns and exception handling in a hierarchical way in large workflow. We consider an extension of nested workflow nets suitable for processing <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> {{at different levels of}} nestedness. This gives rise to new pa-rameterized compositional soundness (proper termination) criteria. We show how these notions of soundness and other correctness criteria such as circumspectness (proper exception handling) can be verified and ex-hibit relationships between these notions. Nested workflow nets are a class of nested nets where tokens are workflow nets themselves which can modify their structure at runtime, proper termination and exception handling is being modeled. This class becomes particularly useful for modeling flexible workflow, in particular by allowing the choice of protocols to be made at runtime and by allowing the library of workflows to be changed at runtime. In [6, 5], the applicability of non-recursive nested workflow nets (called adaptive nets) in the medical domain was shown. Moreover, in [3] the appro...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the published morphological criteria permit reliable segregation of small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) cases by determining the interobserver variation. Methods and results: One hundred and seventy <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> SCLC, LCNEC and cases diagnosed as neuroendocrine lung carcinoma before LCNEC had been established as a diagnostic category were retrieved from the archives of the assessor's institutes. A representative haematoxylin and eosin section from each case was selected for review. <b>Batches</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> were circulated among nine pathologists with a special interest in pulmonary pathology. Participants were asked to classify the cases histologically according to the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The diagnoses were collected and kappa values calculated. Unanimity of diagnosis was achieved for only 20 cases; a majority diagnosis was reached for 115 cases. In 35 cases no consensus diagnosis could be reached. There was striking variability amongst assessors in diagnosing SCLC and LCNEC. The overall level of agreement for all cases included in this study was fair (kappa = 0. 40). Conclusions: Using non-preselected cases, the morphological WHO criteria for diagnosing SCLC and LCNEC leave room for subjective pathological interpretation, which results in imprecise categorization of SCLC and LCNEC cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{manufacturing}} industry, {{variations in}} machinability are regularly observed when producing {{the same part}} out <b>of</b> different material <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> a <b>case</b> hardening steel. Some batches result in variations in chip breakability {{which leads to a}} non-robust production process with unforeseen stops of automatic machining process. The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of the microstructure on chip formation in case hardening steel. Different microstructures were produced from the same <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> material by varying heat treatment. Chips were collected after machining at different feed rates and depths of cut. The cross sections of the chips have been analyzed with respect to overall deformation pattern, mean thickness, and degree of segmentation. Also, the influence of manganese sulfide on machinability has been investigated. The microstructural investigation of the chips has shown that there is a clear difference in the deformation behavior between a case hardening steel with larger and smaller pearlite nodular structure. Chips from the material with larger pearlite nodular size and lower amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite are by far more segmented as compared to chips from materials with smaller pearlite nodular size...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is based on}} field studies in full scale production and machinability is evaluated in terms of tool wear of cemented carbide inserts. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how rather small variations in chemical composition between different <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> a <b>case</b> hardening steel affect machinability. Continuous wear is observed to be low for all of the investigated inserts. However, some of the tools show discontinuous wear, like spalling of coating. The discontinuous wear is believed to be caused by unevenness of the forged scale of the machined component and not by variations in the material workpiece bulk properties. Since this wear mechanism may cause a premature tool breakage, it is very important to investigate this finding in more detail. To be able to evaluate the effect of chemical composition on machinability further experiments are necessary, in a more controlled environment with a material having a larger variation in composition...|$|R
40|$|In {{manufacturing}} industry, {{variations in}} machinability are regularly observed when producing {{the same part}} out <b>of</b> different material <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> a <b>case</b> hardening steel. However, material batches showing a decreased machinability often have properties within the material specification. Thus, for an increased machinability and a more robust production <b>of</b> <b>case</b> hardening steel parts, the relationship between microstructure and machinability needs to be further investigated. In this study, machinability has been evaluated for a specific case hardening steel with respect to pearlite nodular size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing of pearlite. These variations in microstructure have been achieved by altering the annealing cycle, i. e. austenitizing temperature, holding time and temperature for pearlite formation. The criterions for machinability which are taken into consideration in this investigation are tool wear and chip formation. Furthermore, a comparison of cutting forces and surface integrity for the tested microstructures will be presented. The results from tests show a difference between material with larger pearlite nodules and a material with smaller pearlite nodules. For tool wear, the material with larger pearlite nodules has a decreased machinability. However, for chip formation the result is opposite, and a material with larger pearlite nodules has an increased machinability...|$|R
40|$|Least-squares {{estimates}} are trustworthy with minimal variance if the correct stochastic model is used. Due to computational burden, diagonal models that neglect correlations are preferred {{to describe the}} elevation dependency of the variance of GPS observations. In this contribution, an improved stochastic model based on a parametric function to take correlations between GPS phase observations into account is presented. Built on an adapted and flexible Mátern function accounting for spatiotemporal variabilities, its parameters can be fixed thanks to Maximum Likelihood Estimation or chosen apriori to model turbulent tropospheric refractivity fluctuations. In this contribution, we will show in which cases and under which conditions corresponding fully populated variance covariance matrices (VCM) replace the estimation of a tropospheric parameter. For this equivalence “augmented functional versus augmented stochastic model” to hold, the VCM should be made sufficiently largewhich corresponds to computing small <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> observations. A <b>case</b> study with observations from a medium baseline of 80 km divided into <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> 600 s shows improvement of up to 100 mm for the 3 Drms when fully populated VCM are used compared with an elevation dependent diagonal model.
