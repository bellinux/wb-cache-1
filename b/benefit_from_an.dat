5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping that the children would <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> English education—where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.|$|E

25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.|$|E
25|$|Walker Arboretum: Located {{along the}} {{hillside}} of Rodman Hall and the Twelve Mile Creek below, the original owner of this estate was Thomas Rodman Merritt, son of William Hamilton Merritt. In the late 19th century, an English landscape designer named Samuel Richardson {{was hired by}} Merritt to tend the grounds. As a result, the arboretum is an extensive, rambling garden with rare conifers which <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> exceptional micro-climate.

Although ICDs deliver electrical shocks to resynchronize heart rhythm which are potentially distressing to the patient, they have not been shown to affect quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{has made}} {{a concerted effort to}} improve the economy’s ability to <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> {{enhanced}} system of intellectual property rights. This includes increasing the resources of the Israel Patent Office, upgrading enforcement activities and implementing programmes to bring ideas funded by government research to the market. Between 2002 and 2012, foreigners accounted for nearly 80% of the patent applications filed with the Israel Patent Office. A sizeable share of foreign applicants seeking protection from the Israel Patent Office are pharmaceutical companies such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Janssen, Novartis, Merck, Bayer-Schering, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer, which happen to be the main business competitors of Israel’s own Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.|$|E
25|$|Manstein's {{aggressive}} {{plan was}} {{to break through the}} weak Allied centre with overwhelming force, trap the forces to the north in a pocket, and drive on to Paris. The plan would <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Allied response close to how they would have responded in the original case; namely, that a large part of French and British strength would be drawn north to defend Belgium and Picardy. To help ensure this result, German Army Group B would still attack Belgium and the Netherlands in order to draw Allied forces eastward into the developing encirclement. The attack would also enable the Germans to secure bases for a later attack on Britain.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for the high-risk population to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of breast cancer risk. These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even {{in a place that}} is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain close to the ground {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E
25|$|While the American {{working class}} has {{lost much of}} its {{political}} strength with the decline of labor unions, it remains a stronghold of the Democratic Party and continues as {{an essential part of the}} Democratic base. Today, roughly a third of the American public is estimated to be working class with around 52% being either members of the working or lower classes. Yet, as those with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to vote, the working and lower classes are underrepresented in the electorate. The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of clerical and blue-collar workers. Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate standard of living, high economic insecurity and possible personal <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> extended social safety net, make the majority of working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic base. The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which shows that the majority of those with low incomes and little education vote for the Democratic Party.|$|E

500|$|For the 2008 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, Holden {{announced}} the MY09.5 upgrade involving the standardisation of the [...] "premium" [...] Alloytec V6 across the Commodore range from 1 November 2008, whereas previously {{it had been}} reserved for the SV6 and Calais. Omega and Berlina variants acquired variable valve timing, like the High Output engine, but not the [...] "premium" [...] dual exhaust system and the five-speed automatic transmission. These changes result in the base petrol V6 producing [...] less power and [...] less torque than the engine it replaces. However, Omega and Berlina sedans benefit from a twopercent fuel efficiency improvement, or fourpercent for wagons. Additionally, emissions have also been reduced allowing petrol-powered variants to achieve Euro VI certification, a pending emission standard for European introduction in 2014. These changes extend further than the petrol engine as bi-fuel LPG variants <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> eightpercent improvement in fuel economy when run on LPG. This reduced fuel consumption does however, come at a cost—LPG-equipped models are rated at , [...] less than before.|$|E
500|$|Directly {{influenced}} by musical theatre, Ashman strongly believed that The Little Mermaid would <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> [...] "I Want" [...] song, a musical number {{during which the}} main character sings about what {{she would like to}} accomplish by the end of her story. Directors and writers Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song for Ariel in which she expresses her romantic feelings for Prince Eric, but Ashman felt that a song that details the character's fascination with the human world instead would better serve the film's plot. Ashman recruited Benson, a stage actress with whom he had first worked on the Broadway musical Smile (1986), to record [...] "Part of Your World", and worked closely with her to ensure that she delivered a desirable performance. Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg initially ordered that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] be removed from the final film due to concerns that the ballad would bore young children. However, Ashman, Clements, Musker and animator Glen Keane ultimately convinced Katzenberg that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is essential to the film's narrative, and the song was spared after audiences appeared to enjoy it during a subsequent test screening.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{disliked the}} game's control scheme, many {{stating that the}} use of the Wii remote was awkward and {{difficult}} to master. Bozon condemned the lack of refined flight control and noted that it was easier to use either the Classic Controller or the GameCube controller. Similarly, Scullion said that out of the three control schemes, the Wii remote was the least accurate option. VanOrd also criticized the poorly implemented use of the Wii remote, and Rosenberg thought its controls were overly responsive and unpolished; both reviewers recommended using the Classic Controller's analogue stick as an alternative. Dickens recognised that the original Nights into Dreams {{was one of the first}} games to <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> analogue stick, and was therefore surprised at how the sequel had a [...] "control scheme crisis": multiple control schemes might add confusion for new players. Govan suggested that the reason why the game featured alternative control schemes was that Sonic Team wanted to emulate the original Saturn controls. In contrast, the reviewer from Jeuxvideo.com found little fault with any of the game's control schemes, and Bedigan labelled them as [...] "excellent". Both reviewers, however, agreed that the Wii remote's motion controls did not work well with the game.|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
