25|$|Amundsen's {{team did}} {{initially}} {{have problems with}} their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late.|$|E
25|$|In July, 2009, {{writing for}} the Washington Post, former US {{ambassador}} to the United Nations John Bolton said that a targeted military strike against Iran's weapons facilities {{was the only way}} to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

25|$|Peter Wykeham {{suggested}} that the government in London was more to blame {{than any of the}} British commanders in the Far East. Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham – and therefore Percival – permission to enter neutral Thailand <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to put in place forward defences.|$|E

Gude was rejected by the academy, but attracted the attention of Andreas Achenbach who provided him with private lessons.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of the riot the House was {{discovered}} to be on fire. The flames spread rapidly, and of the stately pile there soon remained no more than the gaunt and blackened walls. <b>Before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late the booty had been dragged out upon the sward, and the country people flocked in crowds to buy the cheese, the bacon, and the wheat which had been stored within. Prizes of greater value were reserved for more appreciative chapmen.|$|E
25|$|However, {{once the}} Shah fled the country, the SAVAK (Iranian state security) agents {{assigned}} {{with the task}} of guarding Hoveyda, absconded from their posts, leaving Hoveida open to arrest by revolutionary forces. Hoveyda refused requests by friends and relatives to flee Iran <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late, and instead turned himself into the authorities. Hoveyda believed that as the trial would be before an Islamic court, and that he personally had done nothing wrong, he would be acquitted.|$|E

25|$|A common myth {{surrounding}} the bombing (due {{in part to}} such books as Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret) is that Coventry was deliberately undefended to prevent the Germans realising that Enigma cipher machine traffic (information from which was termed Ultra) was being read by British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park. This claim is untrue – Winston Churchill was aware that a major bombing raid was to take place, but no-one knew where the raid was meant to strike <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to evacuate.|$|E
25|$|The {{harvesting}} machines constantly broke down, {{which resulted in}} shooting beginning late in the afternoon, allowing {{for only a few}} hours of light <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> dark to go on. One day, two helicopters were scheduled to drop peanut shells that were to simulate locusts on film; however, Malick decided to shoot period cars instead. He kept the helicopters on hold at great cost. Production was lagging behind, with costs exceeding the budget $3,000,000 by about $800,000, and Schneider had already mortgaged his home in order to cover the overages.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the message}} {{had not been}} passed on to Quebec <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late. Near quitting time that same afternoon, {{after four years of}} construction, the south arm and part of the central section of the bridge {{collapsed}} into the St. Lawrence River in just 15 seconds. Of the 86 workers on the bridge that day, 75 were killed and the rest were injured, making it the world's worst bridge construction disaster. Of these victims, 33 (some sources say 35) were Mohawk steelworkers from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal; they were buried at Kahnawake under crosses made of steel beams.|$|E

25|$|At {{the opening}} of {{hostilities}} several Polish cities including Dubno, Łuck and Włodzimierz Wołyński let the Red Army in peacefully, convinced that it was marching on in order to fight the Germans. General Juliusz Rómmel of the Polish Army issued an unauthorised order to treat them like an ally <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late. The Soviet government announced it was acting to protect the Ukrainians and Belarusians {{who lived in the}} eastern part of Poland, because the Polish state – according to Soviet propaganda – had collapsed in the face of the Nazi German attack and could no longer guarantee the security of its own citizens. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded that the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all uniformed troops to then-neutral Romania.|$|E
25|$|Though Senna's consistency, the car's {{competitiveness}} and the Williams's unreliability {{at the beginning}} of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the car <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late. These modifications enabled him to make a late-season push, and he won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in Japan when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season. Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty.|$|E
25|$|Henry and Emma {{return to}} Regina's cave. Emma asks {{to speak with}} Regina alone, and tells {{her that if she}} tells Robin the truth about how she feels, {{everything}} will be fixed and they can both get their happy endings with the men they love, acknowledging that she herself never got the chance to tell Hook how she really felt <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late. The trio arrive at the chapel to stop the wedding, but before they can do so, Rumple suddenly appears to stop them. Emma and Henry try to distract Rumple as Regina tries to work up the nerve to interrupt the ceremony. Emma engages Rumple in a sword fight, until he is able to knock her out temporarily. He then aims his sword at Henry, but Regina jumps in front of him just in time to take the hit herself, opting to save Henry instead of pursuing Robin. Moments later, Robin and Zelena exit the chapel and Robin rushes to Regina's side as Zelena's envy starts to take over, causing her to start turning green. Robin tells Regina that she won't have to die alone.|$|E

500|$|Many {{journalists who}} saw the film at Sundance speculated that it was likely that Disney would take legal action to prevent the film from being shown outside the festival, or perhaps even during it. [...] "Disney's lawyers are {{probably}} climbing onto helicopters and planning a raid on Park City right now," [...] wrote McWeeny. Critics urged others present to see it <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late, and commented that it was questionable if those not present at the festival would ever {{have an opportunity to}} see it.|$|E
500|$|Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press {{noted that}} [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] is {{different}} from [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] and that it shows a side of Beyoncé that listeners rarely see. Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that the song reveals [...] "a more ferocious side to Beyoncé with it's [...] faster pace and aggressive piano backing". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy commented that the [...] " [...] is a classic Beyoncé track waiting to happen". Chad Grischow of IGN wrote that [...] "the lush backing music and [...] soaring vocals" [...] on the song sound suitable for an updated take on the [...] soundtrack album as Beyoncé is ecstatic that she ended a poor relationship <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late. Jon Caramainca of The New York Times commented that the [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] has [...] "optimistic, coffee-commercial" [...] pianos, which place Beyoncé directly in Lilith Fair territory. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that {{it is one of}} the best ballads on the album 4. James Dinh of the same publication added that the song has a radio-friendly appeal and a catchy chorus. Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly and Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle praised the song's radio nature, with the latter calling it [...] "a return to form" [...] with a [...] "regal sound of a radio smash". Jim Farber of Daily News wrote that the melodies and the clever lyrics of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] are likely to inspire significant airplay. Ricky Schweitzer of One Thirty BPM commented that even though the ballad sounds like a place-filler on 4, it remains largely superior [...] "to the majority of the trash being churned out by Beyoncé’s peers".|$|E

Johanne Jørgensen, the pregnant young wife of Captain Jørgen M. Jørgensen, and their 4-year-old son Carl Zealand Jørgensen, were among those who drowned in a final escape attempt as the ship broke up. One more sailor survived, but other five sailors were also drowned. The Captain was somehow spared and washed ashore semi-conscious, but still alive.|$|E
