40|$|Abstract—Advances in CMOS image sensors enable {{high-speed}} image readout, {{which makes}} it possible to capture multiple images within a normal exposure time. Earlier work has demonstrated the use of this capability to enhance sensor dynamic range. This paper presents an algorithm for synthesizing a high dynamic range, motion blur free, still image from multiple captures. The algorithm consists of two main procedures, photocurrent estimation and saturation and motion detection. Estimation is used to reduce read noise, and, thus, to enhance dynamic range at the low illumination end. Saturation detection is used to enhance dynamic range at the high illumination end as previously proposed, while motion blur detection ensures that the estimation is not corrupted by motion. Motion blur detection also {{makes it possible to}} extend exposure time and to capture more images, which can be used to further enhance dynamic range at the low illumination end. Our algorithm operates completely locally; each pixel’s final value is computed using only its captured values, and recursively, requiring the storage of only a constant number of values per pixel independent of the number of images captured. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), dynamic range, and the motion blur prevention achieved using the algorithm.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} for <b>blurred</b> image <b>restoration</b> is presented. Our algorithm is based on human vision which zooms {{back and forth in}} the image in order to identify global structures or details. Deconvolution parameters are estimated by an edge detection and correspond to the ones of a chosen edge detection model. The segmentation is obtained by merging multiscale information provided by multiscale edge detection. The edge detection is achieved by using a derivative approach following a generalization of Canny-Deriche ﬁltering. This multiscale analysis performs an efﬁcient edge detection in noisy blurred images. The merging leads to the best local representation of edge information across scales. The algorithm deals with a mixed (coarse-to-ﬁne/ﬁne-to-coarse) approach and searches for candidate edge points through the scales. Edge characteristics are estimated by the merging algorithm for the chosen model. Scale, direction and amplitude informations allow a local deconvolution of the original image. The noise problem is not considered in this work since it does not disturb the process. Results show that this method allows non-uniformly <b>blurred</b> image <b>restoration.</b> An implementation of the whole algorithm in an intelligent camera (DSP) has been performed...|$|R
