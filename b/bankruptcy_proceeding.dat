2500|$|An {{important}} reason for the movements to create a single national Court of Appeals for tax cases is that the United States Tax Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over tax cases.

In the first two instances, the taxpayer bringing the claim generally must have first paid the deficiency determined by the IRS.

40|$|For {{the past}} 15 years an {{enormous}} enterprise of global norm making and related national lawmaking has been underway {{in many areas}} of global commerce. This article shows that leading global institu-tions, such as the World Bank, IMF, and United Nations, are build-ing an international financial architecture with law—including cor-porate bankruptcy law—as its foundation. Building on research on international institutions and three national cases (China, Indonesia, Korea), the authors propose a new framework for legal change in a global context—the recursivity of law. They argue that the glob-alization of <b>bankruptcy</b> law has <b>proceeded</b> through three cycles: (1) at the national level through recursive cycles of lawmaking, (2) at the global level through iterative cycles of norm making, and (3) at the nexus of the two. Recursive cycles are driven by driven by four mechanisms—the indeterminacy of law, contradictions, diagnostic struggles, and actor mismatch. Thus the recursivity of law both revives and expands the sociological theory of legal change and offers a basis for an integrated theory of globalization and law. Sociological studies of globalization largely neglect law. Whereas research has been extensive in such global arenas as finance, business, culture, religion, and population, it has been almost entirely absent for law. Thi...|$|R

40|$|Discharge from debts {{represents}} one of modes of resolving bankruptcy of a debtor. It is a legal institute, which is very often used by debtors. Its aim {{is not only to}} satisfy creditors at least in the law guaranteed amount but also to protect the debtor, who is released of all his previous debts after successful discharge and he can start new life without debts and never-ending executions. The purpose of this thesis is to characterize an institute of discharge, to put it into the system of insolvency law, to describe insolvency procedure and some problematic areas of discharge, which cause difficulties in practice. During writing this thesis I tried to interconnect effective laws with case law of higher courts, reference literature and articles. The thesis is composed of 5 chapters. In the first one I briefly characterize basic terms of insolvency law (insolvency <b>proceeding,</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> procedural entities) and modes of resolving bankruptcy of a debtor. Second chapter focuses on insolvency proceeding from insolvency petition to permission of discharge. Last part of the chapter describes alternatives of discharge, these are converting debtor's property into money, payment schedule or combination of both. In the third part, I deal with some problematic areas of discharge, which are missing or unclear [...] ...|$|R
