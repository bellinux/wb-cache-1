5|$|The {{purpose of}} the raid was to destroy three objectives: the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire {{together}} with the water pumping machinery and other installations, and any U-boats or other shipping in the area. The initial Combined Operations plan required one specially lightened destroyer {{to carry out the}} raid. It would <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> with explosives and rammed into the dock gates.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s, Dælenenga was {{dominated}} by the Workers' Sports Federation (AIF) and served as its main stadium in Oslo. AIF's Grünerløkka chapter was established at Dælenenga and used it as its training ground. Dælenenga was used for major AIF tournaments and the largest tournament took place 5 July 1929, with 500 participants. It also served as the terminus of many of AIF's and other labor movement parades. Each May Day the stadium would <b>be</b> <b>packed.</b> From the early 1930s, AIF moved its largest tournaments to Jordal. The local AIF club was particularly good at boxing, and in 1937 gathered thousands of spectators to watch a boxing match at Dælenenga.|$|E
5|$|The Government may ask for {{the flag}} to be lowered to half-mast {{in the event of}} the death of an {{important}} person or for national mourning. No person is permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony. However, the national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral. No person may display any flag that is damaged or dirty. Any worn out or damaged flag should <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> into a sealed black trash bag before being disposed and not left visible in dustbins.|$|E
50|$|The {{ammunition}} is of {{the conventional}} streamlined, fin-stabilized type. It uses the ignition cartridge and powder-increment type of propellant. The round uses the standard type 100 mortar fuze and weighs 26.4 pounds. Two rounds of ammunition <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> in a wooden box, lined with asphalt impregnated paper. The ignition cartridges are assembled into the rounds as <b>packed,</b> the fuzes <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> in tear-top cans, and the doughnut-type increments <b>are</b> <b>packed</b> in tar-paper bags.|$|R
25|$|The sphere <b>packing</b> problem <b>is</b> the {{three-dimensional}} {{version of a}} class of ball-packing problems in arbitrary dimensions. In two dimensions, the equivalent problem <b>is</b> <b>packing</b> circles on a plane. In one dimension it <b>is</b> <b>packing</b> line segments into a linear universe.|$|R

5|$|The {{extraction}} of peat from the Moors {{is known to}} have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3feet (0.3–0.8m) over 100years. Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Underground was a {{non-traditional}} {{magazine that}} Sony Computer Entertainment America produced and published between Spring 1997 to Spring 2001. Subscribers received two PlayStation CDs, {{along with a}} booklet and colorful packaging every quarter. The CDs contained interviews, cheats, programmers moves, game demos and one-of-a-kind Memory Card saves. Several issues showed how a game was created from basic design to final product. Since the CDs could only be run on a PlayStation, it proved a useful marketing tool which spawned a line of PlayStation Underground JamPacks Demo CDs and which contained highlights from recent issues of PlayStation Underground, along with seemingly as many game demos that could <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> on a single CD. Unlike PlayStation Underground these were available in most stores for $4.95, were published twice a year in Summer and Winter and usually spotlighted newly released or coming soon games. By 2001, Sony had decided to phase out Underground {{to focus on the}} JamPacks with the release of the PlayStation 2. PlayStation Underground CDs are mainly in the hands of collectors these days.|$|E

25|$|The burying {{of human}} (and pet) waste in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is prohibited. Anyone who camps farther {{than a quarter}} of a mile from a marina, however, must bring a {{portable}} toilet. Pet waste must also <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> out.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{items are}} {{typically}} repackaged in zippered plastic bags. Canned or jarred food, except for meats or small delicacies, is avoided: their containers and moist contents are usually heavy, and the metal or glass must <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> out. Food dehydrators are popular for drying fruit, jerky, and pre-cooked meals.|$|E
25|$|Cats with sporotrichosis {{are unique}} in that the exudate from their lesions may contain {{numerous}} organisms. This makes cytological evaluation of exudate a valuable diagnostic tool in this species. Exudate is pyogranulomatous and phagocytic cells may <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> with yeast forms. These are variable in size, but many are cigar-shaped.|$|E

25|$|Ambo Mineral Water {{began to}} <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> in plastic bottles {{relatively}} recently, and {{prior to this}} was packed exclusively in glass bottles. New products introduced circa November 2014 were Ambo flavored water, which was formulated in several flavors, and Ambo Lite, a product with a lower mineral and carbonation content.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} replication systems {{during the life}} cycle of a retrovirus. First of all, the reverse transcriptase synthesizes viral DNA from viral RNA, and then from newly made complementary DNA strand. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> into virions. Therefore, mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.|$|E
25|$|The edited {{broadcast}} of December 3 – combining the big, choreographed numbers, lavish sets {{and some of}} the informal live sessions – was an enormous success. The show was the highest-rated television special of the year. According to Binder, it was probably the first one-man TV special to appear on commercial American television. Previously, TV specials tended to <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> with guest stars, like Frank Sinatra's Timex Special of 1960, in which Presley himself appeared with other celebrities, including Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr..|$|E

25|$|Of great {{importance}} to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules {{on the outside of}} the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} {{is similar to}} the Bin Packing Problem. It differs from the Bin Packing Problem in that a subset of items can be selected, whereas, in the Bin Packing Problem, all items have to <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> to certain bins. The concept is that there are multiple knapsacks. This may seem like a trivial change, but it is not equivalent to adding to the capacity of the initial knapsack. This {{variation is}} used in many loading and scheduling problems in Operations Research and has a Polynomial-time approximation scheme.|$|E
25|$|All {{the iron}} and {{machinery}} had to <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> in by mule overland, and a forge {{was set up}} to hammer the iron into fittings. The timber for her hull and cabins was cut in the mountains and hauled or floated to the construction site, where it was sawn into planks and other components for the vessel. It cost the company as much to build Shoshone as it took to build three boats elsewhere. Although she was a large boat and expensive, Shoshone drew less than two feet of water and had no difficulty navigating the river to Old's Ferry, Idaho.|$|E

25|$|In 1936, Dr. and Mrs. Robert South Barrett {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} the Library Association. They agreed to donate a building in memory of Dr. Barrett's mother, Kate Waller Barrett, if the city would commit to running it as a public library. The city agreed and the Society of Friends offered a 99-year lease on an old Quaker graveyard located on Queen Street. The old library was closed on March 1 for the books to <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> {{and moved to the}} new library, which opened to the public in August 1937. The Alexandria Library Association became the Alexandria Library Society.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} energy inputs and the {{environmental}} costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may {{last as long as}} a century, reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> in containers for final disposal. The process is very expensive, time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} costs of every {{nuclear power plant}} continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as greenfield status. After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and {{cut into small pieces}} to <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> in containers for interim storage or transmutation experiments. The consensus on how to approach the task is one that is relatively inexpensive, but {{it has the potential to}} be hazardous to the natural environment as it presents opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E
