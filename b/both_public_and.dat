5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, <b>both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied {{on the strength of}} inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E

5|$|Evidently {{there was}} a burst in {{overlapping}} commitments and commission, <b>both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> ecclesiastical, {{many of which were}} more important than his debut work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli.

5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps {{this is the reason}} for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, <b>both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private.|$|E

This has led to protest from local pregnant women for the government to remedy the issue, as they have found difficulty in securing a bed space for giving birth and routine check-ups. Other concerns in the decade of 2001–2010 relate to the workload medical staff experience; and medical errors and mishaps, which are frequently highlighted in local news.|$|E

Alternatively, conjoint analysis (a ranking of users' preferences which can then be statistically analysed) may be used. Approximate estimates of price elasticity can be calculated from the income elasticity of demand, under conditions of preference independence. This approach has been emprirically validated using bundles of goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, recreation, etc.).|$|E

5|$|Within Scotland, {{the monarchy}} of the United Kingdom has {{continued}} to {{use a variety of}} styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in <b>both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private law. The continued existence of legal, educational, religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, <b>both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the SR 125 {{toll road}} started in September 2003; it was {{projected}} {{to open in}} 2006. Over the next few years, 1.5 million cubic meters of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions {{to allow for the}} interchange with SR 54 to be built. In 2005, the road was given the South Bay Expressway name. The South Bay Expressway extended SR 125 southward from SR 54 to Otay Mesa. This toll road was one of four privately financed toll highway projects, including the 91 Express Toll Lanes, that were approved in 1990; it was also one of two toll roads financed and controlled by <b>both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> private sources, although the 91 Express Lanes, the other road, soon became entirely publicly owned. A partnership known as the South Bay Expressway operated the road, while an Australian company, Maquarie Group Ltd., handled financial and construction matters.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, {{calculations}} by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, {{along with}} confirmations by Fermi, {{had shown that}} not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951 Teller and Ulam made a breakthrough, and invented a new design, proposed in a classified March 1951 paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I: Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors, for a practical megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to {{what became known as the}} Teller–Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in <b>both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> classified discussions since the early 1950s.|$|E

Recognition of her work included selection as a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award in 2000, inclusion in the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition, and being shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. Her works are held in major Australian collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The National Historic Landmark Program is {{administered}} by the National Park Service, a branch of the Department of the Interior.

The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. <b>Both</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation.|$|E
