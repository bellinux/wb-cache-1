25|$|Some of {{the party}} {{attendees}} expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to come <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and complete the performance. Both women came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|E

From 7:30a.m. onwards, Borel started shooting people at random. No one grew suspicious of his rifle until he started his rampage, since it was hunting season and the sight of rifles outside was to be expected.|$|E

2500|$|Big Brother is a {{game show}} in which a group of contestants, {{referred}} to as HouseGuests, live in a custom-built [...] "house" [...] (actually a set built on a CBS stage in Los Angeles, Stage 18 in recent editions), constantly under video surveillance. While in the house, the contestants are completely isolated from the outside world, meaning no phone, television, internet, magazines, newspaper, or contact with those not in the house. This rule could be broken, however, {{in the event of}} a medical injury, a family emergency or death. The format of the series is mainly seen as a social experiment, and requires HouseGuests to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices. While a competition, the series allows viewers to witness the relationships formed in the house and the behavior of the HouseGuests. Though locked in the house, the HouseGuests are free to quit the game, though will not be allowed entry <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Should a HouseGuest break the rules of the game, they could be expelled from the house, and unable to return. The contestants compete for a grand prize of $500,000.|$|E

The evaluation finds that the programs' package (savings requirement, voucher and mortgage) design is inappropriate if the program is targeted to the poor. In fact the pro-poor targeting of the program was poor with high under-coverage and high leakage. Furthermore, the benefit of a minimum quality new house was not sustainable as many households slipped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> shortage category overtime. This impact evaluation reveals that although the program had significant positive effects on materiality conditions (access to water, sewerage, and electricity), it had a negative effect on overcrowding, and had no discernible effects on welfare indicators (poverty, school attendance, occupation ratio) ...|$|R
