5000|$|When in combat, {{the player}} {{can take some}} damage from enemy fire, filling a blood-colored [...] "crimson omen" [...] on the HUD {{as a measure of}} the player's health, unlike the {{traditional}} health bar in other shooters. By staying out of the line of fire, this will dissipate over time, but by taking too much damage, the player will become downed or killed, and must be [...] "revived" [...] by an ally within a short [...] "bleed-out" [...] period, or else the player will die, unless playing the game on Insane difficultly in which case a player will die immediately after taking too much damage without the <b>bleed-out.</b> The player can also be killed during the <b>bleed-out</b> by the use of the game's signature execution moves by the enemy. Some types of damage, such as explosives or head shots, can kill the player immediately without the <b>bleed-out</b> period. Similarly, the player can also cause enemies to fall into <b>bleed-out</b> in the same manner. The player and their allies and enemies can use nearly any structure as cover, firing blind from behind it or leaning out to take aimed shots while usually exposing their head more. Players can quickly switch between nearby covering walls or jump over lower cover to rush forward. Within Gears of War 3, some cover can be destroyed after taking some amount of damage, which can be used to a tactical advantage to draw out enemies from cover.|$|E
50|$|Pipe bombs {{can fail}} to explode if the gas {{pressure}} buildup is too slow, resulting in <b>bleed-out</b> through the detonator ignition hole. Insufficiently tight threading can also bleed gas pressure through the threads {{faster than the}} chemical reaction pressure can rise.|$|E
50|$|The {{developer}} draws penetrant from defects {{out onto}} the surface to form a visible indication, commonly known as <b>bleed-out.</b> Any areas that bleed out can indicate the location, orientation and possible types of defects on the surface. Interpreting the results and characterizing defects from the indications found may require some training and/or experience indication size is not the actual size of the defect.|$|E
500|$|Hostage: a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, {{in which the}} attackers must extract the hostage from the defenders, while the defenders must prevent the hostage from being rescued. A secondary manner of winning can occur if the attacking or defending team accidentally damages the hostage, causing the hostage to [...] "down"; if the opposing team can prevent revival of the hostage, and the hostage <b>bleeds-out</b> and dies, they will win the round.|$|R
50|$|Photo-quality {{images and}} {{graphics}} in vivid color may be printed into the unsealed porous oxide layer using color dyes via silkscreen, sublimation transfer or digital printer. Line-art-quality graphics {{can be achieved}} by use of a printer. Color graphics may also be directly applied by hand using an airbrush, sponge or paintbrush. Printed anodizing is sealed to prevent or reduce dye <b>bleed-out.</b> Uses include baseball bats, signs, furniture, surgical trays, motorcycle components, and architectural moulding.|$|E
5000|$|This {{school of}} thought says that the bigger {{the hole in the}} target the higher the rate of <b>bleed-out</b> and thus the higher the rate of the {{aforementioned}} [...] "one shot stop". According to this theory, as the bullet does not pass entirely through the body, it incorporates the energy transfer and the overpenetration ideals. Those that support this theory cite the [...]40 S&W round, arguing that it has a better ballistic profile than the [...]45, and more stopping power than a 9×19mm Parabellum.|$|E
5000|$|For close range, {{in order}} to get a {{baseline}} pressure reading, the zombie bite was simulated by a 100 lb rottweiler, named [...] "Joey", that bit down on a load cell hidden in an attack sleeve which resulted in 255 lbs of pressure. For the vampire bite, an alligator, named [...] "Ripper", was brought in to chomp down on a 10 lb load cell between two blocks, which resulted in 1,723 lbs of bite force. Then the forces were feed into an automated chomper designed by Geoff, changing the bite force and teeth for each creature. The zombie teeth killed a simulated vampire through <b>bleed-out</b> in 2:22, and the vampire teeth destroyed a zombie brain in 5 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|The theory {{centers on}} the [...] "permanent cavitation" [...] element of a handgun wound. A big hole damages more tissue. It is {{therefore}} valid to a point, but penetration is also important, as a large bullet that does not penetrate will {{be less likely to}} strike vital blood vessels and blood-carrying organs such as the heart and liver, while a smaller bullet that penetrates deep enough to strike these organs or vessels will cause faster <b>bleed-out</b> through a smaller hole. The ideal may therefore be a combination; a large bullet that penetrates deeply, which can be achieved with a larger, slower non-expanding bullet, or a smaller, faster expanding bullet such as a hollow point.|$|E
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, each warrior's sword {{was tested}} against ballistics gel torsos. The ninjato {{was able to}} cut six inches into the shoulder, lacerating the arm's blood vessels and the lung, and causing death by <b>bleed-out</b> {{within a matter of}} seconds. The velocity of the ninjato was measured and while the results were not specifically stated on the show, it was stated that the ninjato's velocity surpassed that of the Spartan's dory spear. The Spartan xiphos short sword was thrust six or seven inches into the torso just below the ribcage, but hit the metal rod supporting the torso with enough force to bend the sword, preventing an accurate reading, but according to Spartan expert Barry Jacobsen, it would have severed a real spinal cord. It was also explained in the Ninja/Spartan episode of the Aftermath that the blow had already severed the main aorta, cause rapid death. Both weapons were also tested on pig carcasses. The ninjato was able to cut clean through the pig in two slices (cutting through the pelvis and the spine) as well as the short sword. The edge was given to the ninjato due to its power, lightness, superior range, and quickness.|$|E
30|$|At {{the time}} of extubation and decanulation, the group of rats resuscitated with fluids only (FR) had {{required}} more fluids than animals resuscitated with FR+NE (183 % vs 106 % of <b>bleed-out</b> volume; p =[*] 0.003). During reperfusion, both HS groups were comparable and had lower MAP and higher HR than the sham group. No differences were noted in terms of saturation or temperature between groups (Table  1).|$|E
40|$|The South African Animal Protection Law, which {{requires}} animals to be stunned before slaughter, allows certain exemptions to accommodate religious slaughter. The {{supporters of the}} Jewish method of slaughter (Shechita), in which animals are slaughtered without pre-stunning, claim that the <b>bleed-out</b> and some quality parameters are better than when the animals are stunned before slaughtering. In this study, the percentage blood loss (BL%), presence (%) {{of blood in the}} trachea (BLT%) and blood splash % in the lungs (BS%), between the Shechita (Kosher) group and the conventionally slaughtered group of cattle were compared. Results showed {{no significant difference between the}} two treatment groups in terms of blood loss, although the conventional group had a higher <b>bleed-out.</b> However, there were significant differences in the presence of blood in the trachea and blood splash in the lungs, with the Kosher group having the highest percentages of these quality defects. Out of 170 animals examined for Kosher, 93 % had blood lining the trachea, ranging from one to over 50 %. From the 141 animals examined for the conventionally-slaughtered group, 97 % had no blood lining the trachea while the remaining 3 % had less than 10 % blood lining the trachea. Furthermore, 65 % of animals slaughtered in the Kosher way had blood splash ranging from 5 % to over 50 %, while the conventional group had only 0. 7 % incidence of blood splash in the lungs. These results show that slaughtering animals without stunning do not improve <b>bleed-out,</b> but increase blood in the trachea and blood splash in the lungs.

30|$|No {{difference}} {{was present in}} MAP levels during HS or reperfusion between the two resuscitation strategies. FR required significantly more fluid than FR+NE (183 % vs 106 % of <b>bleed-out</b> volume; p =[*] 0.003), when plasma lactate increased similarly. Xanthine oxidase was equally activated in both HS groups. After FR+NE, creatinine peaked higher but was similar in all groups at later time points. FR+NE enhanced MPO in the lung, when Claudin- 4 increased significantly after FR. In the brain amygdala, FR provoked more caspase 3 activity, MPO and microglial activation (Iba 1 expression).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether prolonged (chronic) resuscitation has any beneficial effects on cardiac output and hepatocellular function after trauma-hemorrhage and acute fluid replacement. BACKGROUND DATA: Acute fluid resuscitation after trauma-hemorrhage restores {{but does not}} maintain the depressed hepatocellular function and cardiac output. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 5 -cm laparotomy (i. e., trauma was induced) and were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg until 40 % of maximal <b>bleed-out</b> volume was returned {{in the form of}} Ringer's lactate (RL). The animals were acutely resuscitated with RL using 4 times the volume of maximum <b>bleed-out</b> over 60 minutes, followed by chronic resuscitation of 0, 5, or 10 mL/kg/hr RL for 20 hours. Hepatocellular function was determined by an in vivo indocyanine green clearance technique. Hepatic microvascular blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry. Plasma levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were determined by bioassay. RESULTS: Chronic resuscitation with 5 mL/kg/hr RL, but not with 0 or 10 mL/kg/hr RL, restored cardiac output, hepatocellular function, and hepatic microvascular blood flow at 20 hours after hemorrhage. The regimen above also reduced plasma IL- 6 levels. CONCLUSION: Because chronic resuscitation with 5 mL/kg/hr RL after trauma-hemorrhage and acute fluid replacement restored hepatocellular function and hepatic microvascular blood flow and decreased plasma levels of IL- 6, we propose that chronic fluid resuscitation in addition to acute fluid replacement should be routinely used in experimental studies of trauma-hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|A pseudobinary {{eutectic}} alloy composition {{was determined by}} a previously developed <b>bleed-out</b> technique. The directionally solidified {{eutectic alloy}} with a composition of Ni- 37. 4 Fe- 10. 0 Cr- 9. 6 Al (in wt%) had tensile strengths decreasing from 1, 090 MPa at room temperature to 54 MPa at 1, 100 C. The low density, excellent microstructural stability, and oxidation resistance of the alloy during thermal cycling suggest {{that it might have}} applicability as a gas turbine vane alloy while its relatively low high temperature strength precludes its use as a blade alloy. A zirconium addition increased the 750 C strength, and a tungsten addition was ineffective. The gamma=beta eutectic alloys appeared to obey a normal freezing relation...|$|E
40|$|Over 60 {{years ago}} the first {{reported}} molten metal explosion from a <b>bleed-out</b> during direct chill casting in an aluminium mill was reported. Soon thereafter, testing was performed to determine {{the root cause of}} the explosion. Upon determination of the root cause, an investigation to determine if any preventive measures could be instituted to prevent the explosions was conducted. Results found that a specific organic coating (e. g., Wise Chem E- 212 -F) prevented molten metal explosions, whereas some specific organic coatings initiated the explosions. Fifteen {{years ago the}} U. S. Department of Energy in conjuncture with the Aluminum Association reinvestigated the root cause of molten metal explosions. Testing revealed that an initiation or trigger had to be present for a molten metal explosion to occur. Testing identified three additional coatings that could afford protection...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of welfare issues {{relating}} to religious slaughter and the handling of animals both before slaughter and at point of slaughter. Most notably perceived pain and distress by cattle during the neck cut and the duration of sensibility in the period after slaughter prior to loss of brain function are often examined within religious slaughter methods. This paper will examine two different methods of the slaughter of cattle: penetrating captive bolt versus traditional halal slaughter. The two methods at point of slaughter will first be illustrated, and then pre-slaughter methods relating to the restraint of the animal prior to slaughter will be compared and contrasted. Ultimately, these comparisons will answer the question: is commercial captive bolt stunning more humane than the practice of halal style slaughter? Several physiological indicators such as <b>bleed-out</b> rate, sentience at point of slaughter, and time to collapse among others will be examined and compared between the two methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of pre-slaughter electrical stunning techniques and slaughter without stunning on bleeding efficiency and shelf life of chevon during a 14 d postmortem aging were assessed. Thirty two Boer crossbred bucks {{were randomly assigned}} to four slaughtering techniques viz slaughter without stunning (SWS), low frequency head-only electrical stunning (LFHO; 1 A for 3 s at a frequency of 50 Hz), low frequency head-to-back electrical stunning (LFHB; 1 A for 3 s at a frequency of 50 Hz) and high frequency head-to-back electrical stunning (HFHB; 1 A for 3 s at a frequency of 850 Hz). The SWS, LFHO and HFHB goats had higher (p< 0. 05) blood loss and lower residual hemoglobin in muscle compared to LFHB. The LFHB meat had higher (p< 0. 05) TBARS value than other treatments on d 7 and 14 d postmortem. Slaughtering methods had no effect on protein oxidation. Higher bacterial counts were observed in LFHB meat compared to those from SWS, LFHO and HFHB after 3 d postmortem. Results indicate that the low <b>bleed-out</b> in LFHB lowered the lipid oxidative stability and microbiological quality of chevon during aging...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric {{properties}} of polyurethanes containing poly(propylene oxide) (PO) and poly(ethylene oxide) (EO) units are discussed, {{along with the}} results of direct current (DC) measurements and broadband electrical spectroscopy (BES) studies. The dielectric {{properties of}} polyether-containing polyurethanes (PUs) are compared to those of PUs containing 1000 ppm of ionic liquids (ILs) as antistatic agents. The eﬀects of the chemical environment of these ILs, including anion-fixed polymers (PU-AF), cation-fixed polymers (PU-CF), and a simple mixture of IL with the PUs (PU-IL), are compared and discussed on the basis of ion mobility. DC measurements suggest that the charge current is attributed not only to the electrode polarization but also to continuous dielectric relaxation. BES studies elucidate that both fast and slow relaxations are taking place in EO-rich domains in pristine PU and PU-AF. The activation energies of the slow relaxation and of the ionic conductivity are similar, suggesting that the ionic conductivity of these materials is attributed to the ion exchange reaction in EO/ion complexes. In contrast, only fast relaxations are observed in the domains mostly comprised of ion-depleted EO in the PUs containing ‘‘free’’ anions, i. e., PU-CF and PU-IL. This suggests that [Tf 2 N] ligands are weakly interacting with the EO chains and contribute eﬀectively to the ion conduction. Thus, enhanced ionic conductivity is observed in PU-CF and PU-IL, yielding suﬃcient antistatic eﬀects. Taking into account its long shelf life, arising from the lack of IL <b>bleed-out,</b> PU-CF is concluded to be the most promising candidate...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis :Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{intracellular}} signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases, play a pivotal role in the activation of the inflammatory response. We hypothesized that administration of a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, PD 98059, at the end of resuscitation following severe hemorrhagic shock can reduce the plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and hepatocellular damage. Design Prospective controlled animal study. Setting Medical school 9 ̆ 6 affiliated university hospital. Interventions Male Sprague-Dawley (275 - 325 g) rats underwent laparotomy (ie, soft tissue trauma) and were then bled to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg for approximately 90 minutes. The animals were then resuscitated with 4 times the <b>bleed-out</b> volume using Ringer lactate solution for 60 minutes. PD 98059, an inhibitor of extracellular signal 9 ̆ 6 regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 (750 mmol/L), or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide and isotonic sodium chloride solution) was administered intravenously as a bolus at the end of resuscitation. Main Outcome Measures At 24 hours after resuscitation or sham operation, plasma levels of IL- 6 and -glutathione S-transferase were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Moreover liver sections were stained with monoclonal antibody against the phosphorylated form of ERKs. Results: At 24 hours following trauma hemorrhage and resuscitation, plasma levels of IL- 6 and -glutathione S-transferase were markedly elevated. Administration of PD 98059, however, reduced levels to sham values. Moreover, liver expression of phosphorylated ERKs was found in the cytosol and nuclear compartment of hepatocytes only following trauma hemorrhage. Conclusion :Administration of PD 98059 (ie, inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways) may represent a feasible approach to blunt the inflammatory response and improve outcome following traumatic injuries and hemorrhagic shock...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the influence of conventional and Kosher slaughter techniques in cattle on carcass and meat quality parameters. The conventional slaughter was done using a pneumatic captive bolt gun to stun the animals before sticking, while Kosher slaughter was done by sticking the animals and then stunning them with a 0. 22 calibre cash special captive bolt gun, 20 seconds later. The animals (n= 311) were randomly assigned into 4 treatment groups, namely; slaughter method (SM) (main group, sub-divided into: conventional slaughter technique (CST) and Kosher slaughter technique (KST)); electrical stimulation (ES), sub-divided into: electrically stimulated (ES) and non-stimulated (NES); gender (G), sub-divided into: male (M) and female (F); fat code (FC), sub-divided into: FC- 2 and FC- 3 (i. e. lean to medium fatness). The quality attributes evaluated were blood loss (BL), drip loss (DL), cooking loss (CL), presence of blood in the trachea (BLT), blood splash in the lungs (BS), shear force (SF), colour (L*, a* and b*), pH and temperature profile over 24 hours and the effect of subcutaneous fat thickness (SCF). Animals were mainly steers in the “A” age group with an average slaughter weight of about 400 kg. Different crossbreeds of Bonsmara, Brahman and Nguni cattle were used, which is typical of cattle slaughtered in South Africa. Blood loss, blood in trachea and blood splash were evaluated using 311 animals (CST, n= 141; KST, n= 170) but for the other parameters, smaller numbers were used because of the hectic nature of the trials. Evaluation of BL, BLT and BS were done in the abattoir and pH and temperature readings were also taken at 45 mins, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hrs post-mortem between the 10 th and 11 th rib on the m. longissimus dorsi which was where the carcasses were sampled for the meat quality analyses. The results of this study revealed that there was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in % blood loss between the conventional and the Kosher group but the conventionally slaughtered group had a slightly higher <b>bleed-out.</b> Fat code had a significant (p= 0. 0475) influence on %BL, with FC- 2 (2. 42 %) group bleeding out slightly more than FC- 3 (2. 24 %). For % drip loss, there were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between all the treatment groups except for fat code (p= 0. 0242), with FC- 3 (2. 95 %) samples exuding more water than FC- 2 (2. 42 %) meat samples. In terms of % cooking loss, there was a significant difference (p= 0. 0004) between the slaughter methods, with meat samples from the conventional method (22. 11 %) exuding more water than the meat from Kosher group (18. 16 %). For blood in trachea, there was a highly significant difference (p 0. 05) in all the treatments save for fat code, with FC- 3 group (6. 38) having thicker fat cover (p= 0. 0004) than FC- 2 (4. 44) which was anticipated. In terms of colour, there was a significant difference (p< 0. 0001) between slaughter methods for the L* value (lightness). Meat samples from the Kosher-killed animals (46. 08) were lighter than the conventionally killed ones (35. 40). Samples from the females (48. 29) were also significantly lighter (p= 0. 0057) than the males’ (37. 79). For a* value (redness), there was a significant difference (p< 0. 0001) between the slaughter methods. The conventional group meat (15. 58), were redder than the Kosher meat (10. 40). Gender effect was also significant (p< 0. 05), with meat from the males (13. 81) appearing redder than the females’ (11. 25). For b* value (yellowness), significant difference (p< 0. 0001) was also found between the slaughter methods. The Kosher meat samples (- 6. 49) appeared yellower than those from conventional slaughter (0. 26). FC- 3 samples (- 2. 36) were also significantly (p= 0. 0112) yellower than the FC- 2 samples (- 3. 05). For pH, analyses revealed a significant difference (p< 0. 0380) at 45 minutes post-mortem (pm) between slaughter methods. The kosher carcasses (pH= 6. 43) had a slightly higher pH compared to the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (6. 33). The ES carcasses (pH= 6. 16) also had a significantly lower (p< 0. 0001) pH compared to the NES carcasses (pH= 6. 89). At 3 hrs pm, only electrical stimulation showed a significant influence (p< 0. 0001). The ES carcasses (pH= 5. 72) were lower than the NES group (pH= 6. 49). At 6 hrs, only electrical stimulation still showed a significant influence (p< 0. 0001), with the ES carcasses (5. 56) still having a faster decline compared to the NES group (pH= 6. 01). At 12 hrs, the ES group (pH= 5. 61) still had a significantly (p= 0. 0008) lower pH than the NES group (pH= 5. 82). At 24 hrs, only the slaughter method showed a significant influence (p= 0. 0314) in carcass pH, with the Kosher carcasses (pH= 5. 53) having a slightly lower pH compared to the conventionally slaughtered ones (pH= 5. 56). The latter difference is probably not of any practical significance and could be ignored. Temperature at 45 minutes pm showed a significant difference (p= 0. 0248) between the slaughter methods with the carcasses from Kosher slaughter (36. 500 C) having a slightly lower temperature compared to those slaughtered conventionally (37. 220 C). At 3 hrs pm, the carcasses from Kosher slaughter (30. 060 C) had a significantly higher (p= 0. 0005) temperature than the conventional group (27. 050 C). The female carcasses (31. 260 C) also had significantly higher (p< 0. 05) temperature compared to the male carcasses (27. 890 C). The FC- 2 carcasses (28. 190 C) also had a significantly lower temperature (p= 0. 0149) compared to FC- 3 (30. 110 C) which was anticipated due to lower temperature decline in those with lower subcutaneous fat. At 6 hrs pm, the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (14. 710 C) still showed a significantly faster decline (p< 0. 0001) compared to those slaughtered by Kosher (20. 16). FC- 2 carcasses also showed a significantly (p= 0. 0104) lower temperature (16. 680 C) compared to FC- 3 (18. 740 C). At 12 hrs pm, the conventionally slaughtered carcasses (4. 720 C) still had a significantly (p< 0. 0001) lower temperature compared to the Kosher group (10. 240 C). The FC- 2 group (6. 690 C) also had a significantly (p= 0. 0011) lower temperature compared to the FC- 3 group (8. 890 C). Finally at 24 hrs after slaughter, slaughter method still showed a highly significant influence (p< 0. 0001) with the conventionally slaughtered carcasses having a much lower temperature (- 0. 420 C) compared to the Kosher group (3. 060 C). The male’ carcasses (0. 620 C) also had significantly lower (p< 0. 05), ultimate temperature compared to carcasses from the females (2. 990 C). There was also a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the fat codes, with the FC- 2 carcasses (1. 010 C) showing a lower temperature, compared to the FC- 3 (1. 710 C) carcasses.
