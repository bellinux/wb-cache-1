40|$|Computations {{have been}} {{performed}} on the bleed slot lip and the test section of the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Wind Tunnel. Separation bubbles on the <b>bleed</b> <b>lip</b> and associated fluctuations induced near the <b>bleed</b> <b>lip</b> were identified as the most likely cause of early transition of the nozzle wall boundary layer, resulting in a noisy test section. The existence of separation bubbles was predicted with high resolution CFD simulations, and a new geometry was designed to eliminate these bubbles. The new geometry was implemented and the maximum quiet stagnation pressure of the tunnel improved from 8 psia to 150 psia. Computations were also run on the test section to determine if expanding the diameter would allow starting larger blunt models with stronger shocks. Several cone sizes were considered, with half-angles ranging from 15 ° to 75 °, and the resulting flowfield was examined to see what effect the shocks and shear layers {{would have on the}} quiet test section flow.

40|$|Background: Cheilitis is {{a common}} problem of unknown etiology. A {{possible}} cause of cheilitis is contact allergy. Drugs, lipsticks, sunblock and toothpaste {{are the most common}} implicated allergens. Allergic contact cheilitis is a chronic superficial inflammatory disorder of the vermilion borders characterized by desquamation due to delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Purpose: We report a management of Allergic contact cheilitis due to lipsticks. Case: A 21 -year-old woman had a history of atopic allergy to eggs, milk, and chicken presented with sore, dry, fissured, scaled and sometimes <b>bleeding</b> <b>lip,</b> over a 3 -month period after application of a lipstick. Her symptoms persisted despite treatments with hydrocortisone cream. The patient provided a detailed history and underwent physical examination and patch tests to cosmetic components and patch test to her own lipstick. The patient had strongly-positive result to the tested lipstick. A diagnosis of allergic contact cheilitis was made based on the history and clinical findings. Case management: Patient was advised to avoid wearing lipstick. To relieve symptoms, treatment was initiated with combined topical corticosteroid, antibiotic, and moisturizer. Conclusion: Contact allergy patients should be tested for both cosmetic component series and their own lipsticks to exclude exfolliative cheilitis, infection, or light actinic cheilitis as causal agents...|$|R

2500|$|Although some dentists advise {{that the}} best {{treatment}} for an avulsed tooth is immediate replantation, {{for a variety of}} reasons this can be difficult for the non-professional person. The teeth are often covered with debris. This debris must be washed off with a physiological solution and not scrubbed. Often multiple teeth are knocked-out and the person will not know which socket an individual tooth belongs to. The injured victim may have other more serious injuries that require more immediate attention or injuries such as a severely lacerated <b>bleeding</b> <b>lip</b> or gum that prevent easy visualization of the socket. Pain may be severe and the person may resist replantation of the teeth. People may, in light of infectious diseases (e.g. HIV), fear handling the teeth or touching the blood associated with them. If immediate replantation is not possible, the teeth should be placed in an appropriate storage solution and brought to a dentist who can then replant them. The dentist will clean the socket, wash the teeth if necessary, and replant them into their sockets. He will splint them to non-knocked-out teeth for a maximum of two weeks for teeth with normal alveolar process and bone support. Properly handled, even replantation of periodontally compromised permanent teeth in older patients under good maintenance have been reported, with splinting extending for over 4 weeks due to the reduced support structure for the root due to periodontal disease. [...] One week to ten days after the replantation, the dental pulps of the replanted teeth should be removed and a root canal treatment completed within two months.|$|R

5000|$|Evidence {{presented}} in the McCabe court martial {{can be divided into}} four broad categories: video testimony from al-Isawi as the alleged victim, direct testimony from DeMartino regarding the alleged assault, testimony and character evidence from SEAL team members and other witnesses, and medical evidence. al-Isawi's recorded testimony was played for the court first, in which he alleged that [...] "while handcuffed and blindfolded, he was kicked in the abdomen and fell to the floor ... and then kicked several more times while on the floor." [...] During the video playback, the defence used an easel to present what it described as inconsistencies in al-Isawis testimony. Evidence was then submitted of al-Isawis suspected involvement in the Fallujah killings, and testimony presented that he was [...] "believed to have killed hundreds of Iraqis" [...] and earned the nickname [...] "The Finisher" [...] amongst Iraqis, for his reputedly having [...] "the decapitated bodies of his victims delivered to their families' doorsteps." [...] The detachment officer-in-charge, the direct commander of both McCabe and DeMartino, testified for the government under a grant of immunity that he observed blood on al-Isawi's lip. Under cross-examination by the defense, he suggested that al-Isawi was [...] "hamming it up" [...] and faking injuries, and said the detainee [...] "sucked on the sore in his mouth to mix blood in with his saliva and spit it out after he heard Iraqi voices"; an oral surgeon confirmed that the blood may have come from biting a mouth ulcer. [...] At the Huertas court-martial, photographs of al-Isawi's [...] "face and body taken in the days immediately after the alleged attack" [...] were {{presented in}} evidence, and showed [...] "a visible cut inside his lip but no obvious signs of bruising or injuries anywhere else." [...] Consequently, with the claim of repeated kicks unsupported by physical evidence and the testimony that the <b>bleeding</b> <b>lip</b> may have been self-inflicted, both the defense and some subsequent commentary argued that al-Isawi was following the directions in the al-Qaeda manual to claim mistreatment.|$|R
6000|$|And Harrison went in, in such {{fashion that}} no man {{who saw him}} do it will ever forget it. Crab Wilson, as game as a pebble, met him with a flush hit every time, but no human {{strength}} or human science seemed capable of stopping the terrible onslaught of this iron man. Round after round he scrambled his way in, slap-bang, right and left, every hit tremendously sent home. Sometimes he covered his own face with his left, and sometimes he disdained to use any guard at all, but his springing hits were irresistible. The rain lashed down upon them, pouring from their faces and running in crimson trickles over their bodies, but neither gave any heed to it save to manoeuvre always with the view of bringing it in to each other's eyes. But round after round the west-countryman fell, and round after round the betting rose, until the odds were higher in our favour than ever they had been against us. With a sinking heart, filled with pity and admiration for these two gallant men, I longed that every bout might be the last, and yet the [...] "Time!"

Such a spectacle may brutalize those who are brutal, but I say that there is a spiritual side to it also, and that the sight of the utmost human limit of endurance and courage is one which bears a lesson of its own.|$|R

40|$|Oral sex is {{commonly}} practiced by sexually active male-female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents. The various type of oral sex practices are fellatio, cunnilingus and analingus. Oral sex is infrequently examined {{in research on}} adolescents; oral sex can transmit oral, respiratory, and genital pathogens. Oral health has {{a direct impact on}} the transmission of infection; a cut in your mouth, <b>bleeding</b> gums, <b>lip</b> sores or broken skin increases chances of infection. Although oral sex is considered a low risk activity, it is important to use protection and safer sex precautions. There are various methods of preventing infection during oral sex such as physical barriers, health and medical issues, ethical issues and oral hygiene and dental issues. The lesions or unhealthy periodontal status of oral cavity accelerates the phenomenon of transmission of infections into the circulation. Thus consequences of unhealthy or painful oral cavity are significant and oral health should be given paramount importance for the practice of oral sex...|$|R
60|$|Alford {{turned his}} eyes to the {{interior}} of the smoker, which, except for two or three dozing commuters and a noisy euchre-party, had been empty of everything but the fumes and stale odors of tobacco, and found it swarming with visions, the eidolons of everything he remembered from his past life. Whatever had once strongly impressed itself upon his nerves was reported there again as instantly as he thought of it. It was largely a whirling chaos, a kaleidoscopic jumble of facts; but from time to time some more memorable and important experience visualized itself alone. Such was the death-bed of the little sister whom he had been wakened, a child, to see going to heaven, as they told him. Such was the pathetic, foolish face of the girl whom long ago he had made believe he cared for, and then had abruptly broken with: he saw again, with heartache, her silly, tender amaze when {{he said he was going}} away. Such was the look of mute astonishment, of gentle reproach, in the eyes of the friend, now long dead, whom in a moment of insensate fury he had struck on the mouth, and who put his hand to his <b>bleeding</b> <b>lips</b> as he bent that gaze of wonder and bewilderment upon him. But it was not alone the dreadful impressions that reported themselves. There were others, as vivid, which came back in the original joyousness: the face of his mother looking up at him from the crowd on a day of college triumph when he was delivering the valedictory of his class; the collective gayety of the whole table on a particularly delightful evening at his dining-club; his own image in the glass as he caught sight of it on coming home accepted by the woman who afterwards jilted him; the transport which lighted up his father's visage when he stepped ashore from the vessel which had been rumored lost, and he could be verified by the senses as still alive; the comical, bashful ecstasy of the good fellow, his ancient chum, in telling him he had had a son born the night before, and the mother was doing well, and how he laughed and danced, and skipped into the air.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Stevens-Johnson {{syndrome}} (SJS) is {{a life-threatening}} dermatosis characterized by epidermal sloughing and stomatitis. We report {{the case of}} a 7 -year-old boy in whom laser phototherapy (LPT) was highly effective in reversing the effects of an initial episode of SJS that had apparently developed in association with treatment with phenobarbital for a seizure disorder. The patient was first seen {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) of our institution with fever, cutaneous lesions on his extremities, trunk, face, and neck; mucosal involvement of his genitalia and eyes (conjunctivitis); ulcerative intraoral lesions; and swollen, crusted, and <b>bleeding</b> <b>lips.</b> He reported severe pain at the sites of his intraoral and skin lesions and was unable to eat, speak, swallow, or open his mouth. Materials and Methods: Trying to prevent and minimize secondary infections, gastric problems, pain, and other complications, the patient was given clindamycin, ranitidine, dipyrone, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) drops, and morphine. In addition, he was instructed to use bicarbonate solution and Ketoconazole (Xylogel) in the oral cavity. Because of the lack of progress of the patient, the LPT was selected. Results: At 5 days after the initial session of LPT, the patient was able to eat gelatin, and on the following day, the number and severity of his intraoral lesions and his labial crusting and swelling had diminished. By 6 days after his initial session of LPT, most of the patient's intraoral lesions had disappeared, and the few that remained were painless; the patient was able to eat solid food by himself and was removed from the ICU. Ten sessions of LPT were conducted in the hospital. The patient underwent three further and consecutive sessions at the School of Dentistry, when complete healing of his oral lesions was observed. Conclusion: The outcome in this case suggests that LPT may be a new adjuvant modality for SJS complications.
