5|$|Having {{pushed the}} Crusaders out {{of most of}} Syria, the Ayyubids {{generally}} adopted a policy of peace with them. The war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with European states. This led to fruitful interaction between <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.|$|E
5|$|Ships were {{sometimes}} camouflaged in classical times. Mediterranean pirate ships {{were sometimes}} painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout ships were painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. Ships were sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|The first fleet battle, and {{the first}} ocean battle, {{involving}} ironclad warships was the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Waged between the Austrian and Italian navies, the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the largest naval battle between the battles of Navarino and Tsushima.|$|E

5|$|The game {{kicked off}} on January 1, 1947 at Kidd Field in El Paso, Texas in {{freezing}} temperatures. Defense dominated on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> {{the first half}} due to the weather and tough play. Neither team scored, but Virginia Tech had the best chance—driving to a first down inside the Cincinnati two-yard line in the first quarter. The Cincinnati defense held, however, and the game went into halftime scoreless.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} {{provoked a}} response from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the conflict. U.S. commanders broadcast radio messages and dropped leaflets demanding the senior North Korean commanders {{be held responsible for}} the atrocity. The North Korean commanders, concerned about the way their soldiers were treating prisoners of war, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. Memorials were later constructed on Hill 303 by troops at nearby Camp Carroll, to honor the victims of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, navies across Europe {{had adopted}} ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles {{using the new}} ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of Gloire and Warrior. The use of ironclads by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence {{on the development of}} ironclad design.|$|E
5000|$|Conversely, if the {{derivative}} of f {{at a point}} is zero ( [...] is a stationary point), one cannot in general conclude anything about the local behavior of f - it may increase {{to one side and}} decrease to the other (as in [...] ), increase to <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> (as <b>in</b> [...] ), decrease to <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> (as <b>in</b> [...] ), or behave in more complicated ways, such as oscillating (as in , as discussed below).|$|R

5|$|Chelsea {{qualified}} for the 2005 FA Community Shield as winners of the 2004–05 FA Premier League. It was their first league title in 50 years, remembered for the records broken such as the most wins, fewest goals conceded in a league season and most points accumulated. The other Community Shield place went to Arsenal, who beat Manchester United on penalties to win {{the final of the}} 2004–05 FA Cup. Arsenal was making its 19th Community Shield appearance and held the Shield after beating Manchester United 3–1 a year previously. By contrast this was Chelsea's fifth appearance, their first since 2000. It was also the first meeting between <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the Shield.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> <b>In</b> 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the area.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were heavy}} {{casualties}} on <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> and although [...] "both claimed victory ... both suffered defeats". It {{resulted in a}} stalemate, with <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> digging <b>in,</b> creating elaborate trench systems.|$|R

5|$|Fortune, the 23rd ship of {{that name}} in the Royal Navy, was laid down by John Brown & Company at their Clydebank {{shipyard}} on 27 July 1933. She was launched on 29 August 1934 and completed on 27 April 1935. The ship cost 247,564 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Fortune was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but detached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1937 to enforce the arms embargo imposed on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish Civil War by the Non-Intervention Committee. The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months {{before the start of}} World War II.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} a deputy in the {{legislature}} of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, during the presidency of Arturo Frondizi, and a national deputy during the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. He opposed {{both sides of the}} Dirty War, and several times filed a writ of Habeas corpus, requesting the freedom of victims of forced disappearances, during the National Reorganization Process. He denounced the crimes of the military dictatorship of other countries, and opposed the actions of <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the Falklands War as well. He became the leader of the UCR after Balbín's death, and was the Radical candidate for the presidency in the 1983 elections, which he won.|$|E
5|$|In 580, Hormizd IV {{abolished}} the Caucasian Iberian monarchy, and turned Iberia into a Persian province {{ruled by a}} marzpan (governor). During the 580s, the war continued inconclusively with victories on <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> <b>In</b> 582, Maurice won a battle at Constantia over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general did not follow up his victory; he had to hurry to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions. Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate.|$|E

Finucane {{attempted}} to fly back to England across the English Channel but was forced to ditch into the sea and subsequently vanished. After his death, Finucane's brother Raymond served in No. 101 Squadron RAF and survived the war. Brendan's nephew was the Northern Ireland solicitor Pat Finucane, who during The Troubles, defended <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> legal cases, winning human rights actions brought action the British government, he would be murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries acting in collusion with the British government intelligence service MI5 in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The buttons worn on the Infantryman's {{clothing}} {{is not as}} minor a detail as it would sound. The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State buttons. This would indicate to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The father {{panel is}} {{signed and dated}} on <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>in</b> {{what may be the}} oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d. However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E

5|$|The two-storied {{structure}} is rectangular in plan. The portico has four Ionic columns with fluted stems and cabbage leaf capitals. The front gables {{of the building}} have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The {{lower part of the}} exterior walls are made of plastered brick. The upper windows have semi-circular French windows, with pilasters on <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> <b>In</b> 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace's walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer's club.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight {{alongside}} the French {{in the name of}} the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> Paris. The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons. Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.|$|E
5|$|Although William's {{supporters}} now {{dominated the}} government and parliament, there remained significant pockets of Scottish support for James, a movement which became known as Jacobitism, from the Latin (Jacobus) for James. This was especially strong among the clergy and gentry who lost out with the abolition of Episcopacy in the Church of Scotland and in certain Highland clans. It's hard to be definitive on the extent or make up since clan loyalties or feuds were often as important as religion or attachment to the Stuarts; this included generalised hostility between Lowlanders and Highlanders, specific feuds (Campbells and McDonald's) or differences within branches of the same clan; Gordons and Fletchers fought on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>in</b> 1715 and 1745. In addition, the Stuart monarchy only ended {{with the death of}} Queen Anne in 1714, so until then, supporting the Stuarts was not necessarily the same as being a Jacobite.|$|E
