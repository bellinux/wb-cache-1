40|$|Objective: To perform {{phytochemical}} analyses on {{the leaves}} of Ocimum basilicum L. (O. basilicum), to elucidate the structure of isolate and then perform the antisickling activity on the crude extract and on the isolate. Methods: The Emmel test performed on the acidified methanolic extract of this plant {{was used to evaluate}} the antisickling activity. The structure characterization of the active compound was performed using chromatographic techniques for the separation and the spectroscopic ones for structure elucidation (1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, COSY, HMBC). Results: The chemical screening on the crude extract revealed the presence of polyphenols (flavonoids, anthocyanins, leucoanthocyanins, tannins, quinones) alkaloids, saponins, triterpenoids and steroids. The obtained extract after evaporation yielded 34. 50 g (11. 5 %) out of 300 g of powdered leaves of O. basilicum. The acidified methanolic extract and <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> showed an interesting antisickling activity. Conclusions: The acidified methanolic extract and <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> from O. basilicum displayed a good antisickling activity. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} to report the antisickling activity of this compound in this plant.

40|$|Water-in-oil {{emulsions}} of metabolizable {{fatty acid}} esters, with the non-toxic surfactant Pluronic L 122 as emulsifying agent, potentiated the humoral response to bovine serum albumin and staphylococcal toxoid in the mouse. Adjuvant activity was increased {{by changing the}} chemical nature of the esters as follows: (i) using a series of ethyl esters, adjuvant activity appeared when the acyl chain length of the fatty acid component was 16 or greater; (ii) isobutyl and isopropyl esters of palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) were superior to ethyl; (iii) the ethyl esters of oleic (C 18 : 1) and linoleic (C 18 : 2) acids were better than stearic (C 18 : 0). Since emulsions prepared with longer chain saturated esters are very viscous or solid at room temperature, and unsaturated esters are chemically reactive, emulsions were prepared with differing proportions of ethyl caprate (C 10 : 0) and <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate.</b> At a ratio of 9 : 1 the emulsions possessed the low viscosity of ethyl caprate, but gained the adjuvant activity of <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate.</b> 125 I-labelled BSA was retained in the footpad to a significantly greater extent than with a caprate emulsion, but reasons are given for believing that slow release of antigen {{is not the only}} mechanism of adjuvant activity.

30|$|Several {{managing}} SCD {{therapy strategies}} {{have been proposed}} including the bone marrow transplantation, gene therapy, repeated blood transfusions and treatment with hydroxyurea. However, some of these treatments are ineffective or very expensive for the less fortunate African populations, or may constitute a risk of HIV/AIDS infections [4, 15, 16]. Recently, several studies have reported the use of medicinal plants {{for the treatment of}} SCD [17, 18, 19, 20]. In DR Congo, Mpiana and coworkers reported that more than 70 medicinal plant species used in folk medicine for the treatment of SCD display in vitro anti-sickling activity [6, 12, 13, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24]. The bioactivity of these plants is usually due to the presence of anthocyanins, organic acids or <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> [2, 4, 6, 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhase change {{material}} (PCM) {{can store}} and release heat {{within a certain}} temperature range during the phase transitions. Compared with sensible heat material, latent heat phase change material (PCM) is very attractive, because of its high-energy storage density and isothermal behavior during the phase change process. This paper attempts to research the application of PCM in Chinese style solar greenhouse. The PCM we used is <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> with the phase change temperature about 18 °C, and spinach of F 1 from Italy is chosen to be the test plant. The research is a contrast test with the same two greenhouse models, one is installed with PCM {{and the other is}} not. By recording the temperature with T type thermocouples on the different set-points and observing the growth situation of the plants in two greenhouses, we can recognize the effect of the PCM on the thermal environment of greenhouse...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermal mass}} of {{concrete}} within a building {{can be used}} as an energy storage system and hence reduce the demand on the auxiliary heating and cooling systems in the building. The heat storage capacity of concrete can be enhanced by adding phase change materials (PCMs) which provide a high latent heat storage capacity. However the addition of PCM to concrete reduces the conductivity of the concrete due to the low conductivity of the PCMs. This hinders the efficient utilisation of the additional heat storage capacity provided by the PCM. It is generally understood that the use of ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) as a partial cement replacement results in a denser cement paste which, for a given aggregate type, increases the conductivity of the concrete. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if the use of GGBS influences the thermal mass behaviour of a PCM-concrete. Two types of PCM-concrete panels were manufactured. Firstly microencapsulated paraffin was added to fresh concrete during the mixing process. Secondly <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> was vacuum impregnated into lightweight aggregate which was then included in the concrete mix. Half of the samples contained 50 % GGBS cement replacement and consequently the effect of GGBS on the thermal performance is reporte...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how different decreasing of pH regimes during microencapsulation process with melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin affects the composition, morphology and thermal stability of microcapsules containing a phase-change material (PCM). Technical <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> was used as PCM. Microencapsulation was carried out at 70 °C. For all experiments the starting pH value was 6. 0. After one hour of microencapsulation at the starting pH value, the pH value was lowered to final pH value (5. 5; 5. 0; 4. 5) in a stepwise or linear way. The properties of microcapsules were monitored during and after the microencapsulation process. The results showed that pH value decreasing regime was critical for the morphology and stability of microcapsules. During microencapsulations with a stepwise decrease of pH value we observed faster increase of the amount of MF resin in the microencapsulation product compared to the microencapsulations with a linear pH value decrease. However, faster deposition in the case of microencapsulations with stepwise decrease of pH value did not result in thicker MF shells. The shell thickness increased much faster when the pH value was decreased in a linear way or in several smaller steps. It was shown that for the best thermal stability of microcapsules, the pH value during microencapsulation had to be lowered in a linear way or in smaller steps to 5. 0 or lower...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermal mass {{indicates}} {{the ability of}} a material to store and release heat and {{is a function of the}} heat storage capacity of a material. The thermal mass of construction materials can be used to reduce the energy required for heating and cooling buildings. The heat storage capacity of concrete can be increased by incorporating phase change materials (PCMs) into the concrete and hence providing additional latent heat storage capacity. Research was carried out to compare the thermal behaviour of two different types of PCM/concrete composite panels. The first type of panel was formed by adding microencapsulated paraffin to fresh concrete during the mixing process. The second panel was formed by vacuum impregnating <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> into lightweight aggregate which was then included in the concrete mix. This study aimed to establish which type of PCM/concrete composite material was most effective at improving the thermal mass behaviour of the panel and also to evaluate the effect that the PCM had on the relevant properties of concrete. The panels were exposed to radiative heat energy in a controlled environment for a specified time period during which the surface and internal temperatures of the panel were recorded. The temperature data together with the measured density and thermal conductivity was used to evaluate and compare the thermal mass behaviour of each type of PCM/concrete composite material. The addition of PCM to the concrete significantly increased the overall thermal storage capacity of the concrete despite reducing the density and thermal conductivity of the concrete. It was determined that the concrete containing the lightweight aggregate/PCM was more effective at increasing the thermal storage capacity up to a depth of 100 mm...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{practical}} approach to store energy in building materials by incorporating Phase Change Materials (PCMs) into their structures. The intend of this present work is to address this achievement. Concrete blocks (both regular and autoclaved), the widely used construction material, were selected as ideal candidate for the experimental evaluation. Followed by previous laboratory work, both <b>Butyl</b> <b>Stearate</b> (BS) and Paraffin (PAR) were selected as PCM {{due to the fact}} that they are representing the lower and higher melting temperature ranges. The weight percentages vary with different PCMs and the types of block; furthermore, the adopted incorporating technique is by immersing. The experimental studies were conducted in a thermally insulated wooden box. Twelve identical blocks were laid contiguously to allow continuous air flow through the tunnels formed by their hollow cores. In addition, their temperatures were recorded by digital data logger. Heating and cooling cycle were provided by two sets of microcomputer controlled air conditioning systems. Three different heating and cooling temperature ranges were applied on different combinations. The mean air flow velocities were also set between 2 to 3 m/s. The results showed that: (1) Paraffin impregnated autoclaved blocks (AP) present the highest total storable heat to storable sensible heat in block ratio; (2) the appropriate heating and cooling temperature ranges should be set according to the melting and freezing points of the PCM; (3) it is possible to predict the required charging and discharging time for a designated heating and cooling process. The results exhibited the concept of latent heat storage in concrete blocks is workable and that a higher amount of heat can be stored...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{carry out}} a phyto-chemical {{characterization}} of essential oil from Ocimum basilicum L. (O.  basilicum) harvested in DR Congo and to assess the antioxidant potential of crude extracts {{with respect to the}} polarity for comparison reason. MethodsThe phyto-chemical characterization of essential oil produced by hydro-distillation was performed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis and the antioxidant potential evaluation by in vitro 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity method. ResultsA previously weighed amount of fresh leaves of O.  basilicum produced 0. 65 % of essential oil that led to the identification of a set of 84. 44 % out of 99. 98 % as major compounds (> 1. 5 %). The chemo-type of this essential oil was linalool-methyl chavicol. Chemical components of oil were characterized by oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons (46. 00 %) and oxygenated monoterpenes (26. 75 %). With respect to the amount of components, methyl chavicol also known as estragole (35. 72 %) constituted the very large quantity afterward linalool (21. 25 %) and then epi-α-cadinol (8. 02 %), α-bergamotene (6. 56 %), eugenol (4. 60 %), 1, 8 -cineole (4. 04 %), germacrene D (2. 06 %), thymol (1. 64 %), and (E) -citral (1. 55 %), respectively. Essential oil exhibited antioxidant potential and IC 50  = (1. 180  ±  0. 015)  mg/mL. Non-polar crude extracts yields were low compared to the one of polar extracts. Only methanol and ethyl acetate had considerably manifested antioxidant potential with IC 50 values equal to (0. 025  ±  0. 013)  mg/mL and (0. 085  ±  0. 012)  mg/mL, respectively. As concerns to IC 50 values, essential oil was less active than methanol and ethyl acetate extracts. The methanol crude extract exhibited the highest activity. Non-polar extracts showed insignificant radical scavenging ability that did not allow assessing IC 50 values. These results highlighted the occurrence of antioxidant potential compounds in polar media. ConclusionsEssential oil and crude extracts of O.  basilicum growing in DR Congo can be advocated as natural sources of antioxidant potential compounds not only in food but also in pharmaceutical industries. The high antioxidant potential of polar crude extracts highlights antioxidant character of its composition particularly <b>butyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and rosmarinic acid we isolated and identified, respectively in the methanol crude extract...|$|E
