5000|$|... <b>bottom</b> <b>pull</b> : Commonly used on {{road and}} touring bikes, {{this type of}} {{derailleur}} is actuated by a cable pulling downwards. The cable is often routed across the top or {{along the bottom of}} the bottom bracket shell on a cable guide, which redirects the cable up the lower edge of the frame's down tube. Full-suspension mountain bikes often have <b>bottom</b> <b>pull</b> routing as the rear suspension prevents routing via the top tube.|$|E
5000|$|... {{combination}} of both (dual pull): There are some derailleurs available that have provisions for either top pull or <b>bottom</b> <b>pull,</b> {{and can be used}} in either application.|$|E
50|$|Outfall {{materials}} include polyethylene, stainless steel, carbon steel, glass-reinforced plastic, reinforced concrete, {{cast iron}} or tunnels through rock. Common installation methods for pipelines are float and sink, <b>bottom</b> <b>pull</b> and top pull.|$|E
6000|$|And {{he waved}} his hand round and round, over and under the slowly sinking glass. Finally he took it by the <b>bottom,</b> <b>pulled</b> it down and placed it very {{carefully}} on the table. [...] "Eh?" [...] he said to me, and laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know why}} not, Esther. If {{you were living}} in an {{unfinished}} house, liable to have the roof put on or taken off--to be from top to <b>bottom</b> <b>pulled</b> down or built up--to-morrow, next day, next week, next month, next year--you would {{find it hard to}} rest or settle. So do I. Now? There's no now for us suitors." ...|$|R
5000|$|Two way {{open-ended}} zippers Instead {{of having}} an insertion pin and pin box at the bottom, a two way open-ended zipper has a puller on {{each end of the}} zipper tape. Someone wearing a garment with this kind of zipper can slide up the <b>bottom</b> <b>puller</b> to accommodate more leg movement without stressing the pin and box of a one-way open-ended zipper. It is most commonly used on long coats.|$|R
6000|$|... "Roughly speaking," [...] said Gibberne, [...] "an {{object in}} these latitudes falls 16 {{feet in the}} first second. This glass is falling 16 feet in a second now. Only, you see, it hasn't been falling yet for the {{hundredth}} part of a second. That gives you {{some idea of the}} pace of my Accelerator." [...] And he waved his hand round and round, over and under the slowly sinking glass. Finally, he took it by the <b>bottom,</b> <b>pulled</b> it down, and placed it very carefully on the table. [...] "Eh?" [...] he said to me, and laughed.|$|R

60|$|Riggs made no reply, {{and went}} on rolling down his {{trousers}} leg, lapped a fold over at the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pulled</b> on his boot. Then he strode out toward the promontory. Half-way there he encountered Anson tramping back.|$|R
5000|$|... 17-year-old, Valerie Smith, newly {{graduated}} from high school, heads off on a road trip to San Francisco with her friend Joleen. They have just started out when Joleen’s car breaks down, but one of Joleen’s friends, Buddy (Sam <b>Bottoms)</b> <b>pulls</b> up and offers to take Valerie {{the rest of the}} way. He is overly familiar; Valerie does not know him and is reluctant to accept the offer, but is ultimately pressured into accepting the ride. Not far into the trip Buddy decides to rob a liquor store and forces Valerie to assist him at gunpoint. The shopkeeper raises the alarm and is shot dead; the police arrive and both Buddy and Valerie are arrested.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly the {{destruction}} of the will, in order that those who destroyed might get possession of property, would be criminal. Well, I don't know; I have thought it over in every sense, and think the balance of probability is against their having destroyed it. In the first place the Miss Penfolds doubtless consider that the will is so securely hidden there is little, if any, chance of its being discovered. That this is so we know, from the fact that although I ransacked the house from top to <b>bottom,</b> <b>pulled</b> down wainscoting, lifted floors, and tried every imaginable point which either I or the men who were working with me suspected to be a likely spot for a hiding-place, we did not succeed in finding it.|$|R
6000|$|... “There is not {{a moment}} to lose,” Will said as he followed, and he at once lifted up the false <b>bottom</b> and <b>pulled</b> out the rope and grapnel. He had knotted the rope about every foot, to assist the {{prisoner}} in climbing, and had covered the iron of the grapnel with strips of flannel {{so that it would}} make no noise when it struck the wall.|$|R
5000|$|Flamingo: Similar to ballet leg {{position}} where <b>bottom</b> leg is <b>pulled</b> into the chest {{so that the}} shin of the bottom leg is touching the knee of the vertical leg, while remaining parallel {{to the surface of}} the water.|$|R
2500|$|The gravestone, {{designed}} by North Snohomish County sculptor Kirk McLean, {{is a tribute}} to Lee and Hutton. Its two twisting rectangles of charcoal granite join at the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pull</b> apart at the top. [...] "It represents Eliza and Brandon, the two of them, and how the tragedy of his death separated their mortal life together", said his mother, Linda Lee Cadwell, who described her son, like his father before him, as a poetic, romantic person.|$|R
5000|$|The rigid arm {{scroll saw}} was popular until the 1970s but {{is no longer}} made. It has a single-piece cast iron frame. The blade is {{attached}} to a pitman arm on the <b>bottom,</b> which <b>pulls</b> the blade down. A spring in the upper arm pulls the blade back up again. This design has a significant weakness in that the tension on the blade changes with every stroke; modern scroll saws are all [...] "constant tension" [...] designs.|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} few days, Mr Hoppy carries out {{the second part of}} his plan. He visits every pet shop in the city, and buys many {{tortoises}} of various sizes, but none that weigh less than 13 ounces. Mr Hoppy brings all the tortoises back to his apartment and installs them in a makeshift corral in his living room. Next, Mr Hoppy builds a special tool to help him snatch the tortoise from Mrs Silver's balcony. He fastens a handle {{to the end of a}} long metal tube, and a tiny claw at the <b>bottom.</b> By <b>pulling</b> the handle, the arms of the claw gently open and close.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Suspended weight showing inertia. The {{weight is}} {{suspended}} on a string, and has another string hanging from it. If the string is pulled quickly, only the bottom string is detached, {{and the weight}} remains hanging because of its inability to react in time (its inertness). If the same <b>bottom</b> string is <b>pulled</b> more slowly, the entire assembly falls down.|$|R
5000|$|Gogoplata [...] - [...] Performed from full guard {{by using}} an omoplata setup to trap the top man's arm, then <b>pulling</b> the <b>bottom</b> man's foot past the top man's head, {{pressing}} the shin of that leg against the throat. The <b>bottom</b> man then <b>pulls</b> on his opponent's head, cutting off the airflow and forcing him to submit or risk passing out from lack of oxygen.|$|R
50|$|The regular pieces drop in {{from the}} top in pairs, with two Ka-Gloms or at minimum a Ka-Glom and a Block. Players can rotate pieces as they drop, and try and combine the colors with other Ka-Gloms on the <b>bottom.</b> Gravity <b>pulls</b> the pieces toward the bottom, and {{increases}} slowly as play proceeds. When four Ka-Gloms of the same color are combined, they explode creating a reaction that explodes all blocks of that same color also. After the explosion, gravity pulls down {{the rest of the}} pieces, and could cause even more exploding Ka-Gloms. The Special pieces drop in one at a time. If a block is placed that extends above the screen, the game ends.|$|R
60|$|She {{pulled at}} the door. It did not budge. It had caught at the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Pulling</b> with all her might proved to be in vain. Pausing, with palms hot and bruised, she heard a louder, closer {{approach}} of the invaders of her home. Fear, wrath, and impotence contested for supremacy over her and drove her to desperation. She was alone here, and she must rely on herself. And as she strained every muscle to move that obstinate door and heard the quick, harsh voices of men {{and the sounds of}} a hurried search she suddenly felt sure that they were hunting for her. She knew it. She did not wonder at it. But she wondered if she were really Madeline Hammond, and if it were possible that brutal men would harm her. Then the tramping of heavy feet {{on the floor of the}} adjoining room lent her the last strength of fear. Pushing with hands and shoulders, she moved the door far enough to permit the passage of her body. Then she stepped up on the sill and slipped through the aperture. She saw no one. Lightly she jumped down and ran in among the bushes. But these did not afford her the cover she needed. She stole from one clump to another, finding too late that she had chosen with poor judgment. The position of the bushes had drawn her closer to the front of the house rather than away from it, and just before her were horses, and beyond a group of excited men. With her heart in her throat Madeline crouched down.|$|R
5000|$|One form, once {{common in}} the Mediterranean Sea area, was [...] "about three to four feet wide and six feet deep (these {{dimensions}} often vary, however), consisting {{of two or three}} wooden planks assembled to one another, of more than four inches wide, in which several hard and cutting flints crammed into the <b>bottom</b> part <b>pull</b> along over the grains. In the rear part there is a large ring nailed, that is used to tie the rope that pulls it and to which two horses are usually harnessed; and a person, sitting on the threshing board, drives it in circles over the cereal that is spread on the threshing floor. Should the person need more weight, he need only put some big stones over it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shade screens utilize acrylic canvas or a mesh fabric, {{which allows}} some view-through while {{blocking}} the sun's rays. The roller {{at the top}} may be hand-cranked or motorized. The fabric is gravity-fed, with a weighted <b>bottom</b> rail <b>pulling</b> the fabric down between guide rails or guy wires. Exterior shades are much more effective at blocking heat than interior shades, since they block the heat before it enters the glass. This style of framed screen is typically done by professional installers, because of the specialized frames and tools required. A recent advancement is frame-less shade screens, which allows a [...] "DIY-er" [...] to install their own exterior shades. Solar shade screens can also be installed {{at the end of}} awnings to provide horizontal shade during early morning or late afternoon sun positions.|$|R
60|$|There was no bucket {{at the end}} of the {{windlass}} chain, {{but there}} was a big hook that at one time was used to hold a bucket. Shaggy let down this hook, dragged it around on the <b>bottom</b> and then <b>pulled</b> it up. An old hoopskirt came with it, and Betsy laughed and threw it away. The thing frightened Hank, who had never seen a hoopskirt before, and he kept a good distance away from it.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{reckless}} deed {{attributed to the}} Bottoms Gang occurred {{on the morning of}} April 14, 1908. Eddie Carroll led a half-dozen of their number to the police's Jefferson Club at dawn. Finding no cops on the premises, the boys broke all the building's windows. At 9 o'clock, the <b>Bottoms</b> gangsters <b>pulled</b> up to St. Louis City Hall's Market Street entrance in an expensive coach. They charged into the building, shouting obscenities while brandishing revolvers and cracking snake whips at passerby. They headed for the office of Lewis Marks, superindentent of the Water Tap and Motor Department. Marks had recently fired Carroll from his cushy job. After seeing that their quarry was gone, Eddie Carroll snarled, [...] "De guy wot we wuz looking for ain't here." [...] The gangsters were arrested soon after while [...] "refueling" [...] at a nearby saloon.|$|R
5000|$|The episode [...] "Prescription for Death" [...] {{establishes}} that Cragen is {{a recovering}} alcoholic. He {{says that his}} drinking problem had become so severe in his early career that Greevey insisted {{he would no longer}} partner with him unless he joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Cragen finally hit rock <b>bottom</b> when he <b>pulled</b> his service revolver on a taxi driver while in a drunken rage; horrified, he quit drinking, joined AA, and has been sober ever since. Nevertheless, he admits that he feels a daily temptation to drink due to the horrors he witnesses on the job.|$|R
60|$|Boarding the sloop, they {{dismantled}} the pumps, {{and then}} found that with these, the lead weights, and the diving helmet, the small dory had a heavy load. The tide was, however, falling, {{and for some}} distance it carried them down a smooth channel between banks of uncovered sand. They had no trouble here, but when they reached open water they found a confused swell running against them. The fog had again thickened and they could see only the gray slopes of water that {{moved out of the}} haze. It was hard work rowing, and care was needed when an undulation curled and broke into a ridge of foam. If that happened before they could avoid it, the dory might be overturned; and the water was icy cold. They toiled across a broad shallow, sounding with the oars, until they lost touch of the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pulled</b> by guess for a spot where landing was safe.|$|R
40|$|We compare how gender {{inequality}} varies by educational {{level in the}} Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States, representing three different welfare regimes: the conservative, the social democratic, and the liberal. With few exceptions, {{gender inequality}} in labor force participation, work hours, occupational segregation, and housework are less severe as education goes up in all three countries, with the root cause being the high employment levels of well-educated women. Despite a common pattern across nations, we note that the educational gradient on gender equality in employment is weaker in Sweden. De-familialization policies in Sweden no doubt increase gender equality at the <b>bottom</b> by <b>pulling</b> less-educated women into the work force. One form of gender equality, wages, however, does not increase with education. In the United States, educational differences in the gender gap in wages are trivial; in Sweden and the Netherlands, the gender wage gap is greatest for the highly educated because of higher returns to education for men than women in these nations...|$|R
50|$|A bell pull is a woven textile, pull cord, handle, knob, {{or other}} object that connects with a bell or bell wire, and which rings a bell when pulled. Bell pulls {{are used to}} summon workers in homes {{of people who have}} butlers, maids or other servants, and often have a tassel at the <b>bottom.</b> The bell <b>pull</b> is one element of a complex {{interior}} mechanical network which typically in Victorian times involved a range of bell pulls in different rooms; moreover, these bell connections link to a central bank of bells in a room where servants would await commands.|$|R
5000|$|... 2) The cheat loop: Take a loop {{of string}} and {{lay it on}} the table. Take the right hand side of the loop and twist it 180 degrees counter-clockwise. Then bring it down and around (clockwise) as before. Again the gap on the right hand side is loose, but now the {{overlapped}} portion on the left hand side is also loose. Additionally, by picking up the <b>bottom</b> string and <b>pulling</b> it through the top string on either side will cause the loop to wrap around the opposite side and hold fast. Thus both sides will hold fast or come loose at the con-artists discretion.|$|R
6000|$|Aubrey had {{recovered}} sufficiently to observe to Blanche, [...] "That {{was almost as}} bad as Ulysses," [...] which, being overheard and repeated, led to the information that he was Ethel's pupil, whereupon Dr. Spencer began to inquire after the school, and to exclaim at his friend for having deserted it {{in the person of}} Tom. Dr. May looked convicted, but said it was all Norman's fault; and Dr. Spencer, shaking his head at Blanche, opined that the young gentleman was a great innovater, and that he was sure he was at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pulling</b> down the Market Cross, and the stopping up Randall's Alley--iniquities of the [...] "nasty people," [...] of which she already had made him aware.|$|R
5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pull</b> it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|R
50|$|From {{a seated}} position, one heel {{is brought to}} press on the {{perineum}} with the {{sole of the foot}} flat against the inner thigh. The body sits on top of this heel. Adjustments are made until the body is comfortable and the pressure is firmly applied. Then the opposite ankle is placed over the first, so the ankle bones are touching and the heels are above one another with the top heel pressing the pubis directly above the genitals. The genitals will then lie in between the two heels. The toes and outer edge of the top foot are pushed down into the space between the calf and thigh muscles. The toes of the <b>bottom</b> foot are <b>pulled</b> up into the similar space on the opposite side. The spine is held erect. A small meditation cushion or zafu is sometimes used to aid vertical back alignment.|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} day it became evident that our journey in the canoes could not last much longer, for the stream was rapidly growing more shallow. Twice in as many hours we stuck upon the <b>bottom.</b> Finally we <b>pulled</b> the boats up among the {{brushwood}} and spent the night {{on the bank of}} the river. In the morning Lord John and I made our way for a couple of miles through the forest, keeping parallel with the stream; but as it grew ever shallower we returned and reported, what Professor Challenger had already suspected, that we had reached the highest point to which the canoes could be brought. We drew them up, therefore, and concealed them among the bushes, blazing a tree with our axes, so that we should find them again. Then we distributed the various burdens among us--guns, ammunition, food, a tent, blankets, and the rest--and, shouldering our packages, we set forth upon the more laborious stage of our journey.|$|R
40|$|Within {{this paper}} a concept for nested control loops for pull methods for the {{material}} planning will be presented. It displays {{which is one}} of the first results out of an ongoing German research project with eleven industrial and science partners. Target of the research project is, to develop methods and tools for the planning, evaluation and monitoring of all resources and components of changeable assembly systems. Special emphasis is placed on material provision and production control. The material provision with pull methods like Kanban is lead by the actual workload and usage of parts and is restricted to a barrier of demand. Higher demand pulls the system empty, lower demand results in unused <b>bottom</b> inventory. Therefore <b>pull</b> methods has to be embedded in control loops. They comprises of demand barriers and alerting rules to indicate emerging needs to change the parameters of the production control. An early alert cockpit supports the control loops...|$|R
