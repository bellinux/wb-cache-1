40|$|Excerpt] When direct subordinated {{employment}} is disguised as self-employment, it is termed ‘bogus’. Work can be contracted {{in several different}} ways. The main distinction remains the one between ‘employment’ and ‘self-employment’: this is a prominent feature in all European legal systems, built around the concepts of ‘subordination’ and ‘autonomy’. Contracting work can therefore be done {{in one of two}} ways: through a commercial relationship/contract, between one client and a self-employed person or entrepreneur through a labour contract, between an employer and a worker/employee. No definition of <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment</b> has yet been agreed at European level. Various definitions have been proposed in several forums. <b>Bogus</b> <b>self-employment</b> refers to self-employed people ‘who declare themselves (or are declared) as self-employed simply to reduce tax liabilities, or employers’ responsibilities’ (OECD, 2000, p. 156). Generally speaking, a person is considered to be in <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment</b> when the characteristics and activities of self-employment (autonomy, tendering for different clients and so on) are limited or non-existent. Thus, bogus self- employment contains features of subordinate employment relationships such as: long-term engagement with a single contractor/work donor/employer lack of control or autonomy over the organisation of work (working time, for example) lack of own resources and equipment. However, the person concerned is bound by a commercial contract instead of a labour contract and therefore does not enjoy the protection and social rights provided by labour laws. <b>Bogus</b> <b>self-employment</b> results in a situation of factual subordination and dependence, which is not recognised legally or institutionally recognised in terms of employment and social rights, nor in terms of employers’ liability and responsibility towards their employees. Thus, workers must comply with employers’ working methods, but are deprived of the various rights associated with employee status (such as severance pay in the case of dismissal, access to unemployment benefits, and health and safety protection) and therefore suffer negative consequences...|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. Governments in Europe and {{elsewhere}} have renewed {{their attention to}} the fiscal regulation of their economies in order to close tax loopholes and boost revenues in response to the financial crisis. The article uses a neo-Polanyian ‘instituted economic process’ approach to explore and explain the uniquely high level of <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment</b> in the UK construction industry, facilitated by confused law and stimulated by a bespoke construction fiscal regime, resulting in endemic tax evasion. It examines how the co-evolution of employment status law and a sector-specific fiscal regime maps tightly onto the emergence of mass self-employment, as evidenced by comparative labour market and sectoral statistics. Seeing competition as an instituted process within these distinctive market arrangements, it identifies a form of ‘degenerative competition’, driving out both genuine direct-employment and self-employment, and driving in <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment,</b> with its attendant substantial fiscal losses, failed skill reproduction and poor productivity...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{recognition}} that <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment</b> is rapidly growing, {{not least because}} of the advent {{of what has been}} called the ‘gig,’ ‘sharing’ or ‘collaborative’ economy, has led governments to search for ways to tackle this form of dependent self-employment that is widely viewed as diminishing the quality of working conditions. Until now, however, there have been few ex-post evaluations of policy initiatives that seek to tackle this phenomenon. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} provide one of the first ex-post evaluations by examining the outcomes of a 2016 legislative initiative in Romania to tackle <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment.</b> Reporting both descriptive statistics and OLS regression analysis on monthly official data from August 2014 to August 2016, the finding is that while other business types and waged employment rates followed a similar trend to the years before the introduction of the new legislation, the number of self-employed started a negative trend after the new legislation was announced. After controlling for other indicators related to the economy (i. e. GDP) and labor market (i. e. employees, other companies, vacancy rates), the impact of the new legislation on the self-employed remains negative, offering reasonable grounds for assuming bogus self-employed was lowered by the new legislation. The paper concludes by discussing the wider implications of these findings...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss the problem of false (<b>bogus)</b> <b>self-employment</b> and other {{precarious}} forms of employment in the ‘grey area’ between genuine self-employment and subordinate employment in Sweden. Why has this area developed in a longer and shorter perspective? How does the use of disguised and ambiguous forms of employment affect workers, industrial relations and regular labour standards? Examples are given from the construction, road haulage and cleaning industries. The article indicates that work in the grey area has become more and more common in recent years, not only in the context of east-west labour migration, but also among Swedish workers. The author also discusses this development...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss recent trends in false (<b>bogus)</b> <b>self-employment</b> in east-west labour {{migration}} in Sweden after the enlargement of the EU into the former Eastern Bloc. The study explores the reasons for using “self-employed” migrant workers in the construction and road haulage industries, how the workers are recruited and how the organised parties in the labour market have recognised and responded to this practice. The emphasis is on the intertwined relationships between self-employment as a mode of exploitation and as a strategy for survival in the labour market, which always has made false self-employment a complex matter for the trade unions to address. The analysis also relates to the current scholarly debate on dual labour markets. The study shows that the practice of false self-employment has increased in recent years in both industries. Yet there are other ways to avoid Swedish collective agreements and labour standards, for example by concluding “false collective agreements”. The study analyses the reasons behind this increase in a Swedish and international context. The discussion includes, among other things, how false self-employment is related to the use of long subcontracting chains, the infringement of the EU regulations on the cabotage traffic and the evasion of taxes and social fees in the host countries. It also includes why combating false self-employment has become a matter of converging interests and organised cooperation between the social partners in the road haulage industry, but as yet not in the construction industr...|$|E
30|$|Regarding wage dispersion, the {{weakness}} of collective bargaining in the private service sector, in particular in medium- and low-skill occupations, has raised attention {{of the issue of}} setting binding minimum wages since the mid- 2000 s. This was virtually a non-issue for many years as trade unions (and employers) always saw wage bargaining as their genuine responsibility, but faced with increasing low pay and limited capacities to establish collective agreements, the trade unions started to push for a general statutory minimum wage, a political project that is also popular with the majority of German voters. Over the last years and in different government constellations, however, collectively agreed minimum wages in an increasing number of sectors have been made generally binding via existing legislation on the posting of workers or, in the case of agency workers, on the regulation of temporary work agencies. The new statutory minimum wage of 8.50  EUR per hour effective as of January 2015 —with a transition period of 2 years for existing and binding collectively agreed minimum wages—has established a binding minimum wage floor for virtually all categories of workers (except for young people and apprentices) and all sectors {{for the first time in}} Germany. Along with the expected interventions into agency work, the relatively high statutory minimum wage is the most important reform breaking with the deregulatory approach adopted about 10 years ago. While designed to limit the dispersion of wages and working conditions, the re-regulatory approach may also trigger new forms of circumvention, such as a resort to undocumented overtime or more <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment.</b>|$|E
30|$|The second {{possibility}} to address segmentation through EPL reform is re-regulating temporary contracts. Indeed, {{there have also}} been some—albeit less far-reaching—changes in this direction (OECD 2013, 2014). One trend is to make the use of temporary contracts more expensive for employers, {{while at the same time}} offering monetary incentives to allow for transitions into permanent jobs. In Slovenia, the 2013 labor market reform raised employers’ unemployment insurance contributions for temporary jobs. However, if the temporary job is converted into a permanent one, employers are exempted from contributions for a limited time. The social partners in France have agreed upon a similar reform. Since May 2013, employers pay increased unemployment insurance contributions depending on the length of the contract. Contributions increase by 3 percentage points if the contract runs for less than one month, 1.5 if one to 3  months and 0.5 for longer contracts. Hence, the goal is to make employers contribute to the costs of extremely flexible hiring practices. Moreover, employers in France are exempt from contributions for a limited period if they hire younger or older workers on permanent contracts. In Italy, since 2012 employers have had to pay a contribution 1.4 percentage points higher for temporary rather than permanent workers, although this is reimbursed if the job is later converted into a permanent one (see also the more recent subsidy for permanent hirings). In Spain, from 2015 onwards, temporary workers receive a higher severance pay at the end of their contract. The payment corresponds to the salary of 12  days per year of employment with the firm and is considerably lower than for permanent workers. Finally, in the Netherlands, social protection for temporary and freelance workers was improved with an Act from 2013, addressing the boundary of dependent work and (sometime <b>bogus)</b> <b>self-employment.</b>|$|E
40|$|Labour {{mobility}} {{within the}} European Union {{continues to be}} a limited phenomenon. This concerns both long-term intra-EU mobility and more temporary forms of mobility such as posting of workers, i. e. workers posted to another member state in the framework of cross-border service provision. Yet, despite the limited nature of posting, this topic is far from being absent from the public and political debates. Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, a surge in the number of posted workers has been noticed over the recent years and increased attention has therefore been paid to this issue. Quite a few economic sectors, including construction, manufacturing, and social work, are very concerned by this trend. Secondly, several types of abuses have been recorded such as letter-box companies, <b>bogus</b> <b>self-employment</b> and exploitation of the posted workers' vulnerable situation. Thirdly, questions have been raised as to whether the balance struck by the EU legislator in 1996 (when adopting the Posted Workers Directive) between the freedom to provide crossborder services and the workers' social rights is still valid today. These elements highlight the need for a policy adjustment in order to preserve the legitimacy of the citizens' and workers' freedom to move and, to a certain extent, of the social dimension of the European project. In this context, the European Commission published a proposal to revise the 1996 Directive in order to strike a better balance between economic and social rights. But is this proposal sufficient to ensure a level playing field between economic actors and equal treatment between workers? How will this proposal affect the implementation of other EU initiatives aiming to tackle fraud and abuse? What else is needed to address the tensions between the Single Market principles and the EU's social objectives? This discussion paper, published {{in the context of the}} Dutch Presidency and the ongoing negotiations of a revised Directive on posted workers, focuses on these questions while proposing some concrete solutions for a fairer policy framework...|$|E
