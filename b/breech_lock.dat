50|$|The A407 100mm {{anti-tank}} gun {{was the first}} artillery piece designed in Romania after World War II. The first variant of the gun, the M1975 (M stands for Model) had a semi-automatic horizontal sliding wedge type <b>breech</b> <b>lock.</b> The second variant, M1977, had a more practical vertical sliding wedge breech block.|$|E
50|$|Autoclaves {{over four}} feet in {{diameter}} or those rated at higher pressures generally use the rotating locking ring door, also called a <b>breech</b> <b>lock</b> door. This door can be designed for any size and pressure. Both the hub and the door itself are generally non-rotating. The hub is welded to the vessel and the door moves on hinges that align it with the hub as it closes.|$|E
50|$|The {{locking system}} {{features}} a locking block hinged from the bolt and {{housed in the}} bolt carrier that contains two locking lugs which descend into and engage locking shoulders in the receiver's internal guide rails. The weapon is unlocked by the short tappet-like stroke of the piston rod as it strikes the bolt carrier and drives it rearwards. After 22 mm of unrestricted travel, a wedge-like surface on the bolt carrier moves under the <b>breech</b> <b>locking</b> piece and lifts it {{up and out of}} engagement with the locking recesses in the steel body. The <b>breech</b> <b>locking</b> piece swings up and this movement provides the leverage required for primary extraction. The breech block is then carried rearwards extracting the empty cartridge casing from the chamber. A fixed ejector passes through a groove cut in the underside of the bolt and the case is flung upwards clear of the gun.|$|R

50|$|In May 1959, the Canonflex SLR was introduced. The camera {{featured}} a quick return mirror, an automatic diaphragm and was introduced with an interchangeable black pentaprism housing. It also featured newly developed 'R' series <b>breech</b> <b>lock</b> mount lenses. This SLR was superseded by the Canonflex RM, a fixed prism SLR which {{featured a}} built-in selenium cell meter. Later came the Canonflex R2000, {{with a top}} shutter speed of 1/2000 of a second. This model was also superseded by the Canonflex RM.|$|E
50|$|The HW (Hermann Weihrauch) 35 was {{the first}} air rifle with Weihrauchs famous Rekord 2-stage {{adjustable}} trigger and used a conventional piston and spring assembly. The spring is compressed by breaking the barrel through 125° before loading a pellet directly into the breach. The barrel was then returned into place and locked with a special <b>Breech</b> <b>lock.</b> The first production models had a leather piston seal with a 4mm diameter transfer port {{but at the end}} of the 1970s Weihrauch switched to synthetic seals and a 2.8mm dia port from serial #843636.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]32 ACP was {{intended}} for blowback semi-automatic pistols which lacked a <b>breech</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism. It was John Pedersen with the Remington Model 51 that delivered a true <b>locked</b> <b>breech</b> for the [...]32 ACP cartridge. The relatively low power and light bullet of the cartridge allowed Browning to incorporate a practical blowback mechanism in a small Pocket Size Pistol. It is still used today primarily in compact, inexpensive pistols, unless the pistol is used for ISSF competition where the cost then escalates. Cartridges in [...]32 ACP are also sometimes used in caliber conversion sleeves, also known as supplemental chambers, for providing an alternative pistol caliber carbine function in [...]30-caliber hunting and service rifles.|$|R

50|$|Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies {{demanded that}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. On 21 November 1918, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their <b>breech</b> <b>locks</b> were removed, which disabled their guns.|$|R
50|$|The 35 mm {{film gauge}} {{has long been}} the most common gauge in {{professional}} usage, and thus enjoys the greatest number of cameras currently available for professional usage. The modern era of 35 mm cameras dates to 1972, when Arri's Arriflex 35BL and Panavision's original Panaflex models emerged as the first self-blimped, lightweight cameras. Another distinguishing characteristic of modern cameras is the adoption of stronger lens mount seatings secured with a <b>breech</b> <b>lock</b> - namely the Arri PL and PV mount, both of which were designs descended from the BNCR mount of Mitchell cameras.|$|E

5000|$|The Blish Lock {{resulted}} from Blish's observation of large naval guns. He {{noticed that the}} breech blocks of naval guns with interrupted thread breeches remained closed when fired with full charges, but tended to unscrew when fired with light charges. He concluded that dissimilar metals {{have a tendency to}} adhere to each other when subjected to very high pressure. This principle of metallic adhesion of dissimilar metals became known as the Blish Principle. Blish put this knowledge to use in a delayed-blowback <b>breech</b> <b>lock.</b> He developed a working model that used a simple wedge as the lock, and was eventually assigned [...] on March 9, 1915.|$|E

This dubious principle was later eliminated as redundant in the [...]45 caliber submachine gun. Lubrication or fouling would completely defeat any delay. Whatever actual advantage a clean, unlubricated Blish system could impart could also be attained by adding a mere ounce of mass to the bolt.|$|R
5000|$|The first Petri SLR was the [...] "Penta" [...] (1959). After {{the first}} model, the {{original}} product line cameras were named Penta for the domestic Japanese market and PetriFlex for export. The original Penta {{came with a}} 'universal' M42 screw type mount, while most subsequent models in the Penta, Flex and FT lines used the proprietary Petri <b>breech</b> <b>lock</b> bayonet. Adapters were manufactured to allow interchangeability, albeit with some loss of function. A very limited range of lenses was produced. They returned to the M42 mount in 1974 with the Petri FTX body, continuing to use it on low cost bodies such as the FT1000/500 and the compact MFT1000 and Micro MF-1 bodies.|$|E

This excludes all of Canon's EF bayonet mount autofocus lenses (introduced in 1987). During the late 1970s and 1980s, there were approximately 55 Canon FD lenses available for purchase. They ranged from a 7.5mm f/5.6 fisheye to an FD 800mm f/5.6 telephoto, and included lenses with maximum apertures to f/1.2 and a line of L-series lenses of exceptional quality. Accessories for the A-1 included the Canon motor drive MA (automatic film advance up to 5 frames per second), the Canon Databack A (sequential numbering or date stamping on the film), and the Canon Speedlight 155A (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) and Canon Speedlight 199A (guide number 98/30 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) electronic flashes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most famous}} {{applications}} of the Blish Lock were the Thompson Autorifle and Thompson submachine gun. Several engineers suspected the autorifle functioned more as a retarded blowback than as an adhesion-locked breech action. Some authorities, such as Julian Hatcher, felt the Blish Lock as employed in the submachine gun did not accomplish much in terms of actual <b>breech</b> <b>locking.</b> In fact, the submachine gun was successfully redesigned as a simple blowback weapon (the M1/M1A1). Any real advantages to the system were far outweighed by the additional cost of manufacture associated with the device. Also, in the Thompson submachine gun the [...] "H" [...] shaped bronze lock connects the bolt actuator to the bolt body; incorrect installation of the Blish lock can render a Thompson inoperable.|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} screw plug (also called <b>breech</b> <b>lock)</b> exchangers are {{arguably the most}} complicated bolted connection in a refinery. After traveling around the world helping facilities turn these exchangers from chronic leakers (from internal tubesheet and external diaphragm and B style shell leaks) {{to one of the}} most reliable heat exchangers in the plant, it is very clear to me that manufacturers, engineers and mechanics struggle to correctly understand the interactions between gaskets, internal pressure, the two circles of external push bolts that are part of A style exchangers and all the internal parts. Some manufactuers have given up on trying to make these connections operate leak free, and prefer to weld in the tubesheets and diaphragms. This significantly adds to the cost and time needed to open and close these exchangers, as special equipment is needed to machine out the parts and weld them back together again. There are a handful of equipment manufacturers that build these exchangers, and while there are differences from one manufacturer to the next, once the basic design is understood, the reader should be able understand that they are all basically the same when it comes to the few critical steps that must be followed when opening and closing these exchangers. In order to obtain reliable leak free performance, all the basic sealing tools must be employed, including: 1. A spreadsheet that will easily analyze the critical variables; 2. Correct gasket selection; 3. Correct assembly procedures that focus on important steps including proper spacing of internal parts and obtaining consistent thread friction; 4. And finally hot torqueing the exchangers after startup. The goal of this paper to provide the end-user with a good understanding for how parts interact and how the bolted connections function, so that they might also achieve reliable, leak free performance.

50|$|The R4 is a {{selective}} fire, gas-operated weapon that fires from a closed bolt. As with the Galil parent weapon, {{the operating system}} is derived {{from that of the}} AK-47. It uses ignited powder gases channelled through a vent in the barrel to drive a long stroke piston located above the barrel in a gas cylinder to provide power to the operating system. The weapon features a self-regulating gas system and a rotary bolt <b>breech</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism (equipped with two locking lugs), which is rotated by a helical camming groove machined into the bolt carrier that engages a control pin on the bolt. Extraction is carried out by means of a spring-loaded extractor contained in the bolt and a protrusion on the left guide rail inside the receiver acts as the fixed ejector.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 SIG {{licensed}} {{this design}} from the French and created their model SIG P210 Handgun series of handguns. When examining the Browning 1926 prototype, the French Model l935 and the Sig P210 is may be {{noticed that the}} slide mechanisms of all three appear very similar. Like the M1911A1 Colt pistol the <b>breech</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism {{was a series of}} grooves in the barrel which matched similar grooves in the slide which were levered or cammed upward to engage thus creating a <b>locked</b> <b>breech</b> action. Only after the slide and barrel assembly had recoiled due to the energy of expelling the bullet from the barrel was it possible for the link to pivot downward, tilting the barrel and unlocking the action. The velocity of movement as high enough to push the slide against its recoil spring to its rear most position. From there the spring was strong enough to push the slide forward, where it would strike the base of an unfired cartridge in the magazine which had risen after the breech block had moved rearward, thus pushing the unfired cartridge into the chamber, effecting the semi-automatic reloading process.|$|R
