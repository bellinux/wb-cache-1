5|$|In 1398 Richard summoned {{a packed}} Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which {{declared}} all {{the acts of}} the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

25|$|After voters {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} referendum in November 2014 supporting {{the expansion of}} the Township Committee from three to five members, the Township Committee addressed the process of following through with the expansion, which would involve gathering petitions of 147 voters after which the committee could approve the expansion or a bing referendum could <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot.|$|E

25|$|The railroad's representative, Grayson Butterfield, enlists McElroy, Potter, Tucker (one of Hollander's men), and Evans, {{to deliver}} Wade to Contention, where Wade will <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 3:10 {{afternoon}} train to Yuma Territorial Prison. Evans requests a $200 fee to deliver Wade for transport, which Butterfield accepts. From Evans' ranch, McElroy arranges a decoy wagon to distract Wade's gang, now led by Charlie Prince, {{with the real}} prisoner transport departing later that night.|$|E
25|$|Once large {{kindling}} is burning, all kindling should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fire, {{save for}} one piece {{at least a}} foot long. This piece is useful later to push pieces of fuel wood where needed. Once all of the kindling is burning, the fuel wood {{should be placed on}} top of it (unless, as in the rakovalkea fire-build, it is already there). For best results, two or more pieces of fuel wood should be leaned against each other, as in the tipi fire-build.|$|E
25|$|The halftime {{show was}} a salute to both New Orleans and the 40th anniversary of the comic strip Peanuts. The show {{featured}} performances by clarinetist Pete Fountain, fiddle player Doug Kershaw, and singer Irma Thomas – all Louisiana natives. Three local college bands, Southern University, ULL, and Nicholls State, joined in the performance. The finale featured a float that was dressed up as a riverboat that rose several stories high. The float was so huge {{that one of the}} goal posts had to be moved so it could <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|E

25|$|On 22 March 2015, {{during his}} satirical show Zondag met Lubach, comedian Arjen Lubach {{launched}} a satirical citizen's initiative to have himself proclaimed Pharaoh of the Netherlands. The initiave, {{intended as a}} statement against the monarchy (200 years after the coronation of King William I), obtained the necessary 40,000 signatures within 24 hours (helped by Lubach's appearance on De Wereld Draait Door on 23 March). Although it is unlikely the initiative will <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives' agenda, Lubach did succeed in sparking a new national debate {{on the status of}} the monarchy as a form of government.|$|E
25|$|Real {{and complex}} embeddings can <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same footing as prime ideals by {{adopting}} a perspective based on valuations. Consider, for example, the integers. In {{addition to the}} usual absolute value function |·| : Q → R, there are p-adic absolute value functions |·|p : Q → R, defined for each prime number p, which measure divisibility by p. Ostrowski's theorem states that these are all possible absolute value functions on Q (up to equivalence). Therefore, absolute values are a common language to describe both the real embedding of Q and the prime numbers.|$|E
25|$|Post 9/11 remarks made by Muslim {{leaders in}} Cleveland and Los Angeles {{also led to}} the {{suspension}} of longstanding Muslim-Jewish dialogues. Some Jewish community leaders cite the statements as the latest evidence that Muslim-Jewish dialogue is futile in today's charged atmosphere. John Rosove, senior rabbi of Temple Israel of Hollywood, and other Jewish participants withdrew from the three-year-old Muslim-Jewish dialogue group {{after one of the}} Muslim participants, Salam al-Marayati of MPAC, suggested in a radio interview that Israel should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list of suspects behind the 11 September attacks. However, in January 2011, MPAC member Wa’el Azmeh and Temple Israel engaged in an interfaith dialogue.|$|E

25|$|Jarka Sipka, Rudolf Kleppich, Murray Chapman and Sarah Walters {{were four}} people from New South Wales who were {{entitled}} to vote in New South Wales elections, but had not enrolled to vote in federal elections. When they applied to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electoral roll, the Registrar refused to put their names on the roll until after the election, because the roll was already closed. Sipka and Chapman could have enrolled before the writs were issued, had they so chosen, but Kleppich and Walters could only have enrolled on or after 15 February, because Kleppich was not naturalised until that date, and Walters did not turn eighteen (the minimum voting age) until that date.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} {{speakers}} is given first to member states, then observer states and supranational bodies. Any other observers entities {{will have a}} chance to speak at the end of the debate, if they so choose. Speakers will <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in one of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented at the podium. Speeches are requested to be limited to five minutes, with seven minutes for supranational bodies.|$|E
25|$|If the {{manifold}} {{is allowed}} to have boundary, then some restrictions must <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> domain of the elliptic operator {{in order to ensure}} a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the signature operator) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder, and also introduced the Atiyah–Patodi–Singer eta invariant. This resulted in a series of papers on spectral asymmetry, which were later unexpectedly used in theoretical physics, in particular in Witten's work on anomalies.|$|E
