40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{description}} of the development of optimized rubber compounds for the various parts of the <b>bead</b> <b>section</b> of low aspect ratio steel-betted radial tines. Four main parts of the bead zone have been considered which are bead insulation, apex, chafer and pad. For each section, a series of compounds have been designed and then based on the measured physical and mechanical properties, they are modified until the pre-defined properties have been achieved. It is shown that based on use of a blend of elastomers and novel combination of different compounding ingredients, optimized rubber compounds for the mentioned parts both from physical properties and economical points of view can be obtained. The use of the developed compounds in the manufacturing of a 175 IT 0 - 14 steel-belted tire and also the results of the indoor and outdoor tire tests generally confirm the validity of the designed rubber compounds.

40|$|Fiber {{laser welding}} of cold rolled TRIP steel (transformation Induced Plasticity steel) sheet with tensile {{strength}} of 820 MPa and thickness of 1. 4 mm {{was carried out}} using shielding gases Ar and He, respectively. For the same laser power and welding speed, the effects of different shielding gases on penetration and <b>bead</b> <b>section</b> morphologies were investigated. The microstructures and properties of the TRIP steel joints were also studied. The investigation showed that higher penetration and lower porosity could be obtained under shielding gas He using the same laser power and welding speed. The microstructures of the TRIP joint mainly included martensite and retained austenite. But the joint microhardness and tensile strength were higher under the shielding gas He. The tensile strength of the welded joint perpendicular to the weld line was {{equal to that of}} the base metal. But the tensile strength of the joint parallel with the weld line was higher than that of the base metal. The plasticity and formability of the welded joint were impaired due to the formation of martensite in the weld metal...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{assesses the}} gap bridgeability of pulse GMAW joints of DP 780 for {{automobile}} body. Design/methodology/approach: Wire melting was analyzed using a high-speed camera. The impact of EN ratio on {{the shape of}} the <b>bead</b> <b>section</b> was examined after analyzing the macrosection of welding which was obtained on a bead-on-plate-welding experiment. Welding conditions that are robust to the gap were suggested through an analysis on tensile strength, macrosection of the weld and fracture appearance of tensile strength testing at the lap joint welding of DP 780. Findings: A relation among the welding current (welding process parameter of AC pulse GMAW), EN ratio, welding speed and bead shape parameters which include bead width, bead height and penetration were computed. Research limitations/implications: The suitable welding conditions proposed in this paper can change because of types of welding joints thickness of base metal and other reasons. Practical implications: In this study, the suitable welding conditions were presented for securing a good weld quality of DP 780 for the automobile body. Originality/value: Through this study, the correlation between the weld bead geometry and the EN ratio in the AC pulse GMAW was confirmed. Though the weld quality assessment, suitable pulse GMAW conditions of DP 780 were suggested...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the impact of}} pressure upon the sizes of the heat-affected zone when MAG hyperbaric dry welding with pulsated arc and flux-cored wire is applied. For this research 15 beads were layered on a plate in the horizontal position. The beads filling were carried out in atmospheric conditions and in the conditions of 2 and 4 bar overpressure. During the bead filling operations some of the technological parameters were kept constant and some others were modified. The ESAB Aristo LUD 32 O universal welding power source and a FW 1000 Railtrac cutting/welding tractor were used for this experimental project.

50|$|The {{experimentation}} continued when {{he moved}} into his own studio in 1960, and {{it was here that}} he created another important motif: the bead and cup. Pouring molten gold into cold water, he discovered that it divided into small beads, some of which caught bubbles of air and cooled into hollow cups. The beads were painstakingly soldered together, creating a complex surface of contrasting of convex and concave shapes. He later cast <b>bead</b> and cup <b>sections,</b> enabling him to use them in larger scale designs.|$|R

Researchers excavated a [...] cast-bronze cannon from the waters, as well as musket balls, bronze straight pins, and trade <b>beads.</b> Large <b>sections</b> of the wooden hull were intact, protected from the damaging effects of warm salt water by layers of muddy sediment which [...] "essentially creat an oxygen-free time capsule". La Belle was the oldest French shipwreck discovered in the Western Hemisphere to that date. To enable the archaeologists to recover {{as many of the}} artifacts as possible, a cofferdam was constructed around the ship. The cofferdam held back the waters of the bay, allowing archaeologists to conduct the excavation as if it were on land. This was the first attempt in North America to excavate a shipwreck in dry conditions. Previous shipwreck excavations using cofferdams were completed in Europe, but never on a ship as large as the Belle.|$|R

50|$|The {{movement}} to repeal Section 377 was initiated by AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan in 1991. Their historic publication Less than Gay: A Citizen's Report, spelled out {{the problems with}} 377 and asked for its repeal. A 1996 article in Economic and Political Weekly by Vimal Balasubrahmanyan titled 'Gay Rights In India' chronicles this early history. As the case prolonged over the years, it was revived in the next decade, led by the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, an activist group, which filed a public interest litigation in the Delhi High Court in 2001, seeking legalisation of homosexual intercourse between consenting adults. The Naz Foundation worked with a legal team from the Lawyers Collective to engage in court. In 2003, the Delhi High Court refused to consider a petition regarding {{the legality of the}} law, saying that the petitioners, had no locus standi in the matter. Since nobody had been prosecuted in the recent past under this section it seemed unlikely that the section would be struck down as illegal by the Delhi High Court {{in the absence of a}} petitioner with standing. Naz Foundation appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court to dismiss the petition on technical grounds. The Supreme Court decided that Naz Foundation had the standing to file a PIL in this case and sent the case back to the Delhi High Court to reconsider it on merit. Subsequently, there was a significant intervention in the case by a Delhi-based coalition of LGBT, women's and human rights activists called 'Voices Against 377', which supported the demand to <b>'read</b> down' <b>section</b> 377 to exclude adult consensual sex from within its purview. The Indian author Rajesh Talwar wrote a satirical play on Section 377 titled 'Inside Gayland' where a young lawyer visits a planet where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuality is criminalised.|$|R
5000|$|Longisquama is {{characterized}} by distinctive integumentary structures along its back. The holotype (specimen PIN 2584/4) is the only known fossil preserving these appendages projecting {{from the back of}} an associated skeleton. It has 7 appendages radiating in a fan-like pattern, but their tips are not preserved. PIN 2584/9 preserves five complete appendages spaced close together. PIN 2584/6 preserves two long, curved appendage running side by side. Other specimens, such as PIN 2585/7 and FG 596/V/1 preserve only one appendage. These structures are long and narrow throughout most of their length, and angle backward near the tip to give the appearance of a hockey stick. The proximal straight section is divided into three longitudinal lobes: a smooth lobe on either side and a transversely ridged lobe running between them. The middle ridged lobe is made up of raised [...] "rugae" [...] and deep [...] "interstices," [...] which Sharov compared to rosary <b>beads.</b> The distal <b>section</b> is thought to be an extension of the middle and anterior lobes of the proximal section. While the anterior lobe widens in the distal section, the posterior lobe of the proximal section narrows until it ends {{at the base of the}} distal section. In addition, an [...] "anterior flange" [...] appears about two-thirds the way up the proximal section and continues to the tip of the distal section. Both lobes in the distal section are ridged and separated by a grooved axis. In some specimens, the rugae of either lobe in the distal section line up with each other, while in other specimens they do not. Some specimens have straight rugae projecting perpendicular to the axis, while others have rugae that curve in an S-shape. One specimen of Longisquama, PIN 2584/5, has small spines projecting from the axis of the distal section.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the risk of global warming by reducing CO 2 emissions, the co-firing technique, burning pulverized coal and granular biomass together in conventional pulverised fuel power station boilers, has been advocated to generate “greener” electricity to satisfy energy demand while continuing to utilize existing rich coal resources. A major problem is controllably distributing fuel mixtures of pulverized coal and granular biomass in a common pipeline, thus saving much investment. This is still under development in many co-firing studies. This research into particle dynamics in pipe flow was undertaken {{in order to address}} the problem of controllable distribution in co-firing techniques and gain an improved understanding of pneumatic conveying mechanisms. The objectives of this research were, firstly, to numerically evaluate the influence of various factors on the behaviour of particles of the different materials in a horizontal pipe gas-solid flow, secondly, to develop an extended technique of Laser Doppler Anemometry in order to determine cross-sectional characteristics of the solid phase flow in the horizontal and vertical legs of a pneumatic conveying system, and, thirdly, to develop a novel imaging system for visualizing particle trajectories by using a high definition camcorder on a cross-section illuminated by a white halogen light sheet. Finally, a comparison was made of cross-sectional flow characteristics established by experiments and those simulated by using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics code (Fluent) and the coupling calculations of Fluent & EDEM (a commercial code of Discrete Element Method) respectively. Particle dynamic behaviour of the solid phase in a dilute horizontal pipe flow was investigated numerically by using the Discrete Phase Model (DPM) in Fluent 6. 2. 16. The numerical results indicate that the Saffman force plays an important role in re-suspending particles at the lower pipe boundary and that three critical parameters of the critical air: conveying velocity, the critical particle size and the critical pipe roughness, exist in pneumatic conveying systems. The Stokes number can be used as a similarity criterion to classify the dimensionless mean particle velocity of the different materials in the fully developed region. An extended Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) technique has been developed to measure the distributions of particle velocities and particle number over a whole pipe cross section in a dilute pneumatic conveying system. The first extension concentrates on a transform matrix for predicting the refracted laser beams’ crossing point in a pipe according to the shift coordinate of the 3 D computer-controlled traverse system on which the probes of the LDA system were mounted. Another part focussed on the proper sampling rate of LDA for measurements on the gas-solid pipe flow with polydispersing particles. A suitable LDA sampling rate should ensure that enough data is recorded in the measurement interval to precisely calculate the particle mean velocity or other statistical values at every sample point. The present study explores the methodology as well as fundamentals of measurements of the local instantaneous density of particles as a primary standard using a laser facility. The extended LDA technique has also been applied to quantitatively investigate particle dynamic behaviour in the horizontal and vertical pipes of a dilute pneumatic conveying system. Three kinds of glass beads were selected to simulate the pulverized coal and biomass pellets transported in a dilute pneumatic conveying system. Detailed information on the cross-sectional spatial distributions of the axial particle velocity and particle number rate is reported. In the horizontal pipe section, experimental data on a series of cross-sections clearly illustrate two uniform fluid patterns of solid phase: an annular structure describing the cross-sectional distribution of the axial particle velocity and a stratified configuration describing particle number rate. In the vertical pipe downstream of an elbow R/D= 1. 3, a horseshoe-shaped feature, which shows that the axial particle velocity is highest in wall regions of the pipe on the outside of the bend for all three types of glass <b>beads</b> on the <b>section</b> 0 D close to the elbow outlet. The developments of cross-sectional distributions of particle number rate indicate that the horseshoe-shaped feature of particle flow pattern is rapidly dispersed for particles with high inertia. A video & image processing system has been built using a high definition camcorder and a light sheet from a source consisting of a halogen lamp. A set of video and image processing algorithms has been developed to extract particle information from each frame in a video. The experimental results suggest that the gas-solid flow in a dilute pneumatic conveying system is always heterogeneous and unsteady. The parameter of particle mass mean size is superior to particle number mean size for statistically describing the unsteady properties of gas-solid pipe flow. It is also demonstrated that the local data of particle number rate or concentration are represented by a stratified structure of the flow pattern over a horizontal pipe cross-section. Finally, comparisons of numerically predicated flow patterns and experimental ones show that there is reasonable agreement at pipe cross-sections located at horizontal positions less than half the product of particle mean velocity and mean free fall time in the pipe from the particle inlet. Further away from the inlet, the numerical results show flow patterns which are increasingly divergent from the experimental results along the pipe in the direction of flow. This discrepancy indicates that particles’ spatial distribution in the pipe is not accurately predicted by the Discrete Phase Model or Fluent coupled with EDEM.
