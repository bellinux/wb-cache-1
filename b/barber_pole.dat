25|$|During World War I and World War II, {{the pattern}} {{has also been}} used as an {{insignia}} for aircraft identification. Spad XIIIs of the 94th Aero Squadron USAS in early 1919 used variations on <b>barber</b> <b>pole</b> patterns including: 'Barber Pole' of Lt Dudley 'Red' Outcault; S.16546 'Flag Bus' of Captain Reed Chambers; and 'Rising Sun' of Lt John Jeffers.|$|E
25|$|His {{second most}} {{recognizable}} painting after Nighthawks is another urban painting, Early Sunday Morning (originally called Seventh Avenue Shops), which shows an empty street scene in sharp side light, {{with a fire}} hydrant and a <b>barber</b> <b>pole</b> as stand-ins for human figures. Originally Hopper intended to put figures in the upstairs windows but left them empty to heighten the feeling of desolation.|$|E
25|$|Lighthouses near to {{each other}} that are similar in shape are often painted in a unique pattern so they can easily be {{recognized}} during daylight, a marking known as a daymark. The black and white <b>barber</b> <b>pole</b> spiral pattern of Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is one example. Race Rocks Light in western Canada is painted in horizontal black and white bands to stand out against the horizon.|$|E

25|$|After the {{formation}} of the United Barber Surgeon's Company in England, a statute required the barber to use a blue and white pole and the surgeon to use a red pole. In France, surgeons used a red pole with a basin attached to identify their offices. Blue often appears on poles in the United States, possibly as a homage to its national colors. Another, more fanciful interpretation of these <b>barber</b> <b>pole</b> colors is that red represents arterial blood, blue is symbolic of venous blood, and white depicts the bandage.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1950, {{there were}} four {{manufacturers}} of barber poles in the United States. In 1950, William Marvy of St. Paul, Minnesota, started manufacturing barber poles. Marvy made his 50,000th <b>barber</b> <b>pole</b> in 1967, and, by 2010, over 82,000 had been produced. The William Marvy Company is now the sole manufacturer of barber poles in North America, and sells only 500 per year (compared to 5,100 in the 1960s). In recent years, the sale of spinning barber poles has dropped considerably, since few barber shops are opening, and many jurisdictions prohibit moving signs. Koken of St. Louis, Missouri, manufactured barber equipment such as chairs and assorted poles in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{striping}} {{pattern of}} the zebra is unique among sympatric ungulates. One suggested function for the stripes is to provide crypsis for the animal in tall grass or in the dappled shade beneath bushes and trees. However, cryptically coloured species, such as the kudu and bushbuck, tend to be quiet and stealthy. They freeze when there is danger and flee only at the last moment. By contrast, the zebra is active and noisy, and makes no attempt to hide itself. Another suggestion is motion camouflage, that the stripes affect a predator's judgement of the zebra's size, distance and what direction it is going in. A 2014 study supports this hypothesis, finding that, when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, via two visual illusions, the wagon wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the <b>barber</b> <b>pole</b> illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction. A related hypothesis is that the stripes {{make it difficult for}} a predator to single out and learn about an individual during a chase.|$|E
