5|$|While it was {{formerly}} considered a megaloolithid, Cairanoolithus {{is now considered}} to belong its own monotypic oofamily, Cairanoolithidae. It belongs to the dinosauroid-spherulitic <b>basic</b> <b>type,</b> a group including sauropod eggs and ornithischian eggs, but paraphyletically excluding theropod eggs.|$|E
5|$|According to the parataxonomic {{system used}} to {{classify}} fossil eggs, Gobioolithus is {{classified in the}} oofamily Gobioolithidae, which, in turn, is classified in the prismatic morphotype (also called the neognath morphotype) of the ornithoid <b>basic</b> <b>type.</b> A cladistic analysis performed by Varricchio and Barta (2015) (pictured below) found Gobioolithus to be a sister taxon to Styloolithus. However, they considered Styloolithus different enough from Gobioolithus to warrant its excluslion from Gobioolithidae.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>basic</b> <b>type</b> of {{meetings}} are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow {{people of all}} ages and abilities to compete.

5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most <b>basic</b> <b>type</b> of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E

Family shrine is always positioned in the most auspicious corner at the north-east (kaja-kangin).|$|E

25|$|The most <b>basic</b> <b>type</b> of {{convergence}} for {{a sequence}} of functions (in particular, it does not assume any topological structure on {{the domain of the}} functions) is pointwise convergence. It is defined as convergence of the sequence of values of the functions at every point. If the functions take their values in a uniform space, then one can define pointwise Cauchy convergence, uniform convergence, and uniform Cauchy convergence of the sequence.|$|E

This type can be found all over the world, but the terminology here is that used on the British canals. A subsequent section explains common variations.|$|E
25|$|When a {{programming}} language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than <b>basic</b> <b>type</b> checking, but this {{comes at a price}} when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.|$|E

25|$|Transformations {{describing}} {{relative motion}} with constant (uniform) velocity and without {{rotation of the}} space coordinate axes are called boosts, and the relative velocity between the frames is the parameter of the transformation. The other <b>basic</b> <b>type</b> of Lorentz transformations is rotations in the spatial coordinates only, these are also inertial frames {{since there is no}} relative motion, the frames are simply tilted (and not continuously rotating), and in this case quantities defining the rotation are the parameters of the transformation (e.g., axis–angle representation, or Euler angles, etc.). A combination of a rotation and boost is a homogeneous transformation, which transforms the origin back to the origin.|$|E
25|$|A {{recently}} completed Spirit reproduction, intended for airworthiness {{is owned by}} the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome (ORA), fulfilling a lifelong dream of its primary founder, Cole Palen (1925–1993). The reproduction project had been started by Cole before his own death, and has mostly been subsequently built by former ORA pilot and current vintage aircraft maintenance manager Ken Cassens, receiving its wing covering, completed with doped fabric in 2015. A restored Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial was obtained by Palen in the 1970s for the project's start, with original, and still functional 1920s-era flight instruments being incorporated — including the same <b>basic</b> <b>type</b> of earth inductor compass used by Lindbergh — matching the ones in the original Spirit at the NASM, with the goal of becoming the most authentic airworthy reproduction of the Spirit yet built.|$|E
25|$|The {{avionics}} of {{the original}} version of the Alpha Jet were of an austere nature, partly {{to make it a}} simple and easily exportable aircraft. The <b>basic</b> <b>type</b> lacked features such as an autopilot, inertial navigation, or a radar. Later upgrade programs would typically focus on the addition of a glass cockpit and other avionics systems. The Luftwaffe's Alpha Jets were equipped with additional avionics for the attack role, such as a Doppler radar and additional hardpoints. During the 1970s, Dornier claimed that the Alpha Jet outperformed aircraft used as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, LTV A-7 Corsair II, and Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in the close air support role; the firms specifically stated that the Alpha Jet was smaller, faster, less vulnerable, more maneuverable, cheaper and had higher all-round performance than the A-10.|$|E
