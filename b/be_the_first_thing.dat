25|$|In Guyana, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago, {{it is one}} of {{the most}} popular type of beans cooked with rice, the main one being red kidney beans, also {{referred}} to as red beans. It is also cooked as a snack or appetizer on its own. On New Year's Eve (referred to as Old Year's Night in Guyana and Suriname), families cook a traditional dish called cook-up rice. The dish comprises rice, black-eyed peas, and other peas and a variety of meats cooked in coconut milk and seasonings. According to tradition, cook-up rice should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> consumed in the New Year for good luck. Cook-up rice is also made as an everyday dish.|$|E

But that is the emotion—subterranean, powerful, beautiful, illicit, and infinitely patient—that suffuses the pages of Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. As in his best-selling first novel, The Kite Runner, Hosseini movingly examines the connections between unlikely friends, the fissures that open up between parents and children, the intransigence of quiet hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers, such as Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer and Chris Holt of Macworld {{echoed the}} praises for the {{graphics}} and atmosphere, while Craig Pearson of PC Gamer UK added praises {{for the music}} and voiceovers and Suzie Ochs of MacLife praised the music and story. Other praises for the game came for its control scheme and for the gameplay mechanics, with Holt calling out the cooking system as worthy of praise. Though noting that the visuals and presentation of the game would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that players noticed, Nathan Cocks of PC PowerPlay claimed that [...] "from a design standpoint, Aquaria is a triumph," [...] with {{the right amount of}} complexity and level design that is [...] "spot on".|$|E

2500|$|An early draft {{included}} an additional chapter set after the confrontation with Vernita {{in which the}} Bride has a gunfight with Gogo Yubari's vengeful sister Yuki. The scene was cut for time and budget reasons. Tarantino said: [...] "I'm dealing with a three and a half-hour movie. Yuki's revenge {{is going to be}} the first to go. I'm going to kill myself shooting it, it's going to cost $1 million and it's going to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to go, so I can't do it." [...] Another draft featured a scene in which the Bride's [...] "Pussy Wagon" [...] is blown up by Elle Driver.|$|E

[...] (...) , that is to say, either victorious or dead, since in battle, the heavy hoplite shield would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> a fleeing soldier would be tempted to abandon –- rhipsaspia, [...] "dropping the shield", was a synonym for desertion in the field.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2007, a {{demo version}} of Montag's song [...] "Body Language" [...] was leaked on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, which {{featured}} an uncredited rapped verse by Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt. Montag has claimed she {{was unhappy with}} the leak, as the song was a [...] "joke" [...] {{and she did not}} want that to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> people heard from her musically. Montag released the promo single, [...] "Higher" [...] along with an accompanying video shot by Pratt to iTunes on February 5, 2008. The song and the video immediately elicited a negative response from the online community. Two weeks later, a ballad titled [...] "No More" [...] was leaked online, and Montag later released it as a promotional single the following month. Two more songs, [...] "Fashion" [...] and [...] "One More Drink" [...] appeared on the internet in June 2008. Consequently, Montag released the extended plays Wherever I Am and Here She Is..., which were made up of previously leaked material. Following the album's release, Montag stated [...] "I've actually gone broke putting every dollar I've ever made and my heart and soul into this music. For me, I have a different appreciation, a different understanding, and a different love of my music and for my album than any other artist possibly could." [...] Montag later confirmed she spent nearly $2 million on the album. Initially, the album was to include Montag's debut single, [...] "Body Language", but the song was later removed from the final product. The album was eventually released on January 11, 2010 for digital download.|$|E

25|$|And as I told you, these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> two {{secondary}} {{causes of}} the decline of art; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> being <b>the</b> loss of moral purpose. Pray note them clearly.

I'm sure I'm the last girl {{in the world to}} keep a diary. I'm not a bit sentimental and I never have time for soul outpourings.

6000|$|... § 9. It will follow, of course, {{from the}} above considerations, that the choice which characterises the school of high art is seen {{as much in the}} {{treatment}} of a subject as in its selection, and that the expression of the thoughts of the persons represented will always <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> considered by the painter who worthily enters that highest school. For the artist who sincerely chooses the noblest subject will also choose chiefly to represent what makes that subject noble, namely, the various heroism or other noble emotions of the persons represented. If, instead of this, the artist seeks only to make his picture agreeable by the composition of its masses and colors, or by any other merely pictorial merit, as fine drawing of limbs, it is evident, not only that any other subject would have answered his purpose as well, but that he is unfit to approach the subject he has chosen, because he cannot enter into its deepest meaning, and therefore cannot in reality have chosen it for that meaning. Nevertheless, while the expression is always to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> considered, all other merits must be added to the utmost of the painter's power: for until he can both color and draw beautifully he has no business to consider himself a painter at all, far less to attempt the noblest subjects of painting; and, when he has once possessed himself of these powers, he will naturally and fitly employ them to deepen and perfect the impression made by the sentiment of his subject.|$|E
