30|$|Schelter et al. {{presented}} a new method {{to minimize the}} false alarms adopting circadian concepts[25]. A circadian rhythm is defined as any <b>biological</b> <b>operation</b> that reveals an endogenous, entrainable oscillation for 24  h. The authors used {{the output of the}} mean phase coherent algorithm, which measures the interaction between pairs of EEG signals, as a seizure predictor, which causes an alarm to be raised if it exceeds a certain threshold. It was assumed that the seizures occur while the patient is sleeping. The false alarms display a circadian dependency with most of the seizure prediction algorithms. The seizure predectability is increased during night due to the large number of seizures. Accordingly, threshold adaptation can be used in day and night to enhance predictability. The authors evaluated this method utilizing iEEG data from eight patients and a total of 1400  h, which include 172 seizures and reported a good prediction performance for 40 % of the patients.|$|E

The security {{of this form}} of encryption hinges on the enormous difficulty that is required to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), especially over GF(2 n), n ∈ Z+. This paper describes an effective method to find solutions to the ECDLP {{by means of a}} molecular computer. We propose that this research accomplishment would represent a breakthrough for applied biological computation and this paper demonstrates that in principle this is possible. Three DNA-based algorithms: a parallel adder, a parallel multiplier, and a parallel inverse over GF(2 n) are described. The <b>biological</b> <b>operation</b> time of all of these algorithms is polynomial with respect to n. Considering this analysis, cryptography using a public key might be less secure.

30|$|Recently, an {{encryption}} scheme using DNA addition {{in combination}} with chaotic system was proposed by Zhang et al. [14]. Soon afterwards, some cryptosystems were applied to DNA sequence operations and chaotic systems [2 – 5, 7, 15 – 27]. These schemes applied DNA encoding and DNA sequence operation to encrypt images. An idea of DNA subsequence operation, rather than complex <b>biological</b> <b>operation</b> of image encryption scheme, was introduced by Zhang et al. [25]. Liu and his research team [26] employed a chaotic map and the DNA complementary rule in an image encryption algorithm. SaberiKamarposhti et al. [27] proposed hybrid image encryption algorithm through DNA sequences and a logistic map. However, compared with the general chaotic system, the fractional-order system has nonlocal character and high nonlinearity, and the encryption algorithm of fractional-order chaotic has higher security features [20, 28]. Compared with the general chaotic system, dynamic features of the memristor chaotic system depend not only on system parameters {{but also on the}} initial conditions of memristor retention internal state variables [29, 30]. However, the memristor chaotic systems are not widely used for image and data encryption algorithms. Therefore, to improve the safety performance of image encryption algorithm, in this paper, a color image encryption using a fractional-order 4 D hyperchaotic memristive system and DNA sequence operations is proposed.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to (13) C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is presented using cytosolic metabolite pool sizes and their (13) C labeling data from an isotopically non-stationary (13) C labeling experiment (INST-CLE). The procedure is demonstrated with an E. coli wild type strain grown at fed batch conditions. The intra cellular labeling dynamics are excited {{by a sudden}} step increase of the (13) C portion in the substrate feed. Due to unchanged saturation of the substrate uptake system, the metabolic fluxes remain constant during the following sampling time period of only 16 s, in which 20 samples are taken by an automated rapid sampling device immediately stopping metabolism by methanol quenching. Subsequent cell disruptive sample preparation and LC-MS/MS enabled simultaneous determination of pool sizes and mass isotopomers of intra cellular metabolites requiring detection limits in the nM range. Based on this data the new computational flux analysis tool 13 CFLUX/INST is {{used to determine the}} intra cellular fluxes based on a complex carbon labeling network model. The measured data is in good agreement with the model predictions, thus proving the applicability of the new isotopically non-stationary (13) C metabolic flux analysis (INST-(13) C-MFA) concept. Moreover, it is shown that significant new information with respect to flux identifiability, non-measurable pool sizes, data consistency, or large storage pools can be taken from the novel kind of experimental data. This offers new insight into the <b>biological</b> <b>operation</b> of the metabolic network in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The Scotia Sea is a {{sub-region}} of the Southern Ocean with {{a unique}} <b>biological</b> <b>operation,</b> including high rates of primary production, high abundances of Antarctic krill, and a diverse community of land-breeding predators. Trophic interactions link all species in an ecosystem into a network known as the food web. Theoretical analyses of trophic food webs, which are parameterised using diet composition data, offer useful tools to explore food web structure and operation. However, limitations in diet data can cause uncertainty in subsequent food web analyses. Therefore, this thesis had two aims: (i) to provide ecological insight into the Scotia Sea food web using theoretical analyses; and (ii) to identify, explore and ameliorate {{for the effects of}} some data limitations on these analyses. Therefore, in Chapter 2, I collated a set of diet composition data for consumers in the Scotia Sea, and highlighted its strengths and limitations. In Chapters 3 and 4, I constructed food web analyses to draw ecological insight into the Scotia Sea food web. I indicated the robustness of these conclusions to some of the assumptions I used to construct them. Finally, in Chapter 5, I constructed a probabilistic model of a penguin encountering prey to investigate changes in trophic interactions caused by the spatial and temporal variability of their prey. I show that natural variabilities, such as the spatial aggregation of prey into swarms, can explain observed foraging outcomes for this predator. Pressures caused by anthropogenically-driven changes to the earth’s climate may alter the community structure in the Scotia Sea. Furthermore, activities by commercial fisheries who operate in the Scotia Sea are increasing, which may impact on the food web. This thesis offers a baseline analysis of the Scotia Sea food web, which will be useful to assess changes to the ecosystem caused by future, external pressures...|$|E

40|$|Plant aliveness {{is proven}} through {{laboratory}} experiments and special scientific instruments. In this paper, {{we aim to}} detect the degree of animation of plants based on the magnification of the small color changes in the plant's green leaves using the Eulerian video magnification. Capturing the video under a controlled environment, e. g., using a tripod and direct current (DC) light sources, reduces camera movements and minimizes light fluctuations; we aim to reduce the external factors as much as possible. The acquired video is then stabilized and a proposed algorithm used to reduce the illumination variations. Lastly, the Euler magnification is utilized to magnify the color changes on the light invariant video. The proposed system does not require any special purpose instruments as it uses a digital camera with a regular frame rate. The results of magnified color changes on both natural and plastic leaves show that the live green leaves have color changes {{in contrast to the}} plastic leaves. Hence, we can argue that the color changes of the leaves are due to <b>biological</b> <b>operations,</b> such as photosynthesis.

The inventory is mostly based on plant-specific data, extrapolated from on-site measurements regarding mechanical and <b>biological</b> <b>operations</b> (including anaerobic digestion and composting of digestate). The combined treatment of 46, 929 tonnes of residual Municipal Solid Waste and 12, 158 tonnes of source-sorted biowaste (as treated in 2010 at the plant) generates 24, 550 tonnes CO 2 -eq as an impact on climate change, 69, 943 kg SO 2 -eq on terrestrial acidification and 19, 929 kg NMVOC-eq on photochemical oxidant formation, in a life-cycle perspective. On the contrary MBT induces environmental benefits in terms of fossil resource depletion, human toxicity (carcinogenic) and ecotoxicity. The results firstly highlight the relatively large contribution of some pollutants, such as CH 4, emitted at the plant and yet sometimes neglected in the LCA of waste MBT. Moreover this study identifies 4 plant-specific operation conditions which drive the environmental impact potentials induced by MBT: the conditions of degradation of the fermentable fraction, the collection of gaseous flows emitted from <b>biological</b> <b>operations,</b> the abatement of collected pollutants and NOx emissions from biogas combustion.

Comput. Biol. 8 (2001) 69; Genetics 163 (2003) 375; Genetics 111 (1985) 147) is to find a phylogenetic network that derives an input set of sequences, minimizing the number of recombinations used. No efficient, general algorithm is known for that problem. An efficient algorithm does exist for the problem when the network is constrained to be a “galled-tree”, and the ancestral sequence for the galled-tree is specified in advance (Proceedings of Second CSB Bioinformatics Conference, Los Alamitos, CA, 2003, IEEE Press, New York; J. Bioinform. Comput. Biol. 2 (1) (2004) 173; INFORMS J. Comput. 16 (2004) 459). However, the more biologically realistic case is that no ancestral sequence is known in advance, and the only previous algorithmic solution for that case takes exponential time. In this paper we give an efficient solution to the galled-tree problem when no ancestral sequence is known in advance, and show that the solution produced has very strong global optimality properties. We also indicate how these results generalize to other complex biological phenomena such as gene-conversion, lateral gene transfer, hybrid speciation, and back and recurrent mutation...|$|R
