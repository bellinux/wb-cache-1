5|$|A {{significant}} proportion of food waste is produced by the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste. Potatoes, <b>bread</b> <b>slices</b> and apples are respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion. A majority of wasted food is avoidable, with the rest being divided almost equally by foods which are unavoidable (e.g. tea bags) and unavoidable due to preference (e.g. bread crusts) or cooking type (e.g. potato skins).|$|E
5|$|The {{single largest}} {{producer}} of food {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is the domestic household. In 2007, households created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste – accounting for 19 per cent of all municipal solid waste. Potatoes account for the largest quantity of avoidable food disposed of; 359,000 tonnes per year are thrown away, 49 per cent (177,400 tonnes) of which are untouched. <b>Bread</b> <b>slices</b> account for the second food type most disposed of (328,000 tonnes per year), and apples the third (190,000 tonnes per year). Salad is disposed of in the greatest proportion - 45 per cent of all salad purchased by weight will be thrown away uneaten.|$|E
25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is named}} after The Great Gatsby, a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nobody really knows when or how the concept came about (even though many falsely laid {{claim to be the}} originators because of its popularity) except that it originated in various factories in and around in the 70s. It is believed that the workers from factories in and around Cape Town would share lunches and thus created sandwiches from whatever they had for lunch that day. As the French loaf allowed for extra filling space, they would prefer to use these over traditional <b>bread</b> <b>slices</b> that way it could also be easier shared amongst co-workers. A Gatsby is thus better enjoyed when shared and best served in its largest form.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sliced</b> <b>bread</b> is a loaf {{of bread}} which has been pre-sliced and {{packaged}} for commercial convenience. The automatic commercial <b>bread</b> <b>slicer</b> was invented in 1927 by Otto Frederick Rohwedder. His machine both sliced and wrapped {{a loaf of}} bread.

500|$|The modern beefsteak banquet hews fairly {{closely to}} the early-1900s model, {{although}} the expansive selections found at an old-fashioned [...] "West Side" [...] beefsteak have been tapered down to beef, fried potatoes, and tossed salad. Butter is sometimes replaced by margarine, and a pasta course makes an occasional appearance, but attendees at beefsteaks still expect to be fed mostly abundant quantities of beef tenderloin. Modern beefsteak attendees often follow an unspoken protocol to leave their <b>bread</b> <b>slices</b> uneaten. Piling them {{up in front of}} one's plate instead of consuming them [...] "saves valuable stomach capacity for more beef while simultaneously serving as an informal scorekeeping system".|$|E

5000|$|It {{is worth}} noting in passing that the term {{sandwich}} in British or Australian use always refers to a filling of any sort between two slices of bread: that is, <b>bread</b> <b>slices</b> from a loaf.

50|$|The {{industrialization}} of bread-baking was a formative step in {{the creation}} of the modern world. Otto Frederick Rohwedder is considered to be the father of <b>sliced</b> <b>bread.</b> In 1912 Rohwedder started work on inventing a machine that <b>sliced</b> <b>bread,</b> but bakeries were reluctant to use it since they were concerned the <b>sliced</b> <b>bread</b> would go stale. It was not until 1928, when Rohwedder invented a machine that both sliced and wrapped the <b>bread,</b> that <b>sliced</b> <b>bread</b> caught on. A bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri was the first to use this machine to produce <b>sliced</b> <b>bread.</b>|$|R

50|$|Modern {{versions}} of the pie-iron are commonly more domestic, if not necessarily more refined, with subdivisions allowing pairs of <b>bread</b> <b>slices</b> to be clamped together around fillings to form pockets or stuffed sandwiches.

5000|$|Rohwedder {{first had}} a brief career as a jeweler, and became the owner of three jewelry stores in St. Joseph. He used his work with watches and jewelry to invent new machines. Convinced he could develop a <b>bread</b> <b>slicing</b> machine, he sold his jewelry stores to fund the {{development}} effort and manufacture the machines.In 1917 a fire broke out at the factory where Rohwedder was manufacturing his machine.
