5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, {{so there was no}} way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass <b>break-outs</b> were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E
25|$|The Libyan Government {{rejected}} the allegations about Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency {{head of the}} Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation {{on the order of}} the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate <b>break-outs</b> prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.|$|E

At the end of the month [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] reached the top ten at Modern Rock - peaking at number 2 in August, and only leaving the top ten in September - as Garbage ascended into the top forty of the Billboard 200 for the first time.

50|$|Trend {{channels}} are traded by waiting for <b>break-out</b> failures, i.e. banking on the trend channel continuing, {{in which case}} at that bar's close, the entry stop is placed one tick away towards {{the centre of the}} channel above/below the <b>break-out</b> bar. Trading with the <b>break-out</b> only has a good probability of profit when the <b>break-out</b> bar is above average size, and an entry is taken only on confirmation of the <b>break-out.</b> The confirmation would be given when a pull-back from the <b>break-out</b> is over without the pull-back having retraced to the return line, so invalidating the plotted channel lines.|$|R
50|$|Also as an example, after a <b>break-out</b> of {{a trading}} range or a trend line, the market may {{return to the}} level of the <b>break-out</b> and then instead of rejoining the trading range or the trend, will reverse and {{continue}} the <b>break-out.</b> This is also known as 'confirmation'.|$|R
50|$|Introduced by {{the second}} summit in 2003, <b>break-out</b> groups are held {{concurrently}} {{with each other and}} allow more open discussion between participants on specific issues. These sessions also ensure that sufficient time is available during the summit for ministers to hold bilateral meetings. The <b>break-out</b> groups are strictly off-the-record so that officials could advance policy goals more freely. The <b>break-out</b> groups are usually chaired by a senior IISS staff member. By 2006, <b>break-out</b> group speaking slots are allocated only to ministers or senior officials from a delegation.|$|R

The British had placed ambushes or artillery concentrations on the routes the Japanese were to use. Hundreds of men drowned trying to cross the swollen Sittang on improvised bamboo floats and rafts. Burmese guerrillas and bandits killed stragglers east of the river. The <b>break-out</b> cost the Japanese nearly 10,000 men, half the strength of Twenty-Eighth Army.

50|$|If a {{trend line}} is plotted {{on the lower}} lows or the higher highs of a trend over a longer trend, a microtrend line is plotted when all or {{almost all of the}} highs or lows line up in a short multi-bar period. Just as <b>break-outs</b> from a normal trend are prone to fail as noted above, microtrend lines drawn on a chart are {{frequently}} broken by subsequent price action and these <b>break-outs</b> frequently fail too. Such a failure is traded by placing an entry stop order 1 tick above or below the previous bar, which would result in a with-trend position if hit, providing a low risk scalp with a target {{on the opposite side of}} the trend channel.|$|E
50|$|Once {{a trader}} has {{identified}} a trading range, i.e. {{the lack of}} a trend and a ceiling to the market's upward movement and a floor to any downward move, then the trader will use the ceiling and floor levels as barriers that the market can break through, with the expectation that the <b>break-outs</b> will fail and the market will reverse.|$|E

50|$|In stage lighting, a multicable (otherwise {{known as}} {{multi-core}} cable or mult) {{is a type}} of heavy-duty electrical cable used in theaters to power lights. The basic construction involves a bundle of individual conductors surrounded by a single outer jacket. Whereas single cables only have three conductors, multicable has ten or more. They are configured to run in six or eight-circuit varieties. Typically, both ends of multicable have a specific connector known as a Socapex Connector. Technicians then combine the cables with <b>break-outs</b> and break-ins, which essentially are an octopus-like adapter with one Socapex end and six to eight Edison, twist-lok, or stage pin style connectors.|$|E

Spider-Woman had Tigra insult Poltergeist enough to start a fight, in which they shorted out their specially designed prisons. Spider-Woman then had Gypsy Moth use her powers to swap their costumes. Tick-Tock did not foresee this change. Once placed in Gypsy Moth’s specific prison, Spider-Woman broke free and released everyone else. After everyone was free, Locksmith collapsed upon having a nervous breakdown. Gypsy Moth restrained Locksmith and Tick-Tock {{long enough for the}} authorities to collect them.|$|E

50|$|A {{price action}} trader's {{analysis}} may start with classical technical analysis, e.g. Edwards and Magee patterns including trend lines, <b>break-outs,</b> and pull-backs, which are broken down further and supplemented with extra bar-by-bar analysis, sometimes including volume. This observed price action gives the trader {{clues about the}} current and likely future behaviour of other market participants. The trader can explain why a particular pattern is predictive, in terms of bulls (buyers in the market), bears (sellers), the crowd mentality of other traders, change in volume and other factors. A good knowledge of the market's make-up is required. The resulting picture that a trader builds up will not only seek to predict market direction, but also speed of movement, duration and intensity, {{all of which is}} based on the trader's assessment and prediction of the actions and reactions of other market participants.|$|E
