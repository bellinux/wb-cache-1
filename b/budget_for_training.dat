The volunteers were used to staff nine infantry battalions and an artillery battalion. Each infantry battalion would be filled with 495 recruits on a one year tour of duty. Each battalion would be stiffened with a cadre of 22 trainers and 33 medical specialists from the Thai Army. The very size of the projected Unity force was a decided escalation in Thailand's commitment in the Laotian War. The Unity training was moved to a larger base near Kanchanaburi, Thailand, capable of housing four battalions at a time. There the Thais were trained by a staff of 44 U.S. Special Forces troops.

30|$|Another {{strand of}} {{literature}} considers a labor demand-induced impact of minimum wages on skill formation. Cahuc and Michel (1996) suppose {{that due to}} the implementation of a minimum wage, the wages of low-skilled employees tend to rise relative to those of high-skilled labor. Thus, the relative demand for low-skilled employees decreases while the relative demand for high-skilled employees increases. Consequently, this creates a labor demand-induced incentive for human capital accumulation of the low-skilled {{in order to meet the}} increased demand for high-skilled employment. However, such human capital accumulation could be realized outside the workplace on the own initiative of the employee. Hence, training at the workplace level could disregard the suggested theoretical channel of an additional human capital accumulation. Moreover, the authors mention that training subsidies may serve the same objective while avoiding the negative externalities such as unemployment, and such subsidies may cover some of both the employees’ and employers’ incentives for additional training. This mechanism may be relevant in our case, as the German Federal Government announced an additional <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> subsidies for unemployed and employees who are in danger of becoming unemployed shortly after the minimum wage was introduced.|$|E

This research {{contributes to the}} body of knowledge on insourcing an information system; exploring and discussing the enabling and inhibiting factors of the insourcing of an information system in selected government agencies in Malaysia. This study was undertaken in response to a paucity of similar projects and a limited literature focused on developing countries. It considers the post outsourcing context following the decision to insource a major Malaysian Government Information System in 2011. A qualitative research method was used to obtain empirical evidence from selected government agencies through 69 semi-structured interviews in two data collection periods: 2013 - 2014 and 2015. Interviews were conducted with civil servants at all levels, from senior management to clerical staff, including users of the government information system. By using coding principles from grounded theory to analyse the data, seven exciters and six inhibitors of insourcing a government information system were identified and mapped in the analytical framework. Further, this is the first research to use an enhanced model, devised by combining the OPTIMISM model and two distinct theoretical traditions: institutional theory and the capability approach; in order to analyse the insourcing of government information system adoption. The enhanced model was created by mapping the OPTIMISM model (that has a set of dimensions) to an analytical framework comprising the capability approach, institutional theory and technology (ICTs). The main research contribution of this thesis is in the area of capacity building of the internal development team.

40|$|The {{provision}} of HIV treatment and care in resource-limited settings is expanding rapidly. Health-worker training {{is one of}} many factors critical to the rapid scale-up of high-quality care [1 – 6]. Large numbers of health workers require HIV training; yet, few countries have a comprehensive training plan, a clear assessment of ongoing training needs, a plan to operationalize training on a large scale, or adequate funds <b>budgeted</b> <b>for</b> <b>training.</b> In this setting, an extensive variety of HIV-related training programs have sprung up over the past few years.

40|$|Skills {{development}} accounts, {{which are}} used in a voucher-based training program, represented 71 {{percent of the total}} <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> the unemployed in 2010, and will supposedly represent the whole training budget in 2011. This research examines the current conditions in the promotion of skills development accounts, and suggests future improvements. The research details and methods are as follows. First, the current status and performance were identified through an analysis of statistical data released by the Ministry of Employment and Labor, and HRD-Net data. Second, case studies for Germany and the U. S. were conducted with regard to the evaluation of training courses and the assessment of training institutions. Third, professional conferences were held, in which officials of the Ministry of Employment and Labor, and Job Centers, experts, and training institutions participated. Fourth, interviews with those involved in training institutions were conducted to identify the problems related to the quality of training. Based on the analysis, suggestions for future improvements were made as follows, beginning with the aspect of the trainees. First, raising the level of expenses borne by trainees who participate in training provided by training institutions to which the government has given poor ratings can be a mechanism {{to improve the quality of}} vocational training services. Second, a possible alternative to facilitate trainee awareness that the skills development account is their right is to impose a lifetime ceiling on training cost as is done in the U. S., rather than supporting training without limitation as in the current system. Third, though a trainee selection system is being prepared, such as reinforcing Commission for Account Issuance, further strengthening of standards for skills development account issuance is required to select trainees aiming at employment. It is also necessary to operate skills development accounts as a program not for all unemployed, but for the long-term unemployed for 3 ～ 6 months after registering for employment, or to selectively operate the system targeting those who are not employed. Fourth, it is known many participants pursue a kind of ‘training shopping’, and some of these participants do not complete the training. Therefore, it may be necessary to reduce the limit cost of skills development accounts and restrict training courses. The next point is related to training institutions and training courses. First, the motivation of training institutions to prepare quality management systems needs to be reinforced. For example, it is necessary to introduce an incentive program in which additional points are given to the training institutions that adopt a quality management system such as ISO. Second, it is necessary to allow only those training institutions with certain evaluation ratings to open training courses using skills development accounts. Third, employment rate and employment retention rate should be reflected in the evaluation of the suitability of training courses for skills development accounts, in order to encourage training institutions to pursue best practices as they face increasing difficulties in guidance, management and supervision due to the expansion in the number of training institutions and courses. Fourth, suitable training courses for skills development accounts should be acknowledged according to the demand of the labor market. Fifth, the method of evaluating the suitability of training courses for skills development accounts needs to shift from the current centralized approach to an approach focusing on local employment centers. Sixth, to activate the education and training market through the co-existence of training financially supported by the government and general paid training, it is necessary to reflect the capability of conducting general paid training in the evaluation of the suitability of training courses for skills development accounts. Seventh, it is critical to introduce minimum standards in order to provide counseling for trainees in evaluating the suitability of training courses for skills development accounts, and to increase the weight of employment performance and trainee counseling in assessing training institutions. The final point is related to the government. First, the utilization of records management needs to be enhanced. Training records of skills development accounts is managed in the Human Resource Development Training Information Network(HRD-net) of the Ministry of Employment and Labor. The utilization of the records needs to be reinforced, as those records can be an important basic background for r？sum？sto be submitted to companies, as well as training records that are utilized in foreign countries. Second, it is necessary to examine the introduction of training accreditation to improve the prior evaluation and assessment of the suitability of training courses for skills development accounts. 2008 년부터 시작된 직업능력개발계좌제의 당초 정책목표를 달성하면서 제도를 안착시키기 위해서는 직업능력개발계좌제를 둘러싼 각종 문제점들에 대한 개선이 지속적으로 이루어져야 할 필요가 있다. 이 연구에서는 지금까지의 직업능력개발계좌제 추진과정에서 나타나고 있는 현황들을 살펴보면서, 향후 전반적인 개선방향들을 제시하고자 한다. 정부의 훈련품질 제고 관련 주요 정책수단인 적합훈련과정의 심사 및 개설 현황에 대한 분석, 기존의 훈련기관 평가현황 분석, 외국의 훈련품질 제고 관련 사례 분석을 중심으로 계좌제의 성공을 좌우하게 되는 직업훈련의 품질개선을 위한 정책방안을 중점적으로 제시하고자 한다. ○ 주요내용 - 훈련참여 및 수료, 취업 등 직업능력개발계좌제의 추진현황 분석 - 자기부담률 조정에 따른 훈련수요의 변화 및 훈련참여자 의사 분석 - 훈련과정 심사 및 훈련기관 평가 사례 분석 - 외국 바우처제도의 품질관리 사례 분석 - 개선 방안요 약 제 1 장 서론 제 1 절 연구의 필요성 및 목적 1 제 2 절 연구내용 및 연구방법 3 제 3 절 연구범위 4 제 2 장 직업능력개발계좌제 추진현황 제 1 절 추진실적현황 7 1. 예산집행 8 2. 계좌발급 및 훈련실적 9 제 2 절 자부담비율 조정 관련 사례 및 의견조사결과 16 1. 근로자자율적능력개발제도 사례(2005 ～ 2008 년) 검토 16 2. 자부담비율 조정 관련 훈련생 의견조사결과 35 제 3 절 소결 42 제 3 장 직업능력개발계좌제 훈련 참여와 취업실태 제 1 절 분석 개요 45 제 2 절 계좌발급과 훈련참여 49 1. 계좌발급자 추이(’ 08. 9 ～’ 10. 5) 49 2. 3 개월 훈련참여율과 첫 훈련까지의 기간(’ 08. 9 ～’ 10. 2) 54 제 3 절 훈련 이수와 취업 59 1. 훈련참여율과 순훈련수료율 59 2. 계좌발급 후 첫 훈련참여까지의 기간 64 3. 훈련횟수 67 4. 취업률 70 제 4 절 소결 74 제 4 장 직업능력개발계좌제 품질관리제도 현황 제 1 절 적합훈련과정 심사제도 77 1. 심사절차와 심사기준 77 2. 심사결과 개요 92 3. 심사의 문제와 개선방안 94 제 2 절 훈련기관 평가제도 97 1. 계좌제 훈련기관과 훈련기관 평가 97 2. 계좌제 훈련기관 평가 101 제 3 절 소결 107 1. 요약 107 2. 시사점과 개선방안 109 제 5 장 외국 바우처제도의 품질관리제도 사례 제 1 절 외국의 훈련품질관리 개관 113 제 2 절 독일의 품질관리 사례 116 1. 직업교육훈련품질 논의의 역사와 계좌제 훈련 품질관리체제의특성 116 2. 공급측 품질관리 124 4. 수요측 품질관리 138 5. 요약 144 제 3 절 미국의 품질관리 사례 147 1. 훈련생 선발: 훈련적격자 판단 147 2. 훈련기관 관리 및 훈련비 150 3. 지역별 적합직업훈련과정 선정 153 4. 적합훈련과정 선정 시 노동시장성과 관련기준 159 제 4 절 소결 161 제 6 장 논의 및 개선방안 제 1 절 훈련생 관련 166 제 2 절 훈련기관 및 훈련과정 관련 168 제 3 절 정부 관련 170 SUMMARY 173 직업능력개발계좌제 직업훈련참여자 설문조사지 179 제 3 장의 상세표 183 참고문헌 18...|$|E

Research question 6 - What topics are addressed during RA training programs at CCCU institutions? In summary, this research project yielded descriptive data that offers insights into RA training programs at member schools of the CCCU. This research revealed that resident directors are utilized more frequently than others in RA training and only 24. 5 % of respondent schools offer an academic course for RAs. There was also a high degree of similarity in topics addressed in RA training. These data should be valuable to member schools in making comparisons of their particular training programs to others...|$|R

Tang believed in investing in his staff, as his frontline staff would {{be the ones who}} would be in direct contact with the customers and he believed that the image of the store depended on them. As a result, Tang reserved a substantial annual <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> staff <b>training,</b> which included tailored programs for sales staff, supervisors and management. Supervisors and managers were expected to undergo a minimum 100 hours of training. Tang also made an effort {{to get in touch with}} his staff at all levels, in order understand his customers' expectations on product and service quality. Despite the company's poor financial results in certain years, Tangs retained its reputation for good service and reliability.|$|R

To attempt to reduce these work-related injuries, billions of dollars are being <b>budgeted</b> <b>for</b> formal <b>training</b> in the U. S. However, the outcomes of this training are below a satisfactory level. The majority of organizations utilize the Four-level Evaluation Model to evaluate their training program. However, previous studies have pointed out some limitations regarding this evaluation model. Moreover, most organizations collect only trainee reaction, the first level of the Four-level Evaluation Model, to determine the effectiveness of their training program. Many studies reveal that trainee reaction is an invalid indicator to determine the effectiveness of a training program, and further suggest multi-dimensional categorization within each level of the Four-level Evaluation. Therefore, in this study, the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy was employed to enable multidimensional categorization of learning outcomes in a lifting and lowering training program. The learning outcomes of interest in such a training program relate to procedural knowledge and the cognitive process involved are categorized as remembering, understanding, applying, an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the downlink precoding for physical layer multicasting in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We study the max-min fairness (MMF) problem, where channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter {{is used to}} design precoding vectors that maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system, given fixed power <b>budgets</b> <b>for</b> uplink <b>training</b> and downlink transmission. Our system model accounts for channel estimation, pilot contamination, arbitrary pathlosses, and multi-group multicasting. We consider six scenarios with different transmission technologies (unicast and multicast), different pilot assignment strategies (dedicated or shared pilot assignments), and different precoding schemes (maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing), and derive achievable spectral efficiencies for all possible combinations. Then we solve the MMF problem {{for each of these}} scenarios and for any given pilot length we find the SE maximizing uplink pilot and downlink data transmission policies, all in closed-forms. We use these results to draw a general guideline for massive MIMO multicasting design, where for a given number of base station antennas, number of users, and coherence interval length, we determine the multicasting scheme that shall be used...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{privacy is}} a cryptographically {{motivated}} definition of privacy which has gained considerable {{attention in the}} algorithms, machine-learning and data-mining communities. While {{there has been an}} explosion of work on differentially private machine learning algorithms, a major barrier to achieving end-to-end dif-ferential privacy in practical machine learning applications is the lack of an ef-fective procedure for differentially private parameter tuning, or, determining the parameter value, such as a bin size in a histogram, or a regularization parameter, that is suitable for a particular application. In this paper, we introduce a generic validation procedure for differentially private machine learning algorithms that apply when a certain stability condition holds on the training algorithm and the validation performance metric. The training data size and the privacy <b>budget</b> used <b>for</b> <b>training</b> in our procedure is independent of the number of parameter values searched over. We apply our generic procedure to two fundamental tasks in statistics and machine-learning – training a regularized linear classifier and building a histogram density estimator that result in end-to-end differentially private solutions for these problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{systems are}} being {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} cheaper alternative to field training, and as the Services put such systems into place, acquisition managers must add new methods to the traditional technical performance measures to assess {{the effectiveness of these}} training systems. T oday each Service has acquisition programs under way to provide distributed-simulation systems <b>for</b> the collective <b>training</b> needs of military organizational units. Because <b>budgets</b> <b>for</b> collective <b>training</b> are tight, one common objective is to maintain or raise unit performance by acquiring comparatively less expensive distributed-simulation training systems to lessen the need for more expensive field training. Trading field <b>training</b> <b>for</b> distributedsimulation <b>training</b> systems puts pressure on the acquisition community to ensure that the acquired systems are successfully fielded and achieve technical performance objectives. Assessing those objectives may require newly developed measures of performance that mean the same to 19 the acquisition, supporting, and using communities. The research detailed here examines technical performance measures <b>for</b> distributed-simulation <b>training</b> system acquisitions used <b>for</b> collective <b>training</b> of military units. We discuss the importance of these systems to the acquisition community, using the Army’s Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) as an example. We identify potentially relevant technical performance measures. And finally, we analyze the applicability of the identified technical performance measures during an actual distributed-simulation training system exercise. Findings are generalized to other such systems used <b>for</b> collective <b>training</b> of military organizational units. THE CLOSE COMBAT TACTICAL TRAINER Historically, to avoid poor unit performance in combat, military units have focused on training unit tasks through field exercises. With declining budgets, the Services are acquiring distributedsimulation systems that are perceived to be able to train units more cheaply than do field exercises. All the Services and many joint organizations are acquiring these systems. Under the direction of the Under Secretar...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{government}} decided in 1994, {{as part of}} the so-called 50, 000 Swedish crowns scheme, to set aside a portion of the labour market <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> the further <b>training</b> and retraining of local government and country council employees. The present article reports on the experiences of the training effort that took place in 1994 – 1995 and provides a theoretical framework <b>for</b> discussing staff <b>training</b> as an alternative to redundancies in the case of “economic overstuffing” and as part of a strategy for lifelong learning. Staff training and further development can be viewed as direct labour market measures instead of as redundancies. This article is based on a large empirical study in municipalities and county councils that have used these measures. In the study it was shown that these market measures can be defended both economically and humanly in the sense that both contribute to strengthening internal mobility and increasing the worker's adaptability to the external labour market. At the same time, this conform part of a strategy for a more flexible structuring of working time...|$|R
40|$|Conspectus is an instrument, an {{assessment}} methodology and a consortia database which enables providing optimum patron specific access model for resource sharing among libraries. It helps making more informed decisions regarding acquisitions, collection development, fund allocations, budget requests, grants and preservation. A systematic "conspectus" provides many indirect benefits like i) filling-in {{gaps in the}} collection, ii) justifying use of approval plans; identifying subject areas where curricular changes dictate that the library starts or stops buying materials, iii) justifying a grant application or <b>budget</b> increase <b>for</b> <b>training,</b> preservation or collection development, iv) defining possibilities for increased cooperative acquisitions among local or regional libraries in subject areas of mutual interest, v) fulfilling institutional or state mandated assessment programs, vi) providing 'objective evidence' for accreditation and professional association reports, vii) defining collection development objectives, policies, procedures and short and long range goals. The paper provides a birds-eye-view of conspectus methodology, its role in collection development, collection evaluation and resource sharing {{as well as some}} problems and pitfalls in adoption of conspectus methodology. Lastly, concludes by emphasising the need for awareness about conspectus methodology among local professionals and some sincere attempts to create such access tools rather than satisfied with acronyms of library networks...|$|R
