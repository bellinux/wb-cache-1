A script that the main voice actors were reading from during a rehearsal had the line fully capitalized, with the first syllable extended ("daaaaddy!"), so Alan knew to put particular emphasis on the line when {{it was in a}} script.

500|$|Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a biopic of Ed Wood when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood, The Man in the Angora Sweater in his sophomore year at USC. However, Karaszewski figured, [...] "there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> on the planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren't the sort of movies that are made." [...] Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films for their work on Problem Child and Problem Child 2, Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page film treatment for Ed Wood and pitched the idea to Heathers director Michael Lehmann, with whom they attended USC film school. The basis for their treatment came from Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy, a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues. Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on Heathers, Denise Di Novi. Di Novi had previously worked with Tim Burton on Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{popularity}} of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by Bai Juyi. Murasaki taught Chinese to Shōshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Shōshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters. The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, {{was one of the few}} women available to teach Shōshi classical Chinese. Bowring writes it was [...] "almost subversive" [...] that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Shōshi. Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, [...] "Since last summer... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> about, I have been reading with Her Majesty... There has of course been no question of formal lessons... I have thought it best to say nothing about the matter to anybody." ...|$|E
500|$|The Japanese and English {{portrayals of}} Spike have also drawn praise individually. While praising the Japanese cast as [...] "perfectly {{complementing}} the characters", Kenneth Lee of EX.org argued that [...] "there could <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else {{to fill the}} role of Spike Spiegel except Yamadera". Meanwhile, IGN's Ramsey Isler stated that [...] "Steve Blum launched his career into new heights when he gave {{the performance of a}} lifetime in the English dub of the series, giving Spike a sense of smooth, effortless cool that many argue surpassed the original Japanese version." [...] Commending the principal American cast's work {{as one of the best}} English dubs, Serdar Yegulalp of About.com highlighted Blum as Spike as the standout performance of the series, stating that [...] "Cynicism never sounded this suave or self-assured". However, AnimeNation's John Oppliger felt Spike's character was mishandled in the English dub, where he was depicted as a [...] "carefree playboy" [...] whose ambivalent taunts [...] "come across as casual off-the-cuff bluffs, unlike his weighty, solemn statements in the Japanese version". Blum himself has called Spike a [...] "gigantic benchmark" [...] in his career and life, saying that [...] "Spike changed everything" [...] for him. He stated that his role as Spike opened up new opportunities for voicing characters, including T.O.M. on Toonami and Jamie on Megas XLR.|$|E

2500|$|And Then There Were None (1943 play) is Christie's {{adaptation}} of the story for the stage. She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> left to tell the story. Thus, she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and {{fall in love with}} each other. Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General Macarthur became General McKenzie (possibly due to the real-life General Douglas MacArthur's then playing a prominent role in the ongoing World War II [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{separation}} of powers is founded {{on the basis of}} constitutionalism. The notion of constitutionalism is primarily one of culture. Lawrence W. Beer proposed in Constitutional Systems in the Late Twentieth Century Asia (1992) that constitutionalism is where [...] "national history, custom, religion, social values and assumptions about government meet positive law, economic force and power politics". As a result, the notion of constitutionalism differs from region to region and there can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> specific notion of constitutionalism across the world. As Thio Li-ann puts it, [...] "constitutionalism is itself a form of culture which is constructed, rather than 'organic'; a constitutional order is the 'most complex form of socio-political organisation'".|$|E

Also in the series, and in French, Asher tells Jean-Claude that he chose Julianna as a human servant to secure Jean-Claude's love and companionship. Asher's servant was chosen to appeal to and keep Jean-Claude in Asher's life. Jean-Claude begged the High Council to save Asher in exchange for 100 years of servitude. Jean-Claude would rather Asher live and hate him than die. As Julianna burned, she screamed not for Asher, but for Jean-Claude to save her, up to the very last she believed he would rescue her.|$|E
2500|$|The Telegram House was {{occupied}} on March 14. On {{the night of}} March 15 British troops began to occupy the key buildings and arrest Turkish nationalists. It was a very messy operation. The 10th division and military music school resisted the arrest. At least 10 students were killed by gunfire from British Indian troops. The total death toll is unknown. On March 18 the Ottoman parliament met and sent a protest to allies; [...] "it was unacceptable to arrest five of its members" [...] declared the parliament. This {{marked the end of}} the Ottoman Political system. The British move on the parliament left the Sultan as sole controller of the Empire; without parliament the Sultan stood alone with the British. Beginning with March 18, the Sultan become the puppet of the British foreign department, saying, [...] "There would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> left to blame for what will be coming soon"; the Sultan revealed his own version of the declaration of dissolution on April 11, after approximately 150 politicians were exiled to Malta.|$|E
2500|$|On July 30, a four-judge {{panel of}} the Second Department of the Appellate Division ruled that Ravitch [...] "can {{continue}} serving as lieutenant governor pending a legal challenge over his appointment – but he cannot preside over the State Senate." [...] A hearing was held on August 18 before the Appellate Division's Second Dept. in Brooklyn, at which lawyers for both sides presented oral arguments. David Lewis, attorney for Dean Skelos and the Republican Senate caucus, likened the appointment of Ravitch to the Roman Emperor Caligula’s naming of his horse to public office. Justice Thomas A. Dickerson said that [...] "there is to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> who is appointed to take this office." [...] Justice Steven W. Fisher said he expected the Court to rule as soon as possible, referring the case directly to the New York Court of Appeals. On August 20, the Appellate Division rejected the appointment, saying that [...] "the Governor’s purported appointment of Mr. Ravitch was unlawful because no provision of the Constitution or of any statute provides for the filling of a vacancy {{in the office of}} lieutenant governor other than by election." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1692, {{upon his}} return from being held {{prisoner}} by the Portuguese, Fritz discovered that an Omagua cult had grown up around claims that he possessed supernatural powers related to curing, rites of passage, {{and the movement of}} rivers, and a belief that Fritz himself was immortal. During his absence, in June 1690, a massive earthquake occurred, which was attributed by the Indians to the anger of their deities at Fritz's imprisonment. Rumors also spread that the Portuguese had cut Fritz into pieces, but that he had miraculously reassembled himself. Some of these beliefs, however, portrayed Fritz as evil. Following a solar eclipse in June 1695, an Aisuari chief sent gifts to Fritz with a message begging him not to extinguish the sun. On a more practical note, many of the Indians viewed the presence of Spanish missionaries as protection against the Portuguese, who were subjecting indigenous communities to forced labor. Fritz understood that the Indians viewed him as different from other Europeans—more kindly and patient, less self-serving, and not exploitative, in addition to being very possibly immortal. Once, when talking about the afterlife, he was interrupted by an Aisuari chief who said that Fritz could surely never die, because then there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to serve as their [...] "Father, Lover and Protector." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} {{of the same year}} (540), the Sassanids invaded Byzantine areas. They avoided the fortresses of Mesopotamia, heading for the easier targets of Syria and Cilicia. Bouzes was {{stationed}} at Hierapolis {{at the beginning of this}} campaign season. By mid-summer, the Sassanids had captured Sura. Bouzes left Hierapolis at the head of his best troops. He promised to return if the city came under Persian threat, but Procopius accuses Bouzes of simply vanishing, with neither the Hierapolitans or the Sassanids able to locate him. [...] "Bouzes therefore at first remained at Hierapolis, keeping his whole army with him; but when he learned what had befallen Sura, he called together the first men of the Hierapolitans and spoke as follows: [...] "Whenever men are confronted with a struggle against an assailant with whom they are evenly matched in strength, it is not at all unreasonable that they should engage in open conflict with the enemy; but for those who are by comparison much inferior to their opponents it will be more advantageous to circumvent their enemy by some kind of tricks than to array themselves openly against them and thus enter into foreseen danger. How great, now, the army of Chosroes is, you are assuredly informed. And if, with this army, he wishes to capture us by siege, and if we carry on the fight from the wall, it is probable that, while our supplies will fail us, the Persians will secure all they need from our land, where there will <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to oppose them. And if the siege is prolonged in this way, I believe too that the fortification wall will not withstand the assaults of the enemy, for in many places it is most susceptible to attack, and thus irreparable harm will come to the Romans. But if with a portion of the army we guard the wall of the city, while the rest of us occupy the heights about the city, we shall make attacks from there at times upon the camp of our antagonists, and at times upon those who are sent out for the sake of provisions, and thus compel Chosroes to abandon the siege immediately and to make his retreat within a short time; for he will not be at all able to direct his attack without fear against the fortifications, nor to provide any of the necessities for so great an army." [...] So spoke Bouzes; and in his words he seemed to set forth the advantageous course of action, but of what was necessary he did nothing. For he chose out all that portion of the Roman army which was of marked excellence and was off. And where in the world he was, neither any of the Romans in Hierapolis, nor the hostile army was able to learn." ...|$|E
