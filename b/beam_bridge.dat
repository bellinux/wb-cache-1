5|$|One of {{the most}} common bridge-types built during the Han was the wooden-trestle <b>beam</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{described}} by literary sources and seen in reliefs carved on tomb bricks. Evidence for arch bridges is elusive: one outside of Chengdu's south gate is claimed to date to the Han period, while that built by Ma Xian (馬賢) (fl. 135 CE) was certainly a <b>beam</b> <b>bridge.</b> In artwork, a relief sculpture from a Han tomb in Sichuan province shows an arch bridge with a gradual curve, suggesting that it is segmental, although the use of such bridges are not entirely confirmed. Although there are rare references to simple suspension bridges in Han sources, these are only mentioned in connection with travels to foreign countries in the Himalaya, Hindukush and Afghanistan, demonstrating the antiquity of the invention there. Floating pontoon bridges made of boats secured by iron chains were built during the Han (some even spanning the Yellow River and Yangzi River) and were most often employed for military purposes since they could be easily assembled and then disassembled.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, a 48.9-foot-long {{concrete}} tee <b>beam</b> <b>bridge</b> was built; {{this bridge}} carries Hollow Ave over Leggetts Creek. In 1979, a 37.1-foot-long prestressed box beam or girders bridge was built; it carries Mary Street across the creek. A 44.9-foot-long {{bridge of the}} same type {{was built in the}} same year and carries Wells Street over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long bridge of a similar type was built in 2009 and carries T-422/Burcher Ave over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was built in 2010 and carries State Route 1027/Layton Road over the creek.|$|E
5|$|The GLC's {{solution}} entailed adding two concrete piers in {{the middle}} of the river to support the central span and thus transform the bridge's central section into a <b>beam</b> <b>bridge.</b> The bridge's main girder was also strengthened, and a lightweight replacement deck was laid. The modifications were intended to be a stopgap measure to extend the bridge's life by five years while a replacement was being considered; in the GLC's estimation the work would last for a maximum of 30years, but the bridge would need to be either closed or replaced well before then.|$|E

40|$|Adjacent box <b>beam</b> <b>bridges</b> in Indiana are {{not meeting}} their design life due to {{premature}} deterioration of shear keys and prestressing strands. Cracked shear key joints between box beams allow chloride-laden water to migrate through the superstructure and initiate corrosion. As a result, load distribution between box beams may be reduced, promoting independent beam action and differential deflections. Furthermore, loss of strands from corrosion has serious consequences on the flexural {{capacity of the}} bridge. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the evolution of box beam design in Indiana to understand the lack of performance and durability. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) standards and bridge design manuals were reviewed to track the historical development of box <b>beam</b> <b>bridges</b> in the State. Two timelines were produced tracking important updates to box beam design. Adjacent box <b>beam</b> <b>bridges</b> within INDOT’s bridge database were also analyzed. Superstructure ratings were compared with bridge age as well as bridge characteristics to highlight possible causes for deterioration. Analyzing the INDOT inventory, data shows that the condition of adjacent box <b>beam</b> <b>bridges</b> may be affected by location, type of wearing surface, and the use of deck membranes. Six bridges were then inspected to identify common deficiencies and specific problems. Exterior beams and beams within the wheel load path tend to have higher levels of deterioration. Furthermore, leaking joints between beams lead to corrosion of reinforcement ultimately resulting in spalling, fracture of prestressing strands, and loss of structural capacity. ...|$|R
5|$|The Albert Bridge is a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, {{it proved to be}} structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple <b>beam</b> <b>bridge.</b> As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{a number}} of other bridges have been built across Raven Creek. A {{concrete}} tee <b>beam</b> <b>bridge</b> was built across the creek in 1928. Another bridge was built across it in 1950 and three more were built between 1958 and 1963. A prestressed box <b>beam</b> <b>bridge</b> was built in 1968. A steel culvert bridge and a concrete culvert bridge were built across the creek in 1974 and 1976, respectively and another bridge was built in 2011.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Benning Bridge was rebuilt as a <b>beam</b> <b>bridge</b> on {{concrete}} piers. That same year, the Corps of Engineers transferred ownership of Anacostia Park, Kingman and Heritage islands, and Kingman Lake to the National Park Service. The Park Service also proposed extending East Capitol Street onto the reclaimed land {{and then over}} the Anacostia River, and building a complex of sports stadiums, an armory, an outdoor theater, a swimming pool, an ice skating rink, and athletic fields on the flats. Legislation proposing a bridge across Kingman Island and stadium complex in Anacostia Park was submitted to Congress, which did not act on the proposals. The first nine holes of Langston Golf Course were built on {{the north end of}} Kingman Island in 1939, and the back nine on the lake's western shore in 1955.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the bridges}} that he {{designed}} is the Mosteirô bridge, a continuous truss frame beam, and the S.João railway bridge, a continuous structure one thousand metres in length. He made portico-shaped bridges and suspended bridges over the Zambezi River and Save River in Mozambique, and trussed <b>beam</b> <b>bridges,</b> over the Mondego river in Figueira da Foz, over the Kwanza river in Angola, over the Limpopo river in Xai-Xai, and in Macau. His big span concrete arcs, {{as on the}} Arrábida bridge (Porto), and in re-reinforced concrete porticos, as on the S. João railway bridge, achieved world records for that time. Since trussed <b>beam</b> <b>bridges,</b> as the Figueira da Foz bridge, the first Portuguese trussed <b>beams</b> <b>bridge,</b> until suspended <b>bridges</b> without rigidity <b>beam,</b> stabilized by the suspended cable and the inclination of kingpost whole rigidity, as in Zambeze bridge, Edgar Cardoso branded by the difference the structures engineering evolution.
