At international borders, Xcm was detected at 17 % in Malaba, 32 % at Mutukula, 33 % in Busia, 42 % at Katuna/Kamwezi, 44 % Mpondwe and 62 % Mpanga. About 13 % of the inoculated plants exhibited symptoms typical of Xcm infection. Xcm survived for up to six months, with colony counts of 25. 3 cfu/gm, 23. 1 cfu/gm and 20. 0 cfu/gm in the peel, pulp and rachis, respectively. This study demonstrated that Xcm is carried in traded banana materials over long distances and across borders. The pathogen can survive in the peel and rachis from markets up to 6 months and therefore these organs may act as sources of inocula for new infections.

40|$|<b>Banana</b> <b>finger</b> drop {{is defined}} as {{dislodgement}} of individual fruits from the hand at the pedicel rupture area. For some banana varieties, {{this is a major}} feature of the ripening process, in addition to ethylene production and sugar metabolism. The few studies devoted to assessing the physiological and molecular basis of this process revealed (i) the similarity between this process and softening, (ii) the early onset of related molecular events, between the first and fourth day after ripening induction, and (iii) the putative involvement of ethylene as a regulatory factor. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying, through a candidate gene approach, a quality-related marker that {{could be used as a}} tool in breeding programmes. Here we examined the relationship between ripening ethylene biosynthesis (EB) and finger drop in order to gain further insight into the upstream regulatory steps of the <b>banana</b> <b>finger</b> drop process and to identify putative related candidate genes. Methods Postharvest ripening of green banana fruit was induced by acetylene treatment and fruit taken at 1 - 4 days after ripening induction, and total RNA extracted from the median area [control zone (CZ) ] and the pedicel rupture area [drop zone (DZ) ] of peel tissue. Then the expression patterns of EB genes (MaACO 1, MaACO 2, MaACS 1, MaACS 2, MaACS 3 and MaACS 4) were comparatively examined in CZ and DZ via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Principal results Differential expression of EB gene was observed in CZ and DZ during the postharvest period examined in this study. MaACO 1, MaACS 2 and MaACS 1 were more highly induced in DZ than in the control, while a slight induction of the MaACS 4 gene was observed. No marked differences between the two zones were observed for the MaACO 2 gene. Conclusions The finger drop process enhanced EB gene expression including developmental- and ripeninginduced genes (MaACO 1), specific ripening-induced genes (MaACS 1) and wound-induced.

Concomitantly, 11 ethylene signal transduction components (ESTC) and 6 MADS box gene expressions were comparatively studied in median (control zone, CZ) and pedicel rupture (drop zone DZ) areas in peel tissue. iMG fruit did not ripen or develop finger drop while eMG and lMG fruits displayed a similar finger drop pattern. Several ESTC and MADS box gene mRNAs were differentially induced in DZ and CZ and sequentially in eMG and lMG fruits. MaESR 2, 3 and MaEIL 1, MaMADS 2 and MaMADS 5 {{had a higher}} mRNA level in eMG and acted earlier, whereas MaERS 1, MaCTR 1, MaEIL 3 /AB 266319, MaEIL 4 /AB 266320 and MaEIL 5 /AB 266321, MaMADS 4 {{and to a lesser}} extent MaMADS 2 and 5 acted later in lMG. In this fruit, MaERS 1 and 3, MaCTR 1, MaEIL 3, 4 and MaEIL 5 /AB 266321, and MaMADS 4 were enhanced by finger drop, suggesting their specific involvement in this process. MaEIL 1, MaMADS 1 and 3, induced at comparable levels in DZ and CZ, are probably related to the overall fruit ripening process.

40|$|<b>Banana</b> <b>finger</b> drop is a {{dislodgement}} {{of individual}} fruits from the {{hand at the}} pedicel area. Recent findings led us to suggest developmental cues as additional factors, beside ethylene, acting to control the finger drop process. Assuming that this developmental control involved MADS-box components as shown in other fruit, we analyzed here the MADS-box gene expression in the median (control zone, CZ) and pedicel rupture (drop zone, DZ) areas of the peel tissue from banana harvested at different physiological stages. In immature fruits, the mRNA level of MaMADS 1, MaMADS 2 and MaMADS 6 genes were transitorily enhanced in DZ as compared to control. In early mature green fruit, MaMADS 2 and MaMADS 5 mRNA were highly and transitorily induced in the DZ, with a peak observed at day 2, {{as compared to the}} CZ. MaMADS 2, MaMADS 3 and MaMADS 4 mRNA accumulated at comparable levels in both zones. In late mature green fruit, all MaMADS genes were transiently and differentially induced according to the peel zone, except MaMADS 6 that increased slightly without any marked change in CZ and DZ. The MaMADS 3 mRNA level was comparable in both zones while that of MaMDAS 4 was enhanced in DZ. In banana fruit, MaMADS box genes may participate in this sequence of events with MaMADS 2 and MaMADS 4, {{and to a lesser extent}} MaMADS 5, being associated with finger drop. They act sequentially to control the process, with MaMADS 2 and MaMADS 5 beginning earlier and MaMADS 4 acting later. Findings offer insights regarding upstream regulatory factors and roles of MADS genes associated with finger drop. For improving banana quality traits, comparative analysis of MADS box genes expression enables selecting candidate genes for molecular marker identification.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{major problem}} in post-harvest {{handling}} of bananas is the individual detachment of the fruit from the hands. This study aimed to establishing the relationship between carbohydrate concentration and enzyme activity in the pedicel region of three cultivars of bananas, resistant and susceptible to natural dropping, during post-harvest ripening, and the susceptibility of <b>bananas</b> to <b>finger</b> dropping. Cultivars ‘Terra’ (plantain, AAB group) and ‘Prata’ (banana, AAB group) triploids and the ‘Prata Graúda’ (banana, AAAB group) tetraploid were used. The experiment was distributed in split plots, with three plots (cultivars) and five subplots (peel color stages) in a completely randomized design with three replications and three fruits per sample unit. ‘Terra’ showed resistance to dropping, even though the fruit were ripe, unlike ‘Prata Graúda’, which, starting from the fifth stage (yellow fruit with green tips), exhibited high susceptibility to dropping. At all ripening stages, the ‘Terra’ had the highest dry mass levels. In turn, the ‘Prata Graúda’ always maintained the lowest levels. The ‘Terra’ showed decreasing levels of pectins during ripening, whereas starch remained high even in the ripe fruit. About the enzymes studied, the results confirmed the increased resistance of the ‘Terra’ to dropping, allowing to conclude that polygalacturonase (PG) and pectinametylesterase (PME) are the key enzymes for the solubilization of the cell wall that accompanies ripening, thus playing {{a critical role in}} inducing natural dropping. The high susceptibility of the ’Prata Graúda’ to dropping is associated with the high activity of PG and PME and the low levels of dry mass; the greater resistance of the ‘Terra’ to dropping is related to higher accumulation of dry mass and starch in the pedicel...|$|R

This particular offtype is the most commonly encountered from micropropagated Lady Finger plants and, in 2 instances, blocks of 3000 and 1500 plants were entirely comprised of this single offtype. Detection of offtype plants was possible during establishment and growth of plants in the glasshouse by the presence of chlorotic streaks in the leaves. In more severe cases the streaks coalesced into chlorotic patches that developed thin, necrotic areas that eventually produced holes or splits in the leaves. Symptom expression was not ameliorated by the addition of fertiliser and even though symptoms were similar to severe Ca and B deficiency, both normal and offtype plants had similar levels of these elements in the leaves. The offtype plants were also slow growing in the glasshouse and produced significantly (P< 0. 05) smaller pseudostems and leaves than normal plants.

As expected, green life increased as the temperature and ethylene concentration decreased. The equation describing the relationship between temperature, ethylene concentration and green life of Cavendish bananas was applied to a five-day 3000 km road transport route from the major tropical production area to the major urban markets. It predicted that bananas transported in the prevailing mean summer temperature of 25 °C would not require refrigeration if the ethylene level did not exceed 0. 58 μL/L while transport at the mean winter temperature of 14 °C fruit could withstand a level of about 0. 90 μL/L without ripening en route. The equation was also applied to a shipment protocol of 19 days for bananas exported from Central America to southern Europe. This predicted that fruit could be transported without refrigeration if ethylene levels were maintained at 0. 04 μL/L during the winter temperature of 17 °C and at 0. 002 μL/L at the summer transport temperature of 24 °C.

40|$|This study {{involved}} traditional and molecular methods {{to track the}} movement of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) in the vascular system of banana. Traditional studies were conducted in the field using naturally-infected Lady <b>finger</b> <b>banana</b> plants, and molecular studies are currently being conducted at UQ using banana plants artificially-inoculated with GFP-transformed Foc isolates in the glasshouse. Panama disease is a polycyclic disease where inoculum causing infection is produced in individual plants infected {{during the course of}} the epidemic. This field study clearly demonstrated that the sap produced in such plants will be contaminated with Foc, and will contribute to epidemic build-up if allowed to contaminate the soil. Thus, sap as a source of inoculum is very important when managing disease containment. The study also suggested that the laticifers are not colonised by Foc and that when a pseudostem is cut, the sap from the laticifers is contaminated by inoculum from severed vascular strands and/or associated necrotic tissues. It is difficult to separate these tissues, but results suggest that mycelial fragments may come from severed vascular strands or xylem fluid, and microconidia from necrotic cells adjacent to the vascular bundles. It is anticipated that GFP-transformed isolates being used in the experiment at UQ will provide more definitive evidence on the systemic infection process of Foc in banana. It will determine whether movement in the vascular tissue is via mycelial growth or microconidia, and may explain why the incubation and latent periods for the disease are often so long. Chemical intervention to reduce inoculum levels may be possible but will require much more detailed research. The production of a volatile chemical (bicyclo(4, 2, 0) octa- 1, 3, 5 -triene) detected in this study by race 4 strains of Foc in culture is interesting and presents the opportunity for detection of disease by “sniffer” dogs before external disease symptoms are produced.

40|$|Bananas are an {{extremely}} important crop, serving as both a staple food in developing countries and as a dessert fruit in Western society. Two of the most devastating pathogens currently affecting both commercial and subsistence banana production are Fusarium oxysporum (Foc; causal agent of Fusarium wilt) and Mycosphaerella species (causal agent of black and yellow Sigatoka). Conventional breeding programs designed to improve the disease resistance characteristics of the commercially elite Cavendish cultivar have, thus far, been largely unsuccessful. Genetic engineering is now regarded as the most promising method to generate enhanced disease resistance in banana. In other crops and model species, strategies to enhance disease resistance have included the transgenic expression of defense-related genes such as; disease resistance genes (R genes), downstream signaling genes (eg. NPR 1, non-pathogenesis related) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The overall aims of this research were to amplify and compare the nucleotide binding site (NBS) domains of potential disease resistance genes from disease resistant and disease susceptible banana cultivars. To isolate and compare complete R gene sequences from these cultivars. To generate transgenic Lady <b>Finger</b> <b>banana</b> plants expressing the D 4 E 1 antimicrobial peptide {{under the control of}} two different promoters and finally to assess extracts from these plants for their ability to inhibit the growth of Foc Race 1. Using degenerate primers, the NBS domains of six resistance gene candidate (RGC) sequences were amplified from the disease resistant cultivar Calcutta 4 (C 4) and the disease susceptible cultivar Cavendish (Cav). The RGC 1, 2, 5 and 6 sequences showed similarity to previously characterized R gene sequences isolated from monocotyledonous plant species, while RGCs 3 and 4 showed similarity to R genes which form part of the Fusarium wilt resistance locus isolated from the dicotyledonous species, Lycopersicon esculentum; as well as other monocotyledonous R genes. RGCs 1 - 4 and 6 were present and transcriptionally active in both C 4 and Cav, whereas RGC- 5 was present in Cav only and was not transcribed. The transcripts could not be detected by Northern analysis, which is consistent with previous reports that R genes are constitutively transcriptionally active at only low levels. The NBS domains of RGCs 1 - 6 showed less than 65 % similarity (amino acid level) to one another but when each individual RGC isolated from the C 4 and Cav gDNA and cDNA templates was compared the sequences showed greater than 97 % similarity (amino acid level). Comparative sequence analysis revealed amino acid positions that were consistently different between the C 4 and Cav clones. Southern analysis revealed that RGC 1 - 5 were present in both the C 4 and Cav genomes in only low copy number (1 - 2 gene copies with 1 - 3 alleles), whereas RGC- 6 showed high copy number in both cultivars. Complete RGC sequences were subsequently amplified by RNA-ligase-mediated (RLM) -RACE and 3 '-RACE using specific primers designed to each of the RGC 1 - 4 NBS domains. Amplicons for each RGC were assembled to form potentially complete RGC sequences. Analysis of the sequences revealed the presence of coiled coil (CC) motifs in two of the amino terminal sequences while leucine rich repeats (LRRs) were identified at the carboxy terminal of all sequences. Multiple 3 '-RACE products were amplified for each RGC sequence. Although the polyadenylated products were of different lengths, the sequences were greater than 98 % identical at the amino acid level (except an RGC 3 clone which was 91 - 95 % identical to the other RGC 3 clones due to a 37 amino acid deletion). Specific primers used to amplify each complete RGC sequence from both C 4 and Cav DNA revealed that: RGC 1 (3. 53 kbp) could be amplified from both C 4 and Cav; RGCs 2 (2. 99 kbp) and 4 (4. 44 kbp) could be amplified from only Cav, however, the proposed truncations of these sequences (RGC 2 : 1. 3 kbp, RGC 4 : 2. 8 kbp and 2. 9 kbp) could be amplified from both cultivars; RGC 3 (4. 57 kbp) could not be amplified from either C 4 or Cav, however, the three shorter sequences (1. 96 kbp, 1. 34 kbp and 1. 28 kbp) could be amplified from both templates. The functional significance of the truncated sequences is currently unknown, however, truncated sequences have been detected in a number of R gene families isolated from other crops. No major sequence differences, such as deletions/insertions or early stop codons, were identified between the RGC sequences amplified from C 4 as compared to Cav (greater than 91 % amino acid similarity) and no sequence was identified as being present in the susceptible but absent from the resistant cultivar. However, comparative analysis of multiple clones isolated from C 4 and Cav did reveal amino acid residues that were consistently different between the two cultivars. These differences may result in differing resistance capabilities, functional genomics studies would need to be undertaken to determine this. It has been proposed that CC-NBS-LRR type R genes employ NDR 1 /HIN 1 -like (NHL) proteins, after pathogen invasion is detected, in the signaling process that ultimately leads to the elaboration of a defense response. A NHL partial sequence (420 bp) was amplified from the C 4 banana cultivar. The complete sequence of this gene (termed NHL- 1) was isolated using RLM and 3 '-RACE technologies (576 bp and 535 bp amplicons, respectively) and subsequently the 1. 106 kbp sequence was PCR amplified from both the C 4 and Cav cultivars. The banana NHL- 1 gene contained conserved motifs/domains previously identified within other NHL-type gene sequences. These included a signal peptide motif, a transmembrane domain and three previously identified conserved motifs. Based on current research into NHL type genes, the banana NHL- 1 sequence may not be useful as a transgene to enhance disease resistance in elite cultivars. However, it potentially {{plays an important role in}} the defense response signal transduction pathway and therefore will further our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions in <b>banana.</b> Transgenic Lady <b>Finger</b> <b>banana</b> plants expressing the D 4 E 1 antimicrobial peptide under the control of either the maize polyubiquitin (Ubi) or banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) DNA- 6 (Bt 6. 1) promoters were generated. These plants were subsequently assessed for the ability of their crude protein extracts to inhibit the germination of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Race 1 conidia in vitro. These anti-fungal bioassays revealed that fungal colony growth was reduced by 37 - 100 % using extracts from the pUbi-D 4 E 1 transgenic lines and 89 - 99 % using extracts from the pBt 6. 1 -D 4 E 1 transgenic lines. The transgenic lines are currently undergoing multiplication in preparation for glasshouse and small plant challenge trials for resistance to Fusarium wilt. These preliminary results suggest that D 4 E 1 may be useful in enhancing disease resistance in banana...|$|R
40|$|Banana {{is one of}} the world’s {{most popular}} fruit crops and Sukali Ndizi is the most popular dessert banana in the East African region. Like other banana cultivars, Sukali Ndizi is {{threatened}} by several constraints, of which the Fusarium wilt disease is the most destructive. Fusarium wilt is caused by a soil-borne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). No effective control strategy currently exists for this disease and although disease resistance exists in some banana cultivars, introducing resistance into commercial cultivars by conventional breeding is difficult because of low fertility. Considering that conventional breeding generates hybrids with additional undesirable traits, transformation is the most suitable way of introducing resistance in the banana genome. The success of this strategy depends on the availability of genes for genetic transformation. Recently, a novel strategy involving the expression of anti-apoptosis genes in plants was shown to result in resistance against several necrotrophic fungi, including Foc race 1 in <b>banana</b> cultivar Lady <b>Finger.</b> This thesis explores the potential of a plant-codon optimised nematode anti-apoptosis gene (Mced 9) to provide resistance against Foc race 1 in dessert banana cultivar Sukali Ndizi. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to transform embryogenic cell suspension of Sukali Ndizi with plant expression vector pYC 11, harbouring maize ubiquitin promoter driven Mced 9 gene and nptII as a plant selection marker. A total of 42 independently transformed lines were regenerated and characterized. The transgenic lines were multiplied, infected and evaluated for resistance to Foc race 1 in a small pot bioassay. The pathogenicity of the Ugandan Foc race 1 isolate used for infection was pre-determined and the spore concentration was standardised for consistent infection and symptom development. This process involved challenging tissue culture plants of Sukali Ndizi, a Foc race 1 susceptible cultivar and Nakinyika, an East African Highland cultivar known to be resistant to Foc race 1, with Fusarium inoculum and observing external and internal disease symptom development. Rhizome discolouration symptoms were the best indicators of Fusarium wilt with yellowing being an early sign of disease. Three transgenic lines were found to show significantly less disease severities compared to the wild-type control plants after 13 weeks of infection, indicating that Mced 9 has the potential to provide tolerance to Fusarium wilt in Sukali Ndizi...|$|R
40|$|In 1996, the European banana import {{regime was}} {{under attack by}} the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The United States, {{supported}} by three major multinational corporations in the banana industry along with four Latin American countries, placed pressure on Europe to comply with trade obligations regarding its banana import regime, as they deemed it was functioning illegally. There will be many meetings and consultations {{in the coming year}} culminating in a vote on modifying fundamental rules of the Common Market Organization for Bananas (CMOB), which had been adopted at Marrakech in 1995. The new legislation may be very detrimental to member states of the ACP. The possibilities for growth of ACP member states, traditional suppliers to Europe, is dependent upon current negotiations regarding repartition of quotas. The extent of the current socioeconomic crisis, which could prompt WTO to take corrective measures, is already quite alarming for other Caribbean countries where banana production is the main resource (particularly, for example, Dominica, St Lucia, and Jamaica). Indeed, for several years now, these countries have suffered from diminished competitivity because they have not made needed structural changes. However, opportunities for diversification exist, these include: the opening up of other markets, reinvigoration of local markets, amelioration of channels of production and commercialization of high quality products such as organic bananas and the fair trade banana. But it is wise to be realistic, the roads to diversification, although realizable, are not without their challenges. World trade figures for bananas account for only 13. 3 tonnes of bananas (FAO, 1996). Whereas 80 % of all bananas produced worldwide go to domestic markets. In most producing countries, bananas are very popular and used in a variety of local dishes. Both in terms of production and consumption, plantain {{is at the top of}} the popularity hit list. It literally provides food security for millions of people. Of the 28. 3 million tonnes of plantain produced worldwide, 69. 4 % is destined for human consumption, 11. 1 % processed and 8 % fed to livestock. More than 60 % of this world volume is produced and consumed in central and western Africa. Plantain production is targeted for domestic consumption and thus marketed according to traditional strategies. The plantain trade is closely tied to urban market trends, with demand rising steadily as the population grows. This trade is also dependent on the marketing subsector organisation - transporters, wholesalers, retailers - which varies from country to country. Plantain is transported from plantation to market in a variety of ways, e. g. on labourers' backs, in a refrigerated lorry, by canoe and on bicycles. In Ghana, market retailers and traders go to the plantations or villages themselves to purchase plantain supplies from farmers with whom they have established agreements. Whole bunches are placed in baskets; <b>banana</b> hands and <b>fingers</b> are put in bags and carried out manually to the road. A lorry driver is then paid to transport the fruit to market, and collector-wholesalers often arrange the lorry transport operation. The bananas are sold to middlemen or traders, who sell them to retailers, who in turn sell them to consumers in bunches or separate fingers. The complexity of the intermediary subsector increases proportionally around distribution hubs with the distance between production and supply markets, especially when the approach routes are in good shape. This trend is well established in Caribbean countries such as St Vincent, whereas it is just emerging in Africa. For instance, jobbers group around important markets in southwestern Cameroon (Mile 60, Bole and Owe). The banana plantations are quite remote from Douala (100 - 150 km), not easily accessible, and often impassable in the rainy season. Large quantities of plantain are delivered to the city markets on a daily basis via regular distribution channels, and the longest one involves three main types of middleman: collector-wholesalers (purchasing 50 - 500 bunches from the producers), sedentary wholesalers, who sell to retailers on a per-bunch basis in the wholesale and retail markets of Douala, and these retailers in turn sell to consumers or other retailers on a per-finger basis. Middlemen have a key role in the plantain marketing subsector - from the wholesaler to the retailer. As this domain becomes increasingly complex, growers are forced to produce greater quantities of higher-quality plantain, more regularly, and at lower cost. Production criteria are gathered by middlemen on the basis of information they obtain on selling prices, consumer demand and market trends. By professionalizing the subsector, the most organized of these go-betweens (dealers, transport agents, etc.) could become key stakeholders and thereby influence domestic market patterns. Reducing postharvest losses As domestic consumer demand is constantly increasing, local market dynamics depend on producers' capacity to maintain adequate sustainable production levels, while staving off postharvest banana losses. The most common cropping practice involves extending yearly production over as long a period as possible. Soil potential is crucial for the success of this strategy. In Cameroon and Rwanda, on volcanic soils in the Dominican Republic, and on river alluvia in the humid intertropical zone, plantain growers have adopted a sustainable production strategy, and this crop is often their main source of income. In Ghana, consumer demand for plantain is high and its retail price is steadily rising, however production has been stagnant for 10 years. This situation could be turned around by planting high yield, strongly pest and disease resistant, cultivars. Postharvest plantain losses are generally heavy and are estimated at about 3 million tonnes worldwide. These losses are due to poor harvest and handling conditions, in addition to a shortage of distribution channels (e. g. Côte d'Ivoire). The quality of communications networks is also an important factor. In most African countries, access routes to markets are in poor condition and poorly maintained, except around large urban centres. For instance, farmers in Rusitu valley in Zimbabwe produce high volumes of dessert bananas. They lose a substantial portion of their overall production during the rainy season because of the very long distances along poor roads that have to be travelled to the nearest urban markets. The EU has set up a system whereby farmers can rent vehicles to facilitate getting to local markets. Still, asphalting the roads represents the most efficient way of promoting trade to external markets. Cameroon is a case in point, there are now paved roads allowing comparatively easy access to the main markets and the capital.

40|$|Bananas (Musa sp) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food crops in the world and provide a staple food and source of income in many households especially in Africa. Diseases are a major constraint to production with bunchy top, caused by Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) generally considered the most important virus disease of bananas worldwide. Of the fungal diseases, Fusarium wilt, caused by the Fusarium oxysporum f. sp cubense (Foc), and black Sigatoka, caused by Mycosphaerella fijiensis, are arguably two of the most important and cause significant yield losses. The low fertility of commercially important banana cultivars has hampered efforts to generate disease resistance using conventional breeding. Possible alternative strategies to generate or increase disease resistance are through genetic engineering or by manipulation of the innate plant defence mechanisms, namely systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The first research component of this thesis describes attempts to generate BBTV-resistant banana plants using a genetic modification approach. The second research component of the thesis focused on the identification of a potential marker gene associated with SAR in banana plants and a comparison of the expression levels of the marker gene in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and chemical inducers. Previous research at QUT CTCB showed that replication of BBTV DNA components in banana embryogenic cell suspensions (ECS) was abolished following co-bombardment with 1. 1 mers of mutated BBTV DNA-R. BBTV DNA-R encodes the master replication protein (Rep) and is the only viral protein essential for BBTV replication. In this study, ECS of banana were stably transformed with the same constructs, each containing a different mutation in BBTV DNA-R, namely H 41 G, Y 79 F and K 187 M, to examine the effect on virus replication in stably transformed plants. Cells were also transformed with a construct containing a native BBTV Rep. A total of 16, 16, 11 and five lines of stably transformed banana plants containing the Y 79 F, H 41 G, K 187 M and native Rep constructs, respectively, were generated. Of these, up to nine replicates from Y 79 F lines, four H 41 G lines, seven K 187 M lines and three native Rep lines were inoculated with BBTV by exposure to viruliferous aphids in two separate experiments. At least one replicate from each of the nine Y 79 F lines developed typical bunchy top symptoms and all tested positive for BBTV using PCR. Of the four H 41 G lines tested, at least one replicate from three of the lines showed symptoms of bunchy top and tested positive using PCR. However, none of the five replicates of one H 41 G line (H 41 G- 3) developed symptoms of bunchy top and none of the plants tested positive for BBTV using PCR. Of the seven K 187 M lines, at least one replicate of all lines except one (K 187 M- 1) developed symptoms of bunchy top and tested positive for BBTV. Importantly, none of the four replicates of line K 187 M- 1 showed symptoms or tested positive for BBTV. At least one replicate from each of the three native Rep lines developed symptoms and tested positive for BBTV. The H 41 G- 3 and K 187 M- 1 lines possibly represent the first transgenic banana plants generated using a mutated Rep strategy. The second research component of this thesis focused on the identification of SAR-associated genes in banana and their expression levels in response to biotic and abiotic stresses and chemical inducers. The impetus for this research was the observation that tissue-cultured (TC) banana plants were more susceptible to Fusarium wilt disease (and possibly bunchy top disease) than plants grown from field-derived suckers, possibly due to decreased levels of SAR gene expression in the former. In this study, the pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR- 1) gene was identified as a potential marker for SAR gene expression in banana. A quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed and optimised in order to determine the expression of PR- 1, with polyubiquitin (Ubi- 1) found to be the most suitable reference gene to enable relative quantification. The levels of PR- 1 expression were subsequently compared in Lady Finger and Cavendish (cv. Williams) banana plants grown under three different environmental conditions, namely in the field, the glass house and in tissue-culture. PR- 1 was shown to be expressed in both cultivars growing under different conditions. While PR- 1 expression was highest in the field grown bananas and lowest in the TC <b>bananas</b> in Lady <b>Finger</b> cultivar, this was not the case in the Cavendish cultivar with glass house plants exhibiting the lowest PR- 1 expression compared with tissue culture and field grown plants. The important outcomes of this work were the establishment of a qPCR-based assay to monitor PR- 1 expression levels in banana and a preliminary assessment of the baseline PR- 1 expression levels in two banana cultivars under three different growing conditions. After establishing the baseline PR- 1 expression levels in Cavendish bananas, a study was done to determine whether PR- 1 levels could be increased in these plants by exposure to known banana pathogens and non-pathogens, and a known chemical inducer of SAR. Cavendish banana plants were exposed to pathogenic Foc subtropical race 4 (FocSR 4) and non-pathogenic Foc race 1 (Foc 1), as well as two putative inducers of resistance, Fusarium lycopersici (Fol) and the chemical, acibenzolar-S-methyl (BION®). Tissue culture bananas were acclimatised under either glass house (TCS) or field (TCH) conditions and treatments were carried out in a randomised complete block design. PR- 1 expression was determined using qPCR for both TCS and TCH samples for the period 12 - 72 h post-exposure. Treatment of TCH plants using Foc 1 and FocSR 4 resulted in 120 and 80 times higher PR- 1 expression than baseline levels, respectively. For TCS plants treated with Foc 1, PR- 1 expression was 30 times higher than baseline levels at 12 h post-exposure, while TCS plants treated with FocSR 4 showed the highest PR- 1 expression (20 times higher than baseline levels) at 72 h post-exposure. Interestingly, when TCS plants were treated with Fol there was a marked increase of PR- 1 expression at 12 h and 48 h following treatment which was 4 and 8 times higher than the levels observed when TCS plants were treated with Foc 1 and FocSR 4, respectively. In contrast, when TCH plants were treated with Fol only a slight increase in PR- 1 expression was observed at 12 h, which eventually returned to baseline levels. Exposure of both TCS and TCH plants to BION® resulted in no effect on PR- 1 expression levels at any time-point. The major outcome of the SAR study was that the glass house acclimatised tissue culture bananas exhibited lower PR- 1 gene expression compared to field acclimatised tissue culture plants and the identification of Fol as a good candidate for SAR induction in banana plants exhibiting low PR- 1 levels. A number of outcomes that foster understanding of both pathogen-derived and plant innate resistance strategies in order to potentially improve banana resistance to diseases were explored in this study and include identification of potential inducers of systemic acquired resistance and a promising mutated Rep approach for BBTV resistance. The work presented in this thesis is the first report on the generation of potential BBTV resistant bananas using the mutated Rep approach. In addition, this is the first report on the status of SAR in banana grown under different conditions of exposure to the biotic and abiotic environment. Further, a robust qPCR assay for the study of gene expression using banana leaf samples was developed and a potential inducer of SAR in tissue culture bananas identified which could be harnessed to increase resistance in tissue culture bananas...|$|R
