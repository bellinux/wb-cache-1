40|$|We {{present a}} study of Lyot style (i. e., classical, band-limited, and Gaussian occulter) coronagraphy on {{extremely}} large, highly-segmented telescopes. We show that while increased telescope diameter is always an advantage for high dynamic range science (assuming wavefront errors have been corrected sufficiently well), segmentation itself sets a limit {{on the performance of}} Lyot coronagraphs. Diffraction from inter-segment gaps sets a floor to the achievable extinction of on-axis starlight with Lyot coronagraphy. We derive an analytical expression for the manner in which coronagraphic suppression of an on-axis source decreases with increasing gap size when the segments are placed in a spatially periodic array over the telescope aperture, regardless of the details of the arrangement. A simple Lyot stop masking out pupil edges produces good extinction of the central peak in the point-spread function (PSF), but leaves satellite images caused by inter-segment gaps essentially unaffected. Masking out the <b>bright</b> <b>segment</b> gaps in the Lyot plane with a reticulated mask reduces the satellite images'intensity to a contrast of 5 x 10 ^{- 9 } on a 30 m telescope with 10 mm gaps, at the expense of an increase in the brightness of the central peak.

40|$|One of {{the science}} drivers for the {{extremely}} large telescope (ELT) is imaging and spectroscopy of exo-solar planets located as close as 20 mas to their parent star. The application requires a well thought-out design of the high contrast imaging instrumentation. Several working coronagraphic concepts have already been developed for the monolithic telescope with the diameter up to 8 meter. Nevertheless the conclusions made about the performance of these systems cannot be applied directly to the telescope of the diameter 30 - 100 m. The existing schemes are needed to be reconsidered {{taking into account the}} specific characteristics of a segmented surface. We start this work with the classical system ? Lyot coronagraph. We show that while the increase in telescope diameter is an advantage for the high contrast range science, the segmentation sets a limit on the performance of the coronagraph. Diffraction from intersegment gaps sets a floor to the achievable extinction of the starlight. Masking out the <b>bright</b> <b>segment</b> gaps in the Lyot plane although helps increasing the contrast, does not solve completely the problem: the high spatial frequency component of the diffractive light remains. We suggest using the Lyot stop which acts on the light within gaps in order to produce the uniform illumination in the Lyot plane. We show that for the diffraction limit regime and a perfect phasing this type of coronagraph achieves a sufficient star light extinction.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{hexagonal}} domains of monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS 2) grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) with powder precursors can have discrete segmentation in their photoluminescence (PL) emission intensity, forming symmetric patterns with alternating bright and dark regions. Two-dimensional maps of the PL reveal significant reduction within the segments associated with the longest sides of the hexagonal domains. Analysis of the PL spectra shows differences in the exciton to trion ratio, indicating variations in the exciton recombination dynamics. Monolayers of WS 2 hexagonal islands transferred to new substrates still exhibit this PL segmentation, ruling out local strain in the regions as the dominant cause. High-power laser irradiation causes preferential degradation of the <b>bright</b> <b>segments</b> by sulfur removal, indicating {{the presence of a}} more defective region that is higher in oxidative reactivity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of topography and amplitude modes show uniform thickness of the WS 2 domains and no signs of segmentation. However, AFM phase maps do show the same segmentation of the domain as the PL maps and indicate that it is caused by some kind of structural difference that we could not clearly identify. These results provide important insights into the spatially varying properties of these CVD-grown transition metal dichalcogenide materials, which may be important for their effective implementation in fast photo sensors and optical switches...|$|R

40|$|Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are {{brief but}} intense {{emission}} of soft γ-rays, mostly lasting {{from a few}} seconds to a few thousand seconds. For such kind of high energy transients, their isotropic-equivalent-energy (E_ iso) function may be more scientifically meaningful when compared with GRB isotropic-equivalent-luminosity function (L_ iso), as the traditional luminosity function refers to steady emission much longer than a few thousand seconds. In this work we for the first time construct the isotropic-equivalent-energy function for a sample of 95 bursts with measured redshifts (z) and find an excess of high-z GRBs. Assuming that the excess is caused by a GRB luminosity function evolution in a power-law form, we find a cosmic evolution of E_ iso∝(1 +z) ^ 1. 80 ^+ 0. 36 _- 0. 63, which is comparable to that between L_ iso and z, i. e., L_ iso∝(1 +z) ^ 2. 30 ^+ 0. 56 _- 0. 51 (both 1 σ). The evolution-removed isotropic-equivalent-energy function can be reasonably fitted by a broken power-law, in which the dim and <b>bright</b> <b>segments</b> are ψ(E_ iso) ∝ E_ iso^- 0. 27 ± 0. 01 and ψ(E_ iso) ∝ E_ iso^- 0. 87 ± 0. 07, respectively (1 σ).

Harmonic imaging improved left ventricular endocardial border delineation over fundamental imaging (superior: harmonic = 71. 1 %, fundamental = 18. 7 %; similar: 10. 2 %; P <. 001). Quantitative analysis of 100 wall/cavity combinations demonstrated <b>brighter</b> wall <b>segments</b> and more strikingly darker cavities during harmonic imaging (cavity intensity on a 0 to 255 scale: fundamental = 15. 6 +/- 8. 6; harmonic = 6. 0 +/- 5. 3; P <. 0001), which led to enhanced contrast between the wall and cavity (1. 89 versus 1. 19, P <. 0001).

Most of the available methods suffer from high implementation complexity which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications such as robotics. The presented method is an enhancement to an existing method which can only <b>segment</b> <b>bright</b> targets. This is done by using a new graphical strategy to extract the background class using the analysis of image’s wavelet subband PDF. The new strategy uses the center of masses of the accepted target threshold groups rather than using the globally maximum local minima which has dramatically improved the results. Moreover a novel validation scheme is introduced which simply eliminates the unwanted detections based on their characteristics. The method is applied to a variety of real world cases and is found to give exceptional results...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with Kawasaki disease, serial {{evaluation of the}} distribution and size of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) is necessary for risk stratification and therapeutic management. Although transthoracic echocardiography is often sufficient for this purpose initially, visualization of the coronary arteries becomes progressively more difficult as children grow. We sought to prospectively compare coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and x-ray coronary angiography findings in {{patients with}} CAA caused by Kawasaki disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six subjects (age 10 to 25 years) with known CAA from Kawasaki disease underwent coronary MRA using a free-breathing T 2 -prepared 3 D <b>bright</b> blood <b>segmented</b> k-space gradient echo sequence with navigator gating and tracking. All patients underwent x-ray coronary angiography within a median of 75 days (range, 1 to 359 days) of coronary MRA. There was complete agreement between MRA and x-ray angiography in the detection of CAA (n= 11), coronary artery stenoses (n= 2), and coronary occlusions (n= 2). Excellent agreement {{was found between the}} 2 techniques for detection of CAA maximal diameter (mean difference= 0. 4 +/- 0. 6 mm) and length (mean difference= 1. 4 +/- 1. 6 mm). The 2 methods showed very similar results for proximal coronary artery diameter (mean difference= 0. 2 +/- 0. 5 mm) and CAA distance from the ostia (mean difference= 0. 1 +/- 1. 5 mm). CONCLUSION: Free-breathing 3 D coronary MRA accurately defines CAA in patients with Kawasaki disease. This technique may provide a non-invasive alternative when transthoracic echocardiography image quality is insufficient, thereby reducing the need for serial x-ray coronary angiography in this patient group...|$|R

The best studied store-operated calcium current is the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) current in T-cells and mast cells, with Orai 1 representing the essential pore forming subunit. Although {{it is known that}} functional CRAC channels in store-depleted cells are composed of four Orai 1 subunits, the stoichiometric composition in quiescent cells is still discussed controversially: both a tetrameric and a dimeric stoichiometry of resting state Orai 1 have been reported. We obtained here robust and similar FRET values on labeled tandem repeat constructs of Orai 1 before and after store depletion, suggesting an unchanged tetrameric stoichiometry. Moreover, we directly visualized the stoichiometry of mobile Orai 1 channels in live cells using a new single molecule recording modality that combines single molecule tracking and brightness analysis. By alternating imaging and photobleaching pulses, we recorded trajectories of single, fluorescently labeled Orai 1 channels, with each trajectory consisting of <b>bright</b> and dim <b>segments,</b> corresponding to higher and lower numbers of colocalized active GFP label.

Very thin and <b>bright</b> FIR arm <b>segments</b> are shown in these maps, which have similar structure as the HI gas but with much enhanced arm/inter-arm contrast, typically a factor of 5 on the 60 image.

The colors follow the well known anticorrelation between the 60 micron/ 100 micron flux ratio and the 12 micron/ 25 micron flux ratio. All sources coincide with optical HII regions. A comparison with Hα observations shows that the total luminosity (in the wavelength range 8 [...] - 1000) associated with HII regions is 7. 2 ± 2. 9 10 ^ 8 L_sun, namely 30 ± 14 % of the total IR emission of M 31.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine whether}} the line {{dividing}} the septum into two layers is found consistently by conventional echocardiography and to evaluate functional {{differences in the}} right and left side of the septum in terms of wall thickening, strain rate, and strain imaging. DESIGN: In a systematic study in 30 normal subjects, M mode and Doppler myocardial imaging data from the interventricular septum (IVS) were recorded.

Furthermore, three patients with one sided abnormalities were studied. RESULTS: A <b>bright</b> echo consistently <b>segmented</b> the IVS into a left and right part. In this normal population radial deformation was different for the left and right side of the septum (mean (SD) wall thickening on the left, 49 (46) %, and on the right, 17 (38) %; strain rate on the left, 3. 8 (0. 6) 1 /s, and on the right, 2. 1 (1. 9) 1 /s; strain on the left, 41 (17) %, and on the right, 22 (14) %), whereas longitudinal deformation was found to be similar (strain rate on the left, - 2. 2 (0. 7) 1 /s, and on the right, - 2. 0 (0. 6) 1 /s; strain on the left, - 28 (12) %, and on the right, - 25 (12) %).

The detected calculi by the proposed framework are validated against a group of experts. The Performance of the proposed method is thoroughly investigated and the accuracy of the framework is determined. The framework incorporating automated seed selected region growing algorithm is able to detect the calculi with the efficiency of 78. 57 %. Conclusion: The extracted calculi can further be analyzed for taking decision about the treatment procedures. The proposed system is helpful for taking decision about the treatment procedures. The proposed system is helpful for clinicians as a decision support tool. This system can also be useful as educational aid for assisting or decision making in the treatment of calculus disease...|$|R
