50|$|Despite these drawbacks, Laker Airways {{took the}} aircraft. The airline {{concluded}} it could fly non-stop from the UK to any point {{east of the}} Rockies by keeping the baggage limit at 40 lb and reducing single-class seating from 380 to 345. The saving {{could be used to}} carry more fuel. The calculations had shown that even with reduced seating, it had to fill only 52% of the seats to break even. Moreover, Laker Airways had figured that the aircraft's low break-even seat factor would enable it to operate its proposed London - New York Skytrain with a lower <b>break-even</b> <b>factor</b> compared to the 707, an ageing narrowbodied aircraft whose costs were higher per passenger. The DC-10s also had huge potential to boost the projected profitability of Skytrain. Revised estimates anticipated an average load factor of 70-75% and raised the traffic forecast for the first year of operation to 250,000 passengers each way. This was almost three times the original 707-based forecast. These factors swung the firm in favour of McDonnell-Douglas's offer.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 the world's longest {{non-stop}} {{scheduled airline}} route came to Newark, Singapore Airlines' flight to Singapore that ended on November 23, 2013 (<b>break-even</b> load <b>factor</b> was 110%). The world's longest non-stop scheduled flight, as of October 2017, is a United Airlines' flight between Los Angeles and Singapore.|$|R
40|$|Through radically {{improving}} the value equation for airline customers, Ryanair has served to shake-up established norms {{and practices in}} European aviation. Underpinning its price leadership and market success is a vigorous and relentless cost reduction ethos and resultant low <b>break-even</b> load <b>factor.</b> Ryanair has lowered European airline cost structures considerably, shattering existing cost floors. Few competitors are able to follow, either {{because they do not}} know how or they are unable due to social settlement obligations or service commitments. At the same time, the company has maintained high average load factors on its flights. Taken in conjunction with its low <b>break-even</b> load <b>factor,</b> this results in consistently high overall profit margins. On this basis, Ryanair is likely to remain a significant competitor and increase its market presence and success across Europe...|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{load factor}} is an {{important}} parameter {{for the assessment of}} the performance of any transport system. Almost all transport systems have high fixed costs, and these costs can only be recovered through selling tickets. Airlines often calculate a load factor at which the airline will break even; this is called the <b>break-even</b> load <b>factor.</b> At a load factor lower than the break even level, the airline will lose money, and above will record a profit.|$|R
50|$|They were {{subsequently}} purchased by Kleinwort Benson, which had leased them to British Eagle until its demise in November 1968. These aircraft were earmarked for Skytrain. Laker's original Skytrain application assumed a 62.9% <b>break-even</b> load <b>factor.</b> This {{meant that the}} airline needed to sell 100 out of 158 seats at a single fare of £37.50 per seat on each flight to start making money with Skytrain. Sir Freddie announced Skytrain {{at a press conference}} at London's Savoy Hotel on 30 June 1971.|$|R
50|$|Laker duly reapplied to the CAA for {{permission}} to operate eleven weekly Skytrain services each way between London Gatwick and New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) {{during the summer and}} seven weekly round-trips during the winter. The summer schedule was to be operated with Laker's brand-new DC-10 widebodied jet aircraft to take advantage of increased demand he anticipated for his new low-fare service during the peak months from June to September {{as well as of the}} DC-10's low <b>break-even</b> load <b>factor</b> of only 52%. The winter schedule was to be operated with 707 narrowbodies as specified in Laker's original application to the ATLB.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2013, {{with the}} Indian {{government}} allowing a {{foreign direct investment}} of up to 49% in airlines, AirAsia Berhad applied to the Indian Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) seeking approval for commencing its operations in India. In March 2013, AirAsia {{announced that it would}} establish a joint venture with Tata Sons and Telestra Tradeplace with Tata Sons representing the airline with two non-executive directors in the board. The airliner planned to operate with the world's lowest unit cost of [...] per available seat Kilometre and a passenger <b>break-even</b> load <b>factor</b> of 52%. It also planned to hedge 100% of its fuel requirements for the first three years and to achieve an aircraft turnaround time of 25 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Project “Energy Saving in Fisheries” (ESIF) {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} potential technical and operational methods {{to address the}} need to reduce energy consumption and associated costs in European fisheries. The study started with an inventory of potential technical solutions and ongoing projects in the participating member states. The economic performance of selected fleet segments was analysed with emphasis {{on the role of}} energy costs. This economic analysis considered aspects such as: <b>break-even</b> fuel price, <b>factors</b> determining energy efficiency, the economic potential for technological improvement and scenarios for future outlook related to possible develop-ment of fuel price. Finally, the economic feasibility of proposed technological adaptations was assesse...|$|R
