The two part mCMS grades cartilage-related studies based on ten criteria; Part A: study size, mean follow-up, number of different surgical procedures, type of study, description of surgical procedure, postoperative rehabilitation, inclusion subjects’ MRI outcome and inclusion subjects’ histological outcome; Part B: outcome criteria, procedure for assessing clinical outcomes and description of subject selection process. The maximum score of the mCMS is 100, which indicates that a study largely avoids chance, biases and confounding factors.

30|$|The {{first round}} of this {{research}} therefore found that jatropha’s promoters in Kenya not only used the ‘sustainable biofuel’ discourse to sustain public, political and financial support, they also tailored their representations of jatropha to suit different situations. This ‘discursive flexibility’ helped further insulate jatropha against critique (Citation removed <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>review).</b> <b>For</b> example, initially representing jatropha as a scaffolding plant for vanilla vines and later {{as a source of}} energy helped keep farmers committed to growing jatropha after the first objective failed. Conflating goals that could be achieved through large plantations and community-based projects also helped to build and maintain momentum for jatropha activities, likely delaying the impact of emerging research that cast jatropha in a negative light (e.g. GTZ 2009).|$|R
40|$|Objectives - To {{describe}} the qualitative research methods {{used in the}} Parenting Eating and Activity for Child Health (PEACH) randomized controlled trial and to examine parent-reported facilitators and barriers to the achievement of program goals. Design - Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Setting - Parents enrolled in the Australian PEACH randomized controlled trial, a family-focused child weight management program conducted <b>blinded</b> <b>for</b> <b>review.</b> Participants - A total of 95 parents of overweight children aged 5 – 10 years participated in face-to-face semistructured interviews. Phenomenon of Interest - Factors external to the PEACH intervention that facilitated or inhibited their success. Analysis - Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis techniques. Results - Three facilitator themes were identified : (1) internal locus of parental control; (2) external locus of parental control, and; (3) child factors. - Six barrier themes were identified : (1) internal locus of parental control; (2) external locus of parental control; (3) child factors; (4) maintenance and managing special occasions; (5) time management challenges, and; (6) inconsistencies or lack of support. Conclusions and Implications - The social and environmental barriers and time pressures identified by parents are a common feature of Western family life such that many parents are raising families in stressful situations. Insights provided by this qualitative research provide an important understanding of these experiences. Consideration of such issues {{in the design and}} implementation of future child weight management interventions may help to increase the acceptability and effectiveness of such programs...|$|R

30|$|On {{the actual}} evaluation, the {{information}} on the patient background, specific institutions and the imaging techniques were <b>blinded</b> <b>for</b> reviewers. When <b>reviewing</b> by three independent reviewers, the display setting of liver dynamic CT images, such as window width (WW) and window level (WL), was fixed as WW 270 and WL 60. The efficacy of imaging in the diagnosis of HCC in the AP of each liver segment was evaluated by the 3 independent reviewers, and classified into 4 grades as tumor conspicuity: “excellent (HCC enhancement at AP[*]≥[*]the enhancement of aorta)”, “good (liver parenchyma[*]<[*]< HCC enhancement at AP[*]<[*]the enhancement of aorta)”, “fair (liver parenchyma[*]<[*]HCC enhancement at AP[*]<[*]< the enhancement of aorta)” and “poor (liver parenchyma[*]≥[*]HCC enhancement at AP)”. These gradings were employed for the largest target 10 tumors. The scan timing of AP was investigated by these 2 grades: “good (arterial and portal vein enhancement of the liver are seen, but hepatic vein enhancement is not seen)”, “poor (portal vein enhancement is not seen, or both portal vein and hepatic vein in the liver are seen)”. The evaluation result was adopted when ratings given by 2 reviewers were consistent. When ratings by 3 reviewers were completely inconsistent, the case was discussed to determine the final rating.|$|R

Each participant was asked to walk to a previously seen target under four experimental conditions: eyes closed within the real world, eyes closed wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), eyes open in the real world, and eyes open wearing a HMD. We report three gait parameters {{for each of these}} four conditions: stride length, walking velocity, and head-trunk angle. This data reveals that these gait parameters within a HMD virtual environment (VE) are different than those in the real world. A person wearing a HMD and backpack walks slower, and takes a shorter stride length than they do in a comparable real world condition. In addition, head-trunk angle while walking to a target on the ground plane is lowest when walking with eyes open in a HMD VE...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{the setting}} of the European Bladder Dysfunction Study, a multi-center, randomized, {{controlled}} trial of treatment options for functional incontinence in children, we assessed the concordance between reported and reviewed urodynamic scores. Materials and Methods: A total of 97 children with clinically diagnosed urge syndrome and 105 with clinically diagnosed dysfunctional voiding enrolled in the European Bladder Dysfunction Study and underwent full urodynamic studies before and immediately after treatment for urinary incontinence. Photocopies of 72 % of the original urodynamic recordings were available <b>for</b> <b>blinded</b> <b>review.</b> Results: The concordance for detrusor overactivity throughout the filling phase was 37 % in urge syndrome cases and for increased pelvic floor activity during voiding it was 81 % in dysfunctional voiding cases. Differences in original and reviewed scores were equally distributed among participating centers. Conclusions: Concordance between original and reviewed urodynamic scores was low for detrusor overactivity. Concordance was acceptable for increased pelvic floor activity during voiding but was not specific for dysfunctional voiding. Since interpreting urodynamic studies is based on pattern recognition, investigator bias can only be compensated <b>for</b> by <b>blinded</b> <b>review</b> of the actual recordings...|$|R
3000|$|Raider-Roth (2005), {{while not}} {{explicitly}} addressing self-assessment, makes {{a compelling case}} for including students in decision-making processes that impact their lives. Like other student-centered theorists such as John Dewey (1903), who likewise advocated {{for the promotion of}} democratic environments even within the formal institutional settings of schools, Raider-Roth (2005) implores educators to provide conditions where students feel safe enough to “challenge teachers’ authority” (p. 34). Such environments allow students to be “dangerous and to take risks, to voice that which had not been said” before (p. 34). Empowering students, it would seem, can have a lasting influence on their lives long after they leave the college classroom. However, such a philosophy is not prominent in the Confucian-based education models of East Asia, including Japan (Marginson, 2011). Therefore, introducing student-liberating pedagogies to East Asian contexts may be met with confusion or resistance, at least initially, even at a Japanese liberal arts university based on the western model that promotes developing “adventurous minds capable of critical thinking and sensitivity to questions of meaning and value” (Citation removed <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>review.)</b> [...]...|$|R
40|$|Names {{withheld}} <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>review</b> prediction, temporal-difference learning, temporal abstraction, options, TD networks, {{reinforcement learning}} Temporal-difference (TD) networks {{have been proposed}} {{as a way of}} representing and learning a wide variety of predictions about the interaction between an agent and its environment (Sutton & Tanner, 2005). These predictions are compositional in that their targets are defined in terms of other predictions, and subjunctive in that that they are about what would happen if an action or sequence of actions were taken. In conventional TD networks, the inter-related predictions are at successive time steps and contingent on a single action; here we generalize them to accommodate extended time intervals and contingency on whole ways of behaving. Our generalization is based on the options framework for temporal abstraction (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999). The primary contribution {{of this paper is to}} introduce a new algorithm for intra-option learning in TD networks with function approximation and eligibility traces. We present empirical examples of our algorithm’s effectiveness and of the greater representational expressiveness of temporally-abstract TD networks. 1...|$|R
40|$|Author {{information}} removed <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>review</b> One {{approach to}} reducing {{the costs of}} usability testing is to facilitate the automatic detection of critical incidents: serious breakdowns in interaction that stand out during software use. This research evaluates the use of undo and erase events as indicators of critical incidents in Google SketchUp (a 3 D-modeling application), measuring an indicator’s usefulness by the numbers and types of usability problems discovered. We also compared problems identified using undo and erase events to problems identified using the user-reported critical incident technique [Hartson and Castillo 1998]. In a within-subjects experiment with 35 participants, undo and erase episodes together revealed over 90 % of the problems rated as severe, several of which {{would not have been}} discovered by selfreport alone. Moreover, problems found by all three techniques were rated as significantly more severe than those identified by only a subset of techniques. These results suggest that undo and erase events will serve as useful complements to user-reported critical incidents for low cost usability evaluation of design-oriented applications like SketchUp...|$|R
40|$|Theories {{of youth}} risk taking {{range from the}} realist to the sociocultural. Much of this theorising, {{particularly}} {{in the field of}} epidemiology, has been strongly influenced by the Health Belief Framework. More recently, attention has shifted to understanding how young people perceive risk and what makes some of them resilient to risk taking. In this article we develop a framework that brings together diverse theoretical perspectives on youth risk taking. We draw on lessons from across the social science disciplines to inform a conceptual framework incorporating the broad context and internal processes of young people’s decisions to take risks. Our Youth Risk Interpretation Framework (Y-RIF) has been developed from insights gained during an ethnographic study conducted in South Africa (REMOVED <b>FOR</b> <b>BLIND</b> <b>REVIEW).</b> We argue that our framework is useful, as it offers new ways of understanding why some young people take risks while others are more cautious.

We designed an interactive installation that uses visual {{feedback to the}} incidental movements of passers-by to communicate its interactivity. The lab study reveals: (1) Mirrored user silhouettes and images are more effective than avatar-like representations. (2) It takes time to notice the interactivity (approx. 1. 2 s). In the field study, three displays were installed during three weeks in shop windows, and data about 807 persons interacting were collected. Our observations show: (1) Significantly more passers-by interact when immediately showing the mirrored user image (+ 90 %) or silhouette (+ 47 %) compared to a traditional attract sequence with call-to-action. (2) Passers-by often notice interactivity late and have to walk back to interact (the landing effect). (3) If somebody is already interacting, others begin interaction behind the ones already interacting, forming multiple rows.

40|$|A {{technique}} for improving cross-device graphics and animation on heterogeneous networks of collocated graphical devices Omitted <b>for</b> <b>Blind</b> <b>Review</b> As {{different kinds of}} graphical computing devices become more common, there are numerous opportunities for these devices to work together. Multi-device functionality can be enhanced by persistent graphical entities that move seamlessly among the constituent devices. However, when two devices have different graphical capabilities, {{it may not be}} possible for both devices to represent an entity in the same way; when the entity is transferred between such devices, it undergoes a stylistic transformation that may cause a visual discontinuity. This paper describes a {{technique for}} improving heterogeneous graphics and animation by separating the moment of cross-device transfer from the moment of stylistic transformation. The technique involves implementing an explicit stylistic transformation on the device with superior graphical capabilities, shortly before or after the cross-device transfer. Making the stylistic transformation explicit, and separating it temporally from the transfer, helps to preserve the identity of the graphical object as it moves between devices. This technique can lead to more effective heterogeneous animation, thereby contributing to innovative industrial applications, novel platforms for computer-supported learning and new kinds of graphical entertainment...|$|R
40|$|Author names ommitted <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>review</b> Abstract — The {{security}} of mobile wireless ad hoc networks is a multifaceted topic which {{in recent years}} has been the focus of much interest in the research community. While many security issues in these networks can be addressed by protocol design, wireless nodes have inherent physical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to cause disruptions in network traffic. The nature of these exposures is such that there is little that can be done to eliminate them leaving the network open to denial of service and reduction of quality attacks. This paper is a step in quantifying the effects of attacks that exploit these physical vulnerabilities. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we introduce a general model that can be used to characterize a physical attack as an on-off process and then we apply this model to two specific attack scenarios. Second, we present the results of simulation experiments with these two attack scenarios on a mesh of network nodes using the IEEE 802. 11 standard and the AODV routing protocol.
