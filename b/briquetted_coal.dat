40|$|Significant {{ecological}} {{concerns and}} attractive financial opportunities are raised by growing deposits of waste coal fines in the United States. Roughly 2 {{billion tons of}} waste coal fines are stored in impoundments in the United States and approximately 50 million additional tons are generated annually. These fines can be utilized by extrusion or roller press briquetting along with a binder to impart mechanical strength and water resistance to the briquettes. In this study, a variety of binder materials were considered and were evaluated on seven criteria: cost, availability, binding ability, processability, water resistance, heating value, and toxicity/environmental impact. Municipal solid waste (MSW) plastic binders are the primary focus in this study due to their excellent performance in all areas. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize a <b>briquetted</b> <b>coal</b> product, using waste plastics, which may be an economically and ecologically viable substitute for conventional stoker coal. High density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) provide water resistance to the coal briquettes, and since they do not contain chlorine will not promote dioxin or furan formation when combusted. In addition, the heating value of LDPE is 46. 4 MJ/kg—over double that of the 21. 9 MJ/kg waste coal fines used in this study. A 10 wt% LDPE- 90 wt% coal mixture was found to have an 11 % higher heating value over the neat waste coal fines. A number of coal/LDPE mixtures were briquetted with varying coal particle size distributions, moisture content, and LDPE concentrations using a laboratory-scale roller press briquetter. To examine mechanical robustness, briquettes were subjected to compressive testing and tumbler testing according to ASTM D 441 - 07. Thermal analysis of the briquetted fuels using thermogravimetric analysis/simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) in air revealed a significant interaction between coal and LDPE. Laboratory-scale combustion tests revealed a dependence of combustion efficiency on LDPE concentration in the briquetted fuel. Gas chromatography of effluent gas at 3 minutes validated this trend. The results of this work indicate that HDPE and LDPE can serve as excellent waste coal binders due to their high energy density, water resistance, binding ability, and relatively low cost. ...|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>coal</b> <b>briquettes</b> as an {{alternative}} energy source is still relatively small compared to other energy sources such as oil and gas. This is because the ignition of <b>coal</b> <b>briquette</b> is difficult {{at an early stage}} of the combustion process and also South Sulawesi coal contains high sulfur which leads to emit SO 2. One way to overcome the problem is mixing the coal with a certain ratio of rice husk, a little proportion lime and starch as a glue. Water was poured while stirring the mixture. It then was molded and dried. In this study, the optimum condition was obtained at the ratio of coal-rice husk of 80 % (80 : 20) which gave the characteristics of briquettes with the heating value (Hv) = 5443 kcal / kg, SO 2 emission = 247 ppm, NOx emission = 115 ppm and CO 2 emission = 0. 4 %...|$|R
30|$|The similar {{material}} {{research has}} mainly two stages. No additive phase and pulverized coal directly compressed as samples {{in the absence}} of any additives (Skochinski 1953; Neliekl and Topolnicki 1994; Skoczylas et al. 2014). For example, Skoczylas formed 48  mm diameter, length of 110  mm <b>briquettes</b> using fine <b>coal,</b> and prepared <b>coal</b> <b>briquettes</b> of various porosity from 13.5 % to 33 %, and the <b>coal</b> <b>briquettes</b> have the similar mechanical and gaseous properties with normal and altered coal in 2014 (Skochinski 1953, 2012). Deng formed briquettes of IV, V type strength using fine coal in cold pressure method (Deng et al. 1989). However, the cold briquettes prepared solely relying on pressure condition without any additives such as water, diesel, oil, sand, lime, gypsum and other materials have low strength (Meng et al. 1996; Jiang and Guo 1999). In the researches of the additive phase, Ou formed coal samples with different physical and mechanical properties by controlling the mixture of pulverized coal and tar (Ou 2012). Zhang investigated the influence of various materials on similar material properties (Zhang et al. 2016). Wang resoundingly simulated gas seepage test in the similar materials using pulverized coal, cement, sand, activated carbon, which has a great boost to the development of similar material (Wang et al. 2017). The problems of similar material are that the intensity of physical and mechanical properties, the adsorption, desorption characteristics of similar material are lower than raw coal.|$|R
40|$|Co-pyrolysis {{characteristics}} of sludge with <b>coal</b> and sludge <b>briquetted</b> with <b>coal</b> were studied by the TG-FTIR method. From TG data, weight loss of sludge briquetted {{was higher than}} that of sludge and sludge and coal which means that thermal reaction effect of sludge briquetted is better than those of other two materials. Gas products of pyrolysis were CO, CO 2, H 2 O, alcohol, ketone, acid, hydrocarbon, amine and azine from the FTIR analysis. At last, evolving patterns of the pyrolyses and the yields of their gas products have been recorded, providing extremely important data on the mechanism of the process.
