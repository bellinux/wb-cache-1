Quakers consider {{this to be a}} form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|E
25|$|The other protein, TAS1R3, {{is present}} and {{identical}} {{to that of other}} animals, and the relevant taste buds are still present but inactive. Such a genetic marker found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a mutation in an early ancestor; as a deletion mutation it could not revert, and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the evolutionary tree branched out. Some scientists now <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> root of the cat family's extremely specialized evolutionary niche as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.|$|E

25|$|Modern maps of Oz {{are almost}} universally drawn with the Winkies {{in the west}} and the Munchkins in the east, {{although}} west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found through the looking glass in which everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein's book The Number of the Beast he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. March Laumer's The Magic Mirror of Oz attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.|$|E

We <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right choice, and I guarantee it will be worth the wait."

The team as a whole faded late in the season, and were outscored 85–31 over their last three games. Spurrier resigned on December 30, 2003, choosing to walk away from $15 million still owed to him over the remaining three years of his contract. In a statement released by the team, Spurrier said [...] "I apologize to Redskins fans that we did not reach a level of success that we had all hoped...

The Hindu newspaper claimed the Sarpanch was Nathu Jangid, head of the village government, based on witness statement.

2500|$|Reviewers' {{response}} to the album was mostly positive, holding a score of 75 (out of 100) on music review aggregation website Metacritic. Andy Kellman from Allmusic said [...] "Stronger with Each Tear {{is a very good}} Blige album, if not quite a classic. One of her briefest sets, it is tremendously (almost studiously) balanced between all the ground she has covered so well before. That's no criticism, though, since most of the songs are easily memorable and display so much range. Those who detest [...] "The One" [...] on principle, for its use of Auto-Tune, need only to forward to the album's final song, a quiet and sparse throwback (to 40-plus years ago) production from Raphael Saadiq in which Blige professes new love to chilling effect." [...] Mikael Wood from Spin magazine also liked the album saying [...] "Mary J. Blige has spent the past decade effecting a slow transformation from R's queen of pain to the closest thing the genre counts to Oprah Winfrey. Judging by the titles on Blige's latest, that transformation is almost complete: 'Good Love,' 'I Feel Good,' 'I Love U (Yes I Du).' It's hard to <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same woman who once felt the need to announce she was done with drama. Yet despite the conviction that those track names suggest—and despite solid writing and production contributions from A-listers [...] it feels less vital than 2005's terrific The Breakthrough or 2007's Growing Pains [...] The result is minor Mary—strong by many standards, a bit tepid by hers." [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau offered the description, [...] "plainspoken, low-drama, midtempo love vows, with attempted glamour relegated to the cover shoot", while naming [...] "Tonight" [...] and [...] "I Am" [...] as the record's highlights.|$|E
2500|$|More recent {{critical}} reviews {{show the}} album remains highly regarded. Allmusic said [...] "Their rhythms {{may have been}} reggae-based, their music Jamaican-inspired, but UB40 had such an original take on the genre that all comparisons were moot... Their music was... revolutionary, their sound unlike anything else on either island ... It's hard to <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same UB40 that later topped the U.K. charts {{with the likes of}} 'Red Red Wine' and 'I Got You Babe'. Their fire was dampened quickly, but on Signing Off it blazed high, still accessible to the pop market, but so edgy that even those who are sure there's nothing about the group to admire will change their tune instantly." [...] In 2008 Mojo magazine's online website revisited the album as part of their [...] "Disc of the Day" [...] series, calling it [...] "the Brum reggae institution's original and best" [...] and going on to say that [...] "Signing Off was a singular British take on Jamaican music, in some ways truer to the reggae source than 2-Tone but with a punky, multi-cultured sensibility of its own... it's a superb balance of lightness and weight, as spry, skanking tunes rub up against militant lyrics made soulful by vocalist Ali Campbell." [...] The print edition of the magazine also reviewed the 2010 reissue, stating that [...] "Signing Off... has retained much of its fire... this is flinty, political and Britain-focused reggae, distinct from the later output of a band that... still acts as the form's global ambassadors." [...] Reviewing the 2010 Collector's Edition, BBC Music said [...] "Signing Off is still believed {{by many to be the}} group's greatest album, and it remains the clearest window into what the band were all about... has energy and intelligence that made it stand out from so much post-punk pop. This set sums up a bunch of young Brummies schooled in the West Indian blues dances of Balsall Heath, angry about the world around them and articulate enough to express that without simply ranting." ...|$|E
