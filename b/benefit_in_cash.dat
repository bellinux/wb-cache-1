40|$|Social {{assistance}} means aid to vulnerable {{individuals and}} groups. Who are the vulnerable? In any society, {{they are the}} ones who suffer from the effects of old age, illness, disability, natural disasters, economic crises, or civil conflicts. They include the sick, the elderly and the disabled who cannot care for themselves; the mentally ill; war victims; refugees; widows and orphans; HIV/AIDS sufferers; those dislocated by floods, earthquakes, or fire, by lost livelihoods, or by forced relocation, who cannot at any given time muster the resources for their own subsistence. Such vulnerable individuals are almost always poor, either as a cause or an effect of their vulnerability, and are regarded as having some form of entitlement to this kind of assistance. Social assistance comprises programs all forms of public action, government and nongovernment, that transfer resources to those who are vulnerable and eligible in order to assist these most vulnerable individuals, households, or communities to meet their subsistence needs and help them achieve a decent living standard. It is usually defined as a <b>benefit</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> or in kind, paid by the state on the basis of a means or income test, but can apply to other forms of nonstate assistance, such as relief provided by charities...|$|E

40|$|In Germany, {{individuals}} {{in need of}} long-term care receive support through benefits of the long-term care insurance. A central goal of the insurance is to support informal care provided by family members. Care recipients can choose between <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> kind (formal home care services) and <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash.</b> From a budgetary perspective family care is a cost-saving alternative to formal home care and to stationary nursing care. However, the opportunity costs resulting from reduced labor supply of the carer are often overlooked. We focus on the labor supply decision of family carers and the incentives set by the long-term care insurance. We estimate a structural model of labor supply and the choice of benefits of family carers. We find that <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> kind have small positive effects on labor supply. Labor supply elasticities of cash benefits are larger and negative. If both types of benefits increase, negative labor supply effects are offset to a large extent...|$|R

40|$|The {{unintended}} {{effects of}} social policy measures are frequently important, controversial, difficult to ascertain and {{even more difficult to}} quantify. Some selected aspects of four types of unintended effects are discussed in this article. First, effects due to redistribution of income as well as life chances and opportunities as determined by market forces and attitudes (sexism, ageism, racism) favor some at the expense of others. Even redistribution which increases gross domestic product (GDP) often disadvantages certain groups. Second, contingency-related benefits tend to favor population groups differently. Third, free and subsidized health services, in certain conditions, increase both the supply and demand for services-the moral hazard problem. Fourth, contingency <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and kind tend to increase the incidence of such contingencies and, if income-related, tend to result in poverty and unemployment traps.

[...] In 1970 a bill was passed that introduced a new benefit for handicapped children and their families called the Attendance Allowance, although this was not enacted until the following year by the Heath Administration. The Social Work (Scotland) Act of 1968 placed a duty on Scottish local authorities “to make direct payments available to certain disabled adults and children who wish to receive them.” In addition, the National Insurance Act 1969 contained a provision to extend death benefit insurance cover “to make it payable, on the insurance of close relatives, in respect of the deaths of handicapped people who had never themselves been able to work and contribute to insurance." ...|$|R

40|$|Civic {{engagement}} {{in this book}} is understood to include attendance at booked National Health Service appointments; compulsory attendance at school; the take-up {{of a variety of}} State <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and kind, such as Pension Credit and free school meals; and attendance at work. This book is the outcome of a collaborative exercise, in which specialists in a variety of disciplines have come together to better understand the state of civic {{engagement in}} the fields of health, education, social security, and employment. Their research is drawn primarily from the British experience, but the phenomena studied are international in scope. Generally, civic engagement has been improving, but in certain areas there are serious gaps that still need addressing. Administrative arrangements are shown to reduce absence for booked appointments, without necessarily making referred patients more or less likely to attend. A variety of measures are suggested for truancy, and the take-up of social security benefits faces a number of issues. Work absence attributed to sickness is at least partly viewed as a psychosocial problem. Economic analysis shows the importance of incentives, and the potential cost of changing from selective to the universal provision of free school meals. Taken together, the sociological analysis in the book highlights the fragmentation of society and its consequences for civic engagement.

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of marriage and}} the proportion of childbearing that occurs within marriage have decreased sharply in the United States in the last several decades. This paper examines whether the probability that a woman is currently married and the number of children she has borne, as reported in the 1980 U. S. Census, are related to two identifiable factors: the variation in welfare programs across states (specifically, AFDC and Medicaid benefits and AFDC-UP expenditures) or the variation in the market wage opportunities available to women and to their potential husbands. AFDC and Medicaid benefit levels are associated with fewer women being currently married. Medicaid benefits are related to lower fertility levels for both black and white women, whereas AFDC <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and food are associated with lower fertility among white women ages 15 - 24. Those states that extend AFDC benefits to families with unemployed parents (in other words, fathers in intact poor families) do not have significantly more women married or higher fertility rates, contrary to what might be expected from economic incentives. Men's market wages are associated with more frequent marriage and higher fertility, whereas higher market wage opportunities for women have substantial effects in the opposite direction, all of which are consistent with standard models of gender specialization and the demand for marriage and fertility. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} the program participation decision and {{the determinants of}} benefit levels for the two major poverty programs, cash transfers and food stamps, {{before and after the}} 1996 welfare reforms. While the 1996 reforms ended cash entitlements, the changes to the food stamp program were modest. The data for our study come from the March CPS for 1994 and 1999. We find there is less variation across states in food stamp participation rates and <b>benefit</b> levels than <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> transfers. Southerners are more likely to participate in food stamps yet are less likely to participate <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> transfers. Female heads, the less educated, lower income households, the young, and U. S. citizens are more likely to participate in both programs. Welfare reform has resulted in blacks being no more likely to participate <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> transfers than any other racial group. In addition, welfare reform has eliminated any advantage female heads received <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>benefits.</b> <b>In</b> spite of the reformers efforts to redirect benefits to the most needy, we find that there is no relationship between income and the size of cash transfers. ...|$|R

If the state insurance department determines the company cannot be saved, then the insurance commissioner asks the state court to order the liquidation of the company.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} Spanish social {{protection}} system from a gender perspective. The period investigated is between 1978 and 1996. Two primary research questions were found relevant for the investigation. First, to what extent- and in which way- does the {{social protection system}} in Spain affect gender differently in terms of outcomes for men and women. Second, what are the potential factors that explain that degree of gender difference. Two main issues were set up as hypotheses {{for the analysis of}} this second research question: the extent to which gender equality issues are targeted as objectives in the social protection policy process; and, whether women are represented as social actors in the policy-making process. Using secondary statistical data and legislative documents on entitlement rules, the first question is analysed by assessing men and women's access to <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> administered by the public social security system. Additional consideration is given to social services in kind and the income tax system as complementary sources of social provision. Elite interviews and documentary material are undertaken as primary research material for {{the second part of the}} investigation. The focus has been on patterns of neo-corporatism, policy access of women's policy machinery, gender equality strategies and the discourses and ideologies that embrace social actors' intervention in the policy process. The thesis starts with an overview of the existing literature. The first chapters concentrate on theoretical issues and background of the country under study. Chapter 4 locates several ways in which gender stratification is sustained in the social protection system. It will be shown how labour market segregation and specific configuration of benefits through entitlement rules explain two-track access to social security for men and women. Chapter 5, chapter 6, and chapter 7 have identified internal and external factors conditioning the inclusion of gender equality as a relevant issue in the policy process and the intervention of women's policy machinery in policy-making. Bringing together the findings from the previous chapters, chapter 8 identifies a distinctive gender and welfare model common to the countries of southern Europe, outlining challenges for the future of their social protection systems...|$|R

A similar displacement of AFDC by Medicaid benefits appears to have occurred. Aside from implying that preferences for redistribution have not in fact changed, the results also show that the total transfer benefit has increased, as should be expected from growing income levels. The findings also imply that neither the Food Stamp program nor, presumably, any other lump-sum transfer provided by Congress is likely to have any effect on the incomes of the poor female-head population.
