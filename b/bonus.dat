5|$|A {{major change}} {{was made in}} the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off <b>bonus</b> upon overachieving a quota. Where <b>bonus</b> rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of their normal earnings.|$|E

25|$|According to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, Citigroup paid {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars in <b>bonuses</b> to more than 1,038 of its employees after it had received its $45 billion TARP funds in late 2008. This included 738 employees each receiving $1 million in <b>bonuses,</b> 176 employees each receiving $2 million <b>bonuses,</b> 124 each receiving $3 million in <b>bonuses,</b> and 143 each receiving <b>bonuses</b> of $4 million to more than $10 million. As a result of the criticism and the U.S. Government's majority holding of Citigroup's common shares, compensation and <b>bonuses</b> were restricted from February 2009 until December 2010.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>bonuses</b> and fines in an ‘inspection game’ where an employer can learn the effort of a worker through costly inspection. Standard game theoretic analysis predicts that fines discourage shirking, whereas <b>bonuses</b> encourage shirking. In contrast, ownpayoff effects suggest that both fines and <b>bonuses</b> discourage shirking. In an experiment we find that fines are more effective than <b>bonuses</b> in reducing shirking. However, we do not find that <b>bonuses</b> encourage shirking. Behavioral theories based on Impulse Balance Equilibrium or Quantal Response Equilibrium provide a good account of deviations from Nash equilibrium predictions.

5|$|As at 31 December 2010, the {{remuneration}} of ministers depended on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package {{was made up}} of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a special allowance of one month's salary, and a public service leadership allowance of two months' salary) and variable components (an annual variable component, a performance <b>bonus,</b> and a gross domestic product (GDP) <b>bonus).</b> The annual variable component of up to one and a half month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance <b>bonus</b> was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP <b>bonus</b> depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No <b>bonus</b> was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum <b>bonus</b> of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 salary, and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service <b>bonus</b> in lieu of a performance <b>bonus</b> since {{there was no one to}} assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service <b>bonus</b> was the same as the performance <b>bonus</b> paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.|$|E

5|$|Before December 1981, {{the show}} did not feature a <b>bonus</b> round. Under the <b>bonus</b> round's {{original}} rules, no letters were provided automatically. The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel, {{and then had}} fifteen seconds to attempt solving the puzzle. Also, <b>bonus</b> prizes were selected by the contestant {{at the start of}} the round. The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3, 1988. Starting on September 4, 1989, the first episode of the seventh syndicated season, <b>bonus</b> prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five envelopes labeled W, H, E, E, and L. One prize was always $25,000 in cash, and the rest were changed weekly. Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week. During seasons 16 through 18 (1998–2001), the $25,000 remained in-place the entire week of shows regardless if it was won. At the start of season 19 in 2001, there were three car envelopes and two $25,000 envelopes, which were available the entire week of shows. These envelopes were replaced with the <b>bonus</b> wheel on October 22, 2001.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{lump sum}} <b>bonuses</b> as a {{variable}} pay system is increasingly popular with businesses. Used {{as a means}} to reward strong individual performances of employees, lump sum <b>bonuses</b> are granted according to the manager’s appraisal of the employee’s performance. The aim of this research is to ascertain whether there are factors other than individual performance that exert an influence on the granting of lump sum <b>bonuses.</b> Results show that individual and socio-demographic factors, factors linked to the job, and individual performance have a direct and indirect influence on lump sum <b>bonuses.</b> Thus, contrary to the definition of the concept of lump sum <b>bonuses,</b> individual performance is not the sole factor which determines the granting of lump sum <b>bonuses...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 2004, {{stretched}} by wartime deployments, the US Army countered declining retention {{by increasing}} re-enlistment <b>bonuses</b> and implementing stop-loss to prevent soldiers from separating {{at the end}} of their enlistment. We estimate the effects of <b>bonuses,</b> deployment, and stop-loss on re-enlistment between FY 2002 and 2006. We estimate that the baseline propensity to re-enlist fell by 20 %. However, we find that deployed soldiers are more likely to re-enlist and that the estimated effects of re-enlistment <b>bonuses</b> are similar to those estimated in peacetime. We evaluate the reasons for our findings, and calculate the cost effectiveness of re-enlistment <b>bonuses.</b> Re-enlistment, Deployment, <b>Bonuses,...</b>|$|R
