500|$|Philip Pan's investigation, {{and other}} {{inconsistencies}} highlighted by Falun Gong organisations, led some journalists and other observers {{to entertain the}} possibility that the self-immolation was not as straightforward as the Chinese official media accounts suggested. In the National Review, Ann Noonan of the Laogai Research Foundation suggested that it was [...] "hardly a far-fetched hypothesis" [...] that the government staged the incident or allowed it to proceed to discredit Falun Gong, as the government vowed to crush the practice before the eightieth anniversary celebrations of the Communist Party in July. Clive Ansley, a Vancouver-based rights lawyer who lived in China during the self-immolation, suggested that a dramatic response by Falun Gong would have been understandable, but ultimately concluded that the event was staged: [...] "You've got Falun Gong people in this country, they've been oppressed over and over again, they are not allowed to speak, they are not allowed to assert any of their rights as citizens, the level of frustration must <b>be</b> <b>terribly,</b> terribly high.. I can understand people doing that.. but ironically, we ultimately found out that it was staged anyway, it was not real. it was completely staged by the government." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{television}} reviewer Ken Tucker {{said the}} episode was [...] "rather short on laugh-out-loud funniness", but included several clever ideas, including the Tiger Woods video game, the satire {{of the media}} attention to the Woods scandal, and [...] "one of the best Kenny death scenes ever". Newsweek writer Joshua Alston said the Woods parody [...] "didn't manage to <b>be</b> <b>terribly</b> funny or insightful", and suggested {{the speed at which}} South Park writers can produce a topical episode just days before its broadcast is actually a detriment to the show. Alston said, [...] "Whereas once the show's creators swiftly turned around topical episodes because they could, now the South Park team is expected to seize on the news." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN found much of the episode's humor mediocre, in particular the rehabilitation of the celebrities and the CDC studies of the chimpanzees. Isler said he enjoyed Kenny's death and Butters' obsession with [...] "bush", but felt the theme of the episode was too obvious and less clever than previous South Park episodes. The A.V. Club writer Zack Handlen appreciated the timeliness and relevance of the subject matter, but felt [...] "the satirical target here wasn't meaty enough to warrant a full episode, and the developing plot just felt too half-assed". Handlen said some individual jokes were funny, but the episode as a whole was too one-note and redundant. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said the Woods scandal was several months old, so the episode felt stale and old news. Delgado felt the alien infection theory was too random and lazy, and the idea that men would cheat on their wives if they had more money and opportunity was offensive, but not entirely untrue.|$|E
2500|$|Marijuana {{and cocaine}} in {{particular}} were widely used and {{not considered to}} <b>be</b> <b>terribly</b> dangerous. Popular culture of the time depicted drug culture and illegal drug use as common and unexceptional. Comedians like Cheech and Chong built their acts around drug humor, songs like [...] "Cocaine" [...] became hits and movies like Annie Hall had scenes with drug use.|$|E

2500|$|Musical {{collaborator}} Andy Paley said of Wilson: [...] "When I {{was a kid}} {{listening to}} Beach Boys records, I used to go nuts {{trying to figure out}} what the hell was going on. It sounded so easy, but you'd get to a spot where it was, Jesus, is that a major chord or a minor chord? Now that I'm in the studio with Brian, I know that sometimes he's playing both. He'll do things that sound like they're going to <b>be</b> <b>terribly</b> dissonant, but when it's all put together, It's beautiful. It's actually a great sort of philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The scene spurred {{several people}} to pitch the Pope for Clemente's canonization as a saint. Rossi, a former evangelical minister, {{received}} several messages of support, including a letter showing papal support from Pope Francis in starting the process [...] from the Vatican through the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C. and from Archbishop Jose Horacio Gomez of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. [...] "I've {{never thought of}} him {{in terms of being}} a saint", said former Pirates second baseman Neil Walker, a devout Roman Catholic whose father was a teammate of Clemente. [...] "But he's somebody who lived his life serving others, really. So if it would happen, I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>terribly</b> surprised by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Santos starred {{opposite}} Ogie Alcasid in {{the romantic}} comedy film OMG. A film that was critically and financially unsuccessful, Philbert Dy of ClickTheCity.com wrote, [...] "Santos {{is always a}} bankable talent, and she does pretty well all in all, but OMG goes so far below its own talent level that one can't help but <b>be</b> <b>terribly</b> disappointed.". Santos next role, was in the television sitcom George and Cecil alongside Ryan Agoncillo, as a dominating policewoman married to a submissive school teacher. The show consistently ranked within the top five of over-all primetime programming for weekend viewership garnering 22.2% for Mega Manila during its pilot telecast as yielded by AGB Nielsen Philippines. Santos received a PMPC Star Award nomination for her performance.|$|E

2500|$|Flanders {{returned}} to the family home in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He directed and produced plays with a local amateur theatre group and arranged small musical gatherings with other amateurs of music, including Gerard Hoffnung and Frank Hauser. A stage acting career being no longer possible, he found work as a radio broadcaster and wrote a few song lyrics. At the same time, Swann began composing music for revues. He recalled in 1974, [...] "We wrote our first song {{in the summer of}} 1948. I'd gone over to Michael's home near Hampstead Heath {{to see if he could}} think of some words for a tune I'd written … 'It all sounds a bit like Gilbert and Sullivan, don't you think? … It must <b>be</b> <b>terribly</b> boring in the D'Oyly Carte Company, having to do everything exactly as it always has been done – Idea!" [...] The resulting trio, [...] "In the D'Oyly Cart" [...] , for three disgruntled Savoyards, was accepted by the producer Laurier Lister for his new show Oranges and Lemons. The revue and the trio were highly successful, and Lister commissioned further work from the pair for his next production, Penny Plain (1951). [...] Among their contributions to the latter were [...] "Prehistoric Complaint", a solo for Max Adrian, [...] "dressed in bits of fur as a sort of mis-fit caveman", and [...] "Surly Girls", with Adrian, Desmond Walter-Ellis and Jimmy Thompson as a trio [...] of appalling St Trinian's schoolgirls.|$|E
