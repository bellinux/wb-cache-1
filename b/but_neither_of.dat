5|$|In January 1918, von Trapp was {{replaced}} as commander, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> his two successors {{were able to}} match his accomplishments. In all, U-14 sank 11 ships with a combined gross register tonnage of nearly 48,000 tons. Returned to France {{at the end of}} the war, she rejoined the French Navy in July 1919 under her former name of Curie. She remained in service until 1928 and was scrapped in 1929.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a chipset. Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

5|$|After an {{unremarkable}} school career, Eichmann briefly {{worked for}} his father's mining company in Austria, {{where the family}} had moved in 1914. He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927, and joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in 1932. After returning to Germany in 1933, he joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), where he was appointed {{head of the department}} responsible for Jewish affairsâ€”especially emigration, which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. Eichmann drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first at Nisko in south-east Poland and later in Madagascar, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> these plans were ever carried out.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Ham-Kam {{tried to}} sell the naming rights of the stadium for between NOK5 and 8 million per year, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> their main sponsors, Eidsiva Energi and Sparebanken Hedmark, were interested. The first stage of the stadium opened on 10 August 2008, after which further {{construction}} was terminated. Stage one cost NOK92.5 million to build and NOK19 million for purchase of real estate. By April 2010, BG had combined negative assets, debt and received grants of NOK240 million. Of this, NOK78 million was written-off bad debts to BE1 and NOK19 million was purchase of lots. On 25 September 2009, Hamar Municipality bought HSA, BG, BIP and BE1 for NOK73,000. In December 2009, the municipality increased the share capital in BG with NOK16 million and in BE1 with NOK32 million.|$|E
5|$|On the July 6 {{episode of}} Raw, {{following}} their loss to Edge and Jericho, Carlito turned heel by attacking Primo. At Night of Champions, Carlito challenged for the United States Championship in a Six-Pack Challenge, which also involved Primo, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them {{were able to}} win the title. On the August 3 episode of Raw, Carlito defeated Primo to end their feud. On the August 13 episode of WWE Superstars, Carlito teamed with Rosa Mendes to defeat Kofi Kingston and Mickie James. Mendes would then become Carlito's manager until she {{was traded to the}} ECW brand in September.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force {{encountered}} Vice Admiral Beatty's battlecruiser squadron. The German {{ships were}} the first to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. At 16:52, Moltke hit Tiger with two main gun shells, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> these hits caused any significant damage. Moltke then fired a further four shells, two of which hit simultaneously on the midships and after turrets, knocking both out for a significant period of the battle.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E
5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog turtle and spotted turtle are also similar, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood turtle.|$|E

5|$|Two other Mad Max games, {{developed}} by Cory Barlog and Interplay Entertainment respectively, were in production before {{the announcement of}} this game, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them were successfully released. Although Mad Max {{is not based on}} the film series, it was inspired by its universe, and franchise creator George Miller was consulted during the game's pre-production. Avalanche Studios found developing a vehicular-combat video game a challenge because of their inexperience with creating that type of game. Announced at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the game was re-tooled during development and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were canceled.|$|E
5|$|Webster's first {{priority}} was {{to appoint a}} musical director to build the company from scratch. He negotiated with Bruno Walter and Eugene Goossens, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> those conductors was willing to consider an opera company with no leading international stars. Webster appointed a little-known Austrian, Karl Rankl, to the post. Before the war, Rankl had acquired considerable experience in charge of opera companies in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. He accepted Webster's invitation to assemble and train the principals and chorus of a new opera company, alongside a permanent orchestra that would play in both operas and ballets.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was {{compounded by the fact that}} Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E

5|$|Season ten {{revealed}} that Lex had manufactured {{a number of}} clones {{in an attempt to}} use to heal himself. However, the majority of these clones are flawed and would age at an accelerated rate. One clone of Lex (Mackenzie Gray), aged approximately twenty years older than the original, attempted to get revenge on Clark by trying to kill Lois Lane (Erica Durance) but died before he could finish. The 2-hour series finale reveals Lex had used the parts of other clones to create a composite one but lacked a heart. After an alternate reality version of his father sacrifices himself to Darkseid, Lex is brought back to life through his clone. He speaks with Clark, telling his former friend he accepts they have a destiny as enemies, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them can fulfill their roles unless Clark defeats Darkseid by inspiring humanity. Lex later meets with Tess, and fatally stabs his sister, however, Tess poisons him with a specialized neurotoxin that removes all of Lex's memories. The series ends by shifting seven years into the future, where Lex had been elected as the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both {{had been seen}} to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash. Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his {{with him when he}} came to Rhodesia. Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns. Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the accused men knew the language, and {{the only member of the}} column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard. The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language.|$|E
