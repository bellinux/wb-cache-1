Monitoring of collection rate of the separate battery stream is important for decision making, in particular for implementing interventions to improve the separate {{collection and}} evaluating their results. Limitations of the currently applied method for the estimation of battery collection rate are discussed and a new method, which improves the estimation, is suggested. The method utilizes a more accurate way of estimating the total battery waste generation. This estimation is based on batteries historical consumption estimated with material flow analysis method and distributions of batteries lifespan obtained from empirical data. Empirical data from two decades of <b>battery</b> consumption and <b>disposal</b> in Sweden were analyzed and lifespan distributions have been found for eight different types of batteries by dating over 5000 disposed batteries. The lifespans stretched from 1 to 28 years, with a median lifespan of 3 – 8 years. It is shown how the use of lifespan distributions in the suggested method could considerably improve the estimation of the collection rate. Consequently, the intervention potentials can be identified more accurately and the decision making for investments in the collection system can be improved.

These regulations include requirements of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and regulations pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Energy Policy Act. If the market share of electric vehicles increases {{in response to these}} initiatives, corresponding growth will occur in quantities of spent electric vehicle <b>batteries</b> for <b>disposal.</b> Electric vehicle <b>battery</b> recycling infrastructure must be adequate to support collection, transportation, recovery, and disposal stages of waste battery handling. For some battery types, such as lead-acid, a recycling infrastructure is well established; for others, little exists. This paper examines implications of increasing electric vehicle use for lead recovery infrastructure. Secondary lead recovery facilities can be expected to have adequate capacity to accommodate lead-acid electric vehicle battery recycling. However, they face stringent environmental constraints that may curtail capacity use or new capacity installation. Advanced technologies help address these environmental constraints. For example, this paper describes using backup power to avoid air emissions that could occur if electric utility power outages disable emissions control equipment. This approach has been implemented by GNB Technologies, a major manufacturer and recycler of lead-acid batteries. Secondary lead recovery facilities appear to have adequate capacity to accommodate lead waste from electric vehicles, but growth in that capacity could be constrained by environmental regulations. Advances in lead recovery technologies may alleviate possible environmental constraints on capacity growth...|$|R

Both the simulator and testbed experiments yielded an average success rate up to 92 %, with an arrival rate of 40 transceive cycles per second. We have demonstrated that our generic energy-harvesting framework is useful for WGSN research because the simulator allowed us to verify the achieved results on the real-life testbed and vice versa.|$|E

Metal transfer factors showed that P. australis poorly accumulate Pb and Sb in roots and very poorly translocate them to leaves after growing for 8 and 16 weeks. It may be a poor phytoextractor of Pb and Sb in metal-contaminated soil at least for the 16 weeks of its initial growth.

50|$|When the Norwegian {{government}} evacuated to the United Kingdom in June 1940 {{they had}} given Gabrielsen the task of administrating the as yet unoccupied parts of Northern Norway. In this respect Gabrielsen commanded the troops still guarding the border against the Soviet Union {{in accordance with the}} capitulation agreement. The border units were under the military command of Colonel Wilhelm Faye. The arrangement had been organized by General Otto Ruge, who during the capitulation negations with the Germans demanded that the Norwegians should either be allowed to retain military forces on the eastern border, or that the Germans should immediately occupy all of Finnmark. This demand originated in a fear of a possible Soviet occupation of Eastern Finnmark, as had happened in Poland in 1939. As the Norwegian military refused to serve under direct German command, any potential orders from the Germans had to go through county governor Gabrielsen. The arrangement was supposed to last until the Germans could deploy forces to Eastern Finnmark, and was not cleared with the exiled Norwegian government, being secret for anyone but Gabrielsen. Gabrielsen and General Ruge ordered Gabrielsen's military chief-of-staff, Major Odd Lindbäck-Larsen, to use the two battalions and one artillery <b>battery</b> at his <b>disposal</b> in preparation for a rebuilding of the Norwegian Armed Forces. Lindbäck-Larsen was to start training officers, using the border guard task as a cover. The 1,600-1,700 strong border guard was however dissolved by the German occupying authorities in July 1940. The plan {{for the establishment of a}} new Norwegian elite army in Finnmark, outside German control, was supposed to include several thousands of soldiers. As part of Ruge's plan Gabrielsen and Lindbäck-Larsen had placed Norwegian liaison officers on strategic points from Saltdalen in the south to Kirkenes in the north-east. The hope had been that a new Norwegian volunteer army would be allowed by the Germans to remain on border guard duties in Finnmark for the duration of the conflict. After the Germans took over the border guard duties in early July 1940 Gabrielsen was given command over four armed Norwegian guard posts at the coast of Eastern Finnmark. These guard posts were set up on the secret orders of the German officer in charge of Eastern Finnmark, SS-Obersturmführer Willy Laqua, in accordance with the capitulation agreement. None of the Norwegian officers and soldiers on border guard duties were informed of the fact that they were under German overall command.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an embedded, wireless, energy-harvesting prototype (E-WEHP) that can power on and sustain embedded sensing functions using the power present in ambient wireless signals in urban areas. This research is part of a bigger effort towards greening RF circuits and applications in order to reduce their pollution foot-print. Pollution due to modern electronics is primarily caused by non-biodegradable packaging waste and batteries that form a big part of most electronics. Electronic waste can especially be a nuisance in RFID and wireless sensors that are mass-produced and widely-used in consumer items, buildings, industries, agriculture and transportation. The first part of this research effort addresses the issue of minimizing electronic packaging waste by characterizing and using biodegradable substrates such as Paper and Perfluoropolymer (PFA) as a dielectric material in RF circuits. Towards this goal, {{the first of its kind}} active wireless sensor modules made of biodegradable paper substrate using a clean and novel inkjet-printing technology is developed and successfully operated in the 900 MHz free ISM band. The second and third part of this research effort addresses the issue of battery waste by investigating the use of ambient solar and wireless radiation for powering RF and embedded electronics for wireless localization and sensing applications without the use of batteries. The second part of this work presents a unique solar-powered tag called SOLTAG that combines solar cells along with an RFID-type powering mechanism to implement a very low-cost, battery-less, semi-passive wireless-tag but with a much longer range than passive EPC-Gen 2 RFID tags. A GPS-like, low-cost, vehicle-tracking system based on a received-signal-strength-indication method using SOLTAGs in vehicles and a wireless network of Mica-motes is successfully developed and tested with accuracy down to 1. 62 meters The third and main part of this research work presents a novel embedded-wireless-energy-harvesting-prototype (E-WEHP) that can successfully power-on and sustain sensing and M 2 M peripherals in a 16 -bit microcontroller using the power present in ambient, wireless, Digital-TV signals without the use of batteries.

In this report, conventional water metering is defined as systems using water meters that display their readings on the meters themselves and advanced water metering as systems that add additional components or functionality to a metering system. Advanced metering has the potential to provide substantial benefits if appropriately applied. However, compared with conventional metering, these systems are considerably more expensive and complicated, and often rely on technology that is still being developed. Advanced metering systems therefore carry a higher risk of failure, poor service delivery and financial losses unless the system is implemented with careful design and thorough planning. This report describes a number of case studies of the application of advanced metering in South Africa. The case studies were evaluated according to the evaluation framework described in Appendix A and their detailed evaluations are included in each relevant chapter. Evaluations were done in four areas: technical, environmental, social and economic. The technical evaluation is based on the systems complying with the relevant national metering standards and good metering practice, the environmental evaluations on <b>battery</b> <b>disposal</b> and water savings and the social evaluation on broad socio-economic indicators. It should be recognised that social issues are particularly complex and that no general evaluation framework can accurately predict whether an advanced metering system will be accepted by a particular community. The economic evaluations were based on reductions of the current system cost and not absolute values. Economic performance indicators included the effective surplus (income minus expenses over averaged over the meter service life) and capital repayment period. An overview of lessons learned and conclusions from the case studies are provided in Chapters 8 and 9 of the report...|$|E

To implement such a system, wireless solutions have increasingly become an attractive proposition due to the ease of installation and minimal infrastructure alternation. However, currently most wireless sensors in the world are powered by a finite battery source. The dependence of batteries not only requires frequent maintenance, but also has adverse environmental consequences associated with <b>battery</b> <b>disposal.</b> These reasons render massive deployment of wireless sensors in the industry problematic. With the advances in semiconductors, power consumption of wireless sensors has been continuously decreasing. It is an inevitable trend for self-powered wireless sensors to emerge and become the norm for machine and environmental monitoring. In this research, vibration is chosen to be the energy source to enable self-powered wireless sensors due to its ubiquitousness in machinery and industrial environments. As a result of relying on resonance, the biggest challenge for vibration-based energy harvesters is their narrow bandwidth. Even a small deviation of the vibration frequency can dramatically reduce the power output. The primary goal of this research is to address this problem. In particular, Piezoelectric generators are identified to be the most suitable technology. In this work, extensive theoretical and experimental studies are conducted in single mass and multi-modal harvesters, and in resonance tuning harvesters by modulus and impedance matching as well as by mechanical actuation. Mathematical modelling plays a significant role in energy harvester designs. A dynamic model that generalises the single degree of freedom models and the continuum models is derived and validated by experiments. The model serves as the building block for the whole research, and it is further refined for the investigation of modulus and impedance matching. In the study of multi-modal harvesters, a continuum model for double-mass piezoelectric cantilever beams is derived and experimentally validated. To study the feasibility of resonance tuning by mechanical means, prototypes were built and performance evaluated. This document details the theoretical basis, concepts and experimental results that extend the current knowledge in the field of energy harvesting. This research work, being highly industrially focused, is believed to be a very significant step forward to a commercial energy harvester that works for {{a wide range}} of vibration frequencies...|$|E
