50|$|Brigo {{started his}} work with the development, with Bernard Hanzon and Francois Le Gland (1998), of the {{projection}} filters, a family of approximate nonlinear filters based on the differential geometry approach to statistics, also related to information geometry. With Fabio Mercurio (2002 - 2003), he has shown how to construct stochastic differential equations consistent with mixture models, applying this to volatility smile modeling {{in the context of}} local volatility models. With Aurelien Alfonsi (2005), Brigo introduced new families of multivariate distributions in statistics through the periodic copula function concept. Since 2002, Brigo contributed to credit derivatives modeling and counterparty risk valuation, showing with Pallavicini and Torresetti (2007) how data implied non-negligible probability that several names defaulted together, showing some large default clusters and a concrete risk of high losses in collateralized debt obligations prior to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. This work has been further updated in 2010 leading to a volume for Wiley, while a volume on the updated nonlinear theory of valuation, including credit effects, collateral modeling and funding costs, has appeared in 2013. Overall Brigo authored more than seventy publications and co-authored the <b>book</b> <b>Interest</b> rate models: theory and practice for Springer-Verlag, that quickly became an international reference for stochastic dynamic interest rate modeling in finance. Brigo has been the most cited author in the technical section of the industry influential Risk Magazine in 2006, 2010 and 2012.|$|E

This is far removed {{both from the}} practice of interest rate setting, inflation-targeting central banks and from the models that are taught in graduate courses.

Since Woodford assumes {{complete}} markets, this paper explicitly includes state-contingent securities with either temporary money or a cash-in-advance constraint to analyze Woodford’s logic. This analysis finds four logical problems with Woodford’s analysis: (1) Woodford’s assumption that his solution is bounded is inappropriate. (2) Any finite version of Woodford’s model is incomplete. (3) Woodford’s central bank does not control nominal interest rates. (4) Woodford argument that interest rates determine prices and that prices affect the interest rate is circular and hence invalid. cashless economy, monetary economics, pegging interest rates, central banking...|$|E

40|$|Course Goals: I {{have changed}} the {{orientation}} of this course from previous years to emphasize more heavily common empirical methods in monetary economics. 235 A and 235 C will provide more theoretical foundations. Ultimately, the ideal goal is to motivate your interest in these topics and get you started in your dissertation. The syllabus includes many papers for each topic (and even some topics at the end that I will probably not cover this time around). You {{are not expected to}} read all of them. Rather, I hope this syllabus will serve as a useful bibliographical reference so that you may concentrate on topics that interest you. Textbook(s) : Carl Walsh's book, Monetary Theory and Policy (MTP hereafter), will serve as the main text for the course to continue where you left of in 235 A. However, many references in the bibliography cite chapters in Fabio Canova’s new book, Methods of Applied Macroeconomic Research (MAMR hereafter). Fabio’s book will be a nice complement and reference to the notes I provide in class although on its own, you may find it a little too terse. Michael Woodford’s new <b>book,</b> <b>Interest</b> and Prices, (Princeton University Press) is another important reference book, especially for {{the latter part of the}} course and it may be useful as background for some of the topics in 235 C.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. The {{financial}} intermediation function that a bank performs dictates {{the existence of}} a risk-reward trade-off embedded within a bank's balance sheet. The process of risk management focuses on achieving the broader organisational objectives relating to this risk-reward trade-off. Measuring the contribution of risk to profitability is pivotal in assessing the optimality of a bank's risk-reward trade-off. Conventional accounting-based performance measures such as return on assets and return on equity do not incorporate the risk effects as part of the performance assessment. Risk-adjusted performance measurement assessments, such as risk-adjusted return on capital, acknowledge the impact of risk in measuring the profitability of a bank. Interest rate risk is an important source of bank profitability. The Asset-and-Liability Management function of a bank is tasked with the management of interest rate risk in the 'banking book' of its balance sheet. Managing interest rate risk demands that the sources of interest rate risk for example, reprice risk, yield curve risk, option risk and basis risk are clearly identified and measured. The impact of interest rate risk can be assessed from two perspectives namely, the earnings perspective and the economic value perspective. Measuring the impact of interest rate risk conventionally involves a number of techniques, each of which has inherent strengths and weaknesses. Simulation modelling techniques deploying earnings-at-risk and economic value of equity analyses respectively, most accurately quantifies the earnings and economic value perspectives to the effects of interest rate risk. The methods of repricing gap analyses and duration analyses present efficiency constraints in measuring interest rate risk although complimentary to developing a complete interest rate risk metrics framework. Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing is an important component in measuring the risk-adjusted net interest margin for the risk-adjusted performance measurement process. Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing system isolates the business units from the effects of interest rate risk by transferring the interest rate risk or mismatch spread (profit or loss) to the Central Funding Unit or Asset-and-Liability Management unit. Business units are therefore allocated the net interest margin components relating to the controllable risk elements for which management responsibility is assumed. Business units use the risk-adjusted performance measurement results to develop balance sheet and pricing strategies that are sensitised to asset and liability management and interest rate risk management objectives through the Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing mechanism. These business strategies {{should be included in the}} measurement of interest rate risk by the asset-and-liability management simulation model. The asset-and-liability management process can therefore optimise the interest rate risk management process. The integration of the Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing, Asset-and-Liability Management and banking <b>book</b> <b>interest</b> rate risk management processes institutes a risk-optimisation approach to risk management compared against the conventional risk-control perspective to the function of risk management.
