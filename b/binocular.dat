5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus.

5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them <b>binocular</b> vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had <b>binocular</b> vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving <b>binocular</b> vision. It {{is hard to see how}} natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, <b>binocular</b> vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the egret's eyes allows for <b>binocular</b> vision during feeding, and physiological {{studies suggest that the}} species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Vesta reached {{opposition}} in the constellation of Leo {{on the night of}} 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in <b>binocular</b> range but generally not for the naked eye. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.|$|E
5|$|Two skull bones, the {{lacrimal}} and postorbital bones, projected {{into the}} eye socket {{from the front}} and back, nearly dividing it into two compartments. The eye would have been located in the upper compartment, which was tilted slightly outwards in Carnotaurus, perhaps providing some degree of <b>binocular</b> vision. The lacrimal and postorbital also met above the eye socket, to form a ridge or brow above the eye.|$|E
5|$|APM 08279+5255 {{is a very}} distant, broad {{absorption}} line quasar discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found. It is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It {{appears to be a}} giant elliptical galaxy with a supermassive black hole around 23 billion times as massive as the Sun and an associated accretion disk that has a diameter of 3600 light years. The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. It has a cosmological redshift of 3.911. While observing the quasar in 2008, astronomers using ESA's XMM Newton and the Large <b>Binocular</b> Telescope (LBT) in Arizona discovered the huge galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133.|$|E
5|$|Close to Gamma Corvi {{and visible}} in the same <b>binocular</b> field is R Corvi, a long period (Mira) {{variable}} star. It ranges in brightness from a magnitude of 6.7 to 14.4 with a period of approximately 317 days. TT Corvi is a semiregular variable red giant of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun. TU Corvi is a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars {{that have been used}} as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. It varies by 0.025 of a magnitude around apparent magnitude 6.53 over 59 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have <b>binocular</b> vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1972, {{while driving}} {{home from a}} session of work on his injured {{shoulder}} with the Stoke physiotherapist, Banks lost control of his new Ford Consul (a re-badged Ford Granada Mk 1) car, which {{ended up in a}} ditch. He had attempted to overtake a car on a sharp bend and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van. He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of his right eye, and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. His sight never returned, and as the loss of <b>binocular</b> vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} <b>binocular</b> vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of <b>binocular</b> vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being <b>binocular</b> vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better <b>binocular</b> vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 {{light-sensitive}} rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased <b>binocular</b> vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
5|$|George Malcolm Stratton (September 26, 1865– October 8, 1957) was a {{psychologist}} who pioneered the study of perception in vision by wearing special glasses which inverted images {{up and down and}} left and right. He studied under {{one of the founders of}} modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, and started one of the first experimental psychology labs in America, at the University of California, Berkeley. Stratton's studies on <b>binocular</b> vision inspired many later studies on the subject. He was one of the initial members of the philosophy department at Berkeley, and the first chair of its psychology department. He also worked on sociology, focusing on international relations and peace. Stratton presided over the American Psychological Association in 1908, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He wrote a book on experimental psychology and its methods and scope; published articles on the studies at his labs on perception, and on reviews of studies in the field; served on several psychological committees during and after World War I; and served as advisor to doctoral students who would go on to head psychology departments.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them <b>binocular</b> vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|Stratton went on {{to become}} a first-generation {{experimental}}ist in psychology. Wundt's lab in Leipzig, with experimental programs bringing together the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory physiology and nervous-system studies, was a part of the career of most of the first generation. It was the exposure there, added to the graduate work at Yale, that influenced Stratton into becoming a psychologist. It was there that he started his <b>binocular</b> vision experiments as well. In these experiments, he found himself adapting to the new perception of the environment over a few days, after inverting the images his eyes saw on a regular basis. For this, he wore a set of glasses inverting images both upside-down and left-right. Stratton wore these glasses over his right eye and covered the left with a patch during the day, and slept blindfolded at night. Initial movement was clumsy, but adjusting to the new environment took only a few days.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark has an elongated, cigar-shaped {{body with}} a short, bulbously rounded snout. The {{nostrils}} have a very short flap of skin in front. The large, oval, green eyes are placed forward on the head, though not {{so that there is}} extensive <b>binocular</b> vision. Behind the eyes are large spiracles, positioned on the upper surface of the head. The mouth is short, forming a nearly transverse line, and is surrounded by enlarged, fleshy, suctorial lips. There are 3037 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2531 tooth rows in the lower jaw, increasing with body size. The upper and lower teeth are extremely different: the upper teeth are small, narrow, and upright, tapering to a single, smooth-edged cusp. The lower teeth are also smooth-edged, but much larger, broader, and knife-like, with their bases interlocking to form a single saw-like cutting edge. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of <b>binocular</b> vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide <b>binocular</b> vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a <b>binocular</b> view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The T-26-4 {{with the}} KT tank gun passed tests {{successfully}} and five vehicles {{were built in}} 1933–1934 as pilot batch. Initially it was planned to arm three of these T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 {{and the other two}} tanks with the 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun. The PS-3 tank gun was developed at the Experimental Engineering-Mechanical Department (OKMO) of the Factory No. 174 by engineer P. Syachentov. The PS-3 had better specifications in comparison with the series-produced KT tank gun and also had several technical innovations (foot firing switch, original training gear, travelling position fixing, <b>binocular</b> optical sight). The T-26-4 armed with the PS-3 tank gun was tested in October 1933 but {{it was found that the}} PS-3 was too powerful for the T-26 light tank—turret's race ring and hull roof were deformed during gun fire, and the suspension springs were damaged. It was decided to arm the T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun only. All five experimental T-26-4 artillery tanks were tested during military exercises near Leningrad in September 1934 before scheduled series production of 50 such vehicles in 1935. But on 19 September 1934 an incident with a T-26-4 took place: a blow-back because of shell case destruction during gun fire. Despite the fact that this defect was unrelated to turret design, the military representatives cancelled the order to produce the T-26-4. Also the work to design turretless AT-1 artillery tanks armed with the powerful 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun started at that time. The T-26-4's turret construction was the design used in the series-produced BT-7A artillery tank.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good <b>binocular</b> vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E
25|$|They {{also use}} vision-enhancing {{devices such as}} MATIS thermographic cameras, {{daylight}} thermographic cameras, binoculars, PalMIr 250 night vision cameras, Philips BM8028A1 <b>binocular</b> night vision goggles, ITT AN/AVS-9 <b>binocular</b> night vision goggles, ITT Pocket F6010 night vision visor and laser rangefinders.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} {{penalization}} of one eye by means of patching or atropine drops does not provide the conditions that are necessary in order to develop or improve <b>binocular</b> vision. Recently, efforts have been made to propose alternative treatments of amblyopia that do allow for the improvement of <b>binocular</b> sight, for example using binasal occlusion or partially frosted spectacles in place of any eye patch, using alternating occlusion goggles or using methods of perceptual learning based on video games or virtual reality games for enhancing <b>binocular</b> vision.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{researchers}} {{assumed that}} humans had to acquire <b>binocular</b> vision, in particular stereopsis, {{in early childhood}} or they would never gain it. In recent years, however, successful improvements in persons with amblyopia, convergence insufficiency or other stereo vision anomalies have become prime examples of neuroplasticity; <b>binocular</b> vision improvements and stereopsis recovery are now active areas of scientific and clinical research.|$|E
25|$|Clarity grading by AGS {{standards}} requires examination using a <b>binocular</b> {{stereo microscope}} equipped with adjustable zoom magnification and darkfield illumination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Binocular</b> rivalry is a {{phenomenon}} of visual perception in which perception alternates between different images presented to each eye.|$|E
25|$|Stenonychosaurus {{are thought}} to have been predators, a view {{supported}} by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good <b>binocular</b> vision.|$|E
25|$|A head turn to {{the side}} of the {{affected}} eye to compensate for the movement limitations of the eye(s) and to maintain <b>binocular</b> vision.|$|E
25|$|Orthoptic {{exercises}} {{have proven}} to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating exophoria by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for <b>binocular</b> fusion.|$|E
25|$|When {{the images}} {{presented}} to the eyes differ only in their contours, rivalry {{is referred to as}} <b>binocular</b> contour rivalry. When the images {{presented to the}} eyes differ only in their colours, rivalry is referred to as <b>binocular</b> colour rivalry. When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their lightnesses, a form of rivalry called <b>binocular</b> lustre may be seen. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, the image is usually seen continuously. This is referred to as contour dominance. Occasionally however, the blank field, or even the dark field of a closed eye, can become visible, making the image invisible for about as long as it would be invisible were it in rivalry with another image of equal stimulus strength. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, introducing a different image onto the blank field usually results in that image being seen immediately. This is referred to as flash suppression.|$|E
25|$|Together with Levi of the University of California, Berkeley, {{scientists}} at the University of Rochester have made further developments in terms of virtual reality computer games which have shown some promise in improving both monocular and <b>binocular</b> vision in human subjects.|$|E
25|$|Also when {{children}} with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. infantile esotropia) receive strabismus surgery {{within the first}} few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for <b>binocular</b> vision including stereopsis.|$|E
25|$|Complex eyes can {{distinguish}} shapes and colours. The visual fields of many organisms, especially predators, involve {{large areas of}} <b>binocular</b> vision to improve depth perception. In other organisms, eyes are located so as to maximise the field of view, such as in rabbits and horses, which have monocular vision.|$|E
