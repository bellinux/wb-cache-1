5|$|The {{enormous}} task which Gaudí faced, not {{in terms}} of the number of works, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen. Gaudí always led the way, but allowed expression of the individual abilities of all of his collaborators. A test of his expertise both in his field and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Buckley {{wrote that}} by 1 July, {{there was a}} {{stalemate}} in which the British were established south of the Odon but had retired from Hill 112, in {{what may have been}} a premature decision. The Germans had maintained a continuous front but only by using reserves which made it impossible to begin the counter-offensive planned by , which made the offensive a considerable Allied success, as part of a strategy of attrition based on organised fire power. Looked on as an attempt to break through and force the Germans out of Caen the operation failed <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> Montgomery's strategy it was a costly victory. The German defence of Normandy never recovered from the damage inflicted during Epsom, the initiative was lost and German counter-attack tactics failed in the face of Allied fire power, with even greater cost than that inflicted on the British; the German command structure and assumptions on which the defence was based were undermined.|$|E

Lacan retains Freud's dualism <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> an opposition between the symbolic and the imaginary and not referred to different kinds of drives.

Or in the context of approximate query optimization, it is possible to execute query plans on randomly selected samples of the input data in order to obtain approximate results with reduced execution overhead.

There {{is also the}} Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than either of these in modern psychopathy research on adults.|$|E

25|$|Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman {{authors were}} not so strict about the {{boundary}} between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible koina, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, nous (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of koina, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not {{just in terms of}} memories of sense perceptions, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.|$|E

Social and economic issues are vital to her not from a technical point of view <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> moral and ethical issues involved. Ethical considerations include the nature of private property. Within the Catholic Church several conflicting views had developed. Pope Pius XI declares private property essential for the development and freedom of the individual. Those who deny private property, deny personal freedom and development. But, said Pius, private property has a social function as well. Private property loses its morality, if it is not subordinated to the common good. Therefore, governments have a right to redistribution policies. In extreme cases, the Pope grants the State a right of expropriation of private property.|$|E
