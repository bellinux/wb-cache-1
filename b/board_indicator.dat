40|$|Objectives: Novel {{quantitative}} {{measures of}} the trans-pulmonary circulation status may allow improvement of heart failure (HF) patient management. In this work, we propose a method {{for the assessment of}} the trans-pulmonary circulation using measurements from indicator time-intensity curves, derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MRI) image series. The derived indicator dilution parameters in healthy volunteers (HV) and HF patients were compared, and repeatability was assessed. Furthermore, we compared the parameters derived using the proposed method with standard measures of cardiovascular function (such as left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction). Materials and methodsIn all, 19 HVs and 33 HF patients underwent a DCE-MRI scan on a 1. 5 T MRI scanner using a T 1 -weigthed spoiled gradient echo sequence. Image loops with one heart-beat temporal resolution were acquired in four-chamber view during ventricular late diastole, after the injection of a 0. 1 mmol gadoteriol bolus. On a subset of the patients (8 HF, 2 HV), a second injection of a 0. 3 mmol gadoteriol bolus was performed with same imaging settings. The study was approved by the local institutional review <b>board.</b> <b>Indicator</b> dilution curves (IDCs) were derived averaging the MR signal within regions of interest in the right and left ventricle; parametric deconvolution was performed between right and left ventricular (LV) IDCs to identify the impulse response of the trans-pulmonary dilution system. The local density random walk model was used to parametrize the impulse response; pulmonary transit time (PTT) was defined as the mean transit time of the indicator; λ, related to the Peclet number (ratio between convection and diffusion) for the dilution process, was also estimated. Results PTT was significantly prolonged in HF patients (8. 70 ± 1. 87 s vs. 6. 68 ± 1. 89 s in HV, p 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 005), even stronger when normalized to subject heart rate (normalized PTT, 9. 90 ± 2. 16 vs. 7. 11 ± 2. 17 in HV, dimensionless, p 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 001). λ was significantly smaller in HF patients (8. 59 ± 4. 24 in HF vs. 12. 50 ± 17. 09 in HV, dimensionless, p 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 005), indicating a longer tail for the impulse response. PTT correlated well with established cardiovascular parameters (left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, r= 0. 61, p 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 0001; left ventricular ejection fraction r=- 0. 62, p 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 0001). We consider the measurement of indicator dilution parameters this way repeatable (correlation between estimates based on the two repetitions for PTT: r= 0. 94, p 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 001, difference between two repetitions 0. 01 ± 0. 60 s, for λ: r= 0. 74, p 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 01, difference 0. 69 ± 4. 39). ConclusionsCharacterization of the trans-pulmonary circulation by DCE-MRI is feasible in heart failure patients and healthy volunteers. Significant differences are observed between indicator dilution parameters measured in healthy volunteers and heart failure patients; preliminary results suggest good repeatability for the proposed parameters...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{connection}} between the return volatilities of credit market securities and equities using the Merton model. Focusing primarily on monthly bond and CDS returns, we find that the credit market exhibits volatility in excess of what the equity market and the Merton model suggest. Though prior evidence suggests that the average magnitudes of the relative credit and equity market returns can be characterized by the Merton model, the excess volatility suggests that the value in credit markets sometimes deviate from fundamentals. This deviation is most severe for issues that are illiquid, have poorer ratings, and longer time-to-maturity. However, the excess volatility in credit markets {{does not appear to be}} worse at the height of the Financial Crisis.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper, the theory of {{ecological}} modernization is discussed with respect to some of its central assumptions, taking into account a number of the criticisms that have been raised against the theory. It is argued that the focus of the theory on substance and energy flows within social systems does not necessarily imply a resort to some sort of näve realism which denies the inherently social and contested nature of environmental problems. It is, however, important for environmental sociologists to take on <b>board</b> <b>indicators</b> and criteria that refer to the material dimension of social systems in order to be able to contribute to the debate on sustainable production and consumption. Furthermore, it is argued that environmental technologies are of crucial importance for bringing about more sustainable ways of industrial production and consumption. It is described how the real or supposed dangers of a central focus on technology would result in a technological-fix scheme of environmental social change, or a shallow form of green capitalism. We conclude the section on the general characteristics of the theory with a plea for elaborating ecological modernization theory at the middle-range level, taking into account the different social and environmental characteristics of the various target groups that figure as the central objects of environmental policy-making. The second part of the paper takes the target group of domestic consumers as a point of departure for elaborating ecological modernization theory. Structuration theory is applied to design a model which can be used as an analytical tool in investigating the ecological modernization of domestic consumption. The EU-funded international DOMUS project is used to illustrate the need for consumer involvement in the ecological modernization of domestic routines and life-styles. The paper concludes with a short discussion of the political questions that go along with eco-modernization of domestic consumption under conditions of reflexive modernity...|$|R
