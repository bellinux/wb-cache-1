[...] Amongst the 20 standard naturally occurring amino acids necessary for protein synthesis, four are aromatic [...] histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. (Histidine is aromatic at all pH levels due to its imidazole side-chain but is also basic and so is often grouped with the two other <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> arginine and lysine.) [...] Aromatic amino acids also serve as the starting materials for biosynthesis of vitamins, neurotransmitters and hormones including dopamine and norepinephrine from tyrosine, serotonin and niacin from tryptophan, and tyrosine, thyroxine, and N-methylphenethylamine from phenylalanine.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{heat-stable}} enterotoxin II (STII) {{is composed}} of 48 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues. Among these, one histidine, two arginine, and six lysine residues are basic. Isoelectric focusing showed that the isoelectric point of STII is 9. 7, indicating that the side chains {{of some of these}} <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues project outside the molecule. To understand the role that these <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues play in toxicity, STII was chemically modified with ethoxyformic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and phenylglyoxal, which alter the side chains of <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues in proteins. Maleic anhydride, which modifies the epsilon amino group, caused a significant loss of enterotoxic activity, but the other two modifiers did not. This indicated that lysine residues {{play an important role in}} the expression of the enterotoxic activity of STII and that the contribution of the other <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues to the toxicity is relatively low. To confirm this hypothesis, we substituted these nine <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and examined the enterotoxicity of these purified mutant STIIs. The enterotoxic activity was reduced when the lysine residues at positions 18, 22, 23, and 46 were substituted. In particular, the substitution at positions 22 and 23 induced a remarkable reduction. These results demonstrate that the lysine residues at positions 22 and 23 are very important in the expression of the enterotoxic activity of STII...|$|R

NLS sequences can be monopartite (single cluster of <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids)</b> or bipartite (two clusters of <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> with a linker sequence). The ARM domain contains two binding sites within, allowing a single importin α molecule to interact with two monopartite NLS-containing proteins or a single bipartite NLS protein.|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 circulates in vivo as {{a mixture of}} heterologous populations (quasispecies). We previously analyzed the quasispecies of the third hypervariable region (V 3) in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp 120 in an infected individual {{and found that the}} species with a <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> substitution (lysine for aspartic acid) at a particular position evolved and became a distinct population within a short period, followed by progression to the typical immunodeficiency stage (S. Oka et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10 : 271 - 277, 1994). In the present study, we examined the biological significance of this <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> substitution by constructing recombinant viruses with specific point mutations and comparing their replication capabilities in different cell types. The results demonstrated that the single <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> substitution was sufficient to render a virus fully capable of replicating in human T-cell lines under certain conditions. With an acidic <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> at the position, the virus grew much less fast or did not grow at all in the T-cell lines. Viral neutralization assay and peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays further showed that this <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> substitution resulted in different recognition by several of the serum specimens from human {{immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 -infected individuals and thus could alter the antigenic structure. An additional finding worthy of note was that at the terminal stage, the proviral sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the viral isolates from them were without exception of the late type with the <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> substitution, whereas the early sequence without the substitution was retained as a major subset in the spleen. These results support the notion that <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> substitutions in V 3 are a strong predictor of virus tropism and may be relevant to disease progression...|$|R

40|$|Mutations of the {{survival}} motor neuron gene SMN 1 cause the inherited disease {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA). The ubiquitous SMN protein facilitates the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). The protein is detected in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and enriched with snRNPs in nuclear Cajal bodies. It is structurally divided into at least an amino-terminal region rich in <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues, a central Tudor domain, a self-association tyrosine-glycine-box and an exon 7 -encoded C-terminus. To examine the domains required for the intranuclear localization of SMN, we have used fluorescently tagged protein mutants transiently overexpressed in mammalian cells. The <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues direct nucleolar localization of SMN mutants. The Tudor domain promotes localization of proteins in the nucleus and it cooperates with the <b>basic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues and the tyrosine-glycine-box for protein localization in Cajal bodies. Moreover, the most frequent disease-linked mutant SMN{Delta}ex 7 reduces accumulation of snRNPs in Cajal bodies, suggesting that the C-terminus of SMN participates in targeting to Cajal bodies. A reduced number of Cajal bodies in patient fibroblasts associates with the absence of snRNPs in Cajal bodies, revealing that intranuclear snRNA organization is modified in disease. These results indicate that direct and indirect mechanisms regulate localization of SMN in Cajal bodies...|$|R
