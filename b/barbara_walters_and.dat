500|$|Frank Rich {{referenced}} truthiness {{again in}} The New York Times in 2008, describing {{the strategy of}} John McCain's presidential campaign as being [...] "to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness", Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because [...] "McCain, Sarah Palin and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents {{and not just to}} mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it." [...] Rich also noted, [...] "You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on [...] 'The View'. <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters</b> <b>and</b> Joy Behar called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks for Alaska.

500|$|According to Jean, the episode's table read went [...] "great" [...] {{until the}} third act.

[...] In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Selman {{described it as}} [...] "It's the comedy of saying: 'Oh, he [...] can't do all the stuff {{you want him to}} do'." [...] It was also hard to [...] "keep the story moving" [...] back to normal, since they kept having to [...] "re-use the premise". The episode features American comedian John Kassir as one of the dogs in the gay pride parade {{in the beginning of the}} episode. <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters</b> <b>and</b> Star Jones, the hosts of The View, were portrayed by American voice-actor Tress MacNeille.

2500|$|All My Children made {{television}} {{history on}} April 23, 2003 when Lena and Bianca shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. The kiss {{was not the}} first same-sex kiss for daytime television. The United Kingdom had featured its first lesbian kiss between fictional characters on the soap opera Brookside ten years earlier in December 1993, portrayed by actresses Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson. Lena and Bianca sharing a kiss, however, and also being between two people of the same sex, was something that had been thought of as unlikely for American soap opera. The kiss received media attention such as TV Guide, Soap Opera Digest, and other publications. On the day before the kiss aired, Riegel and Sosnovska appeared on the morning talk show The View and answered questions from <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters</b> <b>and</b> the other hosts, including guest host Monica Lewinsky.

2500|$|Concerned Women for America {{is part of}} a {{movement}} known as the New Christian Right. Organized in reaction to the establishment of its liberal counterpart, the National Organization for Women; the growing dispute over traditional gender roles; and the rising discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), the CWA set out to [...] "fight policies that it believe [...] disrupt traditional gender roles and norms." [...] Fueling its formation, an interview between <b>Barbara</b> <b>Walters</b> <b>and</b> Betty Friedan, a prominent feminist activist, gained public attention in 1978 regarding women's issues. In the interview, Friedan claimed to speak as a women's group for American women. Beverly LaHaye did not believe that Betty Friedan was speaking for the majority of women because feminist views were, according to LaHaye, anti-God and anti-family. In regards to the interview, LaHaye stated that she was convinced Friedan’s goal was a [...] "misguided attempt to dismantle the bedrock of American culture: the family," [...] and that she believed Christian women were not included in discussions of women's rights. In this regard, the [...] "concern" [...] that the CWA had behind the name of the group was in response to the worries that feminism would [...] "ruin" [...] America. Such fears and opposition to much of the Democratic party's ideology during this era led Beverly LaHaye to host a series of conventions and rallies in San Diego, resulting in Concerned Women for America's formation. As a result, the CWA became known as [...] "the largest women's organization of the Christian Right during the 1980s and 1990s." ...|$|E
