5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on {{the affected}} side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal <b>breath</b> <b>sounds.</b> In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- This study {{focuses on}} the {{automation}} of acoustical respiratory phase detection process {{without the aid of}} airflow measurement. Instead of measuring the airflow, a computerized algorithm was developed to detect respiratory phases using the <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> signals recorded from both the chest and trachea. 17 sets of normal <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> signals were used to test the accuracy of the phase detection algorithm. 93 % of phase detection accuracy and 100 % of breath onset detection accuracy were achieved in the fully automated mode. The detection of respiratory phases by acoustical means simplifies the experimental apparatus as well as provides accurate timing of breaths...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The use of lung sound {{monitoring}} during bronchial provocation {{testing has}} not been clearly demonstrated. The appearance of wheeze and changes in inspiratory <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> intensity have been analysed and related to changes in spirometric parameters and to airways hyperresponsiveness. METHODS [...] Lung sounds were recorded in 38 patients undergoing a routine carbachol airway challenge (CAC) test. Spirometric testing was performed {{before and after the}} inhalation of each of five cumulative doses of 320 micrograms carbachol; a fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) by 20 % or more was considered as significant. Lung sound analysis was carried out using a computerised system. RESULTS [...] The CAC test was positive (CAC+) in 21 patients and negative (CAC-) in 17. At the final stage of the challenge, wheeze was identified in 10 positive patients (48 %) and in one negative patient (6 %); in non-wheezers the inspiratory <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> intensity decreased significantly from baseline in 11 CAC+ patients (mean (SD) change - 35 (24 %)) but not in 16 CAC- patients (mean (SD) change 5 (24 %)). In all non-wheezers a linear relationship was found between <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> intensity and the squared inspiratory airflow (r = 0. 53 - 0. 92) which became looser after the inhalation of carbachol. CONCLUSION [...] When unertaking bronchial provocation testing the accurate identification of wheeze may prove useful in avoiding or shortening the test because of the presumed relationship between wheeze and airways hyperresponsiveness. Changes in <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> intensity may also be useful, but further studies are required to define the threshold for significant changes in this index...|$|R
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished <b>breath</b> <b>sounds,</b> and rapid breathing is common.

40|$|Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is {{currently}} diagnosed by a full nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), {{a very expensive}} and time-consuming method. In previous studies {{we were able to}} distinguish patients with OSA through formant frequencies of <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> during sleep. In this study we aimed at identifying OSA patients from <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> analysis during wakefulness. The respiratory sound was acquired by a tracheal microphone simultaneously to PSG recordings. We selected several cycles of consecutive inspiration and exhalation episodes in 10 mild-moderate (AHI = 30) OSA patients during their wake state before getting asleep. Each episode's formant frequencies were estimated by linear predictive coding. We studied several formant features, as well as their variability, in consecutive inspiration and exhalation episodes. In most subjects formant frequencies were similar during inspiration and exhalation. Formant features in some specific frequency band were significantly different in mild OSA as compared to severe OSA patients, and showed a decreasing correlation with OSA severity. These formant characteristics, in combination with some anthropometric measures, allowed the classification of OSA subjects between mild-moderate and severe groups with sensitivity (specificity) up to 88. 9 % (84. 6 %) and accuracy up to 86. 4 %. In conclusion, the information provided by formant frequencies of tracheal <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> recorded during wakefulness may allow identifying subjects with severe OSA.

30|$|Our results {{confirm that}} changes in the <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> power {{spectrum}} occur consistently during the development of permeability-type acute lung injury when determined away from adventitious sounds and that these changes contain information that differentiates between more and less severely affected lung regions. As such, <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> spectra free from interference by adventitious sounds could prove useful in the clinical management of patients with lung injury. Restoration of lung volume with PEEP reverses the spectral changes entirely, suggesting that the spectral power abnormalities depend primarily on the severity of regional gas volume loss in the pulmonary parenchyma and could potentially be used to optimize the level of PEEP. It is conceivable that a comprehensive acoustic lung assessment tool could be constructed, with concurrent assessment of spectral changes, sound transmission magnitude, acoustic wavefront velocity, and the number and location of crackles. Such a tool may provide a valuable, non-invasive means to optimize ventilatory support for patients with acute lung injury.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Separation {{of heart}} and lung <b>sounds</b> from <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> {{recordings}} is a challenging task due to the temporal and spectral overlap of the two signals. In this paper, {{the use of a}} spectro-temporal representation to improve signal separation is investigated. The representation is obtained by means of a frequency decomposition (termed modulation frequency) of temporal trajectories of short-term spectral components. Exper-iments described herein suggest that improved separability of heart (HS) and lung sounds (LS) is attained in the modulation frequency domain. Bandpass and bandstop modulation filters are designed to separate HS and LS signals from <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> recordings, respectively. Visual and auditory inspection, quantitative analysis, as well as algorithm execution time are used to assess algorithm performance.

2500|$|Patients with {{symptoms}} of CAP require evaluation. Diagnosis of pneumonia is made clinically, {{rather than on}} the basis of a particular test. Evaluation begins with a physical examination by a health provider, which may reveal fever, an increased respiratory rate (tachypnea), low blood pressure (hypotension), a fast heart rate (tachycardia) and changes in the amount of oxygen in the blood. Palpating the chest as it expands and tapping the chest wall (percussion) to identify dull, non-resonant areas can identify stiffness and fluid, signs of CAP. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope (auscultation) can also reveal signs associated with CAP. A lack of normal <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> or the presence of crackles can indicate fluid consolidation. Increased vibration of the chest when speaking, known as tactile fremitus, and increased volume of whispered speech during auscultation can also indicate fluid.|$|E
