25|$|<b>Barbell</b> {{earrings}} {{get their}} name from their resemblance to a <b>barbell,</b> generally {{coming in the}} form of a metal bar with an orb on either end. One of these orbs is affixed in place, while the other can be detached to allow the <b>barbell</b> to be inserted into a piercing. Several variations on this basic design exist, including barbells with curves or angles in the bar of the earring.|$|E

5000|$|Two general {{categories}} exist: [...] "standard" [...] plates, {{which have a}} center hole of approximately one inch (25 mm), and [...] "Olympic" [...] plates, meant to fit on the two-inch (50 mm) sleeves of Olympic <b>barbells.</b> [...] Standard plates are usually paired with adjustable dumbbells and Olympic plates with full-size <b>barbells,</b> although standard <b>barbells</b> and Olympic dumbbells exist.|$|R

50|$|The unusual {{trait of}} this Synodontis is the long {{extension}} of the dorsal fin which can reach {{as far back as}} its caudal fin and along with its attractive body colouration makes {{it one of the most}} popular catfish of the genus, Synodontis. The head and body are compressed.

Its ventral region is white. Dorsal, caudal, anal and ventral fins are white with black transverse bands.|$|R
25|$|The second theory uses grip {{placement}} and angle {{as the primary}} factor in targeting each head. For instance, to target the long head when using dumbbells or cables, the grip should be semi-supinated (hammer) grip where the palms face each other. If using a <b>barbell</b> (EZ grip or straight), the grip should be inside of shoulder width. To target the short head when using dumbbells or cables, grip should be supinated, where the palms are facing up completely. If using a <b>barbell</b> (EZ grip or straight), grip should be outside of shoulder width.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>barbells,</b> vaginal weights or cones {{designed}} {{to be held in}} the vagina. The action of passively/actively retaining the device internally is supposed to improve muscle tone. <b>Barbells</b> are made of smooth, polished solid stainless steel, cylindrical in shape, with a rounded bulge at each end. They typically weigh one pound (454 g) and measure approximately 6+3/4 in in length with a diameter of one inch (2.5 cm) at the widest part.

25|$|These {{two broad}} {{categories}} may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind's eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as {{being on the}} left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right side up and then neglect {{the left side of}} the adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a <b>barbell,</b> patients will more significantly neglect {{the left side of the}} <b>barbell,</b> as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the <b>barbell</b> is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients will more significantly neglect the left side of the object, even though it is now on the right side of space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of the World may neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map.|$|E
25|$|As {{the success}} of the <b>barbell</b> {{strategy}} became evident to the general market place, other chains such as McDonald's and Carl's Jr./Hardee's began to experiment with the concept.
