5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an interest in her, her mother went about educating her as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria {{spent the}} autumn and winter of 1643 in Oxford with Charles, where she attempted, as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> to {{maintain}} the pleasant court life that they had enjoyed before the war. The Queen lived in the Warden's lodgings in Merton College, adorned with the royal furniture which had been brought up from London. The Queen's usual companions were present: Denbigh, Davenant, her dwarves; her rooms were overrun by dogs, including Mitte. The atmosphere in Oxford {{was a combination of}} a fortified city and a royal court, and Henrietta Maria was frequently stressed with worry.|$|E
25|$|The British hired armed cutter Sandwich {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant George Lempriere and {{cruising}} off the coast of Barcelona on 14 June 1799 when she sighted a large fleet. Lempriere believed the vessels to be a British fleet and sailed towards them. When the strange vessels did not reply to the recognition signals, Lempriere realized that they were enemy vessels and attempted to sail away. The French fleet detached a lugger, possibly Affronteur, to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the lugger in pursuit and towards evening the lugger opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate then too opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> By 1a.m. the frigate was within musket shot of Sandwich and any further resistance would have been futile. Lempriere then struck to Créole.|$|E

25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children to be like the idealised figure of her own father and tried, as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jonathan Dakss Stone explained the album cover's concept, stating [...] "I wanted the flag to truly represent people of all colors. I wanted the color black {{because it is the}} absence of color. I wanted the color white because it is the combination of all colors. And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|E

500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, Ariadne had been rotated {{out of the front}} patrol line and laid at anchor in the {{entrance}} of the Weser River in support of the cruisers and torpedo boats on patrol. After receiving reports of the British attack on {{the morning of}} the 28th, Ariadne and several other cruisers got up steam and rushed to support the German patrols. She met [...] at around 13:40, but less than twenty minutes thereafter, Beatty's battlecruisers, chasing , arrived and began firing on Ariadne as well. She turned to starboard and attempted to flee. She was hit several times by the British guns, and one hit the forward boiler room. The coal bunker caught fire and five boilers were disabled; her speed fell to [...] Two battlecruisers closed in, until they were firing their [...] guns at a distance of , point-blank range for guns of that caliber. Ariadne returned fire as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> but to no effect.|$|E
500|$|Rudolf Kempe, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} associate conductor in 1960, became principal conductor in 1961 and music director in 1962. Beecham's widow ran {{the affairs of the}} orchestra as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> but some senior players including Brymer and MacDonagh were unhappy with the management, and they left. The orchestra reorganised itself in 1963 as a self-governing limited company, but almost immediately encountered difficulties. The Royal Philharmonic Society decided not to engage the RPO for its concerts; Glyndebourne booked the LPO instead of the RPO from 1964 onwards. The RPO was also excluded from the London Orchestral Concert Board's schedule of concerts, which meant that it was denied the use of London's main concert venue, the Royal Festival Hall. [...] Kempe resigned, although he returned shortly afterwards. Helped by strong support from [...] Sir Malcolm Sargent, the orchestra successfully mounted its own concerts at a cinema in Swiss Cottage, [...] to the north-west of the Festival Hall. A 1965 report to the Arts Council by a committee chaired by Alan Peacock recommended that all four independent London orchestras should receive adequate public subsidy.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{widely read}} popular biographies appeared. Stirling Seagrave's [...] Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China portrays Cixi {{as a woman}} stuck between the xenophobic faction of Manchu nobility and more {{moderate}} influences.

2500|$|Travelling to the cape, a man fell {{overboard}} in high seas. Tryon had to {{make the}} difficult decision whether to try to rescue him, because any small boat risked sinking, taking her crew down also. However, the man was seen to be swimming strongly, so the ship was halted and a boat launched to rescue him. The boat got away well, though was sucked back under the stern of the ship before breaking free. The ship then had to manoeuvre under sail, tacking as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to follow the boat while keeping it on the safe side for recovery. [...] All went well, and Tryon received congratulations from the other captains for his skill in carrying out the rescue.|$|E
2500|$|... "Being {{an actress}} {{who uses the}} Stanislavsky method, I always try to find details about my character. With Pamela... I began with a class ring that I {{remember}} reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex—which is very bad of course—and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having... babies out of wedlock isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> but {{he turned out to}} be a very strange boy. [...] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that she got into trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Elizabeth was the {{particular}} favorite of her father. She resembled him {{both physically and}} temperamentally. She was a bright girl, if not brilliant, but received only a desultory formal education. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education. He had a son (and grandson) {{from his first marriage}} to a noblewoman, and did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid and second wife might one day inherit the throne. Indeed, no woman had ever sat upon the throne of Russia yet. It was therefore left to Catherine to raise the girls as <b>best</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> but she was herself too uneducated to be able to superintend the formal education of her daughters. Elizabeth had a French governess and grew fluent in Italian, German and French. She was also an excellent dancer and rider. Like her father, Elizabeth was physically active and loved riding, hunting, sledging, skating, and gardening. From her earliest years, she delighted everyone with her extraordinary beauty and vivacity, and was regarded as the leading beauty of the Russian Empire. The wife of the British minister (ambassador) described Elizabeth as [...] "fair, with light brown hair, large sprightly blue eyes, fine teeth and a pretty mouth. She is inclinable to be fat, but is very genteel and dances better than anyone I ever saw. She speaks German, French and Italian, is extremely gay and talks to everyone..." ...|$|E
