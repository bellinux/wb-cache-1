5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist. He argued that if something can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist, then something greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived.</b> Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E

5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E

5|$|The first {{title to}} <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> was Advent Children, {{original}} envisioned as a short film presentation created by Visual Works, the animation studio behind CGI cutscenes for the company's games. Early in pre-production, {{plans to make}} Advent Children a video game rather than a film were considered, but due to several factors including Visual Works' lack of experience with actual game production, it remained a film. One of the main conditions for the project's launch was to reunite the original staff members of Final Fantasy VII: Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, composer Nobuo Uematsu. After Advent Children began development, it was decided by the team that one title {{was not enough to}} fully explore the VII universe. In response, Before Crisis, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core were conceived so as to embrace more aspects of the world and characters. Nomura himself was surprised at the creation of the games, having originally assumed that the film would be the sole product of the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E

25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of {{it as a kind of}} thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).|$|E
25|$|On the inscribed healing amulets of the Near Eastern and European magico-medical tradition, {{illness or}} affliction is often personified and {{addressed}} directly; the practitioner may be instructed to inscribe or chant {{a phrase that}} orders the ailment to depart: for example, “Flee, Fever!” The ailment may also <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> of as caused by a demon, who must be identified correctly by name and commanded to depart. In this mode, magico-healing practice bears comparison to exorcism.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1516, Luther's {{belief that}} Mary is a mediatrix between God and {{humanity}} {{was driven by}} his fear of Jesus being the implacable judge of all people.

All other human beings are without grace, both in the first and second conception. But the Virgin Mary, though without grace in the first conception, was full of grace in the second ... whereas other human beings <b>are</b> <b>conceived</b> in sin, in soul as well as in body, and Christ <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> without sin in soul as well as in body, the Virgin Mary <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> in body without grace but in soul full of grace." ...|$|R

25|$|Philo's {{notion is}} even more {{abstract}} {{than that of the}} Monad of Pythagoras or the Good of Plato. Only God’s existence is certain, no appropriate predicates can <b>be</b> <b>conceived.</b> Following Plato, Philo equates matter to nothingness and sees its effect in fallacy, discord, damage, and decay of things. This view enables Philo to combine the Jewish belief in creation with the Greek conviction about the formation of all things from the permanent matter.|$|E
25|$|The archetypes form {{a dynamic}} {{substratum}} {{common to all}} humanity, upon the foundation of which each individual builds his own experience of life, colouring them with his unique culture, personality and life events. Thus, while archetypes themselves may <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> as a relative few innate nebulous forms, from these may arise innumerable images, symbols and patterns of behavior. While the emerging images and forms are apprehended consciously, the archetypes which inform them are elementary structures which are unconscious and impossible to apprehend.|$|E

The result will always be the same as if the game had been played out entirely.|$|E
