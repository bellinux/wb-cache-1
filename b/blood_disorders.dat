5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damages the nervous system, and causes <b>blood</b> <b>disorders.</b> It is particularly problematic in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} {{a major impact}} on human survival, coinciding with the start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the erythrocytes, because such <b>blood</b> <b>disorders</b> confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection). The three major types of inherited genetic resistance (sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) were present in the Mediterranean world {{by the time of the}} Roman Empire, about 2000 years ago.|$|E

25|$|Thalassemias are {{inherited}} <b>blood</b> <b>disorders</b> {{characterized by}} abnormal hemoglobin production. Symptoms {{depend on the}} type and can vary from none to severe.

25|$|These {{inherited}} {{changes to}} hemoglobin or other characteristic erythrocyte proteins which are critical and rather invariant features of mammalian biochemistry, usually result {{in some kind}} of anemia, a disease or defect of red blood cells. These changes are referred to by the names of the diseases resulting from them including sickle cell disease, thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and others. These <b>blood</b> <b>disorders</b> cause increased morbidity and mortality in areas of the world where malaria is no longer prevalent.|$|E
25|$|GD type III (chronic neuropathic) {{can begin}} {{at any time}} in {{childhood}} or even in adulthood, and occurs in about one in 100,000 live births. It is characterized by slowly progressive, but milder neurologic symptoms compared to the acute or type II version. Major symptoms include an enlarged spleen and/or liver, seizures, poor coordination, skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, <b>blood</b> <b>disorders</b> including anemia, and respiratory problems. Patients often live into their early teen years and adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Beta thalassemias (β thalassemias) are a {{group of}} {{inherited}} <b>blood</b> <b>disorders.</b> They are forms of thalassemia caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. Global annual incidence is estimated at one in 100,000. Beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends {{on the nature of}} the mutation.|$|E

25|$|These {{alterations}} which {{protect against}} malarial infections but impair {{red blood cells}} are generally considered <b>blood</b> <b>disorders,</b> since {{they tend to have}} overt and detrimental effects. Their protective function has only in recent times, been discovered and acknowledged. Some of these disorders are known by fanciful and cryptic names like sickle-cell anemia, thalassaemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen and the Duffy antigen. These names refer to various proteins, enzymes, and the shape or function of red blood cells.|$|E

25|$|Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a {{group of}} <b>blood</b> <b>disorders</b> {{typically}} inherited from a person's parents. The most common type is known as sickle-cell anaemia (SCA). It results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin (hemoglobin S) found in red blood cells. This leads to a rigid, sickle-like shape under certain circumstances. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain ("sickle-cell crisis"), anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, and stroke. Long term pain may develop as people get older. The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years.|$|E
25|$|Vincent Lecavalier {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{as the result}} of an open-ice hit from Matt Cooke of the Washington Capitals in the game before the season finale in Atlanta. Lecavalier, who planned on having arthroscopic wrist surgery after the season's ending, would undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder as well. Cooke was fined $2,500 by the NHL for the hit, as Lecavalier did not have possession of the puck at the time. Perhaps the lone bright spot in the season was Lecavalier's winning both the King Clancy Memorial Trophy and the NHL Foundation Player Award for work through his foundation, including a $3million pledge to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, for what would become the Vincent Lecavalier Pediatric Cancer and <b>Blood</b> <b>Disorders</b> Center at All Children's Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Well-planned vegan diets {{can reduce}} the risk of some types of chronic disease, {{including}} heart disease. They are regarded as appropriate for all stages of the life including during infancy and pregnancy by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the British Dietetic Association. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend vegan diets for children, adolescents, or during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals; and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12. Unbalanced vegan diets may lead to nutritional deficiencies that nullify any beneficial effects and may cause serious health issues. These deficiencies can only be prevented through the choice of fortified foods or the regular intake of dietary supplements. Vitamin B12 supplementation is especially important because its deficiency causes <b>blood</b> <b>disorders</b> and potentially irreversible neurological damage.|$|E
