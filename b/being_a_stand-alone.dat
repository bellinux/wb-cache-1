Marino, Ron Fish, Mike Reagan, and Cris Velasco, {{was released on}} CD by Sony Computer Entertainment on April 10, 2007. Dave Valentine of Square Enix Music Online gave the soundtrack an 8 out of 10, and said that it features {{a wide variety of}} ominous orchestral pieces, and each composer's contributions seem slightly more distinctive than the previous installment. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the score [...] "is an impressive orchestral accomplishment within the ever-growing and constantly changing arena of videogame composition," [...] but that it was aimed more towards the gaming experience of God of War II, rather than <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand-alone</b> musical experience. At the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards, the score was nominated for [...] "Best Original Score". In March 2010, the soundtrack was released as downloadable content as part of the God of War Trilogy Soundtrack in the God of War III Ultimate Edition.|$|E

40|$|A simple bench-top {{apparatus}} {{has been}} developed to experimentally determine the forces in {{the members of a}} simple truss system.

There is a need for a low-cost truss experiment which allows first or second year engineering students to compare theory with experiment. While the truss is a simple structure, obtaining convincing agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements requires careful design of the laboratory device. With the apparatus developed, it is possible to obtain experimental measurements of forces in a truss member which agree within a few percent to predictions from elementary mechanics. The apparatus is easy to operate, and is suitable as either a classroom demonstration or a laboratory experiment. The total cost of materials to fabricate the apparatus is less than $ 100. The apparatus is appropriate for inclusion in freshman physics laboratories, engineering statics, mechanics of materials, or an experimental methods course...|$|R
40|$|Among the privacy-preserving {{approaches}} {{that are known}} in the literature, h-anonymity remains the basis of more advanced models while still <b>being</b> useful as <b>a</b> <b>stand-alone</b> solution. Applying h-anonymity in practice, though, incurs severe loss of data utility, thus limiting its effectiveness and reliability in real-life applications and systems. However, such loss in utility does not necessarily arise from an inherent drawback of the model itself, but rather from the deficiencies of the algorithms used to implement the model. Conventional approaches rely on a methodology that publishes data in homogeneous generalized groups. An alternative modern data publishing scheme focuses on publishing the data in heterogeneous groups and achieves higher utility, while ensuring the same privacy guarantees. As conventional approaches cannot anonymize data following this heterogeneous scheme, innovative solutions are required for this purpose. Following this approach, {{in this paper we}} provide a set of algorithms that ensure high-utility h-anonymity, via solving an equivalent graph processing problem...|$|R
