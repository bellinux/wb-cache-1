The NRB has an attached reservoir bag, typically 1 liter, that connects to an external <b>oxygen</b> tank or <b>Bulk</b> <b>Oxygen</b> Supply <b>system.</b> Before an NRB is placed on the patient, the reservoir bag is inflated to greater than two-thirds full of oxygen, at a rate of 15 liters per minute (lpm). Approximately ¹⁄₃ of the air from the reservoir is depleted as the patient inhales, and it is then replaced by the flow from the O2 supply.

40|$|A Pt {{microelectrode}} {{was used}} to measure the oxygen consumption by redox reduction (ORR) on electrochemically polarised zinc in the redox competition mode. Zinc was polarised in the active and passive state, using a pH 7 and pH 13 solution, respectively. At pH 7, the oxygen concentration measured at a distance of 50 μm from the zinc surface, using the Pt microelectrode, is 15 – 60 % of the <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. Therefore, correspondingly, the oxygen consumption by zinc (due to ORR) is 40 – 85 % of the <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. At pH 13, where zinc undergoes passivation, the oxygen consumption by zinc is 70 – 80 % of the <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentration. The ORR rate on the surface of zinc passive films (ZnO/Zn(OH) 2) is thus significant when compared to that on bare/actively corroding zinc. The influence of the electrode kinetics of zinc corrosion, on oxygen diffusion towards the metal surface has been investigated in this study. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|A zone {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to simulate the}} oscillatory behavior occasionally observed in compartment fires. This oscillatory behavior {{is the result of}} an unstable coupling between the liquid fuel evaporation rate, the combustion process, the compartment pressure and the ventilation of the compartment. The governing equations use a classical zone modeling approach combined with a (N-τ) model description of the variations of the fuel evaporation rate. The equations are solved with an in-house Matlab solver. The model is evaluated by comparisons with experimental data previously obtained at Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN) in France. Three different variations of the (N-τ) model are evaluated, corresponding to a coupling between liquid fuel evaporation and <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen,</b> <b>bulk</b> temperature or admission flow rate.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in the literature that contamination within <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> can create significant fire hazards. Cleanliness limits for nonvolatile residues, ranging from 10 to 500 mg/sq m, have been established for various industries and types of <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> {{to reduce the risk of}} ignition of flammable organic films. Particulate cleanliness limits used for <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> vary considerably. Maximum allowed particle size, quantity limits, and allocations for fibers or metallic particles are all variables seen in aerospace cleanliness limits.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lightweight {{portable}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> {{are commonly}} preferred by patients over compressed-oxygen systems that use E-size cylinders. However, cost is often {{perceived as a}} barrier to the prescription of lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems.</b> OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall health-care costs of patients with COPD who used lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>systems</b> to those who used E-cylinder systems. METHODS: All the patients who used either a lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>system,</b> an E-cylinder system, or an E-cylinder system, then a lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>system,</b> for at least 12 months during the study period (January 1, 1999, to December 30, 2004) were identified from the administrative database of our regional managed-care system. All direct medical utilization and costs were captured for at least the first 12 months that supplemental oxygen was dispensed. Other clinical factors that affect costs (including age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities) were examined and adjusted for. RESULTS: Of the 2, 725 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 203 used only a lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>system,</b> 2, 268 used only an E-cylinder system, and 254 switched from an E-cylinder system to a lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>system.</b> Among the patients who used only the lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>system,</b> the median total medical costs in the first year were nonsignificantly lower than those who used an E-cylinder system ($ 6, 515 /y vs $ 9, 503 /y). The cost difference remained nonsignificant after adjustment for clinical factors. Among the pa-tients who switched from one system to the other in the first year, mean monthly health-care costs while using the lightweight portable <b>oxygen</b> <b>system</b> ($ 1, 428) were not significantly different than when using the E-cylinder system ($ 1, 396).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the consequences of}} operating a semiconducting oxide gas sensor with appreciable oxygen ion mobility within a temperature range where equilibration of the <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen</b> content and surface reactions with reducing gases can proceed simultaneously. The investigations focus on the behaviour of {{an example of a}} perovskite material (LaFe 0. 95 W 0. 05 O 3) stemming from standard perovskites, but having all alkaline ions substituted by rare earth, on its resistance and stability against sulfur-containing gases (H 2 S) and on its sensitivity towards some important reducing gases (carbon monoxide, ethanol, methane, propane). The experimental results provide responses to these latter four gases which are distorted by the superimposition of responses involving <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen</b> equilibration upon the surface reactions with reducing gases.

40|$|AIR+ESO:LLI:MTS:ABO:PVEThis study {{reports a}} {{mechanistic}} {{study of the}} soot oxidation on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), a nonreducible oxide with intrinsic <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen</b> mobility. Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and isotope exchange experiments demonstrate the key role of <b>bulk</b> <b>oxygen</b> species in the oxidation process. When "intimate" soot/YSZ contact is achieved after in situ carbon deposition via propylene cracking, lattice oxygen ions are the predominant species involved in the oxidation reaction. Based on isotopic TPO experiments performed with different oxygen partial pressures in "tight" contact mode and oxygen exchange measurements, it is proposed that the ignition of the soot oxidation on YSZ {{can be described as}} a fuel-cell-type electrochemical mechanism at the nanometric scale. The efficiency of this electrochemical process seems to depend both on the YSZ/soot contact and on the oxygen partial pressure. In addition, YSZ porous membranes were fabricated in order to simulate porous walls of YSZ-based DPFs. These membranes are effective for soot filtering and soot oxidation with oxygen starts at temperatures over 430 C, in real soot/catalyst contact. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
