Aqueous biphase extraction is an advanced separation technology that relies on the ability of an aqueous system consisting of a water-soluble polymer and another component, e. g., another polymer, an inorganic salt, or a nonionic surfactant, to separate into two immiscible aqueous phases. The principle behind the partition of solid particles in aqueous <b>biphase</b> <b>systems</b> is the physicochemical interaction between the solid surface and the surrounding liquid solution.

The partitioning behaviors of hematite in the dextran (Dex) /Triton X- 100 (TX 100) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) /dextran systems were investigated {{and the effects of}} some ionic surfactants on solid partition were studied. In both <b>biphase</b> <b>systems,</b> the particles stayed in the bottom dextran-rich phase under all pH conditions. This behavior is attributable {{to the fact that the}} hydrophilic oxide particles prefer the more hydrophilic bottom phase. Also, the strong favorable interaction between dextran and ferric oxide facilitates the dispersion of the solids in the polysaccharide-rich phase. In the Dex/TX 100 system, addition of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) or potassium oleate had no effect on the solid partition; on the other hand, addition of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) transferred the particles to the top phase or interface at high pH values. In the PEG/Dex system, the preferred location of hematite remained the bottom phase in the presence of either SDS or DTAB. The effects of anionic surfactants on the partition behavior are attributable to the fact that they are not able to replace the strongly adsorbed polysaccharide layer on the ferric oxide surface. The results with the cationic surfactant are due to electrostatic interaction between the cationic surfactant and the charged surface of the solid particles. The difference in solids partitioning in the two systems is the result of the different distribution of DTAB in these systems.

Simultaneous production and extraction, is an integrated process of milking that involves cultivation of C. vulgaris {{under the influence of}} dodecane and tetradecane within the aqueous-organic <b>biphase</b> <b>system</b> and the extraction of intracellular lipids. Different concentrations (10 % v/v, 15 % v/v, and 20 % v/v) of dodecane and tetradecane were used for the extraction of lipid. The highest lipid amount (1175 ± 34 mg/L) within the solvent phase was achieved with maximum lipid recovery ratio of 47 ± 5 % during first cycle when 20 % concentration of dodecane was used as the solvent. In addition maximum cell dehydrogenase activity (4. 5 ± 0. 5 OD 492 g− 1 cell) and growth rate (1. 8 d− 1) were also observed under 20 % dodecane. The presence of higher concentration of tetradecane lowers the dehydrogenase activity thus resulting in lower lipid extraction under milking. Solvent recovery ratio was 12 % higher under 20 % dodecane as compared to 10 % of tetradecane. Growth profile study of C. vulgaris showed an overall increase in the lipid content when the cultures were extended up to four cycles.

The partitioning behaviors of silica in the polyethylene glycol (PEG) /dextran (Dex) and dextran/Triton X- 100 (TX 100) systems have been investigated, {{and the effects of}} sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) on solid partition have been studied. In both <b>biphase</b> <b>systems,</b> silica particles stayed in the top PEG-rich phase at low pH. With increase in pH, the particles moved from the top phase to the interface, then to the bottom phase. At very high pH, the solids preferred the top phase again. These trends are attributable to variations in the polymer/solid and nonionic surfactant/solid interactions. Addition of ionic surfactants into these two systems introduces a weakly charged environment, since ionic surfactants concentrate into one phase, either the top phase or the bottom phase. Therefore, coulombic forces also {{play a key role in}} the partition of silica particles because electrostatic attractive or repulsive forces are produced between the solid surface and the ionic-surfactant-concentrated phase. For the PEG/dextran system in the presence of SDS, SiO{sub 2 } preferred the bottom dextran-rich phase above its pH{sub PZC}. However, addition of DTAB moved the oxide particles from the top phase to the interface, and then to the bottom phase, with increase in pH. These different behaviors are attributable to the fact that SDS and DTAB concentrated into the opposite phase of the PEG/dextran system. On the other hand, in the dextran/Triton X- 100 system, both ionic surfactants concentrated in the top surfactant-rich phase and formed mixed micelles with TX 100. Therefore, addition of the anionic surfactant, SDS, moved the silica particles from top phase to the interface or bottom phase. On the other hand, DTAB, a cationic surfactant, attracted the particles to the top phase in the pH range form 4 to 11, where in the DTAB-free system the solids either stayed at the interface or in the bottom phase...|$|R

Extraction and separation of the lanthanides and actinides is becoming increasingly important as the need for these elements rises. As the chemistry of the lanthanides {{is similar to that of}} the actinides, the use of the lanthanides as stand-ins for potential actinide extraction experiments becomes possible. The lanthanides all share a 3 + charge, and exhibit a smooth decrease in ionic radii as Z increases across the series. Because of these factors, separation based solely on charge considerations is impossible. Control of the primary coordination sphere of these elements is important in order to facilitate their separation. The lanthanides are hard Lewis acids, and as such exhibit a high affinity for hard Lewis bases, such as oxygen. This results in the formation of aquo species in aqueous solutions. In order to displace the coordinated water molecules, complexation of the lanthanides by crown ethers was investigated. In the reactions of hydrated lanthanide chlorides and nitrates with 12 -crown- 4, 15 -crown- 5, and 18 -crown- 6, several complexes have been isolated and structurally characterized: (M(OH 2) 5 (12 -crown- 4)) C 13 · 2 H 2 O (M = Ce, Nd, Sm-Er), (MCl 2 (OH 2) 2 (12 -crown- 4)) Cl (M = Ho-Lu), (YCl 2 (OH 2) (OHMe) (12 -crown- 4)) Cl, (LaCl 2 (NO 3) (12 -crown- 4) 2, (La(NO 3) (OH 2) 4 (12 -crown- 4)) Cl 2 ·CH 3 CN, (MCl 3 (15 -crown- 5)) (M = La, Ce), (Er(OH 2) 8) Cl 3 · 15 -crown- 5, (CeCl 2 (OH 2) (18 -crown- 6)) Cl· 2 H 2 O, (MCl(OH 2) 2 (18 -crown- 6)) Cl 2 · 2 H 2 O (M = Pr, Nd, Eu), (LCl 2 (NO 3) (18 -crown- 6)), (Pr(NO 3) 3 (18 -crown- 6)), and (M(NO 3) 3 (OH 2) 3) 18 -crown- 6 (M = Tb, Dy, Y, Ho, Er, Tm, Lu). In most cases, complexes where the crown ether is directly coordinated are observed, although hydrogen bonded complexes in which the crown ether is hydrogen bonded to water molecules which are directly coordinated to the metal center are not uncommon.

40|$|In this Quarter, the {{research}} was focused continually on the two general tasks: Task 1, molecular organometallic catalysts for hydrogenation and Task 2, organic base catalysts for arene hydrogenation and the hydrotreating of the coal liquids. With regards to Task 1, the <b>biphase</b> catalyst <b>system,</b> [1, 5 -HDRhCI]{sub 2 }/buffer, was investigated in detail for the hydrogenation of naphthalene or tetralin to decalin under low pressure of H{sub 2 } at room temperature. The influence of {{various factors such as}} the amount of the phase transfer regent, the volume ratio of the organic phase to the aqueous phase, the pH value and compositions of the buffer solution as well as the solvents on the reaction process was investigated systematically. It was found that the rhodium catalyst works well under biphase conditions rather than under phase transfer conditions. Apparently, the surfactant molecules negatively affect the catalytic activity of the rhodium catalyst. The pH values and the compositions of the buffers in the aqueous phase are critical in the system. The best buffer solution is composed of hydrion with its pH of 7. 4 [...] 7. 6. In addition to tetralin, the Rh catalyst is also effective for the hydrogenation of other unactivated aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, n-butylbenzene etc. In addition, the turnover numbers of the catalyst can reach 200, but its performance needs to be improved further for practical applications. The work on this issue is currently underway. Task 2 was focused on the hydrotreating of coal liquid (VSOH) catalyzed by Catalyst 2 and Catalyst 5. Good results were achieved on this issue. Catalyst 5 was found to be a more effective catalyst for the hydrotreating of coal liquid than Catalyst 2. The coal liquid was hydrotreated to give a clear yellow liquid under relative mild conditions (1000 psi of hydrogen and 200 C) if only 16 mol% of the Catalyst 5 was employed...|$|R
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Física de la Materia Condensada. Fecha de lectura: 08 - 04 - 2015 This work is {{has been}} devoted to the study of single and biphase magnetic microwires, from fabrication to their magnetic characterization at low but particularly at microwave frequencies. As single phase microwires we consider glass-coated amorphous microwires with very soft magnetic behavior (both, positive magnetostriction Fe-based and vanishing magnetostriction CoFe-based samples). In biphase microwires, we grow an external layer of polycrystalline character with either soft (FeNi) or medium-hard (CoNi) magnetic character so that, we consider soft/soft and soft/hard magnetic <b>biphase</b> <b>systems.</b> Microwires have been fabricated by combined glass-coating rapid-solidification technique (the amorphous core) and sputtering/electrodeposition technique (the external shell). After their fabrication, the microwires were characterized from a geometry, composition and structure points of view. Quite a number of different samples were produced as a function of core and external shell magnetic phases as well as for different thickness of intermediate insulating Pyrex thickness and external layer. In addition, selected samples were selected for studies on the influence of thermal annealing at temperatures up to reaching first steps of crystallization at 600 ºC. A first magnetic characterization was performed at low-frequency magnetic fields in a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer, VSM, to determine the magnetization processes and main magnetic magnitudes as coercivity and remanence of each magnetic phase. This has been performed for all the series of samples mentioned above. Studies have been extended to different measuring temperature particularly in the range up to 900 ºC; where after partial crystallization significant deterioration of properties is confirmed. The study about the coercive field of individual and bimagnetic phase systems is analyzed in view of the relevance for technological applications of bimagnetic microwires. Also, the magnetic phase transitions (ferro to paramagnetic) of some individual phases are first identified. The main part of the study {{has been devoted}} to the magnetic properties at high frequency, in the microwave regime. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra have been determined for single and biphase samples with different geometry and compositional characteristics as indicated above. FMR experiments in wires can be basically divided into two categories. The former is done by means of network analyzer up to around 15 GHz and as a function of applied magnetic field. The latter has been performed in a coaxial or microstrip microwave circuit making use of classical FMR spectrometers and waveguide microwave techniques. A first study was focused on the influence of glass Pyrex on single and biphase microwires. For single-phase microwires, the increase of the Pyrex thickness results in a continuous strengthening of the circular magnetoelastic anisotropy of the CoFe-based core as deduced from FMR and confirmed by low-frequency measurements. For biphase microwires three absorption peaks are observed: two of them can be ascribed to each magnetic phase since FMR frequencies obey the Kittel condition for a thin film. A third absorption peak is observed at lower frequencies that does not follow such an equation and can be ascribed to a pure geometrical effect of these biphase microwires. Then, the effect of annealing treatment at temperatures up to 700 ºC on high frequency behavior was investigated. FMR behavior was analyzed by fitting to Kittel equation for annealed samples. The observed different absorption peaks are correlated with the presence of the soft core and the peaks presented at low frequency do not obey such Kittel condition. In this regards, it has been confirmed that the peaks observed at lower frequency corresponded to a capacitance effect. Additional studies have been presented investigating the microwave absorption phenomena of single and biphase magnetic microwires with soft magnetic behavior using two alternative techniques: (i) absorption measurements in the temperature range of - 271 _ 25 ºC using a spectrometer operating at X-band frequency, at 9. 5 GHz, and (ii) room temperature, RT, ferromagnetic resonance measurements in a network analyzer up to 15 GHz. For single phase CoFeSiB microwire, a single absorption is observed, whose DC field dependence of resonance frequency at RT fits to a Kittel law behavior for in-plane magnetized thin film. The temperature dependence behavior shows a monotonic increase in the resonance field, Hr, with temperature. For biphase,CoFeSiB/FeNi, microwires, the absorption phenomena at RT also follow the Kittel condition. The observed opposite evolution with temperature of resonance field, Hr, in two different thick FeNi samples is interpreted considering the opposite sign of magnetostriction of the respective FeNi layers...|$|R
