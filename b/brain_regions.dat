5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} to be used in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator.

30|$|Model fitting is {{performed}} in the lavaan package in R [23]. For identifiability, we fix the loading of the first <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> measurement per region group (latent variable) to 1. This does not only fix the scales of the latent variables, {{but it also has}} the advantage that the resulting latent variables will have the same direction of effect as the first <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> measurement. For example, a reduction in volume of the first <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> will result in a reduction in the corresponding latent variable. All the error variances on the <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> measurements (variance of ζ) are assumed to be equal within each region group, which is the same as in principal component analysis.|$|R

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E
50|$|Many {{authors have}} {{indicated}} an integral link between a person's will to live, personality, and {{the functions of}} the prefrontal cortex. This <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior. The basic activity of this <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.|$|R
40|$|Noninvasive near {{infrared}} spectroscopy measurements {{were performed to}} monitor cyanide (CN) poisoning and recovery in the <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> and in foreleg muscle simultaneously, {{and the effects of}} a novel CN antidote, sulfanegen sodium, on tissue hemoglobin oxygenation changes were compared using a sub-lethal rabbit model. The results demonstrated that the <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> is more susceptible to CN poisoning and slower in end ogenous CN detoxification following exposure than peripheral muscles. However, sulfanegen sodium rapidly reversed CN toxicity, with <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> effects reversing more quickly than muscle. In vivo monitoring of multiple organs may provide important clinical information regarding the extent of CN toxicity and subsequent recovery, and facilitate antidote drug development. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R

5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other <b>brain</b> <b>regions).</b> Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{this theory}} was updated, {{suggesting}} that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP {{by one of the}} same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> most affected by Alzheimer's, so {{it is possible that the}} N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.|$|E

Two <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> {{are said to be}} functionally connected if {{there is a}} high correlation between the times that the two are firing, though this does not imply causality.

25|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian {{method for}} deducing the {{structure}} of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between <b>brain</b> <b>regions,</b> which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.|$|E
