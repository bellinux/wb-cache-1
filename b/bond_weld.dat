40|$|A {{mechanical}} fitting and relatively simple and safe method of installing {{it on the}} metal case of a battery have been devised {{to provide access to}} the interior of the battery to perform inspection and/or to measure such internal conditions as temperature and pressure. A metal boss or stud having an exterior thread is attached to the case by capacitor-discharge stud welding (CDSW), which takes only 3 to 6 milliseconds and in which the metallurgical <b>bond</b> (<b>weld)</b> and the heat-affected zone are limited to a depth of a few thousandths of an inch (a few hundredths of a millimeter). These characteristics of CDSW prevent distortion of the case and localized internal heating that could damage the chemical components inside of the battery. An access hole is then drilled through the stud and case, into the interior of the battery. A {{mechanical fitting}} having a matching thread is installed on the stud and the interior end of the fitting is sealed with a pressure-sealing washer/gasket. The exterior end of the fitting is configured for attachment of whatever instrumentation is required for the selected inspection or measurement...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{failure of}} an ideal crystal is {{dictated}} either by an elastic instability or a soft-mode instability. Previous interpretations of nanoindentation experiments on suspended graphene sheets, however, indicate an anomaly: the inferred strain in the graphene sheet directly beneath the diamond indenter at the measured failure load is anomalously large compared to the fracture strains predicted by both soft-mode and acoustic analyses. Through multiscale modeling combining the results of continuum, atomistic, and quantum calculations, and analysis of experiments, we identify a strain-shielding effect initiated by mechanochemical interactions at the graphene–indenter interface as the operative mechanism responsible for this anomaly. Transmission electron micrographs and a molecular model of the diamond indenter’s tip suggest that the tip surface contains facets comprising crystallographic { 111 } and { 100 } planes. Ab initio and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirm that a covalent <b>bond</b> (<b>weld)</b> formation between graphene and the crystallographic { 111 } and { 100 } facets on the indenter’s surface can be induced by compressive contact stresses of the order achieved in nanoindentation tests. Finite element analysis (FEA) and MD simulations of nanoindentation reveal that the shear stiction provided by the induced covalent bonding restricts relative slip of the graphene sheet at its contact with the indenter, thus initiating a local strain-shielding effect. As a result, subsequent to stress-induced bonding at the graphene–indenter interface, the spatial variation of continuing incremental strain is substantially redistributed, locally shielding the region directly beneath the indenter by limiting the buildup of strain while imparting deformation to the surrounding regions. The extent of strain shielding is governed by {{the strength of the}} shear stiction, which depends upon the level of hydrogen saturation at the indenter’s surface. We show that at intermediate levels of hydrogen saturation the strain-shielding effect can enable the graphene to support experimentally determined fracture loads and displacements without prematurely reaching locally limiting states of stress and deformation...|$|E

Currently, spot welding adhesives process or {{also known as}} <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> process was the effective solution for improving mechanical properties of metal joining. However, it also created issues in occupational safety and health. Previous study confirmed notably higher airborne contaminants were detected prior to usage of welding adhesive. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the personal welding fumes exposure and pulmonary function of welders involved in the <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> process. <b>Welding</b> fumes analysis revealed out of 15 investigated elements, none were exceeding the threshold limits for both spot and <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> processes. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were conducted by using hand held spirometer to 15 control group, 11 spot welders and 19 <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> welders. Result of the study shows a significant mean difference of pulmonary functions values in investigated welder groups. <b>Weld</b> <b>bonding</b> welders had the lowest mean pulmonary functions values compare to other groups. Statistical analysis reveals that the pulmonary function of spot welders were affected significantly by number of smoking years but not significantly affected to duration of exposure. However, <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> welders pulmonary functions values were not significantly affected neither by smoking years nor working durations.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{structural}} adhesive SikaPower- 498 {{is associated with}} spot welds to produce <b>weld</b> <b>bonded</b> joint with KS 2 specimens. The specimens are tested under tension, shear and peeling loading. <b>Weld</b> <b>bonded</b> joint ultimate strength and energy absorption are compared with single spot welded joints and adhesively bonded joints tests.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, fatigue and {{metallurgical}} behaviour of weld-bonds and adhesive bonds developed using 2 mm thick aluminium alloys namely 5052 alloy have been reported. Weld-bonds were prepared using structural adhesive (Epoxy resin) and spot welding (20 kA welding current for 6 cycles welding time at welding pressure of 0. 5 MPa).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Custom-engineered functionally-specific {{properties}} {{leading to}} greatly enhanced design versatility have drawn designers to composites, but will make these materials-of-preference only if better ways {{can be found}} for producing better joints. The very micro- and macrostructure that {{gives rise to the}} unparalleled properties possible with composites exacerbates the inherent weaknesses virtually always associated with joints. Prevailing methods of mechanical fastening and adhesive or thermal <b>bonding</b> (<b>welding)</b> are nonoptimal, if not inappropriate, extensions of methods used for joining conventional metallic or polymeric structures with little real change in over two millennia. This paper challenges the old paradigm of joining being a pragmatic process performed as a last step in manufacture and proposes that it must increasingly become an enabling technology that is integrated with material and structure synthesis. Four new ways to think about joining composites are proposed, and a possibility for each approach is presented to provoke thinking among design and process engineers...|$|R

40|$|Cleaning {{has always}} been an {{important}} step in manufacturing operations. Cleaning proceeds functions such as machining, inspection, plating, <b>bonding,</b> <b>welding,</b> heat treatment, and painting. If a surface is not properly cleaned or prepared, the results can be disastrous. The majority of industry has used cleaning methods such as vapor degreasing or solvent cleaning with chlorinated solvents such as chlorofluorocarbons, methyl chloroform, or perchloroethylene. These solvents were non-flammable, were considered to have low toxicity, and worked fairly well. However, recent finding regarding these solvents have caused them to fall from favor. Chlorofluorocarbons and methyl chloroform have been implicated as ozone depleting substances and are being regulated as such. Current plans call for a ban on production of these substances in the year 2000 and 2005, respectively. Perchloroethylene has been classified as a suspect carcinogen and has also come under recent guidelines and regulations in the United States.
