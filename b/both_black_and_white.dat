5|$|According to {{historian}} George H. Haynes, {{during his}} nearly {{thirty years of}} public service Wilson practiced principled politics by championing unpopular causes, sometimes {{at the expense of}} his personal ambition. The causes Wilson supported included abolition of slavery, and the rights of workers, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white.</b>|$|E
5|$|Filmed in <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> {{as well as}} Gevacolor, Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958 and garnered positive critical reception. It was a commercial success, grossing 11million in its lifetime, thereby becoming only the second Tamil film to earn 10million after another Ramachandran starrer Madurai Veeran (1956); it became a silver jubilee film. Nadodi Mannan acquired cult status in Tamil cinema. It was dubbed into Telugu as Anaganaga Oka Raju and in Hindi as Hamen Bhi Jeene Do.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> patients. He started {{a school in}} the evenings, teaching children. He established {{what has been called}} the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in the back room of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.|$|E
50|$|Chaos continued; {{the police}} were overworked and tired. Detroit Police {{were found to have}} {{committed}} many acts of abuse against <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> who were in their custody.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 Detroit Riot was {{different}} in that <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> participated in destruction in the city. Violence {{was directed at}} attacking police and the National Guard, and destroying property.|$|R
5000|$|Molly Bellhouse Blackburn (12 November 1930 [...] - [...] 28 December 1985) was a South African anti-apartheid activist, {{political}} activist, {{civil rights}} campaigner and politician, widely respected by <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> from the rural and small town South. These developments dramatically altered {{the demographics of the}} state. Indiana industrial cities were among the destinations of the Great Migration. After World War II, industrial restructuring and the shifts in heavy industry resulted in Indiana's becoming part of the Rust Belt.|$|E
5|$|While in Scotland, Smith {{joined the}} Glasgow Emancipation Society and met {{people in the}} Scottish and English {{abolitionist}} movement. In 1833, Great Britain abolished slavery. When Smith returned to New York, he quickly joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and worked for the cause in the United States. He worked effectively with <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> abolitionists, for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that spanned the years from 1846-65.|$|E
5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped crinoline {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the Reconstruction governments {{established}} {{public education}} and social welfare institutions for the first time, improving education for <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> <b>and</b> tried to improve social conditions for the many left in poverty after the long war. No Reconstruction state government was dominated by blacks; in fact, blacks did not attain a level of representation equal to their population in any state.|$|R
25|$|During World War II, Los Angeles grew as {{a center}} for {{production}} of aircraft, war supplies and ammunitions. Thousands of people, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> from the South and the Midwest migrated to the West to fill factory jobs.|$|R
40|$|Everyone {{would agree}} that the American flag is red, <b>white</b> <b>and</b> blue. Everyone should also agree that it looks red, <b>white</b> <b>and</b> blue to people with normal color vision in {{appropriate}} circumstances. If a philosophical theory led {{to the conclusion that}} the red stripes cannot look red to both men <b>and</b> women, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> <b>both</b> young <b>and</b> old, we would be reluctant (to say the least) to accept that philosophical theory. But there is a widespread philosophical view about the nature of conscious experience that, together with some empirical facts, suggests that color experience cannot be veridical for both men <b>and</b> women, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> <b>both</b> young <b>and</b> ol...|$|R
5|$|ZIPRA leader Joshua Nkomo {{publicly}} {{claimed responsibility}} for shooting down the Hunyani {{in an interview with}} the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{arrangement}} protected sharecroppers from {{the negative effects}} of a bad crop, many sharecroppers (<b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white)</b> remained quite poor. Arrangements typically left a third of the crop to the sharecropper.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, Langston was {{urged to}} run for {{a seat in the}} U.S. House of Representatives by fellow Republicans, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white.</b> Leaders of the biracial Readjuster Party, which had held {{political}} power in Virginia from 1879 to 1883, did not support his candidacy. Langston ran as a Republican and lost to his Democratic opponent. He contested the results of the election because of voter intimidation and fraud.|$|E
50|$|Through the 1880s, the {{community}} at Rehoboth were joined by other Baster families from Grootfontein (South) (whom missionary Heidmann had earlier tried to recruit), Okahandja, and Otjimbingwe. While based on descent within the families, they also accepted <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> who applied to join {{the community}}.|$|R
30|$|Now {{suppose that}} <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> through some {{effective}} social policy, experienced an additive shift such that those now at x= 50, or half {{the poverty line}} income, were now at x= 100, which {{can be viewed as}} effectively rescaling the x variable. While the overall proportions of <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> below the poverty line would both be substantially smaller, the corresponding FR would be much higher, going from 2.29 prior to the additive shift to. 118 /. 044 = 2.68 afterwards. Hence, as Scanlan says “…the rarer the outcome, the greater the disparity in experiencing the outcome.” Similarly, for the other ratio, “…the smaller the disparity in avoiding the outcome” namely the SR ratio associated with those avoiding poverty. The SR disparity is reduced from. 84 to. 92.|$|R
25|$|Immediately upon Inauguration in 1869, Grant bolstered Reconstruction by prodding Congress to readmit Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas {{into the}} Union, while {{ensuring}} their constitutions protected every citizen's voting rights. Grant met with prominent black leaders for consultation, {{and signed a}} bill into law that guaranteed equal rights to <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> in Washington D.C.|$|R
25|$|Abuses of {{the poll}} tax {{continued}} to resist efforts by reformers {{for change in}} the 1930s and 1940s. In 1943 legislators managed to rescind the poll tax, but the Tennessee Supreme Court declared that action unconstitutional. It was not until 1953 that a new constitutional convention finally removed provisions for the poll tax. Hundreds of thousands of citizens, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> had been disenfranchised by its abuses during the decades since its passage.|$|E
25|$|Berea College, {{located at}} the extreme {{southern}} edge of the Bluegrass below the Cumberland Plateau, was the first coeducational college in the South to admit <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> students, doing so from its very establishment in 1855. This policy was successfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in the case of Berea College v. Kentucky in 1908. This decision effectively segregated Berea until the landmark Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Ramsay set out by {{welcoming}} <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> parishioners {{into his}} church, {{with the aim}} of converting the slaves to Christianity. As well as pastoring the members of his church he practised medicine and surgery, providing a free service to the poor of the community. Having been appointed surgeon to several plantations on the island, he was able to see firsthand the conditions under which the slaves laboured and the brutality of many of the planters.|$|E
50|$|The Memphis riot was {{investigated}} by the Freedmen's Bureau, aided by the Army and the Tennessee Inspectors General, who gathered affidavits from those involved. In addition, there was investigation and report by a Congressional committee, which reached Memphis on May 22 and interviewed 170 witnesses, gathering extensive oral histories from <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|R
40|$|I {{document}} {{trends in}} <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> retirement rates <b>and</b> in living arrangements among retirees. I {{show that the}} retirement rates of <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> rose between 1900 and 1930 but that convergence in <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> rates <b>and</b> in living arrangements only occurred between 1930 and 1950. I examine whether rising income explains the rise in black retirement rates prior to 1930 and whether rising income and the institution of Social Security in 1935 led to convergence {{by looking at the}} impact of the first pension program available to <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites,</b> that serving Union Army veterans. I find that blacks were 2 to 5 times as responsive as whites to income transfers in their retirement decisions and 6 to 8 times as responsive in their choice of independent living arrangements. The results suggest that income effects from the institution of Social Security explain up to half of the convergence in black-white retirement rates and in living arrangements...|$|R

25|$|After World War I, {{there was}} a rise in lynchings and other racial {{violence}} directed by whites against blacks in the state, as well as across the South and in Chicago and Washington. It was due in part from strains of rapid social and economic changes, as well as competition for jobs, and lingering resentment resulting from the reconstruction after the Civil War as well as tensions among <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> populations created by the return of black veterans.|$|E
25|$|This area of Ohio {{became a}} center of {{resource}} development and industrialization through the mid-20th century. It was {{a center of}} the steel industry, receiving iron ore shipped from Minnesota and shipping Great Lakes products to the east. Railroads took {{over some of the}} transportation from the lake ships. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these cities attracted hundreds of thousands of European immigrants and migrants (<b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white)</b> from the rural South to its industrial jobs.|$|E
25|$|The Brotherhood {{admitted}} <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> carpenters on {{an equal}} footing when it was first formed; one of the union's vice-presidents in its early years was L.E. Rames, an African-American carpenter from Charleston, South Carolina. In the South, however, the union often isolated black carpenters in segregated locals as a concession to the opposition of white carpenters and contractors. Local unions also often excluded black workers on a de facto basis. The union formally dissolved its segregated locals in 1963.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his short}} time in office, Lumumba {{impressed}} <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> with his pragmatic approach to governance of the struggling city. He [...] "promised {{to fix the}} potholes and the sewers and passed a sales tax increase to help do it." [...] He discussed it in all precincts and won 90% approval for the tax.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{sharecropping}} {{system was}} primarily a post-Civil War development, it did exist in antebellum Mississippi, especially in the northeastern part of the state, an area with few slaves or plantations, and most likely existed in Tennessee. Sharecropping, along with tenant farming, was a dominant form in the cotton South from the 1870s to the 1950s, among <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Georgia {{he found}} the {{predominant}} cultural activity revolved around a mega-church ("First Redeemer Church"), so he involved himself in its activities. He felt the most comfortable in this situation, since <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> {{in this area are}} used to seeing the other - as contrasted to the first two sites, where a black person is still a rarity.|$|R
25|$|Governor James B. A. Robertson {{had gone}} to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored. Before {{returning}} to the capital, he ordered an inquiry of events, especially of the City and Sheriff's Office. He called for a Grand Jury to be empanelled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8. The jury was picked by June 9. Judge Biddison expected that the State Attorney General would call numerous witnesses, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> given the large scale of the riot.|$|E
25|$|Chamlee moved for new {{trials for}} all defendants. Private {{investigations}} took place, revealing that Price and Bates had been prostitutes in Tennessee, who regularly serviced <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> clientele. Chamlee offered judge Hawkins affidavits to that effect, {{but the judge}} forbade him to read them out loud. The defense argued that this evidence proved that the two women had likely lied at trial. Chamlee pointed to the uproar in Scottsboro that occurred when the verdicts were reported as further evidence that the change of venue should have been granted.|$|E
25|$|In the endgame, {{it comes}} down to a race over who can checkmate the {{opponent}} first. A tactic known as speed counting {{plays an important role in}} the endgame. By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for <b>both</b> <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White,</b> this will help to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically. Among this, there are many other delicate factors to look out for within the endgame, including sacrificial attacks and traps.|$|E
50|$|Under the 1777 New York constitution, {{all free}} men had {{to satisfy a}} {{property}} requirement to vote, which eliminated poorer men from voting, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites.</b> A new constitution in 1821 eliminated the property requirement for white men, but kept it for blacks, effectively continuing to disfranchise them. This lasted until passage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1870.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Almost Year", Alice Walker {{explains}} how the author Florence Randall {{explains how}} she wants <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> to embrace one another. She clarifies that [...] "she seeks {{to find a}} way in which <b>black</b> abused <b>and</b> poor <b>and</b> <b>white</b> privileged <b>and</b> rich can meet and exchange some warmth of themselves. Walker's perspective is that if <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> can stop the racial equality that <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> will not be divided. In this house, a black girl feels somewhat threatened being an all-white household. Due to these circumstances, Walker provides a sense of division between the <b>black</b> girl <b>and</b> the family that is providing a home for her to feel free. The black girl cannot embrace the warmth from the Mallory's family because she feels that all white people are to hurt black people. Walker explains how the Civil Rights Movement intended to bring <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> together. Walker wants to show how a black girl should not have to feel unequal when they are around white people.|$|R
25|$|Later {{during the}} antebellum years, other {{individual}} African Americans escaped to Canada, mostly to locations in Southwestern Ontario, via the Underground Railroad, a system supported by <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>whites</b> to assist fugitive slaves. After achieving independence, northern {{states in the}} U.S. had begun to abolish slavery as early as 1793, but slavery was not abolished in the South until 1865, following the American Civil War.|$|R
