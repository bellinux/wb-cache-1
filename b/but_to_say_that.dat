500|$|The writers wrote Rousseau out of {{the series}} upon request by Furlan, who {{did not wish to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, {{although}} she later called this an untrue rumor. The producers planned for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four; however, this was delayed due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The writers stated that Rousseau would be in the fifth season, and her story would be told, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it would be told through a flashback would be [...] "disingenuous". In the fifth season of Lost, a younger version of Rousseau is shown. Critical reaction to the character has been generally positive; however, many have expressed disappointment in the execution of Rousseau's death scene.|$|E
2500|$|My {{attitude}} was not pushy ... <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{in the normal}} course of events it would be most likely that they would enter foreign trade. And when they did, the way to signal it to the world at large was to bring Coca-Cola in—as the symbol of U.S. foreign trade.|$|E

And she lost a lot of weight so that if you looked at her, you would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor. I can't act like that. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she did all of the dancing is {{absolutely}} ridiculous to anyone that knows anything about ballet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{answered}} Myles, [...] "what thou sayest doth rejoice my very heart. Ne'theless, it is <b>but</b> just <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{both his}} breast-piece and over-girth were burst in the stitches before {{he ran his}} course, for so I saw with mine own eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no {{particular}} reason why I should have been penitent, <b>but</b> I ventured <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the house they had entered could not be far off.|$|R
2500|$|The things (people, events) in {{the life}} of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a {{discrete}} meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., <b>but,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only in life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. Bertrand Russell wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this: ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is {{able to take care of}} everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take care of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take care of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E
60|$|To {{say that}} Henrietta was {{volatile}} is <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she was woman. To {{say that she}} was in the bonnet-trimming is feebly to express the taste which reigned predominant in her own.|$|E
50|$|Remember, {{the idea}} of the static {{condition}} is not <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> nothing is happening <b>but</b> rather <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> nothing is changing in the instructions given to the system since the last instruction from the Control. If the last instruction by the Control is to accelerate, the system will continue to accelerate until told otherwise.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{difference}} of artistic theory," [...] replied the Professor pensively. [...] "Gogol was an idealist. He made {{up as the}} abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist. But I am a realist. I am a portrait painter. <b>But,</b> indeed, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression. I am a portrait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am deeply}} obliged {{to you for}} your kindness, sir, and to you, Colonel Somerset; <b>but</b> I regret <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> with all respect, I must decline both offers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that is {{so easily}} spoken. Men talk of {{forgiveness}} when their anger rankles deepest in their hearts. In the course of years I shall forgive her. I hope I shall. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I can forgive her now would be a farce. She has broken my heart, Mrs. Orme." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{can well}} believe it. Simple lines in a {{landscape}} are of the same value as the naked parts of a richly-clothed figure. They act both as contrasts and as indications of the original substratum of the figure; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> severe simplicity is the highest ideal is mere pedantry and Manicheism.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I {{attempt to}} deceive thine ears with this tale, I should lay {{falsehood}} to my soul. We are many, and sorry am I {{to say that}} some among us are like unto them that were called 'Legion.' <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there is not still place for all to die where they are born, is to utter damning untruth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} you are telling me everything, Mr. Quatermain, <b>but</b> {{something}} seems <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this is {{because it is not}} well that I should learn everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's thrue," [...] said Thady, {{when he had}} spelt {{through the}} epistle; [...] "that's thrue, father; <b>but</b> this is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he manes <b>to</b> come in 'arnest, when that time comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is <b>but</b> just <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Tommy's {{threat was}} uttered {{more than half}} in jest. He would as soon have thought of [...] "wopping" [...] a little girl as of maltreating his meek companion. But Peekins was {{uncertain}} how to take his threat, so, not being desirous of a wopping, he held his tongue and humbly followed his comrades.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{who escaped}} {{must have had}} their souls doubly riveted inside their bodies to carry them out of Russia through that frost fit to split rocks. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was our fault that {{a single one of}} them got away is mere ignorance. Why! Our own men {{suffered}} nearly to the limit of their strength. Their Russian strength! ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{there were}} all the {{materials}} for the catastrophe--the cannon, the powder, the shot. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Persians must have conquered the Medes, even if Cyrus had never lived, is to say, as too many philosophers {{seem to me to}} say, that, given cannon, powder, and shot, it will fire itself off some day if we only leave it alone long enough.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's {{only one}} economy which I don't think is justifiable,' said he, 'and that is, {{to cut down}} your {{subscriptions}} to charities. It is such a very cheap way of doing things. Not that I do much in that line--too little, perhaps. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> because WE want to economise, therefore some poor people are to suffer, is a very poor argument. We must save at our own expense.' ...|$|E
60|$|Degrees of self-evidence are {{important}} {{in the theory of}} knowledge, since, if propositions may (as seems likely) have some degree of self-evidence without being true, it will not be necessary to abandon all connexion between self-evidence and truth, <b>but</b> merely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> where there is a conflict, the more self-evident proposition is to be retained and the less self-evident rejected.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had that}} paper," [...] Duge said quietly, [...] "I would tear {{it up at}} this moment, <b>but</b> I regret <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I have not. It was stolen during my illness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' {{returned}} the other. 'Shall we walk as we talk? The damp falls rather heavily. Well,--as you please. <b>But</b> I grieve <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I can spare you {{only a very}} few moments.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her glance clouded {{under this}} reminder. Then she pouted {{and made a}} little gesture of impatience. [...] "Dick is not in peril," [...] she answered. [...] "He is foolish to remain so long in hiding, {{and of course he}} will have to face unpleasantness when he is found. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he is in peril is... just nonsense. Terence said nothing of peril. He agreed with me that Dick will {{probably}} be sent home. Surely you don't think--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come hither, Waldemar," [...] said Prince John. [...] "An unhappy prince am I. My father, King Henry, had {{faithful}} servants--He had <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he {{was plagued}} with a factious priest, {{and the blood}} of Thomas-a-Becket, saint though he was, stained the steps of his own altar.--Tracy, Morville, Brito [47] loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are extinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hath left a son, he hath fallen off from his father's fidelity and courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Coming to the {{question}} of fact, I cannot find that there is anything to answer, for nothing has been proved against me. True, it has been proved that I arrived at Monsanto at half-past eleven or twenty minutes to twelve {{on the night of the}} 28th, and it has been further proved that half-an-hour later I was discovered kneeling beside the dead body of Count Samoval. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this proves that I killed him is more, I think, if I understood him correctly, than Major Swan himself dares to assert.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] {{said the}} skipper sharply, [...] "one or two things {{which some people}} might have been proud of. <b>But</b> I’m proud <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there isn’t a living soul knows of ’em." ...|$|R

6000|$|Nevertheless, though Jeff Benson did not boast, it is <b>but</b> just <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he felt {{considerable}} {{satisfaction in}} his triumph, and rejoiced {{in the possession}} of so powerful a frame, as he continued his walk to Miss Millet's house. It did not occur to him, however, to thank God for his strength of body, because at that time [...] "God was not in all his thoughts." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{this is why}} I have, {{with the}} utmost respect, ventured to place The Snob Royal {{at the head of}} my list, causing all others to give way before him, as the Flunkeys before the royal {{representative}} in Kensington Gardens. To say of such and such a Gracious Sovereign that he is a Snob, is <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> his Majesty is a man. Kings, too, are men and Snobs. In a country where Snobs are in the majority, a prime one, surely, cannot be unfit to govern. With us they have succeeded to admiration.|$|E
60|$|It remains <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> {{not a man}} of the Clan Quhele {{survived the}} bloody combat except the {{fugitive}} chief; and the consequence of the defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy. The clans of which it consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner. The Clan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and the best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the race of the Cat a Mountain.|$|E
60|$|In {{one feature}} of the life at Cobhurst there was a change. The absence of Miriam threw Cicely and Ralph much more together. For instance, they breakfasted by themselves, for Mrs. Drane had always been late in coming down in the morning, and it was {{difficult}} for her to change her habits. Moreover, it now happened frequently that Cicely and Ralph found that each must be the sole companion of the other; and in this regard more than in any other was Miriam missed. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in this regard more than any other her absence was regretted would be inaccurate.|$|E
