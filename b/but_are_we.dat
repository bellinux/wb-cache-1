6000|$|... "Lord! there's {{no great}} harm in that! I am {{used to being}} alone with gentlemen, and think nothing of it. <b>But,</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> really alone, Mr. Hugh, and quite by ourselves?" ...|$|E
60|$|BARBARA. I {{beg your}} pardon, madam, I am sure, <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> really {{to see one}} of His Majesty's own brothers? That will be pure! O madam, this is better than Carlisle.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very true, sir; <b>but</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> {{not likely}} to have more work, here? and would it be {{altogether}} prudent to send so fine a ship as the Carnatic away, when the enemy will count ten to six, even if she remain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{trust it}} will be the advance, as Malbone does not strike me as a man likely to retreat very easily. <b>But,</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> certain 'Squire Newcome will grant the warrant he will ask for, being in such close communion himself with these squatters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, one {{perceives}} it now," [...] said Nikolaus, [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not spirits. It {{is plain}} {{he did not}} see you, <b>but</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> invisible, too? He looked at us, but he didn't seem to see us." ...|$|R

6000|$|Farewell to our Bayly, about whose songs we may say, with Mr. Thackeray in [...] "Vanity Fair," [...] that [...] "they contain numberless good-natured, simple {{appeals to}} the affections."

6000|$|Though {{there are}} wreck-masters {{appointed}} {{to look after}} valuable property which must be advertised, yet undoubtedly {{a great deal of}} value is secretly carried off. <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> not all wreckers contriving that some treasure may be washed up on our beach, that we may secure it, and do we not infer the habits of these Nauset and Barnegat wreckers from the common modes of getting a living? ...|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> yet {{through with}} her? Not yet.

Her skewer was broken. My Viking solemnly averring, that he would eat nothing more of her concocting, for fear of being poisoned. For myself, I almost believed, that there was malice enough in the minx to give us our henbane broth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mankind, in Hollingsworth's opinion," [...] thought I, [...] "is {{but another}} yoke of oxen, as stubborn, stupid, and {{sluggish}} as our old Brown and Bright. He vituperates us aloud, and curses {{us in his}} heart, and will begin to prick us with the goad-stick, by and by. <b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> his oxen? And what right has he to be the driver? And why, when there is enough else to do, should we waste our strength in dragging home the ponderous load of his philanthropic absurdities?

6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> here to pause? Not so. On the Universal {{agglomeration}} and dissolution, we {{can readily}} conceive {{that a new}} and perhaps totally different series of conditions may ensue—another creation and irradiation, returning into itself—another action and rëaction of the Divine Will. Guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws, the law of periodicity, are we not, indeed, more than justified in entertaining a belief—let us say, rather, in indulging a hope—that the processes we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever, and forever, and forever; a novel Universe swelling into existence, and then subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the Heart Divine? ...|$|E
60|$|Benz. Alas, my lord, {{where can}} your vengeance fall? Your justice {{will not let}} it reach us all. Selin and Ozmyn both would sufferers be; And punishment's a favour done to me.

Look round, my lord, and see; Point out that face which is your enemy. Would you your hand in Selin's blood embrue? Kill him unarmed, who, armed, shunned killing you? Am I your foe?
