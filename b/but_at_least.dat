5|$|In a 1988 TV special, series creator Gene Roddenberry said that, as {{with the}} first pilot, this one still {{had a lot of}} science-fiction {{elements}} in it, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> it ended with Kirk in a bare-knuckle fistfight with Mitchell and that's what sold NBC on Star Trek.|$|E
5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since {{the appearance of the}} Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{that emerge}} from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E

5|$|The three {{infantry}} classes {{may have}} retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would {{serve in the}} first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded {{that he had a}} religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E

5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Suwo {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Japanese squadron during the Battle of Tsingtao from 27 August to 7 November 1914. The ship served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915–16 before becoming a gunnery training ship {{for the rest of}} the war. In April 1922, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty, Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal. While her armor was being removed, the ship capsized on 13 July. She was probably scrapped in 1922–23, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one source suggests she was refloated and hulked, serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{television}} {{networks in the}} United States were restricted to owning {{no more than five}} local VHF television stations. This system, which evolved from similar FCC regulations governing radio, resulted in executives of {{television networks}} forming alliances with local station owners in order to air network programs across the U.S. These alliances were codified in network affiliation contracts; Paramount Television Network staff required affiliate station managers to sign a network contract even if the station only aired one Paramount program. At its peak in late 1950, the Paramount Television Network was distributing five television series a week to over 40 affiliated television stations. Most Paramount stations were in the United States, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two were Canadian stations.|$|E
5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then {{the source of the}} 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> some of the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there {{does not appear to}} be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E

5|$|Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite National Park was {{at first}} {{administered}} by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing {{was no longer a}} problem, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1963, a B-52E of the 6th Bomb Wing from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico, {{crashed in}} snow-covered {{mountains}} in northern New Mexico after turbulence tore off the vertical fin. The ECM operator and tail gunner were killed <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three crew (pilot, radio operator {{and one other}} crew member) survived. Three Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars and, later, three Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports, circled the area trying to locate survivors; the pilots reported that they saw two other survivors after the first man walked to safety.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E

5|$|The false potto (Pseudopotto martini) is a lorisoid primate of {{uncertain}} taxonomic status {{found in}} Africa. Anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz named it in 1996 {{as the only}} species of the genus Pseudopotto {{on the basis of}} two specimens (consisting only of skeletal material) that had previously been identified as pottos (Perodicticus potto). The precise provenances of the two specimens are uncertain, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one may have come from Cameroon. Schwartz thought the false potto could even represent a separate family, but other researchers have argued that the supposed distinguishing features of the animal do not actually distinguish it from the potto; specifically, the false potto shares several features with West African pottos.|$|E
5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the three leading actors.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other demersal fishing gear. It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
