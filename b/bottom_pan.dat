As for the {{phenomenon}} of the bottom thermal inward convex distortion of the Composite <b>Bottom</b> <b>Pan</b> (CBP) on the condition of heating, the mechanism of the bottom distortion was researched on the basis of ANSYS 10. 0 considering the structural characteristic and the heating conditions of the composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan.</b> The results showed that the thicker the bottom of the composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan,</b> the smaller its thermal deformation amount. The thicker the junction of the pot and wall was, the smaller its deformation. And it was helpful for reduction of deformation to use a big rounded transition. The increase of rings number of magnetic conductive sheet would lead to a less bottom thermal inward convex distortion of the CBP. The larger the area of the additional stainless steel sheet (or ring), the smaller the deformation amount. Consequently, the research laid a solid theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of the structure of composite <b>bottom</b> <b>pan...</b>|$|E
30|$|Heat pump {{performance}} is dependent primarily upon outside temperature. As the temperature becomes lower, heat pump performance declines. At temperatures near to 0 ^∘C, {{there is a}} tendency for water in the air to freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. Some heat pumps employ a small heating coil to prevent water from collecting and freezing in the <b>bottom</b> <b>pan</b> of the outdoor unit, and all heat pumps can periodically reverse the direction heat is pumped to defrost the outdoor unit. Defrosting reduces the overall system performance, especially within about 5 ^∘C of 0 ^∘C [58]. Specific ASHPs monitored in Alaska were found to both exceed, and fail to meet, manufacturer specifications, depending upon circumstance and performance of the particular heat pump [61].|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} the ME content of TMR samples for lactating dairy cows based on 24 h gas production (GP) measured in two TMR fractions obtained by sieving that were considered proxy representations of their forage and concentrate contents. Samples of TMR for lactating cows, collected at 15 Italian dairy farms, were dried and fractionated using an apparatus composed of four sieves (mesh diam. of 6. 00, 2. 36, 1. 18, 0. 60 mm) and a <b>bottom</b> <b>pan.</b> The particles retained by the 6. 00, 2. 36 and 1. 18 mm sieves were bulked to create a fraction named “Long” (L), while particles retained by the 0. 60 mm sieve and the <b>bottom</b> <b>pan</b> created a fraction named “Fine”(F). Samples of whole TMR and of F and L fractions were fermented in rumen fluid (220 mg of dried sample into graduated 100 ml glass syringes with 30 ml of diluted rumen fluid) to measure GP at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation, and GP at 24 h was used in multiple equations to predict the ME content. The L fraction was {{the main part of}} the TMR (633 ± 61. 7 g/kg DM) and contained more aNDFom (391 vs 185 g/kg DM; P < 0. 01), less starch (213 vs 394 g/kg DM; P < 0. 01) and less CP (132 vs 181 g/kg DM; P < 0. 01) than the F fraction. The 24 h GP measured on the F fraction was 17 % higher (P < 0. 01) than in the L fraction lending to a 25 % increase in the predicted ME content of the F fraction (12. 1 vs 9. 7 MJ/kg DM, P < 0. 01). When the GP of the two fractions were summed on the basis of their relative weights in each TMR to obtain a calculated GP of the whole TMR, this did not differ from that directly measured on the original TMR sample. The ME values of the TMR had substantial variability among samples and the highest ME values measured for the F and L fractions were 13. 23 and 10. 82 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The inclusion of these F and L fraction values in TMR samples that had the lowest ME concentrations (e. g. 10. 0 – 10. 4 MJ/kg DM), as an hypothetical consequence of an improvement in nutritive quality of the dietary feed components, resulted in a calculated ME increment of about 0. 5 – 0. 6 and 0. 8 – 1. 0 MJ/kg DM, respectively. These simulations suggest appreciable ME variations in cases of substituting nutritionally extreme forages and/or concentrates with corresponding feeds of different nutritive quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to describe the feed sorting, feeding behavior, and feed intake of cows consuming a close-up ration and to determine if these behaviors are affected by competition {{for access to the}} feed bunk. Thirty-six dry Holstein cows, consuming a close-up total mixed ration diet, were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: 1) noncompetitive (1 cow/feed bin) or 2) competitive (2 cows/feed bin). Dry matter intake, feed-ing behavior, and sorting behavior were monitored for each feed bin on 4 separate days during wk 2 and 3 before the anticipated calving dates of the cows. Fresh feed and orts were sampled daily from each bin and were subjected to particle size analysis. The particle size separator consisted of 3 screens (18, 9, and 1. 18 mm) and a <b>bottom</b> <b>pan</b> resulting in 4 fractions (long, medium, short, and fine). Sorting was calculated as the actual intake of each particle size fraction expressed {{as a percentage of the}} predicted intake of that fraction. Regardless of treatment, the cows sorted against long particles and for short and fine particles. Competition at the feed bunk had no effect on the sorting behavior, dry matter intake, or feeding time of the cows, but did dramatically increase the feeding rate of the cows. The competitively fed cows also had fewer meals per day, and tended to have larger and longermeals. Our results suggest that increased competition at the feed bunk promotes feeding behavior patterns that will likely in-crease the between-cow variation in composition of total mixed ration consumed.

50|$|In {{spite of}} the failure of the collaboration, Norbert Rillieux {{remained}} focused on improving the sugar refining process, developing his machine between 1834 and 1843, when he patented it. The multiple-effect evaporation system that he invented addressed both the spillage that resulted from transfer and the uneven application of heat, as well as making the process safer for workers. The system utilizes a vacuum chamber or a container with reduced air to lower the boiling point of the liquids. Inside this several pans are stacked to contain the sugarcane juice. As the <b>bottom</b> <b>pans</b> heat, they release steam to transfer heat to the pans above. The heat is more easily controlled than in the Jamaican Train method, because one source is needed, at a lower temperature, for multiple pans of sugarcane juice. This prevents the sugar from being burned and discolored. As the workers do not have to transfer the liquid, sugarcane is not spilled, and they are at a reduced risk for burns.|$|R
