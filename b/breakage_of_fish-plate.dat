40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an insight into}} the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> core-spun yarns and {{the contribution of the}} components to the yarn breaking strength. The study was made on cotton covered/nylon filament core yarn of 25 tex linear density produced at different twists. The load-extension curves showed three types ofbreakages. At low twist, the fibers slip along the filament core and mainly the filament yarn supports the effort. The <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> this nature was named high elongation breakage. At medium twist, the sheath destroys first, and then the core filament breakage occurs too. The <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> this nature was named structural breakage. At high twists, a simultaneous <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> cotton fibers and nylon multifilament occurs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hangers are the {{critical}} elements supporting stiffening girder in suspension bridge. The hangers probably break suddenly in {{service for the}} reasons of corrosion, fatigue or traffic accident. Because the hangers are anchored to the main cable, the sudden <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> hanger causes strong vibration of main cable, and the vibration may damage some {{of the elements of}} the bridge. Using nonlinear dynamic analysis methods and adopting 3 D finite element model, the responses of a suspension bridge to sudden <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> hangers are studied in this paper. The results show that the sudden <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> hanger has significant effects on tensions of the hangers adjacent to the broken hanger, the maximum tension of hanger produced by <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> a hanger exceeds 2. 2 times of its initial value, and the tensions of other hangers far away from the broken hanger are affected little. The <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> a single hanger causes very large torsion moments of girder and reactions of bearings, but it has little effects on the tensions of main cable and moments of tower...|$|R

40|$|Effect of some radical {{scavengers}} on the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> DNA by {{ascorbic acid}} of ascorbic acid and Cu 2 + was examined with sucrose {{density gradient centrifugation}} or viscometry. The degradation of DNA by ascorbic acid was distinctly inhibited by 2 -aminoethylisothiouronium bromide.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of coarse aggregates under shear stresses {{and its influence}} on the shear strength is studied, considering the energy consumption by particle breakage during shearing. An analytical model is developed relating the deviator stress ratio, dilatancy, friction angle and particle breakage under triaxial loading. Large-scale triaxial testing of latite basalt has been conducted, and the extent <b>of</b> particle <b>breakage</b> during shearing has been quantified. The <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> particles under monotonic triaxial loading has been considered {{within the scope of}} this paper, and the modelling <b>of</b> particle <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> aggregates under cyclic loading will be presented in a follow-up paper. The results show that the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> particles continues to increase beyond the peak deviator stress. The energy consumption by particle breakage is non-linearly related to the particle breakage index. The model also evaluates the effect <b>of</b> particle <b>breakage</b> on the friction angle of ballast. This study sheds further light on the basic angle of friction, which is independent <b>of</b> the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> particles during shearing...|$|R

40|$|The girder of self-anchored {{suspension}} bridge {{is subjected to}} large compression force applied by main cables. So, serious damage of the girder due to <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> hangers may cause {{the collapse of the}} whole bridge. With the time increasing, the hangers may break suddenly for their resistance capacities decrease due to corrosion. Using nonlinear static and dynamic analysis methods and adopting 3 D finite element model, the responses of an actual self-anchored {{suspension bridge}} to sudden <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> hangers are studied in this paper. The results show that the sudden <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> a hanger causes violent vibration and large changes in internal forces of the bridge. In the process of the vibration, the maximum tension of hanger produced by <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> a hanger exceeds 2. 22 times its initial value, and the reaction forces of the bearings increase by more than 1. 86 times the tension of the broken hanger. Based on the actual bridge, the influences of some factors including flexural stiffness of girder, torsion stiffness of girder, flexural stiffness of main cable, weight of girder, weight of main cable, span to sag ratio of main cable, distance of hangers, span length, and <b>breakage</b> time <b>of</b> hanger on the dynamic responses are studied in detail, and the influencing extent of the factors is presented...|$|R

40|$|Oil {{and water}} dynamic {{hydrocyclone}} is {{one type of}} facilities that separate two phases or multiple phases applied widely in the fields such as food processing, environmental protection, biological pharmacy, petroleum and chemistry. The dispersed oil droplets in the dynamic oil and water hydrocyclone were often broken into small drops by shear force, which decreased the separation efficiency of dynamic oil-water hydrocyclone greatly. To avoid the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> the oil droplets, the turbulence field and the velocity field of the dynamic hydrocyclone were studied by the software of Fluent to analyze the main reason that led to <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> oil droplets. Results indicated that the deformation of oil droplets {{was caused by the}} viscous shear force; the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> oil droplets was caused by the Reynolds shear stress and the local pressure fluctuations. The main area that the drops were prone to breakup of the dynamic hydrocyclone is that the rotating grating nearby, the wall boundary layer of the drum and center axis of the drum. Finally, the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> oil droplets and emulsification of oil and water in the dynamic hydrocyclone were verified by the experiments...|$|R

The crack or <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> crank arm was caused mostly by the deviation of center line of main bearings. The <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> crank pin bolts was due mostly to excessive or unbalanced tightening. 2. In hot balb engines, nearly one half of damaged engines were due to the <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> crank arm. When start engine, neglect about exhaust remaining oil in cylinder caused the engine to rapid rotation, and so crank case, piston, cylinder or cylinder cover to damage. 1. 漁船機関損傷の部位とその原因を,デイーゼル機関. 焼玉機関別に海難審判庁の裁決より考察した. 2. 主軸受中心線偏移によるクランク アームのき裂又は折損が最も多く,殊に焼玉機関に於て著しく,早期の開放点検整備が強く要望される. 3. デイーゼル機関に於ては,更に主軸受の焼損及びクランク ピン. ボルトの折損が多く,之等は他の部分の損傷に直接影響のある所で,潤滑油系に対する充分な注意と,ボルト締め付けに際しての細心の留意が肝要である. 4. 焼玉機関の始動時の急回転による損傷が各部に見出され,特に始動失敗の折の慎重な処置が望まれる. 機関損傷の殆どが,極めて基本的な事項の不注意,不処置に起因し,取扱者の充分な点検整備の実行が遂行されるならば,著しく軽減される海難である...|$|R

Irradiation with 313 nm light induced breaks in the 3 H-labeled strands in cells grown with BrdUrd at a much higher frequency than in 14 C-labeled DNA of cells not exposed to BrdUrd. <b>Breakage</b> <b>of</b> the 3 H-labeled strands was about 0. 6 % as efficient as that of fully BrUra-substituted DNA. During growth {{in the presence of}} BrdUrd, susceptibility to 313 nm-induced <b>breakage</b> <b>of</b> the 3 H-labeled DNA strands increased, reaching a maximum in about one generation, and it decreased to zero during subsequent growth for one generation in medium containing dThd instead of BrdUrd.
