5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of <b>beds</b> <b>for</b> patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of <b>beds</b> <b>for</b> psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E

5|$|The low-lying swampy area of Westhay Moor has had peat {{laid down}} over older rocks {{for the last}} 10,000 years. The Neolithic people lived on the areas of {{slightly}} higher ground but exploited the reed <b>beds</b> <b>for</b> materials and built wooden trackways to cross the raised bog. Peat extraction on the Somerset Levels has occurred since the area was first drained by the Romans. Measures to improve the drainage were {{carried out in the}} Middle Ages largely by Glastonbury Abbey. In the 17th and 18th centuries further drainage work was undertaken including digging a series of rhynes, or ditches and larger drainage canals. Peat extraction peaked in the 1960s but has since declined.|$|E

25|$|Colonel DeLand {{tried to}} impose {{discipline}} on the disorderly camp but was frustrated by its poor condition and corrupt guards, including especially those {{from his own}} regiment. Because only two water hydrants were available to the prisoners, they had {{to wait in the}} cold for hours to get water. Open sinks (latrines), or sewers, ran through the middle of the camp. The rundown buildings provided inadequate shelter. Hospital capacity, with 120 <b>beds</b> <b>for</b> prisoners and 50 <b>beds</b> <b>for</b> guards, was seriously inadequate. The post chapel was converted into hospital space, but there was still insufficient capacity for all the sick prisoners and guards.|$|E

25|$|A {{hospital}} is {{a health care}} institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of {{hospital is}} the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, {{with large numbers of}} <b>beds</b> <b>for</b> intensive care and additional <b>beds</b> <b>for</b> patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.|$|E
