This article focuses on whether and to what extent origin, quality and traceability labeling is an appropriate way to differentiate food products. The focus is on fresh meat and fresh fish, two mainly generic food product categories {{with a high degree of}} credence character. Insights into the potential for market differentiation through origin, quality and traceability labeling are provided and discussed using primary data collected during the period 2000 - 2005 by means of four consumer surveys. In general, direct indications of quality, including mandatory information cues such as <b>best-before</b> <b>dates</b> and species names, but also including quality marks, are found to be more appealing to consumers in general than origin labeling, and the latter more than traceability. The different studies yield the conclusion that the market differentiation potential of origin and quality labeling pertains mainly to a product’s healthiness appeal, and this potential seems stronger for meat than for fish. The differentiation potential of traceability per se is rather limited. Instead, traceability is needed as the regulatory and logistic backbone for providing guarantees related to origin and quality. consumer, country of origin, labeling, quality, traceability, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Globally, around {{one-third of}} the edible parts of {{perishable}} food products is wasted every year. Adequate logistics management of the food supply chain is of importance. Inventory control of processed fresh food with a <b>best-before</b> or use-by <b>date</b> deals with the questions how much to order and how often, and how to review the inventory position. For perishable products, there exists a trade-off between desired product-availability and waste. A high order quantity or frequent ordering may result in high product-availability but also waste. A small order quantity or less frequent ordering results in lower inventory levels, but may cause out-of-stock. For the inventory control of a perishable product the age-distribution of the items should be considered. This is influenced by order picking at a food producer or warehouse, or consumer behaviour at a supermarket, picking First In First Out (FIFO), where first the oldest items are used, or Last In First Out (LIFO), where first the freshest items of the product are used. This thesis investigates periodic review order policies for a food producer and a retailer for a perishable product with a fixed lifetime and a non-stationary demand. For a food producer {{as well as a}} retailer, it is not always economically feasible to reorder in every period. For planning purposes it is desirable to set the timing of the orders in advance. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to better decision making regarding inventory control in the food supply chain from food producer to supermarket, in the trade-off between product-availability and waste. Methods are designed to generate practical order policies using commercial solvers for business rather than custom made solution procedures, where at least the timing of ordering or production is set beforehand. The practical inventory control problems discussed in this thesis are characterised by a perishable product with a fixed lifetime, non-stationary stochastic demand, a single-echelon production/inventory situation in a finite time horizon. The product has a service level requirement to ensure a certain product-availability. The decision problems deal with fixed setup or ordering cost, holding cost and disposal cost for wasted items. The age-distribution of the items in stock is considered in specific theoretical Stochastic Programming (SP) problems that deal with the service level requirement as a chance constraint or fill rate constraint. The studied problems vary in planning characteristics. Fluctuations in demand combined with fixed setup or ordering costs imply that regular production or ordering is probably not optimal. This situation requires a strategy to deal with the fluctuations. In inventory literature, non-stationary demand for a perishable product with a fixed lifetime is hardly studied, and consequently also strategies to deal with it are little investigated. In this thesis, methods have been designed to generate practical order policies using commercial solvers, where at least the timing of ordering or production is set beforehand. The practical order policies have been benchmarked with custom made solution procedures. The developed practical policies are applicable in the practice of fresh food producers and in retail organisations, on the level of the store, {{as well as on the}} level of the distribution centre. An interesting conclusion is that the policies with fixed order timing are hardly more costly than the investigated policy with flexible order timing. The fixed order timing increases the ease of planning.   The studied cost functions in the models comprise disposal cost for which the value of the disposal cost in the experiments was varied. The results show that in the models with fixed order timing and corresponding order-up-to levels, increasing the disposal cost can reduce the percentage of waste, maintaining the service level. In setting a (fictitious) value for the disposal cost, one can steer the percentage of waste in determining the order policy, and thus contribute to better decision making in the food supply chain from food producer to supermarket in the trade-off between product-availability and waste...|$|R
50|$|The cheeses {{are removed}} from the presses and put onto pallets which are then {{immersed}} in a bath of salty water for 2 or 3 hours, according to the size.

5000|$|Brie cheese, like Camembert and Cirrus, are {{considered}} soft cheeses. This {{particular type of}} cheese is very rich and creamy, unlike Cheddar. This softness allows for the rapid widespread growth of bacteria if the cheese is not stored correctly. It is recommended that brie cheese be refrigerated immediately after purchase, and stored in the refrigerator until it is consumed completely. The optimal storage temperature for brie is at [...] or even lower. The cheese {{should be kept in}} a tightly sealed container or plastic wrap to avoid contact with moisture and food-spoilage bacteria which will reduce the shelf life and/or freshness of the product.

Although the cheese can still be consumed at this time, the quality of the cheese is believed to be reduced substantially. In the case that blue or green mold appears to be growing on the cheese, it must no longer be consumed and must be discarded immediately so that food-borne illness is prevented. The mold should not be cut off to continue consumption as there is a high risk of the mold being spread throughout the entire cheese already.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to model the effects of reusing salad from salad bars to reduce product loss, while keeping {{microbial}} safety and product quality at acceptable levels. We, therefore, expand our previously developed simulation model by incorporating reuse strategies and a quality decay model. The expanded model is used to simulate different salad reuse scenarios and to quantify the consequences to product loss, microbial safety and product quality. With this study, we show an application of a generic approach for the integrated modelling of product loss, microbial safety and product quality. The most cautious scenario consists of reusing salad for only 1 day after the first use and only if the salad originates from a package with a valid <b>best-before</b> <b>date</b> at the time of reuse (‘minimum reuse of salad with the <b>best-before</b> <b>date</b> criterion’). This scenario decreases product loss at the salad bar considerably from 37 % to 29 % () 21 %).

40|$|Liste des auteurs cf: EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) : biohaz@efsa. europa. euEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Salmonella Enteritidis is {{considered}} the only pathogen currently posing a major risk of egg-borne diseases in the European Union (EU). The possible impact of extending the shelf-life of eggs on the risk to consumers posed by S. Enteritidis was estimated by applying a quantitative model and comparing the actual situation regarding the storage of eggs in the EU with different possible scenarios combined, considering the prolongation of the best-before and the sell-by date from 7 {{to a maximum of}} 70 days. Extending the sell-by date by one week (from 21 to 28 days), but leaving the <b>best-before</b> <b>date</b> unchanged, is estimated to result in a relative risk of illness of 1. 4 and 1. 5 for uncooked and lightly cooked egg meals respectively, compared to the current situation. If the <b>best-before</b> <b>date</b> is also extended by one week (from 28 to 35 days), the relative risk would be 1. 6 and 1. 7. In the worst case scenario considered (sell-by date of 42 days, best before date of 70 days), such figures would be 2. 9 and 3. 5. It {{should be noted that the}} absolute risk is greater for uncooked meals compared to lightly cooked meals. An effective way to minimise any increase in risk during extended storage is to keep the eggs refrigerated both at retail and the household. Regarding egg spoilage, such events strongly depend on the hygienic conditions of egg production and practices of egg handling, including storage times and temperatures. Finally, the impact of the prolongation of storage time on the quality criteria for eggs (3 -hydroxybutyric acid and lactic acid) destined for manufacturing of egg products {{is considered}} negligible...|$|E

In Austria, most coffee packages have a <b>best-before</b> <b>date</b> between 12 and 24 months, {{but it is}} not regulated by law. Therefore, there is the need to evaluate changes in sensory qualities of coffee beverages prepared from stored coffee beans. For preparation of the coffee beverages, the paper filter method was used. In the quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) 10 trained assessors evaluated the intensity of 30 coffee attributes after roasting at the 9 th and 18 th month of storage, respectively. The sensory evaluation results showed reduction in the sensory qualities of coffee beverages after 9 months storage of roasted coffee beans. The positive associated odor and flavor attributes decreased in their intensity, whereas the negative associated odor and flavor attributes increased significantly (P < 0. 05). After 18 months of storage, the rancid odor and flavor which indicate oxidation processes were even considerably perceivable. Consequently, we can assume that changes in sensory quality characteristics of roasted and vacuum-packed coffee beans during storage are possible...|$|E

40|$|The Max Rubner-Institute (MRI) has {{discovered}} increased findings of vacuum-packed meat contaminated with psychrophilic (growth in cold temperatures) bacteria. The meat is spoiled before the <b>best-before</b> <b>date.</b> Typical signs {{of this are}} bloated packaging and bad odour stemming from the meat. This {{is caused by the}} bacterium Clostridium estertheticum which has contaminated the meat. Beef is most commonly affected, but lamb and venison are also affected. Meat that exhibits such sensory changes is unfit for human consumption, yet a potential health hazard for consumers is unlikely according to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). Due to insufficient data on the bacterium, BfR can only provide a provisional risk assessment of Clostridium estertheticum. Research literature includes no indication of health risk for humans through the ingestion of the bacterium. The bacterium is not considered disease-causing and was therefore classified in the lowest risk group by the Committee for Biological Agents (ABAS). Many species of clostridia occur everywhere in the environment. It is assumed that C. estertheticum is transmitted to the carcass during evisceration and skinning. In contrast to other spoiling agents, these bacteria multiply preferably at temperatures between - 1. 5 to 16 degrees Celsius. They then produce gases that lead to a distension of vacuum packages.

40|$|Vitamin C {{occurs in}} {{relatively}} high concentrations in fresh and processed {{fruits and vegetables}} but is found {{to a lesser extent}} in animal tissues and animal-derived products. Nearly 90 % of vitamin C in the human diet is obtained from fruits and vegetables but this can be indirect by way of commercially prepared fruit juices. These juices are often enriched with vitamin C which has been synthetically prepared. There is a wide range of such juices on the New Zealand market, and they are a significant source of dietary vitamin C for many in the population. The focus of this research is on the Keri range of juice products. The present study monitors the fate of vitamin C during storage of Keri juices up to the <b>best-before</b> <b>date,</b> and under a range of other storage and consumption situations. Two methods were adopted for determining ascorbic acid (AA, the chemical identity of vitamin C). These were the titrimetric method, which is based upon the reduction of the dye 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol by AA in acidic solution, and liquid chromatography, which is used to separate AA from its immediate oxidation product dehydroascorbic acid. In the latter method these two analytes can be measured independently. The liquid chromatography was less successful than the simpler titrimetric method, so most of the work was done by titration. However, the concentration of dehydroascorbic acid, which has vitamin C activity in vivo, remained uncertain. Moreover, the titrimetric method could not be applied to juices with high purple anthocyanin concentrations, like blackcurrant, because the colour change at the titration end point could not be detected. pH adjustment to change colour was ineffective, and decolourisation with charcoal led to the rapid and complete destruction of AA. The concentration of AA in Keri juices at the time of manufacture were always much higher than claimed on the labels. Storage for up to nine months at room temperature resulted in a loss in AA of between 37 and 68 %, depending on the juice and exposure to fluorescent light. However, the time of storage was a much more dominant factor than light exposure. The kinetics of loss, straight lines, were most easily explained by an aerobic model of AA degradation from oxygen diffusing across the polyethylene tetraphthalate bottle wall. Overall, the label claims made were defensible in terms of the <b>best-before</b> <b>date,</b> because it took at least 100 days of storage before the AA concentration in the most susceptible juices fell below the claimed value. This is because these drinks are fast moving consumer goods and storage beyond 100 days is unlikely. (Nonetheless, the supplier (Keri Juice Company) has since adopted its new unitised method of formulating juice. This has resulted in an initially higher concentration of vitamin C as compared to the juices under investigation.) In the nine months storage experiment there was some evidence for the presence of dehydroascorbic acid in blackcurrant drinks, but not in another three juices. Pasteurisation during preparation of these drinks resulted in up to 7 % loss of AA, probably due to oxygen dissolved in water, and accelerated by heat of pasteurisation. Higher temperatures in later storage also accelerated losses. Progressive exposure of juice to air during simulated consumption of 3 L bottles over a week also accelerated losses. Finally, exposure to sunlight in a diurnal temperature environment accelerated losses five-fold higher than in total darkness. Filtration of ultraviolet light approximately halved the loss due to sunlight. Overall however, it can be concluded that AA in the Keri range of juices is very resistant to degradation of AA...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Food {{products}} represent great biotopes for bacteria. The optimisation of foodstuffs conservation, mattering so economically as {{from the}} point of view of the public health, pass by a better understanding of those biotopes and their spoilage. Microbiologists had already tried to resolve this problem throughout several approaches. Studies based on classical microbiology cultures were completed by strategies centred on approaches independent from the microbiological culture. Purpose: The current techniques of new generation sequencing give a new dimension to the microbial ecology, through the metagenomic analysis of individuals' large number, within a mixed microbial population. Our aim is to demonstrate that this methodology can be successfully applied to the study of foodstuffs microbial flora, and can be adapted to the specific requirements of food microbiology. Methods: This study was carried out on pork's minced meat and white sausage, with shelf-life tests in various conditions of preservation (temperature and packaging). The rDNA 16 S was extracted from the original products and samples in the <b>best-before</b> <b>date</b> and, after standardization, hypervariable regions V 5 were sequenced. Results: A total about 130. 000 sequences were obtained and a metagenomic analysis succeeded in the taxonomic classification to the genus level for 80 % of this population. The subsequent analysis of microbial populations shows that the majority microbial populations at the expiration date are the same ones which are generally observed during microbiological analysis of these meat products. However, the population subdominants and especially several populations of not cultivable germs were able to be identified. These groups of bacteria, more difficult to obtain by the other methods, must be studied because they participate in the spoilage process of food products. Significance: The sensibility of this technology makes possible the analysis of foodstuffs presenting a very low microbial rate and, thus, allows the identification of the microbial contaminants before they grow the levels detected by cultural methods...|$|E

Due to the growing concerns of these commodities over their microbial safety, the objectives of this work were to study the microbiological quality and prevalence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes on fresh-cut fruits sold in southern Portugal. A study to examine the changes in pH and microbial counts, {{before and after the}} expiration dates, was also made. A total of 160 samples was purchased in the local grocery stores between September 2011 and August 2014, before their sell-by date. These samples were assayed for aerobic mesophilic (AM) and psychrotrophic (AP) microorganisms, yeasts and molds (YM), lactic-acid bacteria (LAB), coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli and coagulase positive staphylococci as well as L. monocytogenes and Salmonella. The microbiological counts ranged from 3. 0 - 9. 2 lg cfu/g (AM); 2. 2 – 10. 7 lg cfu/g (AP); 2. 3 – 10. 4 lg cfu/g (YM); 1. 9 – 9. 0 lg cfu/g (LAB) and less than 1 – 9. 1 lg cfu/g (TC). The melons and watermelon presented {{the highest levels of the}} microbial quality parameters studied. However, no E. coli, staphylococci, Salmonella and L. monocytogenes were detected in any of the samples. After the sell-by date, an increase of the AM, AP, LAB and YM values was observed in all fruits.

40|$|Background – {{inventory}} management theory {{has in the}} past been focused on traditional engineering industries. These theories are not completely applicable on industries such as FMCG where the main objective is to avoid obsolescence and not tied-up capital. A part of the FMCG industry that is especially pressured by short shelf lives is the food industry. The food industry has also the disadvantage that the customers demand instant deliveries, which makes production to order impossible. Arla Foods is a dairy company that is struggling with high and increasing wastage costs. The wastage cost is generated from products where last sales date is exceeded and Arla Foods CSE therefore has to trash the products even if the <b>best-before</b> <b>date</b> is still valid. These costs need to be reduced on both short and long term. Hence Arla Foods is perfect as a case company for this study. Purpose – the ulterior {{purpose of this study is}} to seek if the current theory is applicable on the food industry. This is investigated through a case study at Arla Foods with the following questions asked: Which factors drives wastage costs at a global dairy company such as Arla Foods? How do the factors relate to each other? Which actions could be taken to reduce the wastage costs at a global dairy company such as Arla Foods? To what extent could these findings be generalizable? Method – a thorough literature study is conducted to create an understanding of the existing theories. The case study is mainly based on interviews and observations with employees at Arla Foods. Data has been extracted from internal data bases and processed to complement the interviews and observations. Conclusion – the case company showed that the most significant wastage drivers on an article level were forecast deviations and batch size/delivery frequency. However, the main wastage drivers at Arla Foods were nothing that could be found in neither supply chain management nor {{inventory management}} theory – this was instead problems related to work process, organization, communication and strategy. Suggested solutions to these problems are among others: Going through the worst performing articles’ set-up in a structured way. Making sure that there exists a clear process and that all employees are educated in it. Having a back-up plan on what to do with excessive inventory.
