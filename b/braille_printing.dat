40|$|Abstract — Different text to Braille {{converter}} {{software for}} different languages is currently available. But for Sinhala language {{there is no}} such converter. Hence the visually impaired people of Srilanka who work with Sinhala language, suffer a lot. They need to operate manually for getting the desired output, which is a time consuming procedure. This software / conversion engine will easily convert the Sinhala text into the corresponding Braille document and will assist the learning process of visually impaired person of Srilanka. The additional advantage of the software is, it can produce the Braille output such that user can take <b>Braille</b> <b>print</b> of it using windows printing mechanism...|$|R
50|$|Several {{institutions}} {{which produce}} Braille materials distribute BRF files. BRF files are files which primarily contain Braille ASCII, but also include control characters, which affect how the <b>Braille</b> is <b>printed</b> or displayed. These files {{can then be}} embossed with a <b>Braille</b> embosser or <b>printed,</b> read on a Refreshable Braille display, or back-translated into standard text, which can then be read by a Screen reader or other similar program.

40|$|DE 2657064 C UPAB: 19930901 The method uses a {{cassette}} recorder or a dictation machine originally designed for sound reproduction. The Braille characters are electronically stored during reproduction by a tape recorder, covering one page of script {{of the normal}} size, in a preliminary (3) and in an operating (4) store, and reproduced in lines in a tactile display without pauses due to the recorder operation. The number of characters in this line is only a little smaller than that normally used in <b>Braille</b> <b>print.</b> A writing keyboard is connected with the operating store so that the user can store the written Braille texts up {{to the size of}} a page, and then record them page by page on the tape by the tape recorder...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} quality testing of <b>Braille</b> <b>printed</b> paper using {{calibrated}} camera by detecting dots and measuring the Euclidean distances between them with equal gap, vertically and horizontally. For higher accuracy, camera calibration {{is essential to}} observe a planar checker board pattern from different distances and orientations. In this process, {{the position of the}} camera is fixed and the pattern can be freely moved. Radial lens distortion is modeled. Machine simulation and experimental results have also been discussed. Quality improvement can be achieved by giving a feedback after finding the distorted edges from image processing of the paper. This approach thus definitely helps the blind reader to avoid disturbances in reading the printed documents by both, single sided and inter-point printer...|$|R
