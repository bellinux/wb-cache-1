50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the junctor circuits with incoming trunks, leaving only the ability to connect those incoming trunks to outgoing trunks. In many cases the resulting Crossbar tandem switch (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its Revertive Pulse senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few <b>both-way,</b> and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|E

RNAS Pulham operated as a Royal Navy base until 1918 when it {{was transferred to the}} new Royal Air Force. In 1917 two large steel-framed sheds were erected and in 1919 a 120 ft-high mooring mast joined them. Following its historic <b>both-way</b> Atlantic crossing the R34 returned to Pulham Market. The large rigid airships R33, R36 and R38 also visited. The base's airship hangar was dismantled in 1928 and re-erected at Cardington. In the early 1920s there was a radio Direction finding station was located here, that helped give accurate position reports to aircraft operating into Croydon airport. The base became disused in the early 1930s after the crash of the R101 when all work stopped in Britain on airships, although it continued as an RAF property until 1958. During World War II it was a dump for crashed aircraft from all over the east of England; parts were salvaged for reuse. Munitions testing was also conducted on the site.|$|E

The study found that the integration of Indigenous and Western science knowledge can provide transformative learning experiences for students which work to strengthen their sense of belonging to community and school. Using action research, the study investigated the integration of <b>both-ways</b> science education into students' zoology lessons. It privileged the community's cultural expertise, practices and connections with students and their families, which worked to enhance student engagement in their learning...|$|R
40|$|Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{had been}} {{deployed}} by many data networking providers、 service including the next-generation mobile backhaul networks, {{because of its}} undeniable potential in terms of virtual private network (VPN) management, traffic engineering, etc. In MPLS networks, IP packets are transmitted along a Label Switched Path (LSP) established between edge nodes. To improve the efficiency of resource use in MPLS networks, {{it is essential to}} utilize the LSPs efficiently. This paper proposes a method of selecting the optimal LSP pair from among multiple LSP pairs which are established between the same pair of edge nodes, on the assumption that both the upward and downward LSPs are established as a pair (<b>both-way</b> operation). It is supposed that both upward and downward bandwidths are allocated simultaneously in the selected LSP pair for each service request. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposal method could reduce the total amount of the bandwidth required by up to 15 % compared with the conventional selection method. The proposed method can also reuse the know-how and management tools in many existing networks which are based on <b>both-way</b> operation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this new}} era in {{tertiary}} education in Australia, the opportunity exists not only {{to meet the needs}} of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and thus redress low access and participation rates, but also to build a system that privileges Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges and ways of learning. To be able to do such a thing would require a shared vision and approach from within the institution and across the academy. In Australia, there is one tertiary education provider with the experience and expertise to be able to develop such an approach – Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education (BIITE). BIITE has been engaged in the post-secondary education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for over 40 years, evolving from a small vocational programme to become a dual sector provider with over 2700 students from across Australia (BIITE, 2011, p. 21). BIITE 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy of adult education is that of <b>both-ways,</b> which has been built from knowledge shared by Aboriginal peoples in the Northern Territory. The methodology presented in this paper extends the <b>both-ways</b> philosophy into a generative framework that has applicability in the many different contexts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tertiary education in Australia. It is our intention to generate a broader discussion about this opportunity in tertiary education and shift the discourse from inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to recognising the knowledges and ways of learning of the first peoples of this land as a strong foundation for the entire nation 2 ̆ 7 s learning...|$|R
40|$|This monogrtaph {{discusses}} {{the broad context}} of Indigenous education in Australian schools and proposes 'two-way enquiry learning' as a major construct of curriculum design. The concept of two-way enquiry learning builds {{on the idea of}} two-way or <b>both-ways</b> learning that is familiar in the Indigenous field of education in Australia, but extends this concept to include the principles of enquiry learning as advanced by Dewey. Two-way enquiry learning encourages Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples to work together on serious projects of mutual concern and to develop new ideas for ongoing social practice. Action proposals that arise are therefore available for investigation and for the generation of new understanbdings and reconciliation across cultural groupings...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a general framework for measuring risks, where the risk measure takes values in an abstract cone. It is shown {{that this approach}} naturally includes the classical risk measures and set-valued risk measures and yields a natural definition of vector-valued risk measures. Several main constructions of risk measures are described in this abstract axiomatic framework. It is shown {{that the concept of}} depth-trimmed (or central) regions from the multivariate statistics is closely related to the definition of risk measures. In particular, the halfspace trimming corresponds to the Value-at-Risk, while the zonoid trimming yields the expected shortfall. In the abstract framework, it is shown how to establish a <b>both-ways</b> correspondence between risk measures and depth-trimmed regions. It is also demonstrated how the lattice structure of the space of risk values influences this relationship. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} cointegration theory, error correcting {{model and}} Granger causality testing theory {{to make an}} empirical research on the relation between urbanization and GDP in China, and also implements a comparative analysis to the relation between three industries and degree of urbanization, the related coeffecient is 0. 97, 0. 95, 0. 97, 0. 97. And the result shows a long-term balance between these two factors, and the promoting effect to tertiary industry by urbanization is more obvious. Urbanization and economic growth are the long-term balanced relations. In the long-term balance, every 1 % increment of urbanization can make 4. 82 % increment of GDP; In short-term balance, if the balance depart from the long-term balance at the i-th term, the model will take automatic reversal adjustment with - 0. 06 adjusting strength at the (i+ 1) th term, to make it move to the long-term balance. The economic growth onto urbanization is one-way causality relationship, the primary and secondary industry onto urbanization is also one-way causality relationship. However, the tertiary industry onto urbanization is <b>both-way</b> causality relationship. Economic growth, Urbanization, Cointegration test, Error correction model, China, Agribusiness,...|$|E
40|$|We study Gaussian quantum {{steering}} and its asymmetry {{in the background}} of a Schwarzschild black hole. We present a Gaussian channel description of quantum state evolution {{under the influence of the}} Hawking radiation. We find that thermal noise introduced by Hawking effect will destroy the steerability between an inertial observer Alice and an accelerated observer Bob who hovers outside the event horizon, while it generates steerability between Bob and a hypothetical observer anti-Bob inside the event horizon. Unlike entanglement behaviors in curved spacetime, here the steering from Alice to Bob suffers from a "sudden death" and the steering from anti-Bob to Bob experiences a "sudden birth" with increasing Hawking temperature. We also find that the Gaussian steering is always asymmetric and the maximum steering asymmetry cannot exceed 2, which means the state never evolves to an extremal asymmetry state. Furthermore, we obtain the parameter settings that maximize steering asymmetry and find that (i) s=arccosh(^ 2 r/ 1 -^ 2 r) is the critical point of steering asymmetry, and (ii) the attainment of maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transition between one-way steerability and <b>both-way</b> steerability for the two-mode Gaussian state under the influence of Hawking radiation.

40|$|AbstractWe {{say that}} a square matrix over a ring with {{identity}} has the consecutive-column property if for all k, all its relevant submatrices having k consecutive rows and the first k columns are invertible. Similarly, the consecutive-row (CR) is defined. We show that, analogously to the commutative case for totally positive matrices, a matrix has both CC and CR properties {{if and only if}} it admits a certain Loewner-Neville-type factorization (with invertible entries); this factorization is unique. Since the result is proved for matrices in such generality, it holds also for block matrices over a field with all blocks square. Explicit <b>both-ways</b> formulae are found between two sets of parameters: the Loewner-Neville coefficients in the factorization and the Schur complements of relevant submatrices in relevant submatrices larger by one. We also show that for lower-triangular matrices, the CC property is preserved by inversion...|$|R
40|$|The goal of Indigenous {{children}} {{living on a}} community in the Tiwi Islands is neither {{to get an education}} nor to be employed – it is to get the  dole and remain trapped in a lifestyle of poverty and disadvantage. There is no notional idea of  breaking this cycle – more a resignation of its inevitability – the consequence being a  continuation of the less than acceptable educational, health, social and demographic indicators for  these children. Evidence clearly demonstrates that “being poor and unemployed statistically lowers self-esteem and increases illness, death and the likelihood of arrest and imprisonment just as poor  health and limited educational achievements affect employability”. The current paper articulates  some of the issues we identified when working with Indigenous people and proposes one option to challenge the status quo using an innovative, multi-cultural, <b>both-ways</b> program of communitydevelopment...|$|R
40|$|Health {{literacy}} {{is an important}} factor in the self management of diabetes. Furthermore, an informed partnership between health professionals and patients-as-consumers that is based on a <b>both-ways</b> or reciprocal knowing of each other's culturally constructed understanding of the disease has been found necessary. According to national statistics in Australia, diabetes among migrants has become a priority health issue (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007). Many reasons such as life style, inappropriate health care services, and barriers to accessing ambulatory health care services have been suggested for the increased incidence, complications and mortality rate from diabetes among the overseas born population in Australia (Dixon & Webbie, 2005). Since diabetes is a lifelong disease, patients require knowledge of both theoretical and practical self-management techniques to manage it in their everyday life. As health literacy has become a very recent concern for the Australian Health service system, and particularly for managing 'diabetes'; health literacy in general and diabetes literacy in particular requires further investigation among culturally and linguistically diverse individuals living with diabetes. This issue is explored through an analysis of adults as learners, multicultural health education and reciprocal knowing in the context of diabetes literacy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: – This paper {{continues}} {{investigation of}} systems of fuzzy interval logics {{based on the}} Checklist Paradigm semantics of Bandler and Kohout [5] [12]. While the early papers dealt with checklist paradigm based interval systems containing commutative AND and OR, this paper is the third in the series describing the system in which these connective types are non-commutative. While the commutative systems can be sufficiently characterized by an 8 -element group of transformations, the non-commutative require the symmetric 16 element group S 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. The paper starts with the overview of a non-commutative interval system generated from implication operators based on a measure m 2 of Bandler and Kohout by the group transformations provided by the group S 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. This system includes the well-known Goguen-Gaines implication operator (PLY) which is not contrapositive. Non-contrapositivity of PLY induces non-commutativity of AND and OR connec-tives under the group transformations. In this interval system, the non-commutative AND connectives residuate with implication operators only by one-sided residuation, either from the left or from the right. Putting the additional constraint, requiring the residuation <b>both-ways,</b> causes the collapse of an interval system into a point system of fuzzy logic. This collapse is investigated in some detail...|$|R
