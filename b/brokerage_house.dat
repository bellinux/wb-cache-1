5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York <b>brokerage</b> <b>house,</b> collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how sell-side equity research companies (<b>brokerage</b> <b>houses)</b> {{responded to the}} increased scrutiny of their equity research business regarding conflicts of interest between investment bank and research departments. This scrutiny materialized in new regulations adopted by the Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) NASD and NYSE – affecting all <b>brokerage</b> <b>houses</b> – and in the Global Settlement – affecting the big 10 <b>brokerage</b> <b>houses.</b> I find evidence of an overall change {{in the distribution of}} recommendations issued by <b>brokerage</b> <b>houses</b> after the new regulations took effect, in which they leaned towards less optimistic ratings. However, the big change is crosssectional, with the big 10 <b>brokerage</b> <b>houses</b> that were part of the Global Settlement aggressively downgrading recommendations, {{to the point where the}} distribution of their consensus recommendations after the regulations took effect became fairly symmetrical between optimistic and pessimistic ratings. More importantly, the results suggest that the regulations achieved their goal of curbing effects of conflicts of interest in how recommendations are issued. While in the pre-regulatory period underwriter recommendations were more likely to be optimistic, and this bias was only partially recognized by the market, after the regulations were adopted the underwriter status is no longer a determinant of optimism in recommendations...|$|R

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Grant's son Ulysses Jr. had opened a Wall Street <b>brokerage</b> <b>house</b> with Ferdinand Ward. Ward was {{regarded}} as a rising star and the firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful. In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money. To encourage investment, Ward paid investors abnormally high interest, by pledging the company's securities on multiple loans in a process called rehypothecation. Ward, in collusion with banker James D. Fish, kept secret from bank examiners, retrieved the firm's securities from the company's bank vault. When the trades went bad, multiple loans came due, all backed up by the same collateral. Historians agree that Grant was likely unaware of Ward's intentions, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew. In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward told Grant of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall. Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt, who gave him a personal loan of $150,000. Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it from failure. Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor, he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets. Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full. Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how he could ever [...] "trust any human being again." [...] In March 1885, as his health was failing, he testified against both Ward and Fish. Ward was convicted of fraud in October 1885, months after Grant's death, and served {{six and a half years}} in prison.|$|E
