5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material.

5|$|In December 1966, the AS-205 {{mission was}} canceled, since the {{validation}} of the CSM would <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft. Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew.|$|E
5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} {{has proven}} to be the more complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis with at least two generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} a still-standing {{track record}} of 1:59, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The {{successive}} quarter-mile times were :25, :24, :23, :23, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race.

5|$|Roosevelt was {{an ardent}} conservationist, {{assisted}} in this by like-minded appointees, including Interior Secretary James R. Garfield and Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot. Taft {{agreed with the}} need for conservation, but felt it should <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by legislation rather than executive order. He did not retain Garfield, an Ohioan, as secretary, choosing instead a westerner, former Seattle mayor Richard A. Ballinger. Roosevelt was surprised at the replacement, believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield, and this change was one of the events that caused Roosevelt to realize that Taft would choose different policies.|$|E
5|$|The German naval staff hoped {{all these}} changes could <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by April 1943, with the carrier's first sea trials {{taking place in}} August that year. Towards that end, Chief Engineer Wilhelm Hadeler was reassigned to oversee Graf Zeppelins completion. Hadeler planned on getting the two inner shafts and their {{respective}} propulsion systems operational first, giving the ship an initial speed of 2526 knots, fast enough for sea trials to commence and for conducting air training exercises. By the winter of 19431944 she {{was expected to be}} combat-ready.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{operating}} systems, Plan 9 {{does not provide}} special application programming interfaces (such as Berkeley sockets, X resources or ioctl system calls) to access devices. Instead, Plan 9 device drivers implement their control interface as a file system, so that the hardware can be accessed by the ordinary file input/output operations read and write. Consequently, sharing the device across the network can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by mounting the corresponding directory tree to the target machine.|$|E
