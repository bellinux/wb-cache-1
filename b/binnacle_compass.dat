50|$|Restoration has {{included}} replanking {{of parts of}} the hull on the starboard side, new hull frames, replacement of all decking, restoration of the original steering and the making and fitting of new deck steps and seating port and starboard. Aguila Wrens original port and starboard navigation lights and her steaming light were tracked down to an owner in New Zealand who had bought them when he lived near Keadby; they were subsequently reacquired by Aguila Wrens present owner and have been refitted to the boat after a round trip of around 23,000 miles to New Zealand and back. Interestingly the provisions and radio locker, the wheel and Kelvin-Hughes <b>binnacle</b> <b>compass</b> fitted to Aguila Wren {{as part of her}} restoration came from ON.881 City of Leeds, the lifeboat that Aguila Wren replaced at Redcar in 1965, with these parts being acquired in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|In 1913 Dr Bottomley became {{chairman}} of Kelvin & James White Ltd {{and the firm}} changed its name, becoming Kelvin Bottomley & Baird Ltd. Alfred Baird had been a compass adjuster with the firm since 1884. Kelvin, Bottomley and Baird Ltd manufactured Marine navigation equipment such as [...] "Kelvite" [...] <b>binnacle</b> <b>compasses</b> and sounding machines at the Kelvin Works, Hillington, Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|Sir William {{was raised}} to Peerage as Baron Kelvin of Largs in 1892. In 1899, Lord Kelvin {{resigned}} from his University chair and, in 1900 became a director in the newly formed private limited liability Company, Kelvin & James White Ltd, which acquired the business of James White. At the same time, Lord Kelvin's nephew, James Thomson Bottomley FRSE (1845-1926), joined the firm. The firm manufacture <b>binnacle</b> <b>compasses</b> and deep sea sounding machines, {{many of which were}} installed on the great ships built on Clyde side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pull, pull, my good boys," [...] said Starbuck, in {{the lowest}} {{possible}} but intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring <b>binnacle</b> <b>compasses.</b> He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only {{the silence of the}} boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.|$|R
50|$|On 25 October 1901, {{after leaving}} Suva, the mate, <b>binnacle</b> and <b>compass</b> {{were lost in}} 'large {{breaking}} seas'. Voss was now alone without a compass, 1200 mi from Sydney. Tilikum is {{claimed to be the}} smallest deep-water ship to have ever entered Sydney Harbour until this time.|$|R

60|$|Here, it must needs be said, that {{accidents}} {{like this}} have {{in more than}} one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be. In instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle. But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the <b>binnacle</b> <b>compasses</b> be affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.|$|R
5000|$|A {{lubber line}} is a fixed line on a <b>compass</b> <b>binnacle</b> or radar plan {{position}} indicator display pointing towards {{the front of the}} ship or aircraft [...] and corresponding to the craft's centerline (being the customary direction of movement).|$|R
50|$|A Flinders bar is a {{vertical}} soft iron bar {{placed in a}} tube on the fore side of a <b>compass</b> <b>binnacle.</b> The Flinders bar is used to counteract the vertical magnetism inherent within a ship and is usually calibrated {{as part of the}} process known as swinging the compass, where deviations caused by this inherent magnetism are negated by the use of horizontal (or quadrantal) correctors.|$|R
50|$|At first good {{progress}} was made down the coast and Lady Nelsons log reported the 'squadron in company' on 18 October. On 22 October Lady Nelson encountered 'strong gales with a heavy sea from south-west' that caused considerable damage including the boat, <b>binnacle</b> and two <b>compasses</b> being washed overboard; and the main sheet carrying away and breaking the tiller. The next day the fore keel {{was found to have}} been broken-off and Symons decided to head into Twofold Bay for shelter and to carry out repairs to the vessel.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} hot and nearly calm, and Marston, sitting on the cabin skylight, languidly looked about. A Krooboy held the wheel, and his dark figure cut against the {{phosphorescent}} sea. Columbine's bulwarks were low and when she rolled the long, smooth swell ran level with their top. A dim glow came from the <b>compass</b> <b>binnacle,</b> but the schooner was close-hauled and the Kroo steered by the faint strain on the helm. The wind was light and baffling and Columbine beat against it as she worked along the coast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't wrecked just then. In fact, I {{made her}} snug, with two reefs in the mainsail, and I lighted the <b>compass</b> <b>binnacle.</b> The trouble {{was that the}} wind was drawing ahead and the night had turned very dark. I couldn't {{get a glimpse of}} the coast, and it wouldn't have been wise to run back yet. There's a light on Hestan Island, but I wouldn't have found water enough across the sands in Rough Firth. She'd have gone down at her anchor if I'd brought up to wait.|$|R
2500|$|Gardiner {{states that}} few parts of either ship bore the name, {{other than the}} easily removed lifeboats, bell, <b>compass</b> <b>binnacle,</b> and name plates. [...] Everything else was {{standard}} White Star issue and was interchangeable between the two ships, and other vessels in the White Star fleet. While all other White Star Line Ships had their name engraved into the hull, the Titanic alone had its name riveted over top. In recent pictures of the wreck depicting a spot where two riveted plates that had spelled Titanic fell off, the letters MP appear to be stamped into the hull.|$|R
50|$|Barnegat fitted {{out at the}} New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, and was detailed, on 20 November 1917, to {{accompany}} the armed yacht Nokomis (Id. No. 609) to the Azores, towing submarine chasers. Dispatch traffic, however, indicates difficulties in finding certain items of equipment to be installed on board, the Commander, Naval Station, New York, informing the Navy Department that Barnegat and Montauk (Id.No.1213) still needed <b>binnacles</b> and standard <b>compasses</b> as of 11 December, but prognosticated that both ships {{would be ready to}} sail on the 12th. Barnegat ultimately departed New York City for the Philadelphia Navy Yard, there to complete preparations “for distant service” and thence to await onward routing.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the gray}} light came on, anxiously we {{scrutinized}} {{the features of}} the craft, as one by one they became more plainly revealed. Every thing seemed stranger now, than when partially visible in the dingy night. The stanchions, or posts of the bulwarks, were of rough stakes, still incased in the bark. The unpainted sides were of a dark-colored, heathenish looking wood. The tiller was a wry-necked, elbowed bough, thrusting itself through the deck, as if the tree itself was fast rooted in the hold. The <b>binnacle,</b> containing the <b>compass,</b> was defended at the sides by yellow matting. The rigging-- shrouds, halyards and all--was of [...] "Kaiar," [...] or cocoa-nut fibres; and here and there the sails were patched with plaited rushes.|$|R
50|$|The Overchurch {{was given}} her major refit in 1998 at Lengthline Ship Repairers in Manchester, which {{resulted}} in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment. She was renamed Royal Daffodil and returned to service in 1999. Mountwood and Woodchurch were also refitted and renamed Royal Iris of the Mersey and Snowdrop, respectively in 2002 and 2004. The ferries were re-designed by their original architects - Graham and Woolnough. When all three vessels were refitted, the previously used helms and <b>binnacles</b> with <b>compasses</b> were placed back on the refurbished bridges. Other equipment, such as the telegraphs, were put in storage in the Mersey Ferries' archives. The fleet of three have served the river for nearly five decades and 2009 saw the 50th birthdays of the Royal Iris of the Mersey and the Snowdrop. This is remarkable for a ship to be in service for nearly 50 years and shows the dedication and care taken by the ferries' staff over the years to keep the boats in the conditions they can be found today. The refitting of the ferries has extended their working lives by approximately thirty years, and this is steadily increasing with additional repairs that are carried out on the boats on a regular basis.|$|R
40|$|Lord Kelvin {{will remain}} a {{significant}} historical figure {{on account of his}} distinguished career and achievements, but many physical monuments also honour his life, mainly in Belfast and Glasgow. The first major one to be erected was the statue in Belfast’s Botanic Gardens, dedicated in 1913 by fellow Ulster scientist, Sir Joseph Larmor MP [1], Figs 1 and 2 (left). Larmor was a most appropriate choice for guest of honour having also attended the Belfast Academical Institution in the mid-nineteenth century and been a strong opponent of Home Rule. This statue, near the rear of Queen’s University’s Department of Pure and Applied Physics, shows Kelvin standing beside a <b>compass</b> <b>binnacle</b> and holding a tablet, possibly representing his ‘green book’. The epitaph on the rear of the plinth could serve as a one sentence biography – ‘pre-eminent in elucidating the laws of nature and applying them to the service of man’...|$|R
60|$|As the Revenge sailed on over sunny seas {{or under}} {{lowering}} clouds, Dickory was {{no stranger to}} the <b>binnacle,</b> and the <b>compass</b> always told him that they were sailing eastward. He had once asked Blackbeard where they now were by the chart, but that gracious gentleman of the midnight beard had given him oaths for answers, and had told him that if the captain knew where the ship was on any particular hour or minute nobody else on that ship need trouble his head about it. But at last the course of the Revenge was changed a little, and she sailed northward. Then Dickory spoke with one of the mildest of the mates upon the subject of their progress, and the man made known to him that they were now about half-way through the Windward passage. Dickory started back. He knew something of the geography of those seas.|$|R
2500|$|At sea, a ship's compass {{must also}} be {{corrected}} for errors, called deviation, caused by iron and steel in its structure and equipment. The ship is swung, that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore. A compass deviation card is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings. The compass can be corrected in three ways. First the lubber line can be adjusted {{so that it is}} aligned with the direction in which the ship travels, then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass. The effect of ferromagnetic materials in the compass's environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted {{on either side of the}} <b>compass</b> <b>binnacle.</b> The coefficient [...] representing the error in the lubber line, while [...] the ferromagnetic effects and [...] the non-ferromagnetic component.|$|R
60|$|The boats landed this evening, {{when the}} artificers had again two hours' work. The weather still {{continuing}} very thick and foggy, more difficulty was experienced in getting on {{board of the}} vessels to-night than had occurred on any previous occasion, owing to a light breeze of wind which carried {{the sound of the}} bell, and the other signals made on board of the vessels, away from the rock. Having fortunately made out the position of the sloop Smeaton at the N.E. buoy--to which we were much assisted by the barking of the ship's dog,--we parted with the Smeaton's boat, when the boats of the tender took a fresh departure for that vessel, which lay about half a mile to the south-westward. Yet such is the very deceiving state of the tides, that, although there was a small <b>binnacle</b> and <b>compass</b> in the landing-master's boat, we had, nevertheless, passed the Sir Joseph a good way, when, fortunately, one of the sailors catched the sound of a blowing-horn. The only firearms on board were a pair of swivels of one-inch calibre; but it is quite surprising how much the sound is lost in foggy weather, as the report was heard but at a very short distance. The sound from the explosion of gunpowder is so instantaneous that the effect of the small guns was not so good as either the blowing of a horn or the tolling of a bell, which afforded a more constant and steady direction for the pilot.|$|R
60|$|And here I {{may as well}} state, that I {{never saw}} {{the inside of the}} cabin during the whole {{interval}} that elapsed from our sailing till our return to New York; though I often used to get a peep at it through a little pane of glass, set in the house on deck, just before the helm, where a watch was kept hanging for the helmsman to strike the half hours by, with his little bell in the <b>binnacle,</b> where the <b>compass</b> was. And it used to be the great amusement of the sailors to look in through the pane of glass, when they stood at the wheel, and watch the proceedings in the cabin; especially when the steward was setting the table for dinner, or the captain was lounging over a decanter of wine on a little mahogany stand, or playing the game called solitaire, at cards, of an evening; for at times he was all alone with his dignity; though, as will ere long be shown, he generally had one pleasant companion, whose society he did not dislike.|$|R
6000|$|It was an {{interesting}} kingdom in detail. Leaving out of view all that which was behind him, and which, of course, he could not see, we may remark that, just before him stood the <b>binnacle</b> and <b>compass,</b> and the cabin skylight. On his right and left {{the territory of the}} quarter-deck was seriously circumscribed, and the promenade much interfered with, by the ship's boats, which, like their parent, were painted red, and which did not hang at the davits, but, like young lobsters of the kangaroo type, found shelter within their mother, when not at sea on their own account. Near to them were two signal-carronades. Beyond the skylight rose the bright brass funnel of the cabin chimney, and the winch, by means of which the lantern was hoisted. Then came another skylight, and the companion-hatch about the centre of the deck. Just beyond this stood {{the most important part of}} the vessel--the lantern-house. This was a circular wooden structure, above six feet in diameter, with a door and small windows. Inside was the lantern--the beautiful piece of costly mechanism for which the light-ship, its crew, and its appurtenances were maintained. Right through the centre of this house rose the thick unyielding mast of the vessel. The lantern, which was just a little less than its house, surrounded this mast and travelled upon it. Beyond this the capital of the kingdom, the eye of the monarch was arrested by another bright brass funnel, which was the chimney of the galley-fire, and indicated the exact position of the abode of the crew, or--to continue our metaphor--the populace, who, however, required no such indicator to tell of their existence or locality, for the chorus of a [...] "nigger" [...] melody burst from them, ever and anon, through every opening in the decks, with jovial violence, as they sat, busily engaged on various pieces of work below. The more remote parts of this landscape--or light-scape, if we may be allowed the expression--were filled up with the galley-skylight, the bitts, and the windlass, above which towered the gong, and around which twined the two enormous chain cables. Only one of these, however, was in use--that, with a single mushroom-anchor, being sufficient to hold the ship securely against tide and tempest.|$|R
