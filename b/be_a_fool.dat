25|$|In 1912 Barnes's family, facing {{financial}} ruin, split up. Elizabeth {{moved to}} New York City with Barnes {{and three of}} her brothers, then filed for divorce, freeing Wald to marry Fanny Clark. The move gave Barnes an opportunity to study art formally for the first time; she attended the Pratt Institute for about six months, but the need to support herself and her family—a burden that fell largely on her—soon drove her to leave school and take {{a job as a}} reporter at the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Upon arriving at the Daily Eagle, Barnes declared, “I can draw and write, and you’d <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> not to hire me”, words that were inscribed inside the Brooklyn Museum.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool,</b> and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E
500|$|Abrams's {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the film Altered States, films by David Cronenberg, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. Orci stated that Fringe is a [...] "new kind of storytelling", combining procedural shows such as Law & Order, and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series like Lost. The procedural aspect was chosen because, {{at the time of its}} premiere, six of the ten top shows were procedural in nature; Orci stated that [...] "you have to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> not to go study what it is that they're doing". Abrams had originally considered naming the series The Lab, as they had envisioned Walter's laboratory to be [...] "the epicenter of the conversation", and where [...] "anything is possible".|$|E

She and Sam had a one night stand in episode [...] "The Borders of Sleep", {{and went on to}} become close friends, with Maddy assisting Sam in caring for a teenage prostitute he felt responsible for. She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any man would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> to turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E

Louis Bedigian of GameZone wrote a positive review, saying that [...] "any Crash Bandicoot fan would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> not {{to go out and}} buy this game. I started playing at 2am one night and did not stop until three in the afternoon!" [...] Doug Perry of IGN described the game as [...] "a decent-playing and pretty-looking Crash Bandicoot game. It's nothing terribly special, but it's not bad, not bad at all." [...] Official US PlayStation Magazine felt that [...] "when the strongest feeling I get from a game is the desire to play its predecessors, something's not quite right." [...] Game Informer criticized the [...] "outrageously bad load times", saying that they [...] "keep the game from being average." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro cautioned that [...] "if you were hoping the new management would give Crash a big kick in the pants, however, this is one pair of pants you will find quite unkicked."

Not being selfish. I was just that geeked about it. It was an experience out of this world... It's amazing to know that five years ago I was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now I'm writing for Michael Jackson... I'd <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> not to say it's a dream come true." [...] Jackson contacted Kelly to see if he had any material available. Kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and Jackson then agreed to work with Kelly on the piece.

500|$|Introduced as a Lothario-type character, {{according}} to Anderson, Oliver [...] "had {{a reputation for}} being the hospital bike." [...] His first relationship developed when he attracted the attention of ward sisters Chrissie Williams and Daisha Anderson. Daisha showed less interest in him than Chrissie, of whose attentiveness Anderson said, [...] "I think any hot-blooded male would find that attractive". Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis – though Anderson noted, [...] "he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake". This left Chrissie free to pursue Oliver. Before their relationship began, Anderson opined [...] "She's gorgeous, and Oliver would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> not to go out with her." [...] He thought that Oliver and Chrissie's [...] "unflappable" [...] natures made them a good fit for one another, though wondered if they were too alike. As an older woman, their relationship was described as a [...] "toyboy storyline" [...] for Chrissie. Hobley admitted to having fun with the storyline due to the real age gap between herself and Anderson. She described Chrissie's feelings for Oliver, stating: [...] "Chrissie is {{having a lot of fun}} with him. But deep down she's really hoping to find true love – she's been quite unlucky so far. She's not getting any younger and she's worried about missing out on kids."

500|$|... "Nothin' on You" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Billboards Evan J.

[...] He {{compared it to}} Lupe Fiasco's duet with Matthew Santos' [...] "Superstar" [...] (2007), [...] "especially its feel-good, singalong hook". The review concluded with positive feedback for the recording's lyrics and references. The same rating was give by Nick Levine of Digital Spy. He called the track a [...] "smash" [...] and praised its piano and hook. Levine concluded that although it doesn't show the same class as [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) by Jay Z and Alicia Keys, [...] "it's all so goddamn catchy you'd <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> to give a hoot." [...] Lee Tyler from Blues & Souls awarded the single 8 out of 10 stars, calling it a [...] "delight" [...] from its beginning until the end. He said [...] "Whilst not being content to just please the ear... seems to laden with instant charisma, stopping only to refresh the parts others cannot reach of late". Tyler opined that it wouldn't surprise him if Gym Class Heroes sang the track, [...] "is sweet in it's up lifting melody, while giving the rapper {{plenty of room to}} flex his prowess." [...] Richard of DJBooth enhanced the way B.o.B. [...] "drops lovestruck bars as agile as they are flattering," [...] and the [...] "silky-smooth bridge and chorus" [...] Mars uses to seduce [...] "the woman in question". Angus Batey thought the song would have stuck out in 2010, even without B.o.B's verses, since is a clear departure from the [...] "in-the-club, eyeing-up-the-booty cliches that have come to pass for romance in hip-hop".|$|E

2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing.

The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness.
