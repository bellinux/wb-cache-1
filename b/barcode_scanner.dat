25|$|Barcode {{scanners}} can {{be classified}} into three categories based on their connection to the computer. The older type is the RS-232 <b>barcode</b> <b>scanner.</b> This type requires special programming for transferring the input data to the application program.|$|E
25|$|Many {{phones are}} able to decode {{barcodes}} using their built-in camera, as well. Google's mobile Android operating system uses both their own Google Goggles application or third party barcode scanners like Scan. Nokia's Symbian operating system features a <b>barcode</b> <b>scanner,</b> while mbarcode is a QR code reader for the Maemo operating system. In Apple iOS 11, the native camera app can decode QR Codes and can link to URLs, join wireless networks, or perform other operations depending on the QR Code contents. Other paid and free apps are available with scanning capabilities for other symbologies or for earlier iOS versions. With BlackBerry devices, the App World application can natively scan barcodes and load any recognized Web URLs on the device's Web browser. Windows Phone 7.5 is able to scan barcodes through the Bing search app. However, these devices are not designed specifically for the capturing of barcodes. As a result, they do not decode nearly as quickly or accurately as a dedicated <b>barcode</b> <b>scanner</b> or portable data terminal.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{experience}} with barcode scanning in those stores revealed additional benefits. The detailed sales information {{acquired by the}} new systems allowed greater responsiveness to customer habits, needs and preferences. This {{was reflected in the}} fact that about 5 weeks after installing barcode scanners, sales in grocery stores typically started climbing and eventually leveled off at a 10–12% increase in sales that never dropped off. There was also a 1–2% decrease in operating cost for those stores, and this enabled them to lower prices and thereby to increase market share. It was shown in the field that the return on investment for a <b>barcode</b> <b>scanner</b> was 41.5%. By 1980, 8,000 stores per year were converting.|$|E
25|$|Waitrose {{offers a}} {{self-service}} system known as 'Quick Check'. Customers must register {{as a member}} of myWaitrose, and then insert their myWaitrose card. They are then automatically issued with a hand-held PDA with built-in <b>barcode</b> <b>scanner,</b> allowing them to scan and pack items as they are taken from the shelf. Loose items from the fresh produce and bakery departments can be weighed at self-service scales, producing a barcode label which can then be scanned. The customer then pays for their shopping at a dedicated self-service checkout by scanning a terminating barcode and recalling the transaction by swiping their registered card. A Partner is summoned when necessary in order to authorise the customer's age for age-restricted items and to help scan any problematic items. The customer can then pay as they would normally.|$|E
500|$|Carphone Warehouse staff {{nominated}} around 1,000 apps {{from which}} a panel of judges produced a shortlist of 50, announced by Hammond in February 2011. In an online process, about 30,000 votes were cast by the public to choose the winners. Most of the shortlisted apps are free to download but others require a one-off or an ongoing payment. Finland-based Rovio Mobile's 2009 game Angry Birds, which recently passed the 100-million download mark, won the award for Best App of the Year along with a win in the Best Game App category and a nomination in the Best Time Waster App category. [...] Lima Sky's Doodle Jump, which topped 10 million downloads in March 2011, was nominated in both the Best Game App and Best Time Waster App categories but failed to win either. [...] Similarly Shop Savvy <b>Barcode</b> <b>Scanner</b> and Football Manager Handheld 2011 were nominated in two categories, both failing to win an award.

2500|$|The first working laser was {{demonstrated}} on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories. When first invented, {{they were called}} [...] "a solution looking for a problem". Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in {{the daily lives of}} the general population was the supermarket <b>barcode</b> <b>scanner,</b> introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storage devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers. Lasers are used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), and lidar. Lasers are also used in holograms, bubblegrams, laser light shows, and laser hair removal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Barcode</b> <b>scanners</b> were {{introduced}} in the 1970 s {{as a way to}} reduce labor costs in stores, particularly at checkout. This paper is the first to estimate their effect on productivity. I use store-level data from the 1972, 1977, and 1982 Census of Retail Trade, matched to data on store scanner installations, to estimate scanners' effect on labor productivity. I find that early scanners increased a store's labor productivity, on average, by approximately 4. 5 percent in the first few years, with a larger effect in stores carrying more packaged products likely to bear barcodes. Setup costs significantly offset the short-run productivity effect. <b>Barcode</b> <b>scanners,</b> Retail, Supermarkets, Technology, Productivity...|$|R
