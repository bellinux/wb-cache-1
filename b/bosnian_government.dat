5|$|During the Siege of Sarajevo, Igman {{became part}} of the buffer zone between the belligerents of the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> and the Army of Republika Srpska. The area around the ski jumping hill saw heavy {{fighting}} during the civil war and was also used for executions by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Since, the structures have been littered with bullet holes. With the war, the hills were no longer able to be used.|$|E
5|$|In late September, Izetbegović and Tuđman {{met again}} and {{attempted}} to create military coordination against the VRS, but to no avail. By October, the agreement had collapsed and afterwards Croatia diverted delivery of weaponry to Bosnia and Herzegovina by seizing a significant amount for itself. Boban had abandoned a <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> alliance and ceased all hostilities with Karadžić. The dominant Croatian–Bosnian defense of Posavina fell apart after Tuđman and/or Gojko Šušak ordered {{the withdrawal of the}} Croatian Army (HV), enabling the Serbs to gain control of the corridor and connect their captured territories in western and eastern Bosnia. On 8 October, the town of Bosanski Brod was abandoned by the HVO and left to the VRS. By that time, the HV and the HVO had sustained approximately 7,500 casualties, out of 20,000 troops committed to the battle to control Posavina. The pullout appeared to be a quid pro quo for the JNA withdrawal from Dubrovnik's hinterland that took place in July. Still, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements. On 9 October, the HVO signed a cease-fire with the VRS in Jajce in exchange for providing electricity.|$|E

The firm engaged in {{lobbying}} efforts for, among others, the Turkish, Israeli and <b>Bosnian</b> <b>governments,</b> in addition to representing defense corporations Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Feith left the firm in 2001, following his nomination as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 November 2004, the {{government}} of Republika Srpska issued an official apology. The statement came after a government review of the Srebrenica commission's report. [...] "The report {{makes it clear that}} enormous crimes were committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995. The <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>Government</b> shares the pain of the families of the Srebrenica victims, is truly sorry and apologises for the tragedy", the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>government</b> said.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2011 it was clear the planned January launch would be postponed as Milić was finishing up at HRT with a rousing sendoff following his final Dnevnik newscast. The veteran broadcaster soon moved to Sarajevo, marking his professional return to the city having previously worked there from 1990 until 1992, first as part of Yutel and later as the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> spokesperson in the initial months of the Bosnian War.|$|R
25|$|Reactions {{came from}} the Bosniak {{dominated}} government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and organisations which support his innocence. The <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> saw this as an attack by Serbia to cause tensions {{a month before the}} 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
25|$|The Ahmići {{massacre}} was {{the culmination}} of the Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing committed by the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia's political and military leadership on Bosniak civilians during the Croat-Bosniak War in April 1993. It was the largest massacre committed during the conflict between Bosnian Croats and the Bosniak-dominated <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|The September 1991 leak alarmed the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government,</b> which {{decided to}} {{proclaim}} independence on 15 October. At {{the time the}} Croatian War of Independence was in full swing, and Serbian actions in Bosnia mirrored those of the Serbs in Croatia. In December 1991, Marković resigned in protest against the excessive use of the Yugoslav budget on military spending which was dedicated 86 percent.|$|E

50|$|The Croatian and <b>Bosnian</b> <b>governments</b> are {{planning}} to build an expressway that would connect Dubrovnik through the Neum municipality and would not require any border control.

500|$|In 2004, a {{mass grave}} located a few hundred meters from the Omarska site was {{unearthed}} containing the remains of 456 persons from the camp. [...] "There is no doubt whatsoever that {{there are hundreds of}} bodies as yet unfound within the mine of Omarska and its vicinity" [...] said Amor Mašović, president of the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> Commission for Tracing Missing Persons. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has been active in advocating the exhumation and identification of their bodies from mass graves around the area; with their help, a number of victims have been identified through DNA testing.|$|R
25|$|On 15 April, Bosnian MUP and TO {{seized the}} arms, {{ammunition}} and equipment of the Tuzla Regional TO {{in the towns}} of Srebrenik, Lukavac and in Tuzla itself. By {{the end of the}} month, the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Government</b> had re-organised the Bosnia and Herzegovina TO, incorporating the troops of the Patriotic League. In total, the new force had around 100,000 men, but only about 40,000–50,000 small arms and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent example}} of a consociational {{government}} is the post-conflict <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> that was agreed upon in the Dayton Accords in 1995. A tripartite presidency was chosen and must have a Croat, a Serb, and a Bosniak. The presidents take turns acting as the forefront executive in terms of 8 months for 4 years. Many have credited this compromise of a consociational government in Bosnia {{for the end of}} the violence and the following long-lasting peace.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) judged {{that the}} 1995 Srebrenica {{massacre}} {{was an act}} of genocide. On 26 February 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in the Bosnian Genocide Case upheld the ICTY's earlier finding that the massacre in Srebrenica and Zepa constituted genocide, but found that the Serbian government had not participated in a wider genocide on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, as the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> had claimed.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{position}} taken by the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>government,</b> the Yugoslav Federation (Serbia and Montenegro) itself {{had to take a}} strong stance against the Bosnian Serb entity. This led to the quasi-complete diplomatic isolation of the Bosnian Serb entity.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Srebrenica and Žepa {{enclaves}} in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, Croatia started massing soldiers near Serb positions outside the enclave as Serb forces with tanks and artillery bombarded the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> lines. The goal was to prevent {{the fall of}} the Bihać enclave. Likewise, the Croatian and Bosnian leaderships signed a mutual defence treaty - the Split Agreement. The siege ended with Operation Storm on 4-5 August 1995 conjoined with Bosnian forces under General Atif Dudaković. Dudaković said: [...] "We needed Operation Storm as much as Croatia did". After the end of siege, food supplies and medical aid started arriving in the area from Bosnia and Croatia, which normalized {{the lives of the people}} living there.|$|R
5000|$|... — British Foreign Secretary William Hague demands {{stagnation}} in <b>Bosnian</b> {{politics and}} <b>government</b> {{to come to}} an end, stating [...] "What happened in Bosnia is a wake-up call.

25|$|On 10–11 April 1994, UNPROFOR {{called in}} air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde safe area, {{resulting}} in the bombing of a Serbian military command outpost near Goražde by 2 US F-16 jets. This {{was the first time}} in NATO's history it had ever done so. This resulted in the taking of 150 U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April. On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. On 15 April the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> lines around Goražde broke.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Agreement {{ended the}} war between Croats and Bosniaks and divided the {{combined}} territory held by Croat and <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> forces into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This reduced the warring parties to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), and the Republika Srpska in the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS).|$|E
25|$|The first {{massacre}} {{occurred between}} 12:10 and 12:15 PM, on 5 February 1994, when a 120 millimeter mortar shell {{landed in the}} center of the crowded marketplace. Republika Srpska authorities denied all responsibility and accused the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> of bombarding its own people to incite international outrage and NATO intervention. Rescue workers and United Nations (UN) personnel rushed to help the numerous civilian casualties, while footage of the event soon made news reports across the world. Controversy over the event started when an initial UNPROFOR report claimed that the shell was fired from <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> positions. General Michael Rose, the British head of UNPROFOR, revealed in his memoirs that three days after the blast he told General Jovan Divjak, the deputy commander of ARBiH forces, that the shell had been fired from Bosnian positions. A later and more in-depth UNPROFOR report noted a calculation error in the original findings. With the error corrected, the United Nations concluded that it was impossible to determine which side had fired the shell. In December 2003, the ICTY Trial Chamber in the trial against Stanislav Galić, a Serb general in the siege of Sarajevo (for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity), concluded that the massacre was committed by Serb forces around Sarajevo.|$|E
5000|$|On 14 January 2009 it was {{reported}} that Ali Ahmed Ali Hamad was seeking asylum in Serbia.

The {{aim of this study}} is to try to provide experiences and attitudes of one not a new, but definitely one constantly changing phenomenon, trafficking in women for sexual exploitation. The qualitative data is mainly collected through nine interviews with people from <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Governments,</b> International organizations and NGOs during my stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The causes to trafficking are complex and intertwined but it directly relates to gender discrimination and attitudes on sexual relationships between women and men.

25|$|In the {{independence}} referendum {{sponsored by the}} <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> was held on 29 February and 1 March 1992. That referendum was in turn declared contrary to the Bosnian and federal constitution by the federal Constitution Court and the newly established Bosnian Serb government; it was also largely boycotted by the Bosnian Serbs. According to the official results, the turnout was 63.4%, and 99.7% of the voters voted for independence. It was unclear what the two-thirds majority requirement actually meant and whether it was satisfied.|$|E
25|$|In Travnik, he {{established}} a Divan, a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government.</b> Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement. He gained {{a reputation as a}} hero and a strong, brave, and decisive ruler. One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. God I fear slightly, Gradaščević replied, the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.|$|E
25|$|When Bosnia and Herzegovina {{declared}} {{independence from}} Yugoslavia and achieved United Nations recognition, Serbian leaders declared a new Serbian national state Republika Srpska (RS) which was carved {{out from the}} territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Serbian Army encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18,000 stationed in the surrounding hills, from which they assaulted the city with artillery, mortars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine-guns, multiple rocket launchers, rocket-launched aircraft bombs, and sniper rifles. From 2 May 1992, the Serbs blockaded the city. The <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> defence forces inside the besieged city were poorly equipped and unable to break the siege.|$|E
5000|$|The {{military}} {{effectiveness of}} the mujahideen is disputed. However, former U.S. Balkans peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke {{said in an interview}} that he thought [...] "the Muslims wouldn't have survived without this" [...] help, as at the time a U.N. arms embargo diminished the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government's</b> fighting capabilities. In 2001, Holbrooke called the arrival of the mujahideen [...] "a pact with the devil" [...] from which Bosnia still is recovering. On the other hand, according to general Stjepan Šiber, the highest ranking ethnic Croat in the Bosnian Army, the key role in foreign volunteers arrival was played by Tuđman and Croatian counter-intelligence with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in the Bosnian War and the crimes committed by Croat forces. Although the Bosnian President Alija Izetbegović regarded them as symbolically valuable as a sign of the Muslim world's support for Bosnia, they appear to have made little military difference and became a major political liability.|$|R
2500|$|During {{his time}} on Mt. Igman, Prazina had {{established}} formal ties with the HVO through Bosnian Croat warlord Mladen [...] "Tuta" [...] Naletilić and, following the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government’s</b> decision to relieve him of his ARBiH commands, aligned himself with Naletilić's “Convicts Battalion” paramilitary unit. Not content with {{this state of affairs}} and wishing to fight under a recognized army, Prazina asked to be formally incorporated into the HVO on 14 December. Initially the HVO denied his request by stating that they had nothing to gain from having a presence on Igman, but by the latter half of his stay on the mountain his eventual transfer to the HVO was considered imminent. In trying to convince his closest officers to join him on Igman he had revealed his intentions of joining the HVO and their willingness to accept him; revelations which played a role in their refusal to follow him. Despite this lack of support from his former comrades, the consequences of his defeat at the hands of Zuka and the ARBiH made HVO held territory in Herzegovina a logical destination for Prazina.|$|R
500|$|The Republika Srpska {{government}} subsequently disowned {{the report}} with Prime Minister Ivanić {{saying that it}} was an [...] "unfinished version" [...] and [...] "not an attitude of the government of Republika Srpska."

25|$|As {{the joint}} AFBiH began to develop, troops {{began to be}} sent abroad. Bosnia and Herzegovina {{deployed}} a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel {{as part of the}} Multinational force in Iraq. The unit was first deployed to Fallujah, then Talil Air Base, and is now located at Camp Echo. In December 2006, the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th Infantry Division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard Camp Victory in Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|The HVO {{took over}} {{the west side of}} the city and {{expelled}} thousands of Bosniaks to the east side. The HVO shelling reduced much of the east side of Mostar to rubble. In 1992, JNA demolished Carinski Bridge, Titov Bridge and Lucki Bridge over the river, and, in 1993, HVO demolished the Stari Most. HVO forces (and its smaller divisions) engaged in a mass execution, ethnic cleansing and rape on the Bosniak people of the West Mostar and its surroundings and a fierce siege and shelling campaign on the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Government</b> run East Mostar. HVO campaign resulted in thousands of injured and killed.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1992, the UN {{responded to}} Serbian offensives {{in the former}} Yugoslav {{republic}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina by declaring a full embargo on trade with Serbia by all member nations. The sanctions placed Greece, which had recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly after its declaration in 1992, in a difficult position. Serbia was an important trading partner with strong religious and historical ties to Greece, and Serbia had initially supported the Greek position on the Macedonia naming dispute. Beginning in 1992, the Konstantinos Mitsotakis and Andreas Papandreou governments, fearing that the Bosnian war would spread {{in a direction that}} would involve Turkey, Albania and Greece, undertook long series of peace-negotiations with Serbia's president, Slobodan Milošević, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, and the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government</b> without results. Meanwhile, food, oil, and arms were reported moving from Greece into Serbia in violation of the UN embargo. Before, during, and after its 1994 presidency of the EU, Greece was the only EU nation to back the Serbian position that Serbian forces had entered Bosnian territory. In early 1994, Greece incurred the displeasure of its European allies by voting against NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. Greece also refused the use of its NATO air bases at Preveza on the Ionian Sea for such attacks and refused to supply Greek troops to the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. In NATO, Greece's position was diametrically opposed to that of Turkey, which supported the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (Autonomna Pokrajina Zapadna Bosna) {{was a small}} unrecognised {{state that}} existed in the {{northwest}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1993 and 1995. It consisted of the town of Velika Kladuša (its capital) and a few nearby villages. It was proclaimed as a result of secessionist politics by Fikret Abdić against the <b>Bosnian</b> central <b>government</b> during the <b>Bosnian</b> War. For a short time in 1995 it was known as the Republic of Western Bosnia.|$|R
50|$|Operation Spider (Serbian: Операција Паук, Operacija Pauk) was a {{combined}} effort by Republika Srpska and the Republic of Serb Krajina {{to recover the}} territory of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, which was a key ally of the Serbs.

The operation ended in a Serb victory and the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia remained in existence until the fall of its key ally the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the subsequent end of the war.|$|R
50|$|To avoid this, he and Milošević {{decided to}} move all JNA {{soldiers}} originating from Serbia and Montenegro back into Serbia and Montenegro, and to move all JNA soldiers originating from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this way, every Bosnian Serb was transferred from the Yugoslav army to what became the newly created Bosnian Serb Army. In the film, Jović revealed that Yugoslavia promised to pay all the costs, as the <b>Bosnian</b> Serb <b>government</b> could not afford the costs on its own.|$|R
