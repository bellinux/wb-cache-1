5|$|Much of South Dakota, {{with the}} notable {{exception}} of the Black Hills, is dominated by a temperate grasslands <b>biome.</b> Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts. In open, uncultivated areas of the plains, grasses such as buffalograss, western wheatgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem and little bluestem thrive.|$|E
40|$|The long-standing {{tradition}} of classifying South Africa's biogeographical area into <b>biomes</b> is commonly linked to vegetation structure and climate. Because arthropod communities are often governed by both these factors, {{it can be}} expected that arthropod communities would fit the <b>biomes.</b> To test this hypothesis, we considered how well arthropod species assemblages fit South Africa's grassy <b>biomes.</b> Arthropod assemblages were sampled from six localities across the grassland and savanna <b>biomes</b> by means of suction sampling, {{to determine whether the}} two <b>biomes</b> have distinctive arthropod assemblages. Arthropod samples of these <b>biomes</b> clustered separately in multidimensional scaling analyses. Within <b>biomes,</b> arthropod assemblages were more distinctive for savanna localities than grassland. Arthropod samples of the two <b>biomes</b> clustered together when trophic groups were considered separately, suggesting some similarity in functional assemblages. Dissimilarity was greatest between <b>biomes</b> for phytophagous and predacious trophic groups, with most pronounced differentiation between <b>biomes</b> at sub-escarpment localities. Our results indicate that different arthropod assemblages do fit the grassy <b>biomes</b> to some extent, but the pattern is not as clear as it is for plant species...|$|R
50|$|The Indianapolis Zoo is {{organized}} around the concept of <b>biomes.</b> <b>Biomes</b> are areas of the planet with similar climate, plants, and animals.

5000|$|Our {{biosphere}} {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} <b>biomes,</b> inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna. On land, <b>biomes</b> are separated primarily by latitude. Terrestrial <b>biomes</b> lying within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles are relatively barren of plant and animal life, while most of the more populous <b>biomes</b> lie near the equator.|$|R
5|$|Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain cannot fall. As a result, {{very cold}} climates see very little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts. A common <b>biome</b> {{in this area is}} the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no rain at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.|$|E
5|$|Sangay {{is one of}} two active volcanoes {{located within}} the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's {{isolation}} has allowed it to maintain a pristine ecology relatively untouched by human interaction, and the park hosts a <b>biome</b> ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their <b>biome</b> ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the response of}} the Earth <b>biomes</b> to drought using a new global dataset that captures drought effects on vegetation at various time scales. We show that arid and humid <b>biomes</b> are both affected by drought, and that the time scale on which droughts most intensively affects vegetation {{plays a key role in}} determining the sensitivity of <b>biomes</b> to drought. Arid <b>biomes</b> respond to drought at short time scales because plants have mechanisms allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing water availability. Humid <b>biomes</b> also respond to drought at short time scales, probably because there plant species show a poor adaptability to water shortage. Sub-humid <b>biomes</b> respond to drought at long time scales because plants are adapted to withstand water deficit, but they lack the rapid post-drought recovery observed in arid <b>biomes.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Southwestern Africa {{contains}} diverse <b>biomes.</b> The {{amount of}} the annual precipitation of this area has been traditionally {{thought to be the}} most important controlling factor to the differentiation of the <b>biomes.</b> However, this territory experiences the summer rain type and winter rain type. Those two different precipitation patterns should result in the different mechanisms to control the distribution of the <b>biomes.</b> This study intends to clarify the relationships between the distribution of the <b>biomes</b> and the summer rain type and winter rain type, knowing the vegetation structure in terms of the growth forms of the dominant plants. Studies were conducted in the area southwestern Africa, including major <b>biomes</b> of the southern Africa. Grassland, Nama-karoo and Savanna appear in the area with the summer rain type. Both of Succulent karoo and Fynbos appear in the area with the winter precipitation type. The amount of winter precipitation of those two <b>biomes</b> is much higher than that of the other tree <b>biomes.</b> This higher amount of winter precipitation encourages the dominance of evergreen woods and succulents in those two <b>biomes.</b> Especially the succulents efficiently utilize the winter precipitation. This leads to the dominance of the succulents on those two <b>biomes...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Biomes</b> {{represent}} {{large areas}} of ecologically similar communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms. <b>Biomes</b> are defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, <b>biomes</b> are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. <b>Biomes</b> are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation.|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the less}} common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as Parasaurolophus, may {{represent}} the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern <b>biome,</b> where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota has a humid {{continental}} climate {{in the east}} and in the Black Hills, and a semi-arid climate in the west outside of the Black Hills, featuring four very distinct seasons, and the ecology of the state features plant and animal species typical of a North American temperate grassland <b>biome.</b> A number of areas under the protection of the federal or state government, such as Badlands National Park, Wind Cave National Park, and Custer State Park, are located in the state.|$|E

50|$|Plant {{communities}} are broadly distributed into <b>biomes</b> {{based on the}} form of the dominant plant species. For example, grasslands are dominated by grasses, while forests are dominated by trees. <b>Biomes</b> are determined by regional climates, mostly temperature and precipitation, and follow general latitudinal trends. Within <b>biomes,</b> there may be many ecological communities, which are impacted not only by climate and a variety of smaller-scale features, including soils, hydrology, and disturbance regime. <b>Biomes</b> also change with elevation, high elevations often resembling those found at higher latitudes.|$|R
25|$|Grass-dominated <b>biomes</b> {{are called}} grasslands. If only large, {{contiguous}} areas of grasslands are counted, these <b>biomes</b> cover 31% of the planet's land. Grasslands include pampas, steppes, and prairies.|$|R

5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland <b>biome.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{a genetic}} study was made basing on the {{evolutionary}} history of common elands. Located in the sub-Saharan savanna <b>biome</b> of east and southern Africa, the study used methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals {{to learn more}} about various topics, such as the phylogeography, genetic diversity, demographic history of the species. The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer-standing population in the south and a mosaic of Pleistocene refugia in the east. It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization. The similarity of dates obtained from more studies indicates a significant event c. 200 ka, which had brought a great change in the genetic history of the species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biomes</b> are terminologically {{similar to}} the concept of ecosystems, and are climatically and {{geographically}} defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the Earth, such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms, often referred to as ecosystems. <b>Biomes</b> are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate.

5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land <b>biome,</b> forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important {{for the health of}} the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients’ gut <b>biome</b> diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary <b>biome</b> has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E
