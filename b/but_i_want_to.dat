5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

[...] "My Daddy had open-heart surgery today. And after long hours, and lots of tears, they healed his broken heart, and mine," [...] she announced through her official Twitter account. She stated that she hoped the song would inspire her younger fans to appreciate their parents. [...] "I {{have a lot of}} fans who are really lovely, young, troubled fans, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> remind them that you only get one set of parents," [...] she said.|$|E
500|$|To further {{promote the}} album, Rihanna {{embarked}} on her third worldwide and fourth overall tour entitled Loud Tour (2011). The tour was officially announced on February 9, 2011, when North American dates were revealed. Critics gave the tour a positive response, with Jon Brean of the Star Tribune noting, [...] "The Barbadian singer is more visually and vocally dynamic than {{she has ever}} been before." [...] During an interview with Ryan Seacrest after Rihanna performed [...] "California King Bed" [...] on American Idol, April 14, 2011, the singer spoke about the tour's development. Rihanna addressed rumors about a special performance to be included on the setlist in order to fully incorporate her fans into the experience. When asked by Seacrest about the fan experience, she explained, [...] "Right now, we just designed the stage. I'm really not supposed to say this, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get you excited... We're building two sections on the stage [...] closer than they've ever been. It's real VIP." ...|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{condition}} {{might have}} been what prompted the Poe family to move, {{in the hopes of}} finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within Philadelphia in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site in Spring Garden. In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing. The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street. By early 1846, family friend Elizabeth Oakes Smith said that Virginia admitted, [...] "I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy." [...] She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.|$|E
500|$|That August, Brownlee {{received}} a letter from MacLean reading in part [...] "We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan." [...] Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. [...] He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. [...] She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded [...] "what about you?" [...] Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing [...] "I am not asking you to refrain from your action, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell you that the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its money you are after, I haven't got it." ...|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny thing about it is that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E

500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image {{that came to}} him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the {{character}} of Spike in mind {{for a long time}} beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe [...] "tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool." [...] Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, [...] "I don't smoke or drink or fight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> – so Spike does." [...] Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a [...] "typical old-style Japanese man", who would simply do what he wanted and expect others to follow his lead and watch him from the sidelines. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look [...] "uncool": when he stands still, he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as [...] "extra cool". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive manner of speaking, noting that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded right" [...] for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.|$|E

2500|$|About {{contemporary}} American {{poetry and}} her own risk-taking in her work she said: “Perhaps there's a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry.
