25|$|Multiple {{surveys and}} polls taken from 2011 {{reveal that the}} {{majority}} of United States cat owners are against declawing, believing the practice to <b>be</b> <b>cruel.</b> These surveys also suggest that the U.S. public believes {{that the majority of}} veterinarians who perform declawings only do so because of the lucrative amounts of money that can be made for performing them.|$|E
25|$|Throughout history {{individuals}} have condemned various practices that they considered to <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> to animals. Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci, for example, {{was troubled by}} the sight of birds in captivity, and (according to biographer Giorgio Vasari) once purchased caged birds in order to set them free. He also expressed anger within his notebooks with the fact that humans use their strength and power to raise animals for slaughter.|$|E

25|$|Some {{techniques}} of intensive agriculture may <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> to animals: foie gras is a food product {{made from the}} liver of ducks or geese that have been force fed corn to fatten the organ; veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{younger brother}} of Iberville was Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, an {{energetic}} {{man with a}} clear perception of his responsibilities. Consistent with the autocratic nature of the French government, Bienville ruled with authority when governor of Louisiana. Despite this style of governance, he inspired loyalty from his followers. He supported the Jesuits but was also willing {{to use them to}} his advantage. An understanding of Indian culture and Indian languages allowed him to establish friendships and alliances with Indian tribes. While normally kind and gentle, Bienville could also <b>be</b> <b>cruel,</b> causing men to both respect and fear him.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} basic {{areas of concern}} to various groups. The first set of {{concerns}} surround relatively common rodeo practices, {{such as the use}} of bucking straps, also known as flank straps, the use of metal or electric cattle prods, and tail-twisting. The second set of concerns surround non-traditional rodeo events that operate outside the rules of sanctioning organizations. These are usually amateur events such as mutton busting, calf dressing, wild cow milking, calf riding, chuck wagon races, and other events designed primarily for publicity, half-time entertainment or crowd participation. Finally, some groups consider some or all rodeo events themselves to <b>be</b> <b>cruel.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Court was {{determined}} to simultaneously save capital punishment in the United States and impose some reasoned basis for carrying it out. That reasoning flows from the Eighth Amendment's {{cruel and unusual punishment}} clause. Although capital punishment, per se, was not found by the Court to <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> and unusual, it must still be carried out {{in a manner consistent with}} the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. In the Court's view, the country's history with capital punishment suggests that those evolving standards of decency could not tolerate a return to the mandatory death penalty for murder that had prevailed in medieval England.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks {{also created}} early manuscripts about mental disorders. In the 4th century BCE, Hippocrates theorized that {{physiological}} abnormalities {{may be the}} root of mental disorders. In 4th to 5th Century B.C. Greece, Hippocrates wrote that he visited Democritus and found him in his garden cutting open animals. Democritus {{explained that he was}} attempting to discover the cause of madness and melancholy. Hippocrates praised his work. Democritus had with him a book on madness and melancholy. During the 5th century BCE, mental disorders, especially those with psychotic traits, were considered supernatural in origin, a view which existed throughout ancient Greece and Rome, as well as Egyptian regions. Religious leaders often turned to versions of exorcism to treat mental disorders often utilizing methods that many consider to <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> and/or barbaric methods.|$|E

With the heavy plot running through the special, the writers tried to use Bloo and his companions as a means to add humor into it. They wrote Bloo to be more obnoxious and demanding than previously, but did not want him to <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> or malicious.|$|E
500|$|... "My Prerogative" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Bobby Brown {{from his}} second studio album Don't <b>Be</b> <b>Cruel</b> (1988). It was {{released}} on October 11, 1988 as the second single from the album. After recording sessions for the album were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin travelled to New York City, since he felt something was [...] "missing" [...] from the record. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written by Brown {{as a response to}} the criticism he received for his departure from New Edition. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is often considered a new jack swing anthem, and contains many elements from Teddy Riley productions due to his involvement as one of the song's session musicians.|$|E

The Hoofers Club comprised a more informal panel of peers, whose judgments could <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> and mocking and were driven by an insistence on innovation. [...] "Survive or die" [...] was the credo. In an eccentric fusion of imitation and innovation, young dancers were forced to find their style and rhythmic voice.

500|$|Janet Jackson {{collaborated with}} former Prince {{associates}} Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on her third studio album Control (1986); the album's second single [...] "Nasty" [...] {{has been described}} as the origin of the new jack swing sound, a genre innovated by Teddy Riley. Riley's work on Keith Sweat's Make It Last Forever (1987), Guy's Guy (1988), and Bobby Brown's Don't <b>Be</b> <b>Cruel</b> (1998) made new jack swing a staple of contemporary R into the mid-1990s. New jack swing was a style and trend of vocal music, often featuring rapped verses and drum machines. The crossover appeal of early contemporary R artists in mainstream popular music, including works by Prince, Michael and Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Anita Baker, and The Pointer Sisters became a turning point for black artists in the industry, as their success [...] "was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Salon, Mary Elizabeth Williams {{commented that}} [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> and {{inaccurate}} {{to suggest that}} Carla Alcorn did not love her child", but added that Carla's statement that she [...] "loved him unconditionally" [...] revealed [...] "a tragic {{lack of understanding of}} the word 'unconditionally,' even in death." [...] People magazine quoted Johanna Olson, Medical Director for the Center of Trans Youth Health and Development at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, as stating that [...] "Did Leelah's parents love her? Yes, I'm sure they did. Did they support her? No, they didn't. And that's a tragedy." [...] Mara Keisling, the Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, was quoted as stating that the blaming of Alcorn's parents was unhelpful, adding, [...] "Despite the great cultural and policy advances transgender people have made, there is still a lot of disrespect, discrimination and violence aimed at us.

[...] In a statement, the label said [...] "there was some deliberation over the possibility of recording with Connie... However, the decision not to proceed was made with the best intentions for Connie, taking into consideration her age and {{that it would not be}} right to do so at this time." [...] Cowell himself said that [...] "when the time is right, [...] be delighted to see if [...] make it work". The Talbot family decided to search for another label, saying [...] "while [...] loves what she's doing it would <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> to stop her. Fame and money will never matter." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't <b>Be</b> <b>Cruel</b> in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E
500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Singer {{described}} the Apt Pupils premise as a [...] "study in cruelty". He {{prepared for the}} film by reading books like the 1996 history book Hitler's Willing Executioners, which confirmed his beliefs that Nazi war criminals felt [...] "guiltless and matter-of-fact about what they did". He referred to how young Todd Bowden's interactions with Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander start to affect him: [...] "I {{liked the idea of}} the infectious nature of evil... The notion that anybody has the capacity within them to <b>be</b> <b>cruel</b> if motivated properly is, I think, a scary concept." [...] The director also perceived the film as not about the Holocaust, believing that the Nazi war criminal could have been replaced by one of Pol Pot's executioners or a mass murderer from Russia. [...] "It wasn't about fascism or National Socialism. It was about cruelty and the ability to do awful deeds, to live with them and be empowered by them," [...] Singer said. To this end, the director sought to avoid overt use of swastikas and other Nazi symbols. He was also attracted to the film as [...] " [...] idea that the collective awfulness of this terrible thing that happened decades ago in Europe had somehow crept up across the ocean and through time, like a golem, into this beautiful Southern California suburban neighborhood".|$|E
