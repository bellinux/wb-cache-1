40|$|This study {{investigated}} the usefulness and characteristics of a five-megahertz quartz crystal resonator oscillating in a thickness-shear mode as a sensor of biological pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium. An impedance analyzer measured the impedance of the oscillating quartz crystal, which determined all mechanical properties of the oscillating quartz and its immediate environment. ^ In this study, the impedance behavior of the <b>bare</b> <b>crystal</b> was characterized in air and in potassium phosphate buffer solution. The potassium phosphate buffer was a Newtonian liquid. The resonance frequency of the oscillating quartz shifted down about 900 Hz by contacting with the buffer. An immobilized-antibody layer on the quartz surface behaved like a rigid mass when immersed in the buffer solution. ^ The quartz crystal with immobilized antibodies was characterized in various solutions containing antibody-coated paramagnetic microspheres and varying concentrations of Salmonella typhimurium (102 − 108 cells/ml). The Salmonella cells were captured by antibody-coated paramagnetic microspheres, and then these complexes were moved magnetically to the oscillating quartz and were captured by antibodies immobilized on the crystal surface. The response of the crystal was {{expressed in terms of}} equivalent circuit parameters. The motional inductance and the motional resistance increased {{as a function of the}} concentration of Salmonella. The viscous damping was the main contribution to the resistance and the inductance in a liquid environment. The load resistance was the most effective and sensitive circuit parameter. ^ A magnetic force was a useful method to collect the complexes of Salmonella-microspheres on the crystal surface and enhance the response sensor. In this system, the detection limit, based on resistance monitoring, was about 103 cells/ml. ...|$|E
40|$|Iron ore green pellets are {{produced}} by agglomeration of moist magnetite concentrates. The quality of green pellets {{is essential for the}} transportability and metallurgical benefits of the final product. The agglomeration behavior of magnetite concentrate particles is strongly influenced by its surface properties which are affected by the interactions with flotation reagents (i. e. water glass and collector) and species in process water. However, the mechanisms of these interactions and the influence on the following agglomeration process are still not completely understood. The present work has been focused on the interaction of magnetite with water glass (sodium silicate) and bentonite clay (silicate mineral) aiming for better fundamental knowledge of the magnetite surface properties in order to improve the agglomeration behavior of the magnetite concentrate. Water glass is used as a dispersing or depressing agent in flotation of magnetite. The former function is to improve the separation of mineral particles in the pulp, while the latter function is to protect the magnetite surfaces from attachment of the collector which is known to cause problems in the subsequent agglomeration process. Sodium activated bentonite clay is commonly used as an external binder in iron ore agglomeration owing to its swelling properties. The particle interaction between magnetite and bentonite platelets, which is expected to be affected by the surface properties of magnetite, is of importance for the wet and dry strength of the pellets. Sorption mechanisms of sodium silicate onto the magnetite surface at the molecular scale were studied at various pH and silicate concentrations using in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Silicate concentration, pH, and conditioning time are the most important factors for silicate sorption and speciation at the surface of magnetite. A maximum sorption was observed in the pH range 8. 5 - 9. 5. Oligomeric or polymeric silicate species are formed and dominate at high surface loading of silicate. These oligomeric or polymerized species have stronger affinity for the magnetite as compared to monomeric species, resulting in a slower and less extent of desorption and implying a higher depressing efficiency in flotation. Sodium silicate makes the magnetite surface more negatively charged, while adsorbed calcium ions on the surface compensate this negative surface charge. Calcium ions promote the oligomerization of silicate on the surface of magnetite at high pH (pH > 10) possibly due to the increased local silicate concentration by additional sorption of silicate on adsorbed calcium at the surface. The competitive sorption between sodium silicate and collector (sodium oleate) for the magnetite surface was studied using the in situ ATR-FTIR technique. It was confirmed that oleate could still be adsorbed onto a sodium silicate modified magnetite surface but the amount of adsorbed oleate decreased with increasing concentration of silicate (0. 1 - 5 mmol•L- 1). This depression effect became much more significant when the concentration of sodium silicate was higher than 0. 4 mmol•L- 1 above which more dimers or oligomeric silicate species were formed at the magnetite surface. However, when the magnetite surface was pre-treated firstly with sodium oleate, the addition of sodium silicate only slightly reduced the adsorption of oleate. Meanwhile, the sorption of silicate anions was depressed and resulted in a lower degree of oligomerization or polymerization at high silicate dosage. Sessile drop method and Wilhelmy method were used to measure the water contact angle of synthesized magnetite, and Washburn method was used for contact angle measurements of magnetite concentrate. The synthesized magnetite has lower contact angle compared to mineral particles. Nevertheless, similar tendency of changes in wettability upon interaction with calcium, sodium silicate and collector was observed for synthesized magnetite and magnetite concentrate. Sorption of calcium and silicate increased the wettability of the surface, while adsorption of collector made the surface more hydrophobic. Further exposure of the collector modified magnetite surface to sodium silicate could restore the surface wettability. Therefore, an interesting implication for magnetite flotation and agglomeration is that the decreased hydrophilicity of magnetite by attachment of collector could be improved by further chemical conditioning with sodium silicate (water glass). The interaction of bentonite with magnetite was investigated by means of settling of bentonite platelets onto a layer of magnetite nano-particles. The magnetite layer was deposited on a horizontal ZnSe crystal to be able to examine the orientation of the platelets by polarized ATR-FTIR. The measured dichroic ratio of the bentonite platelets decreased with time in wet film and approached a minimum value in the dry bentonite film regardless of the pH of the bentonite suspension. This tendency is in good agreement with the results observed for settling on <b>bare</b> <b>crystal,</b> indicating a more ordered structure of platelets upon evaporation of water. The bentonite platelets in dry film were evidently tending to orient with their basal plane surfaces to the magnetite layer, whilst wet films adopted a much more disordered structure. Similarly, a rather disordered wet bentonite film was formed on the calcium and sodium silicate modified magnetite layer. These bentonite platelets became more ordered when the wet film was dried.

40|$|The {{properties}} of single crystals of cadmium sulfide as radiation detectors are described. It {{has been found}} possible to select crystals such that: (a) The ratio of increase of conductivity under irradiation to the rate of absorption {{of energy in the}} crystal is substantially independent of particle energy (over the examined ranges of 500 ev to 80 kev for electrons and 5 kev to 180 kev for protons) and of the magnitude of energy flux (over the range from. 005 to 10 ergs/cm(sup 2 -sec); and (b) The above ration is substantially the same for protons, electrons, alpha particles, x-rays, and gamma-rays. For a driving voltage of 100 volts, typical crystal yield currents of 10 (sup - 7) to 10 (sup- 6) amperes for each erg/cm(sup 2 -sec) of energy absorbed by the crystal. The threshold of such crystal detectors (resulting from dark currents of the order of 10 (sup 10 amp) is typically 10 (sup - 3) ergs/cm(sup 2 - sec). For the selected crystals a response-temperature coefficient of - 0. 25 % per degree centigrade is found for the temperature range - 50 deg C to + 50 deg C. A description is given of a complete CdS total corpuscular energy detector for the study of geomagnetically trapped radiation by means of a satellite. The detector described has a dynamic range great than 10 (sup 4), a solid angle of 10 (exp - 3) steradian, and a detection threshold of approximately 1 erg/cm(sup 2 -sec-sterad). A similar detector employing a small magnet for the selective exclusion of electrons is also described.

The optical response of HPPCs is easily tunable from the visible to the infraredspectral range, while their fabrication, based on colloidal self-assembly, keeps production costs rather low. Both arguments make HPPCs a class of attractive functional materials. Here, we explore the optical properties of HPPCs obtained by gradual etching of a hexagonal closepacked monolayer of polystyrene microspheres, subsequently covered by a thin metal layer.

Finite-difference time-domain simulations allowed us to explain the correlations between the observed optical response and morphology. The transmission gap in <b>bare</b> colloidal <b>crystals</b> can be blue-shifted up to at least 50 nm, and its depth increased by more than 20 %.

The kinetic behavior {{of the formation of}} a 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -Phosphocholine (POPC) SLB on SiO 2 surfaces is discussed and compared for three cases: (i) a standard SiO 2 film deposited onto the gold electrode of a quartz crystal, (ii) an electrodeless quartz crystal with a sputter-coated SiO 2 film, and (iii) an uncoated electrodeless quartz crystal sensor surface. We demonstrate, supported by imaging the SLB on an uncoated electrodeless surface using atomic force microscopy (AFM), that a defect-free, completely covering bilayer is formed in all three cases. Differences in the kinetics of the SLB formation on the different sensor surfaces are attributed to differences in surface roughness. The latter assumption is supported by imaging the different surfaces using AFM. We show furthermore that electrodeless quartz crystal sensors can be used not only for the formation of neutral SLBs but also for positively and negatively charged SLBs. Based on our results we propose electrodeless QCM-D to be a valuable technique for lipid bilayer and related applications providing several advantages compared to electrode-coated surfaces like optical transparency, longer lifetime, and reduced costs...|$|R

In the <b>bare</b> STO <b>crystals</b> {{we find that the}} photo-generated charge carriers, which accumulate near the (001) surface, have a similar depth profile and sheet carrier concentration as the confined electrons that were previously observed in LAO/STO (001) heterostructures. A large fraction of these photo-generated charge carriers persist at low temperature at the STO (001) surface even after the UV light has been switched off again. These persistent charge carriers seem to originate from oxygen vacancies that are trapped at the structural domain boundaries which develop below the so-called antiferrodistortive transition at T* = 105 K. This is most evident from a corresponding photo-doping study of the DC transport in STO (110) crystals for which the concentration of these domain boundaries can be modified by applying a weak uniaxial stress. The oxygen vacancies and their trapping by defects are also the source of the electrons that are confined to the interface of LAO/STO (110) heterostructures which likely do not have a polar discontinuity as in LAO/STO (001). In the former, the trapping and clustering of the oxygen vacancies also has a strong influence on the anisotropy of the charge carrier mobility. We show that this anisotropy can be readily varied and even inverted by various means, such as a gentle thermal treatment, UV irradiation, or even a weak uniaxial stress. Our experiments suggest that extended defects, which develop over long time periods (of weeks to months), can strongly influence the response of the confined charge carriers at the LAO/STO (110) interface.

We show how intrinsic flexural phonon damping is necessary for obtaining a finite Kapitza resistance and also generalize the theory to encased single-layer 2 D crystals with a superstrate. We illustrate our model by computing the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) for bare and SiO$_{ 2 }$-encased single-layer graphene and MoS$_{ 2 }$ on a SiO$_{ 2 }$ substrate, using input parameters from first-principles calculation. The estimated room temperature TBC for bare (encased) graphene and MoS$_{ 2 }$ on SiO$_{ 2 }$ are 34. 6 (105) and 3. 10 (5. 07) MWK$^{- 1 }$m$^{- 2 }$, respectively.

Seedlings tended to establish on the gypsum surface crust, and their survival was size dependent, probably as a consequence of the necessity of rooting below the surface crust before summer drought arrives. However, once seedlings emerged, a higher survival rate occurred on the alluvial soils of the piedmont-slope boundary where soil crusts are absent or thinner.

The very landscape that Corot looked at was, as he said himself, but a mood of his own mind; and those great figures of Greek or English drama that seem to us to possess an actual existence of their own, apart from the poets who shaped and fashioned them, are, in their ultimate analysis, simply the poets themselves, not as {{they thought they were}}, but as they thought they were not; and by such thinking came in strange manner, though but for a moment, really so to be. For out of ourselves we can never pass, nor can there be in creation what in the creator was not. Nay, I would say that the more objective a creation appears to be, the more subjective it really is. Shakespeare might have met Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in the white streets of London, or seen the serving-men of rival houses bite their thumbs at each other in the open square; but Hamlet came out of his soul, and Romeo out of his passion. They were elements of his nature to which he gave visible form, impulses that stirred so strongly within him that he had, as it were perforce, to suffer them to realise their energy, not on the lower plane of actual life, where they would have been trammelled and constrained and so made imperfect, but on that imaginative plane of art where Love can indeed find in Death its rich fulfilment, where one can stab the eavesdropper behind the arras, and wrestle in a new-made grave, and make a guilty king drink his own hurt, and see one's father's spirit, beneath the glimpses of the moon, stalking in complete steel from misty wall to wall. Action being limited would have left Shakespeare unsatisfied and unexpressed; and, just as it is because he did nothing that {{he has been able to}} achieve everything, so it is because he never speaks to us of himself in his plays that his plays reveal him to us absolutely, and show us his true nature and temperament far more completely than do those strange and exquisite sonnets, even, in which he <b>bares</b> to <b>crystal</b> eyes the secret closet of his heart.

BackgroundIntracoronary {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) is a catheter-based optical imaging modality {{that is capable of}} providing microscopic (∼ 7 -μm axial resolution, ∼ 30 -μm transverse resolution), cross-sectional images of the coronary wall. Although the use of OCT has shown substantial promise for imaging coronary microstructure, blood attenuates the OCT signal, necessitating prolonged, proximal occlusion to screen long arterial segments. OFDI is a second-generation form of OCT that is capable of acquiring images at much higher frame rates. The increased speed of OFDI enables rapid, 3 -dimensional imaging of long coronary segments after a brief, nonocclusive saline purge. MethodsVolumetric OFDI images were obtained in 3 patients after intracoronary stent deployment. Imaging was performed in the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries {{with the use of a}} nonocclusive saline purge rates ranging from 3 to 4 ml/s and for purge durations of 3 to 4 s. After imaging, the OFDI datasets were segmented using previously documented criteria and volume rendered. ResultsGood visualization of the artery wall was obtained in all cases, with clear viewing lengths ranging from 3. 0 to 7. 0 cm at pullback rates ranging from 5 to 20 mm/s.

By investigating {{the dynamics of the}} excited state, we gain new insights into the physical processes that precede or compete with the emission of light. Such insights are necessary to enhance the efficiency of luminescent materials. We study blinking in individual semiconductor nanocrystals, i. e. the seemingly random switching between an emissive and a dark (non-emissive) state under continued excitation. The switching events are due to processes of charge carrier trapping and detrapping in or nearby the quantum dot, which we show occur much more frequently than usually assumed. After charge carrier trapping the nanocrystal is dark because of quenching by Auger processes. We investigate how losses due to Auger processes can be reduced: they are less efficient in CdSe/CdS core–shell nanocrystals or CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods than in <b>bare</b> CdSe nanocrystals. <b>Crystals</b> doped with lanthanide ions find numerous applications as luminescent materials in lighting, bioimaging and lasers. The properties of the material often depend on energy transfer processes between the lanthanide ions. These can be necessary to achieve the desired color output, but they can also reduce the photoluminescence efficiency. The quantitative understanding of energy transfer processes is however limited. We present and apply models to understand energy transfer processes in detail from the analysis of photoluminescence decay curves. In particular, we analyze the energy transfer processes that can result in downconversion (i. e. photoluminescence with a photon-to-photon conversion efficiency higher than 100 %), between Tm 3 + ions in Gd 2 O 2 S or from Tb 3 + to Yb 3 + in YPO 4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the efficiency of energy transfer processes doped nanocrystals is influenced by the refractive index of the environment of the crystal: the lower the refractive index of the environment, the higher the efficiency of energy transfer...|$|R
40|$|ATR (Attenuated Total Reflection) FT-IR (Fourier Transform-Infrared Radiation) {{technique}} {{was applied for}} the study of (1) adsorption of albumin onto a polyurethane film deposited on a <b>bare</b> ZnSe IR <b>crystal</b> (internal reflection element) and onto a ZnSe surface, (2) ionic surfactant (phosphate ester) adsorption onto alumina and (3) PEO (polyethylene oxide) based nonionic surfactant adsorption onto silicon. This {{technique was}} also applied to determine the spatial orientation of adsorbed surfactant molecules at solid/liquid interface. Dynamic contact angle and zeta potential measurements were made in these systems to elucidate adsorption phenomena. Albumin adsorption was found to be dependent on the solution pH and substrate type. The adsorption density was higher at pH = 7 than that at pH = 3 or 11, and the conformations of α-helix and β-sheet of albumin in the adsorbed layer were identified from amide III band. Adsorption density was higher on the more hydrophobic polyurethane surface than on the relatively less hydrophobic ZnSe crystal surface. The adsorption isotherm of alkyl phosphate surfactant onto alumina was characterized by three regions with a maximum adsorption density of 0. 63 μg/cm² corresponding to 1. 2 adsorption density. Using polarized IR beams, tilting angles of alkyl chains adsorbed onto alumina surface were calculated to be 42. 5 ° and 40. 7 ° for 50 and 100 ppm solutions. As the solution concentration of alkyl phosphate surfactant increased, the pH value at which zeta potential reversed decreased due to the specific adsorption of surfactant at alumina/aqueous solution interface. Adsorption of PEO based nonionic surfactants from alkaline solutions onto silicon was affected by types and lengths of hydrophobic groups and lengths of hydrophilic PEO chains. For the same alkyl chain length, increasing the length of ethylene oxide chain (higher HLB number) resulted in a decrease in adsorption density as well as residual surfactant after washing. Complete wetting of hydrophobic silicon was found in the immersing/emersing cycling in the surfactant containing solutions at concentrations in the range of 50 to 100 ppm. Ozonized DI water was very effective in removal of adsorbed surfactant on silicon, but it induced oxide layer growth...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that a few ppmw sulfur impurity may segregate to the interface of thermally grown alumina scales and the underlying substrate, resulting in bond degradation and premature spallation. This has been shown for NiAl and NiCrAl-based alloys, <b>bare</b> single <b>crystal</b> superalloys, or coated superalloys. The role of reactive elements (especially Y) has been to getter the sulfur in the bulk and preclude interfacial segregation. Pt additions are also very beneficial, however a similar thermodynamic explanation does not apply. The {{purpose of the present}} discussion is to highlight some observations of these effects on Rene' 142, Rene'N 5, PWA 1480, and PWA 1484. For PWA 1480, we have mapped cyclic oxidation and spallation in terms of potential sulfur interfacial layers and found that a cumulative amount of about one monolayer is sufficient to degrade long term adhesion. Depending on substrate thickness, optimum performance occurs if sulfur is reduced below about 0. 2 - 0. 5 ppmw. This is accomplished in the laboratory by hydrogen annealing or commercially by melt-fluxing. Excellent 1150 C cyclic oxidation is thus demonstrated for desulfurized Rene' 142, Rene'N 5, and PWA 1484. Alternatively, a series of N 5 alloys provided by GE-AE have shown that as little as 15 ppmw of Y dopant was effective in providing remarkable scale adhesion. In support of a Y-S gettering mechanism, hydrogen annealing was unable to desulfurize these alloys from their initial level of 5 ppmw S. This impurity and critical doping level corresponds closely to YS or Y 2 S 3 stoichiometry. In many cases, Y-doped alloys or alloys with marginal sulfur levels exhibit an oxidative sensitivity to the ambient humidity called Moisture-Induced Delayed Spallation (MIDS). After substantial scale growth, coupled with damage from repeated cycling, cold samples may spall after a period of time, breathing on them, or immersing them in water. While stress corrosion arguments may apply, we propose that the underlying cause is related to a hydrogen embrittlement reaction: Al alloy + 3 H 2 O = Al(OH) 3 + 3 H(+) + 3 e(-). This mechanism is derived from an analogous moisture-induced hydrogen embrittlement mechanism originally shown for Ni 3 Al and FeAl intermetallics. Consequently, a cathodic hydrogen charging technique was used to demonstrate that electrolytic de-scaling occurs for these otherwise adherent alumina scales formed on Y-doped Rene'N 5, in support of hydrogen effects. Finally, some TBC observations are discussed in light of all of the above. Plasma sprayed 8 YSZ coatings, produced on PWA 1484 without a bond coat, were found to survive more than 1000 1 -hr cycles at 1100 C when desulfurized to below 0. 1 ppmw. At higher sulfur (1. 2 ppmw) levels, moisture sensitivity and delayed TBC failure, referred to as Desk Top Spallation, occurred at just 200 hr. Despite a large degree of scatter, a factor of 5 in life improvement is indicated for desulfurized samples in cyclic furnace tests, confirming the beneficial effect of low sulfur alloys on model TBC systems. (DTS and moisture effects are also observed on commercially applied PVD 7 YSZ coatings on Rene'N 5 +Y with Pt-aluminide bond coats). These types of catastrophic failure were subverted on the model system by segmenting the substrate into a network of 0. 010 high ribs, spaced in. apart, prior to plasma spraying. No failures occurred after 1000 cycles at 1150 C or after 2000 cycles at 1100 C, even after water immersion. The benefit is described in terms of elasticity models and a critical buckling stress...|$|R
40|$|Electrides are {{a unique}} class of ionic {{materials}} {{in which the}} anions are stoichiometricallyreplaced by localised electrons. This unique chemical structure confers anumber of desirable properties. However, {{the majority of the}} electride crystals aretemperature unstable making experimental examination of these materials difficult. Theoretical methods are not hindered by the practical problems afflicting the experimentalapproaches and, as such, present an ideal alternate route for the ongoinginvestigation of electrides. Density-functional theory (DFT) is used to conduct this theoretical investigation. We first explore the potential systematic errors associated with common densityfunctionals when modelling a localised electron within a crystal void, which is thecentral characteristic of the electride <b>crystals.</b> <b>Bare</b> DFT is shown to excessivelydelocalise the interstitial electron, while use of continuum solvent models with DFToverly localises this electron. In the latter case, we find the excessive localisationphenomena is dependent only on the applied solvent correction and any electronicstructuremethod that uses a similar correction will exhibit the same errors. The alkali metal-ligand complexes, the building blocks of the electride crystals,are modelled and thermodynamic cycles constructed, highlighting the energychanges that occur when these complexes form. The ionisation potential of thealkali metal-ligand complexes is found to be consistently between 1 and 2 eV, regardlessof the alkali metal or ligand molecule used. We propose this be used as adesign criteria for future computational testing of potential electride-forming alkalimetal-ligand complexes. DFT analysis of all of the known electride crystals (at the time) is conducted. As well as establishing a common ground from which to theoretically discuss theelectrides (the first such study to do so), we identify the ‘electride state’ for all ofthe organic electride crystals. This state is associated with the localised electronand resides between the conduction and valence band in the band structure. Bymodifying the initial self-consistent field guess, we were able to find the first all-electron solutions for the magnetic states of the organic electrides. These magneticstates reproduced the expected anti-ferromagnetic behaviour, in some cases to aremarkable degree of accuracy. Finally, we computationally apply pressure to the simplest organic electride,Cs+(15 -crown- 5) 2 e-. We find that the magnetic properties of the electride changesignificantly upon compression, eventually becoming ferromagnetic. This switchfrom an anti-ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic ground state, termed piezomagnetism,means that Cs+(15 -crown- 5) 2 e-, and potentially other electrides, can develop aspontaneous magnetic moment under pressure. Piezomagnetism is a rare propertythat has just as many potential applications as the well known piezoelectricmaterials. The range of pressure computationally applied is easily accessible tomodern experimental techniques and this result should be reasonably easy to verifyexperimentally...|$|R
