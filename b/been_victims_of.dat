5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have <b>been</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E

40|$|In 2008, U.

Approximately three quarters of them had no history of prior victimization. • Seventy-one {{percent of the children}} <b>were</b> classified as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> child neglect; 16 percent as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> physical abuse; 9 percent as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual abuse; and 7 percent as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> emotional abuse. • A non-CPS study estimated that 1 in 5 U.

40|$|Currently, {{the best}} {{estimate}} of the incidence and prevalence of rape {{is provided by the}} National Violence Against Women study, published in 2000 and sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control 1. This study employed a sampling strategy that closely matched national demographics and found the following: • 14. 8 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape at some point during their lifetime • 2. 8 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> attempted rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 3 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape during the previous 12 months, yielding an 8. 7 per 1000 “incidence rate” Extrapolating this incidence rate to the population of Metro Boston reveals the stark disparity between “official ” rape statistics and the reality of sexual violence. In 1998, there were 1, 687 rapes reported in all of Massachusetts, and 526 arrests were made 17. That same year, among the approximately 1. 75 million women in the Boston Metro area, there were actually 15, 225 rapes. The NIJ study findings described above closely match those of the Rape in America study 2, published in 1992, which found: • 13. 0 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape at some point during their lifetime • 0. 7 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape during the previous 12 months Two other prevalence studies have documented even higher victimization rates, probably due to the unique characteristics of their samples. A study of naval recruits published in 19993 found: • 36. 1 % <b>of</b> female recruits <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape since the age of 14 • 9. 4 % <b>of</b> female recruits <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> attempted rape since the age of 14 A study of a national sample of college students, published in 19874, found: • 15. 4 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> rape since the age of 14 • 12. 1 % <b>of</b> women <b>were</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> attempted rape since the age of 1...|$|R

25|$|Stereotypes of Asians {{have been}} largely collectively internalized by society and these {{stereotypes}} have mainly negative repercussions for Asian Americans and Asian immigrants in daily interactions, current events, and governmental legislation.

Asians have experienced discrimination and have <b>been</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> hate crimes related to their ethnic stereotypes.|$|E

A mixture of SS and Security Police, assisted by Ukrainian police, carried out the killings. Although they did not actively participate in the killings, men of the German 6th Army helped round up the Jews of Kiev and transport them to be shot. By the end of the war, around two million are thought to have <b>been</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> the Einsatzgruppen and their helpers in the local population and the German Army.

25|$|Given {{that the}} main sources of South American {{immigrants}} since the 1960s have been Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru, most of these immigrants have been either Amerindian or Mestizo, for they represent the ethnic majorities in those countries. The increasing numbers of immigrants from these sources has caused the proportion of Argentines of European descent to be reduced significantly in {{certain areas of the}} Greater Buenos Aires (particularly in Morón, La Matanza, Escobar and Tres de Febrero), as well as the Buenos Aires neighbourhoods of Flores, Villa Soldati, Villa Lugano and Nueva Pompeya. Many Amerindian or Mestizo people of Bolivian/Paraguayan/Peruvian origin have suffered racist discrimination, and in some cases, violence, or have <b>been</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual slavery and forced labor in textile sweat shops.|$|E
25|$|The early {{hypothesis}} of belief disconfirmation presented in When Prophecy Fails (1956) reported that faith deepened {{among the members}} of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth, to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The disconfirmed prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they <b>been</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance, between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, material reality, most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to hold a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing. That the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism; social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. Moreover, upon overcoming the disconfirmed belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers, by successful proselytism.|$|E

Arrow D.I.T claims that twenty-three percent of 9-16 year olds in Ireland have been bullied on-line or of-line, compared to nineteen percent in Europe. Although, on-line bullying in Ireland at 4% according to Arrow D.I.T is lower than the European average which stands at 6%, and half that of the UK where 8% reported being cyberbullied. As a result, traditional forms of bullying in Ireland is higher than their European counterparts, but lower when it comes to cyberbullying.|$|R
