5|$|MRO has two {{rechargeable}} nickel-hydrogen batteries used {{to power}} the spacecraft {{when it is not}} facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the operators to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar {{was added to}} the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use of asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E
5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted {{that at the end of}} the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Dio's death.|$|E

5|$|The {{pulling power}} of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal combustion engines could not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the possibility of a}} gas explosion. The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines.|$|E

25|$|The single {{remaining}} national {{rail line}} on the Isle of Wight was electrified in 1967, so that former London Underground rolling stock could <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the limited height of Ryde Tunnel.

500|$|In 1933, Clifton-by-the-Sea {{was home}} to 50 {{residents}} and 2 businesses, and from 1940 to 1949 it {{was home to}} 100 residents and 4 businesses. [...] After World War II the area expanded as it became home for workers of the nearby petrochemical plants. The expansion of the area required {{the establishment of a}} post office in 1948. The U.S. Postal Service refused to allow the name Clifton-by-the-Sea to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its length, and the name Clifton was already in use by another Texas town, so the residents chose the same name as the subdivision at the center of business, Bay Cliff, as a replacement. However, the name was misspelled on the postal paperwork as Bacliff. The new name had only seven letters so it was admissible.|$|E

500|$|However, manager Chris O'Donnell {{said the}} album was 75% live, with overdubs {{restricted}} to backing vocals and a few guitar solos to [...] "clean the sound up". Lynott {{said that there were}} a few necessary overdubs, but [...] "anything else would have ruined the atmosphere on those recordings and made a mockery of putting out a live album". Robertson has been particularly critical over Visconti's view. He has said the album is almost all live, and the sound levels on stage would make overdubbing impossible {{due to the lack of}} acoustic separation between instruments. He claims a recording of [...] "Still In Love With You", featuring a guitar solo he felt was better than the one at the gig that was eventually released, could not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> phaser noise on the bass. From this, he concluded that if the bass could not be overdubbed, nothing else could either.|$|E
500|$|The Master Chief has {{appeared}} or has been referenced {{several times in}} non-canon media.

Team Ninja approached Bungie Studios and asked to use the Master Chief in their 2006 video game Dead or Alive 4. Although the Chief could not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> storyline restrictions, Bungie's interest in the idea resulted in the development of Nicole (Spartan-458).|$|E
500|$|Suda {{wrote the}} game's script in an improvisational manner, {{aiming for a}} lighthearted {{atmosphere}} that sometimes even mocked the game's design. The main reason for this {{was that he had}} fully immersed himself in the grim atmosphere of The Silver Case, and he wanted a change both for himself and his next game. Returning staff from The Silver Case included scenario co-writer Masashi Ooka and character designer Takashi Miyamoto; the change to a lighter atmosphere proved difficult for Miyamoto when designing the characters. Despite the differing aesthetics, the overall visual design was deliberately similar to that of The Silver Case. The music was composed by Masafumi Takada, who had previously worked on The Silver Case, and Shingo Yasumoto. The soundtrack incorporated remixed and re-orchestrated versions of classical music. The idea of using classical music was suggested by Suda: he told the sound designers to create a score that sounded like lounge music, but some considered tracks could not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> licensing issues. Due to budgetary constraints, voice acting could not be included, with characters instead being given garbled vocals [...] "that sounded like random foreign languages".|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of iron hulls in the 19th century, copper {{sheathing}} could no longer <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its galvanic corrosive interaction with iron.

2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} 5-ASA drugs such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label use of drugs such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus has shown some benefits. Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E
