40|$|Load {{balancing}} middleware is {{used extensively}} to improve scalability and overall system throughput in distributed systems. Many load balancing middleware services are simplistic, however, {{since they are}} geared only for specific usecases and environments. These limitations {{make it hard to}} use the same load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> for anything other than the distributed application it was designed for originally. This lack of generality forces continuous re-development of application-specific load balancing services. Not only does re-development increase deployment costs of distributed applications, but it also increases the potential of producing nonoptimal load balancing implementations since proven load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> optimizations cannot be reused directly. This paper presents a set of load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> features that address many existing middleware load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> inadequacies, such as lack of server-side transparency, centralized load balancing, sole support for stateless replication, fixed load monitoring granularities, lack of fault tolerant load balancing, non-extensible load balancing algorithms, and simplistic replica management.

40|$|Abstract. CORBA is {{a widely}} used {{solution}} for distributed object application. Currently, object implementations facilitate object group model to organize the object services. In addition {{to the complexity of}} object grouping, researchers also seek {{to improve the quality of}} service (QoS) by various means such as implementing load balancing to the system. This paper deals with the proposed load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> of distributed object groups. The proposed load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> uses the dynamic replication scheme which is mechanized by flow balance assumption (FBA) that derives from the arrival and service rate to execute request forwarding to new objects. The proposed on-demand replication scheme adjusts the number of replicated objects based on the arrival rate to minimize the waiting time of clients. It consists of procedures such as intercepting the request and executing on-demand activation of objects. The result of the simulation shows the improvement of the total mean client request completion time of the system as compared to other load balancing schemes. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{patchwork}} of different imbalance-settlement rules in geographically adjacent gas regions induces shippers to go “forum shopping” to minimize costs of ex-post <b>balancing</b> <b>services.</b> This shopping increases efficiency, and thus {{welfare of the}} shippers, on the one hand. The impact on net efficiency {{is dependent on the}} relative incentives provided by different balancing mechanisms and the relative system-balancing costs that the transmission-system operators face to offer <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> to unbalanced shippers, on the other hand. If the gas-balancing mechanism and the system-balancing costs are aligned, net efficiency in the combined gas system will rise. Our results demonstrate that such an outcome is not guaranteed. Hence, market integration without properly checking compatibility of balancing rules can improve shipper efficiency at the cost of reducing overall efficiency. The latter outcome should clearly be avoided by policy makers and European regulators whose primary concern should be overall efficiency as this provides fair and efficient prices for gas consumers and a higher utility for society. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure a stable {{operation}} of the power system, Transmission System Operators have to balance production and consumption of electiricty continuously. For this purpose <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> are utilised. With the European objective to migrate to a sustainable power production, a significant share of generation {{is expected to be}} from renewable sources, with its inherent production forecast errors. To balance this variable production, the requirement for <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> increases. The Nordic, particularly the Norwegian hydrobased power system is predestinated of providing such <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> to the continental European power system. This thesis studies the integration of national regulating power markets, enabling the cross-border exchange of <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> in Northern Europe. The research encompasses the development of a mathematical model for the regulating power market, which is based on a day-ahead spot market model. Furthermore, data models for the Northern European power system are developed. Succeedingly, these models are utilised for a set of case studies. The first part of the thesis focuses on the model development and implementation of system scenarios. The mathematical model of the regulating power market comprises the procurement as well as activation of regulating reserves and explicitly addresses the exchange of <b>balancing</b> <b>services.</b> This model is used to assess the integration of national regulating power markets. Two detailed data models are compiled, encompassing 2010 ’s and 2020 ’s state of the Northern European power system. For these scenarios the outcome of the the day-ahead spot market is analysed, which shows significant changes in the future system dispatch. Taking the system dispatch as input to the regulating power market model, its market outcome is investigated. The analysis illustrates significant cost savings for the integration of national regulating power markets. The second part of the thesis comprises a set of analyses, executed with the developed models. The increase in power production from renewable energy sources, especially wind power production is taken as a basis for the future development of the power system. With the changes in the power production portfolio in Northern Europe, including higher variability and increased production forecast error, the future outcome of the regulating power market is studied. Moreover, the impact of various forecast horizons for wind power production and the definition of different reserve requirement levels are investigated. In general the analyses illustrate the challenges due to increased power production from renewable sources. These result in higher system imbalances and hence costs in the regulating power market. It is shown, that an integration of national regulating power markets in Northern Europe provides a good possibility to counteract this cost increase, while the system security is enhanced.
