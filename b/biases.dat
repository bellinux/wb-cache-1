5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known <b>biases,</b> observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational <b>biases</b> of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some <b>biases</b> he found that even with these <b>biases</b> the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if <b>biases</b> are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of <b>biases.</b> Rather, they suggest <b>biases</b> develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation <b>biases</b> in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational <b>biases</b> have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E

The absence of cluster <b>bias</b> implies absence of <b>bias</b> with respect to any cluster-level (level 2) variable. The variables that possibly cause the <b>bias</b> {{do not have to be}} measured to test for cluster <b>bias.</b> Therefore, the test for cluster <b>bias</b> serves as a global test of measurement <b>bias</b> with respect to any level 2 variable. However, the validity of the global test depends on the Type I and Type II error rates of the test. We compare the performance of the test for cluster <b>bias</b> with the restricted factor analysis (RFA) test, which can be used if the variable that leads to measurement <b>bias</b> is measured. It appeared that the RFA test has considerably more power than the test for cluster <b>bias.</b> However, the false positive rates of the test for cluster <b>bias</b> were generally around the expected values, while the RFA test showed unacceptably high false positive rates in some conditions.

40|$|We first review what {{is known}} about {{patterns}} of codon usage <b>bias</b> in Drosophila and make the following points: (i) Drosophila genes are as <b>biased</b> or more <b>biased</b> than those in microorganisms. (ii) The level of <b>bias</b> of genes and even the particular pattern of codon <b>bias</b> can remain phylogenetically invariant for very long periods of evolution. (iii) However, some genes, even very tightly linked genes, can change very greatly in codon <b>bias</b> across species. (iv) Generally G and especially C are favored at synonymous sites in <b>biased</b> genes. (v) With the exception of aspartic acid, all amino acids contribute significantly and about equally to the codon usage <b>bias</b> of a gene. (vi) While most individual amino acids that can use G or C at synonymous sites display a preference for C, there are exceptions: valine and leucine, which prefer G. (vii) Finally, smaller genes tend to be more <b>biased</b> than longer genes. We then examine possible causes of these patterns and discount mutation <b>bias</b> on three bases: there is little evidence of regional mutation <b>bias</b> in Drosophila, mutation <b>bias</b> is likely toward A+T (the opposite of codon usage <b>bias),</b> and not all amino acids display the preference for the same nucleotide in the wobble position. Two lines of evidence support a selection hypothesis based on tRNA pools: highly <b>biased</b> genes tend to be highly and/or rapidly expressed, and the preferred codons in highly <b>biased</b> genes optimally bind the most abundant isoaccepting tRNAs. Finally, we examine the effect of <b>bias</b> on DNA evolution and confirm that genes with high codon usage <b>bias</b> have lower rates of synonymous substitution between species than do genes with low codon usage <b>bias.</b> Surprisingly, we find that genes with higher codon usage <b>bias</b> display higher levels of intraspecific synonymous polymorphism.

40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} {{direction of}} a motion step (probe stimulus) can be influenced by an earlier motion step or a brief motion sweep containing {{a series of steps}} (<b>biasing</b> stimulus). Depending upon experimental conditions, the <b>biasing</b> of the direction of the probe step (a phase shift of 180 °±Φ) by a <b>biasing</b> stimulus which precedes it by approximately 250 ms can either increase (positive filter <b>biasing)</b> or decrease (negative filter <b>biasing)</b> the tendency to see the probe move in the <b>biasing</b> direction as computed with a motion filter with a biphasic temporal impulse response. In a series of experiments it was found that <b>biasing</b> motions traversing 90 ° of phase angle in fewer than six steps in less than 100 ms produced positive filter <b>biasing.</b> Also, <b>biasing</b> of the probe direction could be dissociated from the consciously reported direction of the <b>biasing</b> stimulus, and it did not occur when the probe preceded rather than followed the <b>biasing</b> stimulus. A <b>biasing</b> sweep containing more than six steps traversing 90 ° or a sweep traversing 270 ° produced negative filter <b>biasing.</b> Perceptual fusion of the steps of the sweep was not a necessary condition for obtaining negative filter <b>biasing.</b> In general, the negative filter <b>biasing</b> effects were found to be the most pervasive for the conditions investigated, and they are suggestive of a direction-specific, adaptation-like (gain-control) process in first-order motion filters.
