The growth of vegetation in a channel system is environmental friendly, but its effect on the flow in an open channel junction can be significant. In this work a 3 D RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equation) model has been implemented to investigate the flow phenomena in channel junctions with or without vegetation. The model is first validated by two cases: flow in an open channel T-junction without vegetation, and flow in a single open channel with vegetation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports the}} results of the {{numerical}} simulation of open channel flow diversions using the two-dimensional (2 D) hydrodynamic model River 2 D. In flow diversions a lateral <b>branch</b> <b>channel</b> splits from the main straight channel diverting part of the incoming water. Diversions are found in lateral intakes and river bifurcations. Two lab experiments were simulated: (1) A 30 o lateral channel that diverts 50 % of the incoming flow and has a width-depth ratio of 2. 8; and (2) a narrow 90 o lateral channel that diverts 81 % of the flow and has a width-depth ratio of only 0. 5. The first diversion has been recently simulated using the 3 D model Delft 3 D; but it had limited success to accurately simulate the length of an eddy inside the <b>branch</b> <b>channel</b> because of limitations with the resolution of its structured mesh. River 2 D, which uses a flexible finite element mesh, was able to reproduce the water depths of the first diversion with a discrepancy of only 1 %; as well as the length of the eddy. River 2 D was also able to reproduce the velocity profiles in the <b>branch</b> <b>channel</b> of the second narrow and deep diversion, which is at the limits of applicability for 2 D shallow water models. Despite the flow being highly 3 D for the presence of a helical flow and eddies, River 2 D performed reasonably well. The results suggested that River 2 D can be promising tool for designing the layout of lateral intakes or the study of alluvial river bifurcations...|$|E

In our experiment, we could consider the air play the role of substrate with nS as 1. The refractivity R is inversely proportional to the value of nL/nH, which means the transmissivity T is directly proportional to this ratio. When the anodization temperature decreases, the <b>branched</b> <b>channel</b> layers will not grow sufficiently, so the contrast of effective refractivity of two layers turns to be less.

The biofluid is modeled with single phase shear rate non-Newtonian flow with blood property. The separation of red blood cell from plasma is evident based on biofluid distribution in the microchannels against various relevant effects and findings, including Zweifach-Fung bifurcation law, Fahraeus effect, Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect and cell free phenomenon. The modeling with the initial device shows that this T-microchannel device can separate red blood cell from plasma but the separation efficiency among different bifurcations varies largely. In accordance with the imbalanced performance, a design optimization is conducted. This includes implementing a series of simulations to investigate {{the effect of the}} lengths of the main and <b>branch</b> <b>channels</b> to biofluid behavior and searching an improved design with optimal separation performance. It is found that changing relative lengths of <b>branch</b> <b>channels</b> is effective to both uniformity of flow rate ratio among bifurcations and reduction of difference of the flow velocities between the <b>branch</b> <b>channels,</b> whereas extending the length of the main channel from bifurcation region is only effective for uniformity of flow rate ratio...|$|R

Here, we investigate the separation behaviors of nonspherical and spherical particles∕cells in the hydrodynamic filtration (HDF) scheme, which was previously developed for continuous size-dependent particle∕cell separation. Nonspherical particle models were prepared by coating the hemisphere of spherical polymer particles with a thin Au layer and by bonding the Janus particles to form twins and triplets resembling dividing and aggregating cells, respectively. High-speed imaging revealed {{a difference in the}} separation behaviors of spherical and nonspherical particles at a branch point; nonspherical particles showed rotation behavior and did not enter the <b>branch</b> <b>channel</b> even when their minor axis was smaller than the virtual width of the flow region entering the <b>branch</b> <b>channel,</b> w 1. The confocal-laser high-speed particle intensity velocimetry system visualized the flow profile inside the HDF microchannel, demonstrating that the steep flow-velocity distribution at the branch point is the main factor causing the rotation behavior of nonspherical particles. As applications, we successfully separated spherical and nonspherical particles with various major∕minor lengths and also demonstrated the selection of budding∕single cells from a yeast cell mixture. We therefore conclude that the HDF scheme can be used for continuous shape-based particle∕cell separation...|$|E

Results from experiments examining flow boiling in fractal-like <b>branching</b> <b>channels</b> are also reported.

The channel pressure drops varied from 20 kPa to 90 kPa. These results were also compared to results from the 1 -D model, and the model showed good agreement with the pressure drop results.
