Amsterdam 1768 page 124.) impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive knowledge, but of his truthfulness: he says that bulbs of blue and red hyacinths may be cut in two, {{and that they will}} grow together and throw up a united stem (and this I have myself seen) with flowers of the two colours on the opposite sides. But the remarkable point is, that flowers are sometimes produced with the two <b>colours</b> <b>blended</b> together, which makes the case closely analogous with that of the <b>blended</b> <b>colours</b> of the grapes on the united vine branches.|$|R

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{is a fine}} shading meant to produce a soft transition between colours and tones, {{in order to achieve}} a more believable image. It is most often used by making subtle gradations that do not include lines or borders, from areas of light to areas of dark. The technique was used not only to give an elusive and illusionistic rendering of the human face but also to create rich atmospheric effects. Leonardo da Vinci described the technique as <b>blending</b> <b>colours,</b> without the use of lines or borders [...] "in the manner of smoke".|$|R
50|$|Direct3D is a {{graphics}} {{application programming interface}} (API) for Microsoft Windows. Part of DirectX, Direct3D is used {{to render}} three-dimensional graphics in applications where performance is important, such as games. Direct3D uses hardware acceleration if it {{is available on the}} graphics card, allowing for hardware acceleration of the entire 3D rendering pipeline or even only partial acceleration. Direct3D exposes the advanced graphics capabilities of 3D graphics hardware, including Z-buffering, W-buffering, stencil buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, alpha <b>blending,</b> <b>colour</b> <b>blending,</b> mipmapping, texture blending, clipping, culling, atmospheric effects, perspective-correct texture mapping, programmable HLSL shaders and effects. Integration with other DirectX technologies enables Direct3D to deliver such features as video mapping, hardware 3D rendering in 2D overlay planes, and even sprites, providing the use of 2D and 3D graphics in interactive media ties.|$|R
2500|$|In 1885 he met Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, {{both of whom}} {{relied on}} a more [...] "scientific" [...] theory of {{painting}} by using very small patches of pure colours {{to create the illusion}} of <b>blended</b> <b>colours</b> and shading when viewed from a distance. Pissarro then spent the years from 1885 to 1888 practising this more time-consuming and laborious technique, referred to as pointillism. The paintings that resulted were distinctly different from his Impressionist works, and were on display in the 1886 Impressionist Exhibition, but under a separate section, along with works by Seurat, Signac, and his son Lucien.|$|R

50|$|In the 19th century {{a number}} of {{different}} methods of colour printing using woodcut (technically Chromoxylography) were developed in Europe. George Baxter patented in 1835 a method using an intaglio line plate (or occasionally a lithograph), printed in black or a dark colour, and then overprinted with up to twenty different colours from woodblocks. Edmund Evans used relief and wood throughout, with up to eleven different colours, and latterly specialized in illustrations for children's books, using fewer blocks but overprinting non-solid areas of <b>colour</b> to achieve <b>blended</b> <b>colours.</b> Artists such as Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane and Kate Greenaway were influenced by the Japanese prints now available and fashionable in Europe to create a suitable style, with flat areas of colour.|$|R
50|$|The white opaque surface makes {{tin glaze}} a good base for painted {{decoration}}. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly cobalt oxide for blue, copper oxide for green, iron oxide for brown, manganese dioxide for purple-brown and antimony for yellow. Late Italian maiolica blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called istoriato. To these oxides modern potters {{are able to}} add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes fritted. In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and <b>blended</b> <b>colours</b> which were {{not strong enough to}} penetrate the opaque glaze made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.|$|R
50|$|Different {{texture mapping}} {{algorithms}} exist, e.g.: single image texturing, texture <b>colour</b> <b>blending</b> or view-dependant texturing. The single image texturing approach is often used, {{due to its}} simplicity and efficiency.|$|R

40|$|The {{optimisation}} of {{dry powder}} pharmaceutical blending is very challenging, and often relies on costly and time consuming trial-and-error approaches which waste {{a lot of}} material. A novel method has been developed {{which can be used}} in place of the drug to quickly and effectively evaluate the progression of a dry powder mixing. By blending a small amount of colour tracer with the pharmaceutical formulation bulk, a vast amount of information on blend kinetics and behaviour can be extracted. Information on the degree of tracer spread and breakup can be obtained from measurement of the <b>blend’s</b> <b>colour,</b> as well as providing quantitative insight into the energy input to the blend and its uniformity. It {{can also be used to}} identify conditions which may cause unintentional and undesirable particle damage during blending. By reducing the amount of drug required in preliminary testing, the colour tracer method provides a cost effective means of ensuring equivalent blending conditions between mixer types, scales and operating conditions...|$|R

25|$|Staging and {{presentation}} {{were of a}} high standard, {{under the direction of}} Louis P. Verande (assisted by George King), from Covent Garden where he had been responsible for the staging of Thomas Beecham's controversial 1910 Salome. Verande also had extensive Continental and American experience. All the costumes were designed by Dorothy Carleton Smyth from Glasgow, an authority on historical pageant and theatrical costumes, who travelled with the company. Quinlan pointed out that she concentrated on a harmoniously <b>blended</b> <b>colour</b> scheme, eschewing extraneous spangles and similar gewgaws. The sets for all the operas were designed by Oliver Percy Bernard, from the Boston Opera, and set models for the Puccini operas were first passed by the composer; while Humperdinck, Debussy, Cosima Wagner, Ricordi and other authorities lent their assistance with others. Quinlan claimed the largest scenic studio in England and said that a great deal of research had been done on the historical accuracy of stage accessories. The cost of moving the company and all the baggage — 365 tons of scenery, props and costumes — around the world was £100,000.|$|R
5000|$|To make {{a relief}} print, the printer {{began with a}} wood block, {{engraved}} {{the image on the}} block by carving out areas that were not to be printed (or inked). A wood block was carved for each primary colours, with the coloured ink coating the areas left in relief. Gascoigne explains that the process required a [...] "master craftsman sit with an original painting {{in front of him and}} work out which areas of the image should be printed in which of the available colours to achieve the desired effect." [...] The printer engraved the image to the finer end grain of the woodblock. For more complicated work the carver worked on the end grain of the wood, and with the use of fine hatchings to the wood that were inked separately achieved the look of <b>blended</b> <b>colours.</b> For the children's book market, which had lower profit margins, the printer would use fewer ink colours, which could be optimised by mixing colours such as blue and yellow to create green.|$|R

40|$|Colour {{matching}} between carded {{and finished}} fibres {{is an important}} challenge for textile industry. The straightforward approach for mixing together some differently coloured fibres {{in order to obtain}} a blend of a desired colour is to perform a trial and error approach starting from a given colour recipe and optimizing it with several attempts. Unfortunately, dyeing process so as the carding procedure may result in a carded fibre whose colour is different from the desired one. As a consequence textile companies have to modify the original recipe {{in order to reduce the}} gap between the colour of the final product and the desired one. The present work describes a model able to simulate the colour mixing of fibres in order to assess the best recipe. The model consists in two modules: a “prediction module” predicts the <b>colour</b> of a <b>blend</b> obtained by mixing together several fibres; an “optimization module” is used to optimize the final recipe. The devised system has been tested for optimizing the recipe of a set of 200 blends. The mean error in predicting the <b>blend</b> <b>colour</b> is about 15 % with a variance of 0. 165. The time for optimizing the recipe is reduced by 92 %...|$|R
