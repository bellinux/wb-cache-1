40|$|In {{designing}} and building persistent object systems we {{are attempting to}} regularise the activities on data that are traditional in programming languages, operating systems, database management systems and file systems. We hypothesise that regularity and simplicity may be achieved by regarding the exercise as one of designing a language powerful enough to allow for all our programming needs and using some principles {{in the design of}} the language to achieve this regularity and simplicity. In this paper we investigate the nature of <b>binding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> showing how some form of dynamic binding is necessary for persistence. The <b>binding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of Ada, which has a traditional file based view of persistence, and of Napier, which has an object based view, are used as illustrations. 1.

25|$|Since {{the front}} form of {{dynamics}} aims at explaining hadrons as bound states of quarks and gluons, and the <b>binding</b> <b>mechanism</b> is not describable using perturbation theory, {{the definition of}} a theory needed in this case cannot be limited to perturbative expansions. For example, it is not sufficient to construct a theory using regularization of loop integrals order-by-order and correspondingly redefining the masses, coupling constants, and field normalization constants also order-by-order. In other words, one needs to design the Minkowski space-time formulation of a relativistic theory that is not based on any a priori perturbative scheme. The front form of Hamiltonian dynamics is perceived by many researchers as the most suitable framework for this purpose among the known options.|$|E
500|$|An {{antibody}} (Ab), {{also known}} as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells {{that is used by}} the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen, via the Fab's variable region. Each tip of the [...] "Y" [...] of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this <b>binding</b> <b>mechanism,</b> an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance. The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region (located {{at the base of the}} [...] "Y"), which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions. The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system.|$|E
2500|$|Studies on the <b>binding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitors {{show that they}} have two reversible steps with both COX-1 and COX-2, but the selectivity for COX-2 is due to another step that is slow and irreversible and is seen only in the inhibition of COX-2, not COX-1. The irreversible step {{has been attributed to}} the presence of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) that fits into the side-pocket of COX-2. This has been studied using SC-58125 (an analogue of celecoxib) and mutated COX-2, wherein the valine 523 residue was replaced by isoleucine 523. The irreversible inhibition did not happen, but reversible inhibition was noticed. A model has been made to explain this three-step mechanism behind the inhibitory effects {{of selective}} COX-2 inhibitors. The first step accounts for the contact of the inhibitor with the gate of the hydrophobic channel (called the lobby region). The second step could account for the movement of the inhibitor from the lobby region to the active site of the COX enzyme. The last step probably represents repositioning of the inhibitor at the active site, which leads to strong interactions of the phenylsulfonamide or phenylsulfone group of the inhibitor and the amino acids of the side pocket. It is directly inhibition to postaglanding ...|$|E
40|$|Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK 2) is {{a crucial}} {{regulator}} of the eukaryotic cell cycle. However it is well established that monomeric CDK 2 lacks regulatory activity, which needs to be aroused by its positive regulators, cyclins E and A, or be phosphorylated on the catalytic segment. Interestingly, these activation steps bring some dynamic changes on the 3 D-structure of the kinase, especially the activation segment. Until now, in the monomeric CDK 2 structure, three binding sites have been reported, including the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site (Site I) and two non-competitive binding sites (Site II and III). In addition, when the kinase is subjected to the cyclin binding process, the resulting structural changes {{give rise to a}} variation of the ATP binding site, thus generating an allosteric binding site (Site IV). All the four sites are demonstrated as being targeted by corresponding inhibitors, as is illustrated by the allosteric binding one which is targeted by inhibitor ANS (ﬂuorophore 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonate). In the present work, the <b>binding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and their fluctuations during the activation process attract our attention. Therefore, we carry out corresponding studies on the structural characterization of CDK 2, which are expected to facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of kinase proteins. Besides, the <b>binding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of CDK 2 with its relevant inhibitors, as well as the changes of <b>binding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> following conformational variations of CDK 2, are summarized and compared.

40|$|Layer Manufacturing (LM) {{technologies}} like Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) {{were developed in}} the late 80 ’s as techniques for Rapid Prototyping (RP). Today, SLS- {{as well as its}} derived technology Selective Laser Melting (SLM) - is used as well for prototyping, tooling and manufacturing purposes. This widening of applications is caused mainly by the possibility to process a large variety of materials, resulting in a broad range of physical and mechanical properties. This paper presents a survey of the various <b>binding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in SLS and SLM, which are responsible for the broad range of materials and applications. Basic <b>binding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> involve solid state sintering, chemically induced binding, liquid phase sintering, partial melting and full melting.

Our traditional view of the persistent information space is that it will subsume the functions of a plethora of mechanisms currently supported by components such as command languages, editors, file systems, compilers and interpreters, linkage editors and binders, debuggers, DBMS sublanguages and graphics libraries[1]. The information space is composed of objects, which may be simple or highly structured, defined by the universe of discourse of the type system 2 of the PISA arch...|$|R
