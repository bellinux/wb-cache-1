ETT placement was randomized to tracheal or esophageal location. Three US experts and 45 emergency medicine residents (EMR) performed a total of 150 scans. The primary outcome was the overall sensitivity and specificity of both experts and EMRs to detect location of ETT placement. Secondary outcomes included a priori subgroup comparison of experts and EMRs for thin and obese cadavers, time to detection, and level of operator confidence. Results: Experts had a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI = 72 % to 100 %) and specificity of 100 % (95 % CI = 77 % to 100 %) on thin, and a sensitivity of 93 % (95 % CI = 66 % to 100 %) and specificity of 100 % (95 % CI = 75 % to 100 %) on obese cadavers. EMRs had a sensitivity of 91 % (95 % CI = 69 % to 98 %) and of specificity 96 % (95 % CI = 76 % to 100 %) on thin, and a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI = 82 % to 100 %) specificity of 48 % (95 % CI = 27 % to 69 %) on obese cadavers. The overall mean time to detection was 17 seconds (95 % CI = 13 seconds to 20 seconds, range: 2 to 63 seconds) for US experts and 29 seconds (95 % CI = 25 seconds to 33 seconds; range: 6 to 120 seconds) for EMRs. There was a statistically significant decrease in the specificity of this technique on obese cadavers when comparing the EMRs and experts, {{as well as an}} increased overall time to detection among the EMRs. Conclusion: The simplified 4 <b>S</b> <b>technique</b> was accurate and rapid for US experts. Among novices, the 4 <b>S</b> <b>technique</b> was accurate in thin, but appears less accurate in obese cadavers.

This study examined the diagnostic validity of semiquantitative swab cultures obtained using Levine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>technique</b> and compared semiquantitative and quantitative swab cultures. Two swab specimens were obtained from a sample of 44 chronic wounds using Levine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>technique.</b> One was processed using quantitative laboratory procedures and the other using semiquantitative laboratory procedures. The diagnostic validity of the findings from each swab culture process was determined by associating the culture findings of each with quantitative tissue cultures (reference standard) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and by evaluating concordance. The area under the curve (AUC) of the semiquantitative swab culture was 0. 639, which was not significantly higher than the. 50 diagonal chance (P = 0. 0501), suggesting a non-informative test. The AUC for quantitative swab cultures was 0. 821.
