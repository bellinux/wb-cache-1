5|$|<b>Basil</b> cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth <b>basil</b> and Lettuce leaf <b>basil</b> to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush <b>basil.</b> More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the <b>basil</b> varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any <b>basil</b> contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
5|$|<b>Basil</b> cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} <b>basil.</b> They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of <b>basil,</b> most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet <b>basil.</b> Some are cultivars of other <b>basil</b> species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a <b>basil</b> belongs to. This is because <b>basil</b> cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} the throne, Ivan Vladislav immediately sent a delegation to <b>Basil</b> II, which arrived {{five days after}} the fall of Maglen. In his letter, Ivan Vladislav notified <b>Basil</b> that he had personally murdered Gavril Radomir and had seized all the power in the country and promised <b>Basil</b> deep humility and obedience, an act of submission which some in the nobility supported. After Ivan Vladislav firmly secured his hold on the throne, however, he openly declared to be against any kind of compromise with the Byzantines and quickly began to follow the determined policy of his predecessors against the ongoing Byzantine conquest. <b>Basil</b> II soon understood that Ivan Vladislav's letter was a ruse and plotted a retaliatory action, bribing the kavkhan Theodore, who was in Byzantine captivity, to murder the Bulgarian ruler. Theodore in turn paid a trusted man in Ivan Vladislav's employ to commit the murder, but in the event the assassin actually killed Theodore himself. In the meantime <b>Basil</b> II continued his march, forcing the Bulgarian emperor to retreat to the Albanian mountains, and advanced {{into the heart of the}} Bulgarian state. The Byzantines took the capital Ohrid and burned the imperial palaces; news, however, arrived that Ivan Vladislav had laid siege to Dyrrhachium and that to the south the Bulgarian general Ibatzes had defeated the Byzantine rear army near Bitola. With his supply routes cut, <b>Basil</b> II had to retreat back to Thessalonica leaving a small garrison in Ohrid, which was swiftly retaken by the Bulgarians. Back in his base at Mosynopolis, <b>Basil</b> divided the Byzantine army to harass the areas of Strumitsa and Sofia. In January 1016 the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his great}} authority, Bardas's {{control over his}} nephew was not absolute: after he managed {{to persuade him to}} dismiss his old chamberlain (parakoimomenos), Damian, Michael {{appointed}} to the post not one of Bardas's own protégés, but his favourite companion, the ruthlessly ambitious <b>Basil</b> the Macedonian. Bardas's own position was further weakened in early 866, when Michael learned that Eudokia Ingerina was pregnant with the future Leo VI: hitherto Bardas stood to succeed to the throne if anything should happen to the emperor, but now Michael had a direct heir. Instead of divorcing his wife and marrying his long-time mistress, however, Michael married off Ingerina to <b>Basil</b> instead, who divorced his own wife first. In spring of the same year, Bardas began assembling a large-scale expedition against the Saracen stronghold of Crete. Accompanied by Michael, <b>Basil</b> and the court, Bardas made for Miletus, where the army was assembling. There, on 21 April 866, he was murdered by <b>Basil,</b> ostensibly for plotting against the emperor.|$|E

5|$|In {{retaliation}} against Mansur's reneging {{on their}} deal, Salih attacked Aleppo and prevented movement {{into and out}} of the city. This caused severe hardship for its inhabitants and Mansur was unable to challenge the Kilab alone. He thus appealed for support from <b>Basil</b> II, warning him that the Bedouin uprising was bound to harm the Byzantine Empire. <b>Basil</b> II agreed and dispatched 1,000 Armenian soldiers to assist Mansur, but they were soon after withdrawn when Salih convinced <b>Basil</b> II of Mansur's treachery and promised the emperor of his goodwill toward him. <b>Basil</b> II may have actually withdrawn his men to avoid antagonizing the Kilab or, more importantly, the Kilab's Numayrid kinsmen and allies, who posed a more immediate threat to Byzantine territory. In any case, Mansur's position was further weakened as a consequence.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{agreement}} between Salih and Mansur fell through {{as the latter}} abandoned most of his promises to Salih, including giving his daughter's hand in marriage and according the Kilab their share of Aleppo's revenues. Salih retaliated by besieging Aleppo, while the Kilab and their Bedouin allies plundered the countryside. Mansur appealed for Byzantine intervention and warned Emperor <b>Basil</b> II that if left unchecked, the Bedouin uprising could spread to his territory. <b>Basil</b> dispatched 1,000 Armenian relief troops in response, but withdrew them after Salih informed him of Mansur's treachery and pledged his goodwill to the Byzantines. <b>Basil</b> may have also acquiesced to Salih to avoid provoking Bedouin raids against his territory as the emirates of both the Kilab and their Numayri kinsmen bordered the Byzantines. The withdrawal of Byzantine troops weakened Mansur's position further and strengthened Salih, who dispatched {{one of his sons}} to Constantinople to pay allegiance to <b>Basil.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} was abandoned while Michael and <b>Basil</b> returned to Constantinople, where Michael adopted {{his friend and}} made him co-emperor.

5|$|When the Byzantine emperor <b>Basil</b> II {{ascended the}} throne in 976, {{he made the}} {{destruction}} of independent Bulgaria his first ambition. Opposing him were the Western Bulgarians, now led by Samuel of Bulgaria. <b>Basil</b> II's first campaign was disastrous, the emperor barely escaping with his life when the Bulgarians annihilated the Byzantine army in the Gates of Trajan Pass in 986.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, <b>Basil</b> II {{advanced}} towards Strumitsa, {{which was}} key to holding the whole Vardar valley. On {{their way to}} the city, the Byzantines seized the Matsukion fortress to the east of their advance. The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica. With the remainder of his troops, <b>Basil</b> laid siege to the city itself. The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications, but he and his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley, soon after their task was complete. In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear. As a result, <b>Basil</b> II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat. On the return, the eloquence of the cubicularius Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender, another heavy blow for the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south.|$|E

5|$|After {{putting an}} end to the {{internal}} strife, <b>Basil</b> II launched a counter-campaign against the Arabs in 995. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's position in the east, and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch under threat. <b>Basil</b> won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south. Although {{he did not have the}} force to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire — including the larger city of Antioch which was the seat of its eponymous Patriarch.|$|E

5|$|<b>Basil</b> II is {{considered}} among the most capable Byzantine emperors and his reign as {{the apex of the}} empire in the Middle Ages.

Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, and the reconquest of Crete, Cyprus, and the important city of Antioch. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.|$|E
