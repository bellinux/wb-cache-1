5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line.

This study is intended: (a) to analyze the urgency of service based on various attributes of servicing dimensions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staffs</b> of Manpower and Transmigration Service in North Moluccas Province towards the transmigrants in transmigration areas; (b) to analyze satisfaction of the service based on various attributes of servicing dimensions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staffs</b> of Manpower and Transmigration Service in North Moluccas Province towards the transmigrants in transmigration areas; (c) to analyze service expectation based on various attributes of servicing dimensions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staffs</b> of Manpower and Transmigration Service in North Moluccas Province towards the transmigrants in transmigration areas; and (d) to analyze the relationships among servicing of satisfaction and expectation with the various attributes of servicing dimensions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staffs</b> of Manpower and Transmigration Service in North Moluccas Province towards the transmigrants. 	The method applied in this study is by field survey with descriptive approach directly on the sites. In this regard, the respondents are determined through purposive sampling for the unit head level, and by random sampling for the common respondents/transmigrants. 	Moreover, analyzing the implementation on the urgency of service, satisfaction and expectation towards the transmigrants based on such various attributes of servicing dimensions are performed through Criteria Range Analyze, IPA (Importance Performance Analyze), with Cartesian diagram and Spearman Rank Analyze. 	Through such analyzes of criteria range, and Spearman rank, in general, the result shows that there are significant positive correlations between the urgency of the service and expectation based on such various attributes of servicing dimensions. Adversely, there is no correlation between the urgency of the service and satisfaction and also between satisfaction and expectation on the service, based on such various attributes of servicing dimensions. While the result of IPA analyze shows that the urgency of the service and satisfaction, the whole attributes of servicing dimensions, have been included on the four quadrants (namely the quadrants of A, B, C, and D) resulted...|$|R

Initially, Tito had been in favour of continuing the attack on the SS paratroopers, but after reassessing the situation, he cancelled further attacks. As the German intention to encircle the Supreme Command in a small area around Drvar with approaching units, and then destroy it with land forces had become apparent by now, serious reorganisation of Partisan dispositions was now required. After German troops were observed in the area of Potoci, Tito and his companions were escorted towards Kupres.|$|E
5|$|Grič Tunnel was not {{mentioned}} again in media until 1993, when {{it served as}} the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> of the TV show Top DJ Mag, and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, far more than the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating Earth Day. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95), the tunnel saw some use in its intended capacity as an air raid shelter. During this time, temporary toilets were built at the Radić Street exit.|$|E

5|$|The Z-3 formed part of {{the bomber}} {{versions}} of the Z series, it was, however, also used as a reconnaissance aircraft <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> flight of the particular unit. The engines and the general equipment were identical to the Z-2 standard; however two cameras — the Rb 50/30 and Rb 20/30 - were incorporated into the crew entry hatch. A handheld camera was issued to the crew to validate the success during bombing missions. Autopilot equipment was added later. The Z-2 and Z-3 were identical visually, and could only be distinguished from each other by the altered crew hatch on the Z-3. Owing to spacing problems because of the added camera equipment, the ammunition supply was reduced from 44 to 42 magazines. The power plant of the Z-3 was upgraded to the Bramo 323P-2. The Bramo P-2 remained the engine of all the remaining Z series variants.|$|E

While the series is known for the extensive action in its episodes, the director believes everything he wanted viewers to see was presented.

5|$|Run by the Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Church {{until its}} closure, the orphanage housed males from {{the ages of}} 5 to 16 initially. Its {{capacity}} {{was intended to be}} 100 children, but this peaked to more than 200 during the Second World War. By the 1970s, the orphanage began taking in female orphans from St. Joseph's because of declining numbers of males. Until its closure, the orphanage took in more than 2,500 individuals for various reasons. Only four per cent of those who stayed there were actually orphans. The orphanage's residents were given a religious education, and were trained in agriculture. Accounts by former residents state that they suffered severe beatings and punishments, and that they were issued a single set of clothing that was rarely washed. Another claims that some residents endured sexual abuse and rape, not only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff,</b> but by older boys, and the caretaker.

5|$|As {{the plans}} for three {{different}} versions of the game appeared, the staff realized {{that it was impossible to}} write three storylines in-house. After searching through known video game writers, they decided to consider writers in other fields. The writer suggested by Maeda was Shin Kibayashi, who was famous in Japan for his work on multiple manga and television series. Kibayashi was initially approached by Kozaki through their shared editor, and was pitched the project <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> in December 2012. Kibayashi was going to refuse the project as he had a tight work schedule, but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of Awakening provided by staff, Kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story. Despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten-page summary for each storyline, he became fond of the characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough, and thus the full summary for Birthright extended to about 500 pages. After delivering his work, he then wrote summaries of equal length for Conquest and Revelation, driven by the need to create a high-quality story, partially to surpass his daughter's pressuring expectations, and ended up writing enough script to fill two books. While the Japanese titles for Birthright and Conquest were written in kanji, the third storyline's title was written in katakana to distinguish it from the other two. A great deal of the character traits for the royals of Hoshido and Nohr were contributed by Kibayashi. After he had done his work on the storylines, other writers took over much of the rest of the work. The main scenario writer for the Revelation storyline was Yukinori Kitajima, a writer associated with the Senran Kagura series. He and other staff from his company Synthese also wrote the support conversations for Birthright and Conquest. One of the principal writers for all three story routes was Nami Komuro, who had previously worked on Awakening.|$|E
