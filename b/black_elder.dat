40|$|Introduction: Pain can {{negatively}} affect {{quality of life}} for <b>Black</b> <b>elders.</b> They are less likely to report pain concerns and have voiced pain needs adequately met. To better understand the pain management experiences and concerns of <b>Black</b> <b>elders,</b> an ethnographic study was completed within an urban, low-income, elder housing facility. Methods: 106 participants completed a questionnaire comprised of a demographic tool, the PROMIS Global Health Scale (PROMIS), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and the Psychological Stress Measure (PSM- 9). Additionally, participant observation, informal interviews, and 20 formal recorded interviews with individuals identified as having pain were completed. Qualitative and frequency analysis and were finished using NVIVO 10 qualitative data analysis software, and IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Results indicate that 86 percent of the sample had an average pain rating of 7 on a 0 to 10 scale with 5 pain sites. Pain interference, was about 4, on a 0 to 10 scale. Specific areas of interference areas included general activity (5. 59), walking (5. 73) and normal work (5. 7). Participants preferred nonpharmacological treatments for pain such as exercise and Epsom salt soaks along with non-opioid analgesics that came in cream/liquid form. Preferences were related to concerns with side effects, fears of addiction, and provider mistrust. Prescription medications most commonly used for pain included hydrocodone with acetaminophen, acetaminophen with codeine, tramadol, and Ibuprophen. 17 percent of the population took no pain medications. Global physical health scores for patients with pain were 36, while Global mental health scores were about 44. Respectively 2 and 0. 5 standard deviations lower than the US norms. Mild to moderate stress was reported by the PSM- 9. Adaptive coping strategies used by participants to manage pain included: remaining positive, exercise/ remaining active, being engaged in the community, prayer/meditation, and maintaining positive support systems. Poverty was an additional stressor to managing pain. Discussion: Pain management may be improved in <b>Black</b> <b>elders</b> by proving balanced health information—in written form—with both benefits and burdens of treatments, questioning and discussing medication concerns in-office, increasing patient follow-up post-office visit for pain related visits, and increasing provider familiarity with commonly used home remedies and treatments...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the sources of depressive symptoms experienced by frail Black and Hispanic elderly persons experienced in terms of life strain/stresses and coping resources. Overall, results indicate that women in both groups express more depressive symptoms than do men; and Hispanic elders report more depressive symptoms than do <b>Black</b> <b>elders.</b> Common predictors {{for the two groups}} were being female, greater numbers of physical illnesses, poor perceived health, more perceived unmet needs, and less sense of control in life. Unique predictors for the <b>Black</b> <b>elders</b> were a higher level of impairment in instrumental activities of daily living, loss of a significant other, involuntary relocation, and fewer formal care providers. For Hispanic elders, the unique predictor of depressive symptoms was few informal helpers. In comparison with the overall older population, ethnic minority elderly persons have been the most underserved by the mental health system (Butler, Lewis, & Sunderland, 1991). Many elders from other countries still have a strong sense of ethnic identity and therefore have different worldviews, norms, and beliefs that may have an impact on their adjustment to old age as well as on their ability to cope with frailty and chronic life stresses. In 1980, more than 10 % (2. 5 million) of the elderly population were persons of a ethnic minority group.

Major barriers to optimum health for older rural Blacks are a {{lack of confidence in}} the formal health care system, greater rates of poverty than urban elders, geographic isolation, and lack of access to health care and to social supports; for older Black women, barriers include attitudes that reflect an overestimation of health, health pessimism, a lack of confidence in the health care system, lower economic resources, and major family responsibilities that affect the availability of money for, and time to seek, health care; and for older-aged Blacks, barriers are lack of confi-dence in the formal health care system, dependence on informal supports for health care and an underutilization of formal supports, and lower socioeconomic levels due to this cohort’s education and occupational status. Implications for theory, policy, and practice are discussed.

To describe the importance and to estimate the influence of cattle on groves, the behavior of cattle around trees and shrubs was observed on six semi-open pastures in the mountain range of Thuringia and the Southern Black Forest (Germany). The groves were divided into formations, species and structures. The cattle used the groves more for browsing than rubbing. Significantly preferred species calculated by Chesson-Index were dogwood (Cornus sanguinea), <b>black</b> <b>elder</b> (Sambucus nigra), fly honeysuckle (Lonicera xylosteum), plum (Prunus domestica), osier (Salix viminalis), white beam (Sorbus chamaemespilus), and guelder rose (Viburnum opulus).

To compare {{the extent to which}} different risk domains (comorbidity, smoking, socioeconomic status (SES), self-rated health, and cognitive function) explain more frequent functional decline in <b>black</b> <b>elders,</b> we studied 779 black and 4892 white community-dwelling adults aged 70 and older from the Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD), a population-based cohort study begun in 1993. Our primary outcome was worse functional status at 2 years than at baseline. We used logistic regression to compare the unadjusted with the adjusted black–white odds ratios (ORs) after adjusting for each risk domain. Results. At baseline black participants aged 70 – 79 had higher rates of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension; lower SES; and worse cognitive function than did white participants (p,. 05 for all).

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>elder</b> (Sambucus nigra L.) {{commonly}} occurs {{throughout the}} country – {{it can be found}} in forests, thickets, parks, balks or in home gardens. It is a valuable reservoir of food for beneficial insects and a place of refuge or wintering. Almost every part of the elderberry plant has some uses: the fruits, flowers, leaves, roots, pith and bark. Its fruits and flowers are used in herbal medicine and in the kitchen. S. nigra is a primary host of Aphis sambuci L. feeding, which weakens plant growth, reduces flowering and fruiting, and decreases the ornamental value of these shrubs. Aphid populations are limited by a group of predatory and parasitic organisms, among which an important role is played by predatory Syrphidae. Observations were conducted in the years 2009 and 2010 in Krakow (south Poland, 19 ° 57 ’E, 50 ° 03 ’N). Significantly more numerous A. sambuci colonies were observed in 2009 – in the maximum of their abundance, 960 specimens per shoot were noted.

The reconstruction of past debris-flow activity was, in contrast, only very rarely based on growth anomalies in broad-leaved trees. Consequently, this study aimed at dating the occurrence of former debris flows from growth series of broad-leaved trees and at determining their suitability for dendrogeomorphic research. Results were obtained from gray alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench), silver birch and pubescent birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), aspen (Populus tremula L.), white poplar, black poplar and gray poplar (Populus alba L., Populus nigra L. and Populus x canescens (Ait.) Sm.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) and <b>black</b> <b>elder</b> (Sambucus nigra L.) injured by debris-flow activity at Illgraben (Valais, Swiss Alps). Tree-ring analysis of 104 increment cores, 118 wedges and 93 cross-sections from 154 injured broad-leaved trees allowed the reconstruction of 14 debris-flow events between AD 1965 and 2007. These events were compared with archival records on debris-flow activity at Illgraben. It appears that debris flows are very common at Illgraben, but only very rarely left the channel over the period AD 1965 – 2007. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of disturbed trees contributed to the identification of six patterns of debris-flow routing and led to the determination of preferential breakout locations of events.
