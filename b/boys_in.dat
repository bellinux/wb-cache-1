5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} {{wanted to make}} a sequel to <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> the Sand. In 1984, they finally shot <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> the Sand II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> the Sand II until 1986 and {{with the advent of the}} home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> the Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.|$|E

5|$|Although many {{of these}} early schools were open for only a short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest, {{continuously}} operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario.

5000|$|<b>Boy</b> <b>in</b> Darkness is a novella {{written by}} Mervyn Peake. It was first {{published}} in 1956 by Eyre & Spottiswoode as part of the anthology Sometime, Never: Three Tales of Imagination (with other stories by William Golding and John Wyndham). A corrupt version of <b>Boy</b> <b>in</b> Darkness was published both in an anthology, The Inner Landscape (1969), and separately in 1976 with an introduction by Peake's widow, Maeve Gilmore. Referring to the corrupt text, she wrote that [...] "although the <b>Boy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>in</b> Darkness is assuredly Titus Groan, Peake did not call him so by name"; however, adding the name Titus was one of the specific changes that Peake made between writing and publishing his novella. The correct text has recently become available again in an anthology entitled <b>Boy</b> <b>in</b> Darkness and Other Stories, with a foreword by Joanne Harris and a preface by Peake's son Sebastian, as well as Maeve Gilmore's uncorrected introduction from 1976.|$|R

5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo.
