500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{focuses on the}} yearning desire {{to be with a}} loved one for Christmas, {{regardless}} of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, <b>bass</b> <b>effect,</b> and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment. Slates Ragusea counts [...] "at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other places. (You might also analyze it as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate)." [...] According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains [...] "The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set." [...] In a piece on the song in Vogue, a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: [...] "those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back then. I think that's what gives it that timeless, classic quality." ...|$|E
