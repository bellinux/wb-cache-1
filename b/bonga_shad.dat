50|$|Ethmalosa fimbriata, the <b>bonga</b> <b>shad</b> or just bonga, is a shad, a clupeid fish, {{that occurs}} along the coasts and in {{brackish}} water of coastal lagoons, {{rivers and lakes}} of western Africa from Dakhla in Western Sahara to Lobito in Angola. It is usually around 25 cm long but the maximum length is 45 cm. It is {{the only member of}} its genus.|$|E
40|$|Small {{pelagics}} are {{the main}} fish resource in North West Africa. In Senegal, these are mainly sardinellas (Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis) and <b>bonga</b> <b>shad</b> (Ethmalosa fimbriata). The fisheries, mainly encircling gillnets and purse seines, are predominantly performed by artisanal fishers and are of great importance for the Senegalese economy and for food security in the region. However, in recent years, the main conditions for these fisheries have changed and recent observations have shown strong declines in profit. An analysis over {{the last twenty years}} (1993 - 2013) show that the fisheries lost profit between 65 % and 100 % while operating costs increased by 25 % and 90 %, for encircling gillnet and purse seine, respectively. While the fuel price dominates as determining factor during the survey period, important other drivers during the last five years were a decrease in fish biomass and an increase in fishing effort...|$|E
40|$|The <b>bonga</b> <b>shad,</b> Ethmalosa fimbriata, is a West African {{pelagic species}} still {{abundant}} in most habitats of its distribution range and {{thought to be}} only recently affected by anthropogenic pressure (habitat destruction or fishing pressure). Its presence {{in a wide range}} of coastal habitats characterised by different hydrodynamic processes, represents a case study useful for evaluating the importance of physical structure of the west African shoreline on the genetic structure of a small pelagic species. To investigate this question, the genetic diversity of E. fimbriata was assessed at both regional and species range scales, using mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear DNA markers. Whereas only three panmictic units were identified with mtDNA at the large spatial scale, nuclear genetic markers (EPIC: exon-primed intron-crossing) indicated a more complex genetic pattern at the regional scale. In the northern-most section of shad’s distribution range, up to 4 distinct units were identified. Bayesian inference as well as spatial autocorrelation methods provided evidence that gene flow is impeded by the presence of deep-water areas near the coastline (restricting the width of the coastal shelf), such as the Cap Timiris and the Kayar canyons in Mauritania and Senegal, respectively. The added discriminatory power provided by the use of EPIC markers proved to be essential to detect the influence of more subtle, contemporary processes (e. g. gene flow, barriers, etc.) acting within the glacial refuge...|$|E
40|$|The {{organochlorine}} pesticide (OCPs) residues were measured in three {{species of fish}} Tilapia zilli (Red belly Tilapia), Ethmalosa fimbriata (<b>Bonga</b> <b>Shad)</b> and Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (Catfish). These fish species are {{a significant part of}} the diet of residents of Lagos Nigeria. The {{organochlorine pesticide}}s analyzed include DDT(pp' 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis-(4 -chlorophenyl) ethane), DDD, DDE (pp 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis-(4 -chlorophenyl) ethylene, HCH (gamma 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexachlorocylohexane, HCB (hexachlorobenzene),Dieldrin (1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10 -hexachloro- 6, 7 -epoxy- 1, 4, 4 a, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8 a octahydro- 1, 4, 5, 8 dimethanonaphthalene) and transnonachlor. The analysis was done using Gas Chromatograph with Electron Capture Detector. The mean concentration of OCPs ranged from 0. 01 - 8. 92 ppm. The concentration of the OCPs (except for HCHs) in fish samples in this study were below the extraneous residue limit of 5 ppm, set by the codex alimentarious commission of FAO-WHO- 1997. However, the concentrations were higher than those detected during previous studies of fish samples from Lake Victoria, Uganda in Africa. Also the levels were quite high when compared with the allowable Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), now Federal Ministry of Environment limit and can be harmful if the trend is not checked. The study also showed that concentration of OCPs were higher in adult, than in Juvenile of most of the fish and there was no correlation observed between fat content and total concentration of OCPs...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the concerted {{influence}} of temperature and salinity on the fecundity of clupeid fishes. Due to a globally changing climate, both physical parameters might act as stressors, severely affecting the reproductive potential of clupeid fish populations inhabiting tropical estuaries. Differences in relative batch fecundities, the gonado-somatic index, and the condition index of <b>bonga</b> <b>shad</b> (Ethmalosa fimbriata) were analysed in individual females sampled at the Senegalese coast and inside the inverse Sine Saloum estuary, where salinity increases upstream in all seasons. Sampling took place at the Senegalese coast and inside the Saloum River from February to October 2014, during the peak of E. fimbriata's spawning season. An additional sampling campaign could be conducted in November 2016. Three different sites were sampled: Joal (Senegalese coast, 14 ° 9. 1 ' N; 16 ° 51. 7 ' W), Djifer (Saloum River's mouth, 13 ° 57. 8 ' N; 16 ° 44. 8 ' W), and Foundiougne (upstream Saloum River, 14 ° 8. 1 ' N; 16 ° 28. 1 ' W). MODIS satellite-derived (Aqua, level 2, 0. 1 degrees) sea surface temperatures ([URL] were assessed at Joal (20 km radius) and Djifer once per sampling week to enhance spatial coverage by avoiding cloud cover. As no remote sensing data for inland waters were available, the Saloum River's surface water temperatures were recorded in situ once per sampling week with a digital thermometer (ama-digit ad 15 th; precision 0. 4 %; accuracy 0. 4 %). Monthly means in MODIS satellite-derived (Aquarius, level 3, 0. 5 degrees) sea surface salinities ([URL] were used to assess the coastal ocean's salinity in a radius of 20 km around Joal. For Djifer and Foundiougne salinity was measured with a handheld refractometer (Aqua Medic; precision 0. 7 %, accuracy 0. 2 %) using a Practical Salinity Scale (PSS- 78). Staging of fish was conducted macroscopically after a key by Blay Jr. & Eyeson (1982). In order to discriminate between mature females with ovaries containing fully hydrated oocytes (stage V) and females that have recently spawned (spent, stage VI) further descriptions on maturity stages in clupeid fishes were consulted (West 1990, ter Hofstede et al. 2007). Conversions of fish fork length (LF) to total length (LT) were conducted using the equation LT = 1. 0007 × LF + 3. 9. In order to access the nutritional status of female fish, a condition index (K) was calculated for each individual using wet weight (WW, ± 0. 1 g), total length (LT, nearest mm), and b of the length-weight relationship: K = WW x LT ^ - 3. 62 x 1000. The condition index (Khyd) and gonado-somatic index (IG) of hydrated female spawners (Stage V) was based on the ovary-free body weight (WOF, ± 0. 1 g) and the ovary weight (WOv, ± 0. 0001 g) : Khyd = WOF x LT ^ - 3. 62 x 1000; IG = WOv x WOF ^ - 1 x 100. The length-weight relationship of all sampled females across all sampling sites could be described by the following function: WW = 0. 0015 x LT ^ 3. 6...|$|E
