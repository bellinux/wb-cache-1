500|$|Cash {{notes that}} when {{constructing}} his orrery, Horsefield asked a local man to manufacture a golden ball {{to represent the}} sun and the man replied that [...] "Aw'll mak' thee one an' charge thee now't for't; <b>but,</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> thee, fancy folk like thee 're a'lus poor". Indeed, he was: all of his interests were indulged despite a background of dire poverty, and he remarked of his celebrity in botanical circles that [...] "fame is not bread". He remained a gingham weaver and during his lifetime the sole financial benefit from his interests came when he raised a new hybrid lily– Tigridia conchiflora– in his garden and sold it to a Manchester nurseryman, Thomas Watkinson, for £10. His poverty caused him to be exempted from contributing to the book fund of the Prestwich Botanical Society from the mid-1820s, and he was later exempted from paying into the liquor funds of both that society and the wider-based group. These concessions demonstrate the extent to which his knowledge was appreciated and occurred despite the teetotal Hobson having to pay into a liquor fund of which by definition he took no advantage. Horsefield received £13 10s. from a subscription that was started in 1853 in another attempt to alleviate his penurious state. After his death on 6 March 1854, Esther, with whom he had six sons and five daughters, received £37 from this fund, and he left 37 bulbs of one of the earliest hybrid daffodils to be cultivated, Narcissus horsefieldii, that raised another £2 11s (£2.55). N. horsefieldii {{became one of the most}} popular and extensively grown varieties of daffodil.|$|E

"We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation.

Not so long ago, you might think, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E

You must not imagine that the northern slope, as I called it, is one smooth and uniform surface of descending land. There are mountains, and valleys, and lakes, and precipices, and waterfalls, and every other variety of mountain scenery scattered all over it, making it a most picturesque and romantic region. It is, however, on the whole, a slope. It begins with comparatively smooth and level land on the north and it terminates in a range of lofty mountain crests on the south; and you have to go over this crest somewhere, by some of the steep and difficult passes that cross it, to get into the central valley. We are on the margin of this slope now. When we leave here and strike into the heart of Switzerland we shall be gradually ascending it. I am going first to a place called Interlachen, which is in a deep valley far up this slope, just under the ridge of mountains. Interlachen is surrounded, in fact, by mountains, and a great many pleasant excursions can be made from it. We shall stop there a few days and make excursions, and then cross over by some of the mountain passes into the valley." ...|$|R
