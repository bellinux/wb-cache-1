This investigation is concerned in the strength of the epoxy-colloidal silica fusion, and not the strength of the join between the bonding surface and the bonding medium. To test this, identical blocks of varying volumes of colloidal silica and epoxy resin were created and tensile tested using a Lloyds LR 30 K tensile testing machine to measure the tensile strength properties. The results collected show a dramatic decrease in strength with the increase in the percentage of volume of colloidal silica. ...|$|R

We tested this instrument further with the Manitoba (Canada) First Nations Regional Health Survey, 2003. Using data from this survey, we investigated the bonding dimension of the social capital conceptual framework, with a total sample of 2, 765 First Nations individuals living in 24 Manitoba First Nations communities. Twenty seven Likert-scale survey questions measured aspects of bonding social capital, socially-invested resources, ethos, and networks. Validation analyses included an evaluation of internal consistency, factor analyses to explore how well the items clustered together into {{the components of the}} social capital framework, and the ability of the items to discriminate across the communities represented in the sample. Cronbach’s Alpha was computed on the 27 scale items, producing an Alpha of 0. 84 indicating high internal consistency. The factor analyses produced five distinct factors with a total explained variance of 54. 3 %. Lastly, a one-way analysis of variance run by community produced highly significant F-ratios between the groups on all twenty-seven <b>bonding</b> <b>items.</b> The culturally-sensitive items included in the social capital framework were found to be an appropriate tool to measure bonding aspects among Manitoba First Nations communities.

30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{items for}} the quantitative research were constructed based on the two selected videos to identify the research problems of this study. Questionnaire items were consists of six major parts: attributes of information source (i.e., attractiveness, expertise, and trustworthiness), content sharing intention, attitude toward product, purchase intention, and emotional <b>bond.</b> Finally, all <b>items</b> except demographic characteristics were measured the 7 -point Likert scale (1 point[*]=[*]’not at all’ and 7 points[*]=[*]’very much’). Participants’ age range varied from teenage girls to women in their 30  s, all with past experience of watching vlogs.

30|$|Further {{results on}} unidimensional IRT scaling of the 32 items {{suggested}} that only 1 item of the PUC step {{did not meet}} the item fit criteria (wMNSQ value above 1.33; Bond and Fox 2007) and was therefore excluded. The exclusion of this item led to a significant improvement in final deviance and favored the IRT model with 31 items (model with 32 items: final deviance dev[*]=[*] 18, 085.76, np[*]=[*] 56; model with 31 items: dev[*]=[*] 17, 344.36, np[*]=[*] 53; model comparison: Δ dev[*]=[*] 741.1, Δnp[*]=[*] 3, p[*]<[*] 0.001). Since the remaining items showed a sufficient fit (wMNSQ values between 0.79 and 1.26, absolute t values below 1.96), we accepted the model with 31 items. In item response theory modelling, one assumption refers to the local independence of <b>items</b> (<b>Bond</b> and Fox 2007). Major violations of this assumption could lead to biased estimates of item difficulties, thresholds, and further model parameters (Wainer et al. 2007). In the present study, we addressed this issue in two ways: First, we designed items that did not necessarily require correct responses from previous items (Koppelt 2011). Second, Scherer (2012, 2014) quantified item dependencies and showed that they were neglectable for the present assessment.|$|R
30|$|For an {{accurate}} measurement, the item difficulty should match the persons’ ability (Baghaei, 2008). For this reason, {{items that were}} extremely easy or extremely difficult for each grade {{were removed from the}} test form. The results of the fit statistics indicated inadequate outfit values for some items and some persons in both tests and in the three grades. The outfit statistic is sensitive to the presence of outliers, i.e., “unexpected behavior by persons on items far from the person measure level” (Linacre, 2011, p. 265). It implies that students with high ability level failed to answer to easy questions and low ability students succeeded on extremely difficult items (de Ayala, 2009). This misfit may be a consequence of ambiguous item wording, random answers or distraction, lack of cooperation and motivation; {{it is also possible that}} the misfit items were not working well with the bulk of the test <b>items</b> (<b>Bond</b> & Fox, 2007; Karabatsos, 2000; Linacre, 2011). Point-measure correlation coefficients were negative for some items; therefore, they were not properly measuring the construct. Following the guidelines by Wright and Linacre (1994) and by Bond and Fox (2007), in the TRC-n and the TRC-e, the items with high outfit values and with negative point-measure correlations were removed from the test forms where they did not work well.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{identified}} capability areas and associated items, the maturity model is now constructed by defining maturity levels, assigning capabilities (items) to maturity levels, and thereby implying improvement paths. In contrast to existing CMMs which mostly define maturity levels generically (“measured”, “self-optimizing”) and assign items intuitively to such levels, {{we aim at}} using a quantitative technique to develop an empirically grounded CMM. Following Dekleva and Drehmer (1997 : 96 ff.) which are supported by various real-world examples (e.g. Lahrmann et al. 2011; Mettler 2011 b), the Rasch algorithm {{has proven to be}} a useful analytical method to determine an evolutionary improvement path. The fundamental idea behind Rasch is that each item included in the questionnaire can be associated with a specific “difficulty” (to achieve the respective capability) and thus the items can be ordered according to this difficulty—and their “difficulty sequence” represents an empirically justified evolution. The algorithm is based on the proposition that highly skilled entities have a high probability of having successfully implemented easy <b>items</b> (<b>Bond</b> and Fox 2007 : 37). By counting the answers that indicate the presence of capabilities, the algorithm calculates two scores: one for the difficulty of items and one for the ability of the surveyed entities. Both scores are measured on the same interval scale, which allows for estimating the likeliness, with which a certain entity masters a certain item. For evaluating the quality of the model, two statistics termed ‘Infit’ and ‘Outfit’ are used. Both assess whether data that have been analysed (items and survey participants) fit the expectations specified in the model. Applied in the context of CMM development, the Rasch analysis allows for the inductive allocation of items onto maturity levels based on the measurement of item difficulty as well as the assessment of surveyed entities based on their capability level (Dekleva and Drehmer 1997 : 97).|$|R
40|$|People feel {{in control}} when they {{effectively}} alter an external environment, their own behavior, {{or their own}} mental state. Past research on control emphasizes the psychological benefits of having environmental control, in which people bring the environment in line with their own wishes. The present research explores self-directed control, in which people adapt to the surrounding environmental context. Environmental control affirms the traditional Western cultural emphasis on an independent, agentic self that separates positively from others. But self-directed control assists an interdependent, contextual self-concept that values merging with and depending on other people. Guided by culturally informed views of the interdependent self and by initial theories on self-directed control (originally 2 ̆ 2 secondary 2 ̆ 2 control; Weisz, Rothbaum, 2 ̆ 6 Blackburn, 1984), the present research develops an individual difference measure of self-directed control. Unlike past views that consider self-directed control a passive alternative to failed environmental control, this report considers how positive, active styles of self-directed control enable people to maintain social <b>bonds.</b> ^ Initial <b>items</b> on the individual difference measure of self-directed control (SDC) reflect field work and re-interpretations of four categories outlined in Weisz, et al. (1984). Exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis reduced the item pool to 21 items that comprise five correlated factors: trusting a higher power: allowing other people to fulfill persona needs; anticipating and adjusting to other people 2 ̆ 7 s needs; merging goals with others; and accepting that bad times will improve on their own. ^ Over 2, 300 participants in seven diverse samples completed the SDC scale. The scale meets traditional psychometric standards. It correlates with measures of interdependence and collectivism and is orthogonal to measures of environmental control, as predicted. The scale is uncorrelated with self-esteem. Women and Hispanics, two groups for whom role requirements and cultural background emphasize interdependence, score higher than men and Anglos, respectively. A diary study confirmed that the SDC scale predicts daily reports of self-directed control, and demonstrated that social situations support self-directed control. The results support the social nature of self-directed control, reveal the importance of trust {{in this type of}} control, and suggest that self-directed control may not engage conscious self-efficacy. ...|$|R
