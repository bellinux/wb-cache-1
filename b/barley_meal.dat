5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by <b>barley</b> <b>meal</b> and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E

In Eastern and Central Europe, barley is also used in soups and stews such as ričet. In Africa, where it is a traditional food plant, it has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.|$|E

In this study, we analyzed the SCFA profiles in urine and serum derived from the colonic fermentation process of C <b>barley</b> <b>meals,</b> prepared from <b>barley</b> grown under CO-atmosphere. Methods: In a crossover study 5 volunteers ingested intact barley kernels (high content of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starch) and barley porridge (high content of NSP only). Using a newly developed stable isotope technology we monitored 14 h and 24 h postprandially C-acetate, C-propionate and C-butyrate in plasma and urine, respectively. The oro-cecal transit time of the meals was measured with the hydrogen breath test. Results: The oro-cecal transit time was 6 h and did not differ between the two test meals. An increase of C-acetate was observed already early after ingestion of the meals (< 6 h) and was attributed to early fermentation of the test meal. A rise in plasma C-propionate in the fermentation phase could only be detected after the porridge and not after the kernel meal. An increase in C-butyrate was only found in the fermentation phase and was higher after the barley kernels. Urine C-short chain fatty acids data were consistent with these observations. Conclusion: The difference in the profiles of C-acetate, C-propionate and C-butyrate indicates that NSP combined with resistant starch results in an altered fermentation profile than dietary fiber alone. key-words: fatty acids, volatile; stable isotope; barley; fermentatio...|$|R

Design: Blood glucose and serum insulin responses were studied after subjects consuming (1) two levels of barley kernels rich in intrinsic RS (15. 2 %, total starch basis) and (2) after a standard breakfast following three different evening meals varying in GI and/or indigestible carbohydrates: pasta, barley kernels and white wheat bread, respectively. Subjects: Healthy adults with normal body mass index. Results: (1) Increasing the portion size of barley kernels from 79. 6 g (50 g ` available carbohydrates') to 93. 9 g (50 g available starch) to adjust for its RS content did not significantly affect the GI or insulin index (II). (2) The low GI <b>barley</b> evening <b>meal,</b> as opposed to white wheat bread and pasta evening meals, reduced the postprandial glycaemic and insulinaemic (23 and 29 %, respectively, P< 0. 05) areas under the curve at a standardized white bread breakfast fed the following morning. Conclusion: (1) Increasing portion size to compensate for the considerable portion of RS in a low GI barley product had no significant impact on GI or II. However, for GI testing, it is recommended to base carbohydrate load on specific analyses of the available carbohydrate content. (2) A low GI <b>barley</b> evening <b>meal</b> containing high levels of indigestible carbohydrates (RS and DF) substantially reduced the GI and II of white wheat bread determined at a subsequent breakfast meal...|$|R

An aqueous liquid amylase formulation from Bacillus licheniformis was tested at 3 enzyme doses (EnzD; 0, 300 and 1, 500 kilo novo units/kg of dry matter) on small (< 750 μm) and large (≥ 750 μm) particle size (PS) of Cm and Bm. Data were analyzed according to a randomized complete block design with a factorial arrangement of treatments; the main tested effects were PS, EnzD, and their interaction. Fermentation run entered in the model as random effect. The mixed rumen fluid was collected from 2 rumen-fistulated Holstein dry dairy cows fed at maintenance (forage:concentrate ratio of 80 : 20; 12 % crude protein; 55 % amylase-treated neutral detergent fiber). Small particles of both Cm and Bm had a greater rate of fermentation and shorter lag time than large particles. The rate of starch degradation was greater for small than for large particles of Bm, being 0. 187 and 0. 125 1 /h, respectively. Conversely, the rate of starch degradation of Cm averaged 0. 063 1 /h and was similar among treatments. Enzyme supplementation tended to reduce lag time and to increase rate of fermentation for both PS of Cm and Bm, with a more pronounced effect for small PS. A limited EnzD effect was measured for IVSD data and rate of starch degradation; PS influenced fermentation parameters and the magnitude of starch degradation more than EnzD. Supplementation with exogenous amylase influenced the rumen fermentation pattern of small and large PS of Cm and Bm, even if the effect of the enzyme supplementation differed according to the PS of cereal meals...|$|R

For both in vitro assays, the rumen inocula were collected from 2 rumen-fistulated Holstein lactating dairy cows fed a total mixed ration with 16. 2 % crude protein, 28. 5 % starch, and 35. 0 % neutral detergent fiber on a dry matter basis. To fit gas production data, 1 -pool exponential model and 1 -pool or 2 -pool Gompertz models were adopted. The rate of gas production decreased and lag increased by increasing mPS of both Cm and Bm, irrespective of adopted 1 -pool models. When the 2 -pool Gompertz model was used to fit gas production data, a shift of particles from fast to slow fermentable pools was measured by increasing mPS. In particular, the ratio between fast and slow final volumes ranged from 0. 90 at 0. 11 mm mPS to 0. 10 at 2. 98 mm mPS for Bm. For Cm, the ratio between fast and slow final volumes decreased quadratically by increasing mPS, with the highest value (i. e., 0. 58) measured at the lowest tested mPS. Values lower than 0. 10 were measured for mPS greater than 1. 93 mm for Cm. Concerning IVSD data, linear decreases in rate of starch degradation equal to - 0. 049 or - 0. 092 h- 1 for each 1 -mm increase in mPS were achieved for Cm and Bm, respectively.

Experimental design was a cyclic change-over with six dietary treatments. The treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement consisted of either untreated (UB) or heat-moisture treated barley (TB), given without protein supplementation (control) or with untreated or heat-moisture treated RSM. Grass silage was given ad libitum and the concentrates at a rate of 10 kg/d. For the RSM diets, 2 kg/d of the basal concentrate was replaced with either untreated or treated RSM. Treatment of barley decreased silage intake, the effect being greater when the supplement did not contain RSM. There was no effect on milk yield, but due to the lower milk fat content, energy corrected milk yield was lower in cows given TB than in those given UB. Feeding the TB diets was also associated with lower milk urea content, and with increased milk protein content but not protein yield. Faster initial rate of gas production in vitro suggested that the treatment of barley increased the rate of fermentation. Compared with the control diets, RSM supplementation significantly increased silage intake, milk yield, milk protein content and yields of all milk constituents.
