L.L. Cool J {{is one of the best}} young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E

She earned money for day trips {{out to the}} park by working at a Carl's Jr. Bludworth initially taught her climbing culture; he subscribed to magazines and read books which Hill then devoured. She was influenced in particular by Yvon Chouinard's ethic of [...] "leaving no trace" [...] on the rock. Moreover, the climbing of Beverly Johnson captured her imagination, particularly Johnson's 10-day solo of Dihedral Wall on El Capitan. As Hill explains in her autobiography, [...] "I was awed, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> by the know-how and hard work she'd put into her ascent. It was the courage and confidence that it took to put herself on the line, to do something on the cutting edge—to climb one of the world's greatest big walls {{in one of the}} most challenging ways possible: solo. She had succeeded and she'd given women climbers like me enormous confidence to be ourselves and not feel limited by being a minority in a male-dominated sport." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Larson {{accepted}} {{a position of}} assistant professor at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College in Erie, Pennsylvania. [...] At the time, Behrend College was a 2-year branch campus of the university. [...] In 1971, the Board of Trustees of the University met with the Behrend Advisory Board to announce Behrend College would become the first location outside University Park with the authority to develop baccalaureate program and confer degrees locally. During his first several years at the college, Larson was instrumental in developing a mathematics major at the college. [...] He served {{as a member of}} the University Faculty Senate and also as Behrend College's representative on the University Faculty Council. [...] Larson was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and professor in 1983. Early in his career at Penn State, Larson started writing manuscripts for textbooks. He completed and submitted three manuscripts for calculus texts in 1973, 1974, and 1975 ... only to be rejected by several publishers. [...] Larson relates his determination to continue writing in an essay titled A Single Dream. [...] "When Marilyn Monroe was asked if she had been lucky in her career, she said 'When you have a single dream it is more than likely to come true---because you keep working toward it without getting mixed up.' Anyone who has been in my office knows that I am a Marilyn fan. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a Marilyn fan---I am a fan of the American Dream." [...] Finally, in 1976 he and his co-author, Robert P. Hostetler, obtained a contract from D. C. Heath and Company. The first edition of their calculus book was published in December, 1978. [...] In 1995, Hostetler left the authorship team and was replaced by Bruce A. Edwards of the University of Florida. [...] Calculus by Larson and Edwards is now in its tenth edition. [...] It is used worldwide and has been translated in several languages.|$|E

I knew that this was her trouble, but others attributed her abstraction to religious ecstasy, for she did not share her thinkings with the village at large, yet gave me glimpses of them, and so I knew, better than the rest, what was absorbing her interest. Many a time the idea crossed my mind that she had a secreta secret which she was keeping wholly to herself, as well from me as from the others.
