5|$|In the Late Archaic {{the climate}} became {{more similar to}} modern {{with the end of}} the Hypsithermal. The number of Late Archaic Sites {{increased}} in Iowa, perhaps reflective of increased populations allowed by climate change and new subsistence strategies. The Late Archaic sees the first indication of mound building in Iowa, as well as direct evidence of domesticated plants, and large, long-term settlements. The Red Ocher Culture appeared in northeast Iowa, associated with copper artifacts and mound building. Numerous Late Archaic sites have been excavated in eastern Iowa, some showing the gradual adaptation of cultigens, including squash, little barley, marsh elder, and <b>barnyard</b> <b>grass.</b> Sites with evidence for early cultigens in Iowa include the Edgewater Park Site in Coralville, the Gast Spring Site, and the Sand Run Slough West Site. In western Iowa, Late Archaic sites are common, however large bison killing or processing sites are less common than before, and there is little evidence for the use of domesticated plants.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), <b>barnyard</b> <b>grass</b> (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

50|$|When not {{grown on}} purpose, these grasses {{may become a}} {{nuisance}} to farmers. In particular, common <b>barnyard</b> <b>grass</b> (E. crus-galli) is notorious as a weed. It is not easily suppressed with living mulches such as velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens var. utilis). Early <b>barnyard</b> <b>grass</b> (E. oryzoides) is a well-known example of Vavilovian mimicry: the plants have evolved to resemble rice (Oryza), enabling them to escape weeding more easily.|$|E
25|$|Soras eat a {{wide range}} of foods. Animals that are {{commonly}} reported as sora food items include snails (Gastropoda), crustaceans (Crustacea), spiders (Araneae), and insects (Insecta), mainly beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), flies (Diptera), and dragonflies (Odonata). Soras often eat the seeds of plants, such as smartweeds, bulrushes, sedges, and <b>barnyard</b> <b>grasses.</b> Seeds of annual wildrice (Zizania aquatica) and rice cutgrass are eaten by soras in the eastern United States. A literature review lists crowngrass (Paspalum spp.) and rice (Oryza sativa) as relatively important food sources for soras in the Southeast. Plants comprising <5% of the sora's diet are also listed and include spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.), duckweeds (Lemnaceae), pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.), panicgrasses (Panicum spp.), cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata).|$|R
40|$|Ustilago trichophora is a {{pathogenic}} fungus infecting {{the grass}} of Echinochloa genus. The {{effect of this}} pathogen on the growth of Echinochloa was not yet described. Ustilago trichophora was found and described first time in Poland in 1998 on Echinochloa crus-galli specimen. ThenU. trichophora was found in several places {{in the region of}} Lower Silesia in the following years. The aim of the investigation was to study the effects of Ustilago trichophora on the biometric parameters of plants as well as of seeds of Echinochloa crus-galli. The infected specimens of <b>barnyards</b> <b>grass</b> were found lower, they displayed poorer tillering and they produced a smaller number of panicles than the healthy plants.

40|$|In dryland cotton {{cropping}} systems, {{the main}} weeds {{and effectiveness of}} management practices were identified, and {{the economic impact of}} weeds was estimated using information collected in a postal and a field survey of Southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Forty-eight completed questionnaires were returned, and 32 paddocks were monitored in early and late summer for weed species and density. The main problem weeds were bladder ketmia (Hibiscus trionum), common sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus), <b>barnyard</b> <b>grasses</b> (Echinochloa spp.), liverseed grass (Urochloa panicoides) and black bindweed (Fallopia convolvulus), but the relative importance of these differed with crops, fallows and crop rotations. The weed flora was diverse with 54 genera identified in the field survey. Control of weed growth in rotational crops and fallows depended largely on herbicides, particularly glyphosate in fallow and atrazine in sorghum, although effective control was not consistently achieved. Weed control in dryland cotton involved numerous combinations of selective herbicides, several non-selective herbicides, inter-row cultivation and some manual chipping. Despite this, residual weeds were found at 38 - 59 % of initial densities in about 3 -quarters of the survey paddocks. The on-farm financial costs of weeds ranged from $ 148 to 224 /ha. year depending on the rotation, resulting in an estimated annual economic cost of $ 19. 6 million. The approach of managing weed populations across the whole cropping system needs wider adoption to reduce the weed pressure in dryland cotton and the economic impact of weeds in the long term. Strategies that optimise herbicide performance and minimise return of weed seed to the soil are needed. Data from the surveys provide direction for research to improve weed management in this cropping system. The economic framework provides a valuable measure of evaluating likely future returns from technologies or weed management improvements...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the plant}} {{pathogens}} that affect this genus are the sac fungus Cochliobolus sativus, {{which has been}} noted on common <b>barnyard</b> <b>grass,</b> and rice hoja blanca virus.

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{diseases}} and pests pose threats to rice cultivation {{within the state}} of Arkansas. One such culprit, Pyricularia grisea, commonly known as rice blast, is an invasive fungus that spreads primarily through infected rice stubble from the prior year, related host species and even sometimes infected seed. Though epidemics of the fungus seem to be sporadic (infected seed most likely accounts for the randomness in distribution of the rice blast in Arkansas rice fields), [...] "rice blast has caused significant yield losses in Arkansas." [...] Another disease that is actually [...] "second only to, and often rivals, rice blast in importance" [...] is sheath blight, which is a soil borne pathogen the initial symptoms of which commonly begin with [...] "lesions on the sheaths of lower leaves when plants are in the late tillering or early internode elongation stage of growth." [...] The weed that poses perhaps the largest threat to Arkansas rice is <b>barnyard</b> <b>grass,</b> due to its [...] "widespread resistance to propanil and quinclorac, {{two of the most}} frequently used herbicides." [...] Along with this, [...] "weedy red rice (Oryza sativa) is a problematic weed in cultivated rice," [...] and of the rice fields in Arkansas that account for 50% of the nation's rice crop, [...] "about 60% of these...have some red rice infestation."

50|$|Despite the {{potential}} for some crop weeds {{to be used as}} a food source, many can also prove harmful to crops, both directly and indirectly. Crop weeds can inhibit the growth of crops, contaminate harvested crops and often spread rapidly. They can also host crop pests such as aphids, fungal rots and viruses. Cost increases and yield losses occur as a result. Striga, one of the main cereal crop weeds in Sub-Saharan Africa, commonly causes yield losses of 40-100% and accounts for around $7 billion in losses annually. Around 100 million hectares of land in Sub-Saharan Africa are affected by striga. <b>Barnyard</b> <b>grass</b> has been identified as a culprit in global rice yield losses and certain species have been known to mimic rice.|$|E
50|$|The Edgewater Park Site is a 3,800-year-old Late Archaic {{campsite}} situated {{along the}} Iowa River in Coralville, Iowa, United States.

Excavations revealed a small encampment of two hearths and areas for faunal and stone tool production. Other features identified include a discard area and a deep feature of unknown function. Lithic analysis reveals that the site occupants probably recently traveled along the Iowa River from the north center {{of the state and}} were engaged in late-stage tool manufacture and maintenance. Floral analysis indicates the site occupation occurred during the warm half of the year and that the occupants utilized little barley, a non-local plant which was later cultivated, and <b>barnyard</b> <b>grass,</b> a local plant probably also later cultivated.

50|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.Ailanthus produces an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits the growth of other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating.
