40|$|The US Bureau of Mines {{borehole}} deformation gauge (BMG) {{was designed}} in the early 1960 `s to allow rock stress measurements by the overcoring method. Since that time {{it has become a}} de facto standard against which the performance of other borehole deformation gauges is often judged. However, during recent in situ stress studies in the Climax Stock at the Nevada Test Site a strange "negative hysteresis" in the order of 300 to 500 microstrains was observed in standard calibration data. Here, the relaxation curve lies below the indentation (compression) curves as if the system were to somehow respond with an energy release. Therefore, a precision micro-indentation apparatus has been designed and used to perform a series of tests allowing {{a better understanding of the}} BMG button to cantilever interaction. Results indicate that the hysteresis effect is caused by differential motion between the <b>button</b> <b>base</b> and the cantilever resulting from the geometric motion inherent in the cantilever. The very large apparent hysteresis is mainly caused by cycling opposing cantilevers through the instrument`s entire dynamic range, and the fundamental imprecision inherent in use of the standard micrometers to calibrate the BMG. Laboratory mean hysteresis magnitudes for a polished cantilever typically range from 3 to 25 microstrain for 100 and 1000 microstrain relaxations on 1000 microstrain deflection loops intended to simulate typical field data. The error percentage is thought to remain fairly constant with deformation loop size, and is sufficiently small such that it can be safely ignored. The hysteresis effect can probably be reduced, and instrument stability improved by machining a small 90 degree cone in the cantilever in which a slightly larger mating cone on the base of the indentation button would reside. 5 refs. 26 figs., 1 tab...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} tool for {{automatically}} proving termination of first-order rewrite systems. The tool {{is based on the}} dependency pair method of Arts and Giesl [1]. It incorporates several new ideas that make the method more efficient. The tool produces high-quality output and has a convenient web interface. If T T T succeeds in proving termination, it outputs a proof script which explains in considerable detail how termination was proved. This script is available in both HTML and L ATEX format. In the latter, the approximated dependency graph is visualized using the dot tool of the Graphviz toolkit. T T T is written in Objective Caml. We tested the various options of T T T on numerous examples. The results, as well as a comparison with other tools that implement the dependency pair method and some implementation details, can be found in [2, 3]. We describe some of the features of the tool (T T T in the sequel) by means of its web interface, displayed in Fig. 1. TRS The user inputs a TRS by typing the rules into the upper right text area or by uploading a file via the browse button. The exact input format is obtained by clicking the TRS link. Comment and Bibtex Anything typed into the upper right text area will appear as a footnote in the generated L ATEX code. This is useful to identify TRSs. L ATEX commands may be included. In order for this to work correctly, a corresponding bibtex entry should be supplied. This can be done by typing the entry into the appropriate text area or by uploading an appropriate bibtex file via the browse <b>button.</b> <b>Base</b> Order The current version of T T T supports the following three base orders: LPO with strict precedence, LPO with quasi-precedence, and KBO with strict precedence. Dependency Pairs T T T supports the basic features of the dependency pair technique (argument filtering, dependency graph, cycle analysis) described below. Advanced features like narrowing, rewriting, and instantiation are not yet available. Also innermost termination analysis is not yet implemented...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a haptic {{feedback}} method for a virtual <b>button</b> <b>based</b> on the force-displacement curves of a physical button. The original feature of the proposed method is that it provides haptic feedback, {{not only for the}} “click ” sensation but also for the moving sensation before and after transition points in a force-displacement curve. The haptic feedback is by vibrotactile stimulations only and does not require a force feedback mechanism. We conducted user experiments to show that the resultant haptic feedback is realistic and distinctive. Participants were able to distinguish among six different virtual buttons, with 94. 1 % accuracy even in a noisy environment. In addition, participants were able to associate four virtual buttons with their physical counterparts, with a correct answer rate of 79. 2 %.

40|$|In {{reaching}} movements, parietal contributions can {{be distinguished}} {{that are based on}} representations of external space and body scheme. By functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined 16 healthy subjects to see whether such segregation similarly exists in the frontal lobes when visuomotor actions are not specified but when free choices are allowed. Free selection was <b>button</b> <b>based</b> (target based) or finger based (self-referenced), with invariant instructions as control. To avoid a visual attention bias, instructions were auditory presented. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that free button selection with the same finger was associated with increased activations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right posterodorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) including the rostral extension of the dorsal premotor cortex (pre-PMd), and the anterodorsal PFC. Prefrontal activation related to free finger selection (pressing the same button) was restricted to an anteromedial segment of the posterodorsal PFC/pre-PMd. Bilateral inferior parietal activations were present in both free-choice conditions. Pre-PMd and parietal contributions to free selection support concepts on early-stage action selection in dorsal visuomotor pathways. The rostral-caudal segregation in pre-PMd activations reflected that in anterior direction, frontal processing is gradually less involved in selection of environmental information but increasingly committed to self-referenced selection. ACC particularly contributes to free selection between external goals...|$|R

40|$|In a world full {{of mobile}} and smart devices, enabled to {{communicate}} with each other over wireless channels, secure pairing of two devices is of prime importance. The main threat is the so-called Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, where an attacker inserts it-self into the pairing protocol and impersonates one of the legitimate parties. Different methods have been proposed, which do not rely on a common security infrastructure, but exploit auxiliary channels instead, and typically involve the user in the pairing pro-cess. The most common and minimal interface available on a wide variety of devices is a single button. BEDA (Button-Enabled Device Association), a protocol suite for se-cure pairing of devices with minimal user interfaces, can accommodate pairing scenarios where one (or even both) devices only have a single button as their “user interface”.

However, a traditional TV remote is not suitable for interacting with many Smart TV applications; {{this is particularly true}} when typing text is necessary, such as searching, browsing, and using social applications. On the other hand, increasingly-pervasive mobile devices, scuh as smartphones, are emerging as an interesting platform for TV interactions given their intuitive input and output modalities. In this paper, we present and evaluate a new design of Second-Screen Smart TV control app, S 3 TV, for personal mobile devices. We focus on how to reduce visual attention shifting by leveraging touch gesture controls, tailored for peronsal mobile devices. We conducted comprehensive user studies, subjective usability analysis, objective interaction analysis, and comparative studies against a soft <b>button</b> <b>based</b> control app. The subjective usability analysis showed the prototype achieved a System Usability Score (SUS) of 80. 21, well above the average score of 70. 12.

An obvious ques-tion to arise is whether it can be used for point-and-click tasks, as an alternative for mouse or touch. Pointing with gaze is both fast and natural, although its accuracy is limited. There are still technical challenges with {{gaze tracking}}, as well as inherent physiological limitations. Furthermore, providing an alternative to clicking is challenging. We are considering use cases where input based purely on gaze is desired, and the click targets are discrete user inter-face (UI) elements which are too small to be reliably resolved by gaze alone, e. g., links in hypertext.
