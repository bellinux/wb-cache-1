5000|$|Approximately 40,000 {{people use}} TPN {{at home in}} the United States, and because TPN {{requires}} anywhere from 10-16 hours to be administered, daily life can be affected. [...] Although daily lifestyle can be changed, most patients agree that these changes are better than staying at the hospital. [...] Many different types of pumps exist to limit the time the patient is “hooked-up”. Usually a <b>backpack</b> <b>pump</b> is used, allowing for mobility. The time required to be connected to the IV is dependent on the situation of each patient; some require once a day, or five days a week.|$|E
40|$|Wildfire {{firefighting}} is {{an extremely}} demanding occupation performed under hot environment. The use of personal protective clothing (PPC) is needed to protect subjects from the thermal exposure. However, the additional use of PPC may increase the wildland firefighters' physiological strain, and consequently limit their performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effect of four different PPC on the physiological strain of wildland firefighters under moderate conditions (30 °C and 30 % RH). Eight active and healthy wildland firefighters performed a submaximal walking test wearing a traditional short sports gear and 4 different PPC. The materials combination (viscose, Nomex, Kevlar, P- 140 and fire resistant cotton) used during the PPC manufacturing process was different. During all tests, to simulate a real scenario subjects wore a <b>backpack</b> <b>pump</b> (20 kg). Heart rate, respiratory gas exchange, gastrointestinal temperature, blood lactate concentration, perceived exertion and temperature and humidity underneath the PPC were recorded throughout tests. Additionally, parameters of heat balance were estimated. Wearing a PPC did not cause a significant increase in the subjects' physiological response. The gastrointestinal temperature increment, the relative humidity of the microclimate underneath the PPC, the sweat residue in PPC, the sweat efficiency, the dry heat exchange and the total clothing insulation were significantly affected according to the PPC fabric composition. These results suggest that the PPC composition affect the moisture management. This might be taken into account to increase the wildland firefighters' protection in real situations, when they have to work close to the flames...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{pesticide}} poisonings (APP) are {{a public}} health problem in Nicaragua. The quality and coverage of APP´s register, the real incidence of APP, the main determinants, the economic cost of treating cases {{and the effectiveness of}} educational intervention are not well known. Aim: The overall aim was to investigate the acute health impact of pesticide use and to discuss the possible effectiveness of preventive measures in Nicaragua. The specific aims were to calculate the proportion of APP cases officially registered, to estimate one year cumulative incidence of APP cases among population 15 years and older, to identify the main determinants related to APP among pesticide sprayers and to evaluate the impact of an integrated pest management (IPM) training intervention. Methods: For studies 1, 2, and 3, data concerning pesticide exposure and health effects were assessed in a nationally representative survey of 3169 persons 15 years and older in year 2000. For study 1, to estimate the proportion of underreporting of APP cases, the cases reported at the official surveillance system were cross matched with the casesreported through the survey. In study 2, based on self reported cases we estimated the one year incidence rate and the number of expected cases of APP in the country. In study 3, after regression analysis, the main determinants for APP among agricultural sprayers were identified. Study 4 assessed the impact of a 2 years IPM training to reduce economic costs and acute adverse health effects among 1200 basic grain farmers comparing the group of trained farmers and a group of "control" farmers who did not receive training. Results: Less than 5 % of medically treated APP cases were reported to the official register. The one year APP incidence among general population was 2. 3 % (95 %CI 1. 7 - 2. 8). The rate was higher among men, rural population and agricultural workers. More than 66, 000 cases were estimated to occur yearly. The national incidence rate of APP among sprayers was extremely high, 8. 3 % (95 % CI 5. 8 - 10. 8) and more than 34, 000 cases were estimated to occur among pesticide sprayers, and representing 52 % of all APP s estimated in year 2000. Although most of the cases were minor and moderate, the poisonings caused near 340, 000 disability days. The causal agents for APP in 95 % of cases were WHO Class I-II pesticides. The main determinants of APP among sprayers were: <b>backpack</b> <b>pump</b> leakage and incomplete or no use of personal protective equipment. Seventy seven percent of cases were caused by pesticides proposed to be banned or restricted in Central America. The IPM training prevented acute health effects and maintained productivity: after two years of training, the trained farmers used fewer pesticides, spent less money on pest control, made higher net returns, and suffered less exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides compared to farmers who did not receive IPM training. Conclusion: Underreport figures leads to an erroneous interpretation of acute pesticide health effects. There is a high APP incidence rate in the general population, but it is four times higher among sprayers, causing important loss of or productivity and important economic costs. IPM interventions were successful in prevent the occurrence of APP cases and economic losses. Traditional prevention and control measures are insufficient and structural changes, including pesticides banning and restriction, and change to IPM agriculture models, are needed to transform the underlying determinants...|$|E

50|$|In 1937, firefighters did {{not have}} {{portable}} radios for rapid on-scene communication or helicopters to bring supplies and provide water drops. Firefighters had some access to gas-powered portable water pumps (two were {{set up on the}} Blackwater fire), but most used <b>backpack</b> <b>pumps</b> that were manually operated and held limited water. Firelines were dug by handcrews using shovels, axes and pulaskis (a tool that could be used as either an axe or a hoe). Most firefighters wore cotton and wool clothing, which provided poor protection from flames. Additionally, they {{did not have}} fire shelters, which first became available in the 1960s but were not mandatory until 1977. Later researchers believe the use of shelters might have saved lives depending on where the firefighters were when the firestorm occurred.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{officials}} {{believed they}} needed more manpower, so CCC crews from Bighorn National Forest, 165 mi to the east, and other districts of Shoshone National Forest started responding by {{the morning of}} August 21. By 12:30 pm, more than 200 firefighters were on duty and involved in digging fire line or {{in support of the}} firefighting effort. Along one of the small creeks flowing into Blackwater Creek, a small dam was constructed to pocket water supplies for use in <b>backpack</b> water <b>pumps.</b> Due to a long overnight journey, the CCC members from the Tensleep District of Bighorn National Forest did not commence response to the fire until after noon on August 21. As they arrived, the Tensleep CCC unit were told to relieve the Wapiti CCC unit that had been fighting the fire since the previous evening. More than 50 firefighters commenced construction of a new fire line along Clayton Creek and Clayton Gulch, a ravine extending east from Blackwater Creek. The construction was led by USFS Rangers Alfred Clayton and Urban Post, and their crews consisted mainly of the Tensleep CCC camp and some from other entities.|$|R
