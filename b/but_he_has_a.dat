Meanwhile, in Konoha Hiden {{he makes a}} cameo congratulating Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga for their wedding. He also appears in the spin-off Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, which takes place 15 years after the main story, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> younger appearance, much to the confusion of the main characters.

At some point, he sends Mitsuki to live in Konoha after helping Mitsuki find his independence and decide what path in life he prefers. In , Orochimaru is seen watching his son with his teammates.|$|E

Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were killed when Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., entered the Capitol and opened fire. Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at George Washington University Hospital. Weston's exact motives are unknown, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> mental disorder and maintains a strong distrust of the federal government. He remains in a mental institution due to paranoid schizophrenia and has yet to be tried in court.|$|E
5|$|The {{stories of}} Cú Chulainn's {{childhood}} are told in a flashback sequence in Táin Bó Cúailnge. As a small child, {{living in his}} parents' house on Muirthemne Plain, he begs {{to be allowed to}} join the boy-troop at Emain Macha. However, he sets off on his own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field without first asking for the boys' protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this as a challenge and attack him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> ríastrad and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has Sétanta put himself under the boys' protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.|$|E

25|$|Of the six, Pete Weber is {{the only}} player to have won each Triple Crown event at least twice in his career (five U.S. Opens, two PBA World Championships, and two Tournament of Champions titles). Despite 47 and 43 titles respectively, Walter Ray Williams and Earl Anthony are not Triple Crown winners. As mentioned, Anthony never won the U.S. Open, though he {{finished}} runner-up in the event three times.

500|$|Rider Haggard's writing {{style was}} the source of much {{criticism}} in reviews of She and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote [...] "God help English literature when English people lay aside their Waverley novels, and the works of Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and even Charles Reade for the penny dreadfuls of Mr Haggard"; adding, [...] "The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all". A more common sentiment was expressed by the review of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine: [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard is not an exquisite workman like Mr. [...] Stevenson, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> great deal of power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "It's got some {{effective}} moments and aspects, {{but the film}} goes {{in and out of}} plausibility, and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole". Claudia Puig, in her review for USA Today, wrote, [...] "The dialogue by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer is spotty. There are some great, pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, [...] "Clive Owen makes a semi-believable hero, not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely. He's handsome and has the obligatory macho stubble, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> quality that makes you worry a little about him". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B–" [...] rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "the star of the pic may well be NYC's Guggenheim Museum and Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends".|$|E
500|$|Hideaki Anno {{attempted}} to create characters that reflected {{parts of his}} own personality. The characters of Evangelion struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems, and traumatic events in their past. The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show {{to identify with the}} characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols. Shinji Ikari is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. After witnessing his mother Yui Ikari's death as a child, Shinji was abandoned by his father, Gendo Ikari. He is emotionally hyper-sensitive and sometimes does as expected out of fear of rejection, but he has often rebelled and refused to pilot the Eva because of the extremely excruciating harm that has been done to him or to his friends. Throughout the series he says to himself [...] "I mustn't run away" [...] as a means of encouraging himself to face the threats of the day, and this sometimes actually gives him bravery in battle, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lingering habit of withdrawing in response to traumatic events. Anno has described Shinji as a boy who [...] "shrinks from human contact" [...] and has [...] "convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person".|$|E

500|$|The main cast {{includes}} Eddie Cibrian, who {{was cast}} as Nick Dalton, the central {{character in the}} series. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cibrian stated that Dalton was a [...] "chameleon" [...] and very charismatic. He continued: [...] "On the facade, {{he seems to have}} it all. He's very successful. He's dating the head Playboy bunny. He's one of the first keyholders at the Playboy Club, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> very mysterious past." [...] Jeff Hephner was originally approached for the role after performing well in test auditions, but Hephner had no prior experience playing a television lead before, and the producers decided to let him go after the full cast table. Cibrian was cast just a few days before filming began. Amber Heard was approached by producers of the show to portray Bunny Maureen. Although the series premiere started with Nick helping Maureen out of a difficult situation, Heard said of the character, [...] "Don't underestimate that character and her intelligence, and the journey that she's going to take to really rise above that. [...] I think Maureen allows herself to be helped when she needs it, and by no means relies on any character, male or female, in this story, and never has." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, he is not an entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's {{a lot of fun to}} play. There are a lot of different dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> sensitive side as well, which is coming out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E
500|$|Del Vecho {{explained}} how the film's animation team was organized: [...] "On this movie {{we do have}} character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I think it was different on Tangled, for example, but we chose {{to do it this}} way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the supervising animator on Olaf, is quiet <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> funny, wacky personality so we knew he'd bring a lot of comedy to it; Anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna." [...] Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating. In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. [...] "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," [...] said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable. Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character. Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness. He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing. Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, [...] "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ...|$|E
