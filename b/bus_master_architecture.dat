50|$|Some {{types of}} buses allow only one device (typically the CPU, or its proxy) to {{initiate}} transactions. Most modern bus architectures, such as PCI, allow multiple devices to <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> because it significantly improves performance for general-purpose operating systems. Some real-time operating systems prohibit peripherals from becoming <b>bus</b> <b>masters,</b> because the scheduler {{can no longer}} arbitrate for the bus and hence cannot provide deterministic latency.|$|R
50|$|The bus is {{completely}} asynchronous, allowing {{a mixture of}} fast and slow devices. It allows the overlapping of arbitration (selection of the next <b>bus</b> <b>master)</b> while the current <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> is still performing data transfers. The 18 address lines allow the addressing of a maximum of 256 kiB. Typically, the top 8 kiBw is reserved for the registers of the memory-mapped I/O devices used in the PDP-11 architecture.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>bus</b> <b>mastering</b> system, {{also known}} as a first-party DMA system, the CPU and {{peripherals}} can each be granted control of the memory bus. Where a peripheral can become <b>bus</b> <b>master,</b> it can directly write to system memory without involvement of the CPU, providing memory address and control signals as required. Some measure must be provided to put the processor into a hold condition so that bus contention does not occur.|$|R

50|$|More {{complex systems}} have a multi-master bus -- {{not only do}} they have many devices that each drive the data bus, but also have many <b>bus</b> <b>masters</b> that each drive the address bus.The address bus as well as the data bus in bus {{snooping}} systems is required to be a bidirectional bus, often implemented as a three-state bus.To prevent bus contention on the address bus, a bus arbiter selects which particular <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> is allowed to drive the address bus during this bus cycle.|$|R
50|$|However, some non-ISA bus cycles were added. Cycles {{that were}} added to improve the {{performance}} of devices beside firmware hubs include LPC-style one-, two-, and four-byte <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> memory cycles; one-, two-, and four-byte <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> I/O cycles; and 32-bit third-party DMA which conforms {{to all of the}} restrictions of ISA-style third-party DMA {{except for the fact that}} it can do 32-bit transfers. Any device that is allowed to accept traditional ISA-style DMA is also allowed to use this 32-bit ISA-style DMA. The host could initiate 32-bit ISA-style DMA cycles, while peripherals could initiate <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> cycles. Firmware hubs consumed firmware cycles that were designed just for firmware hubs so that firmware addresses and normal memory-mapped I/O addresses could overlap without conflict. Firmware memory reads could read 1, 2, 4, 16, or 128 bytes at once. Firmware memory writes could write one, two or four bytes at once.|$|R

50|$|Super I/O {{devices and}} audio devices {{are allowed to}} accept I/O cycles, accept ISA-style {{third-party}} DMA cycles, and generate <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> cycles. Generic-application memory devices like nonvolatile BIOS memory and LPC flash devices are allowed to accept memory cycles. Firmware hubs are allowed to accept firmware memory cycles. Embedded controllers are allowed to accept I/O cycles and generate <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> cycles. Some ISA cycles that were deemed not useful to these classes were removed. They include host-initiated two-byte memory cycles and host-initiated two-byte I/O cycles. These removed transfer types could be initiated by the host on ISA buses but not on LPC buses. The host would have to simulate two-byte cycles by splitting them up into two one-byte cycles. The ISA bus has a similar concept because the original 8-bit ISA bus required 16-bit cycles to be split up. Therefore, the 16-bit ISA bus automatically split 16-bit cycles into 8-bit cycles {{for the benefit of}} 8-bit ISA peripherals unless the ISA device being targeted by a 16-bit memory or I/O cycle asserted a signal that told the bus that it could accept the requested 16-bit transfer without assistance from an ISA cycle splitter. ISA-style <b>bus</b> <b>mastering</b> has been replaced in the LPC bus with a <b>bus</b> <b>mastering</b> protocol that does not rely on the ISA-style DMA controllers at all. This was done in order to remove ISA's limit on what type of <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> cycles a device is allowed to initiate on which DMA channel. The ISA-style bus cycles that were inherited by LPC from ISA are one-byte host-initiated I/O bus cycles, one-byte host-initiated memory cycles, and one- or two-byte host-initiated ISA-style DMA cycles.|$|R

50|$|While both {{technologies}} provide similar end results, there are fundamental differences between USB and FireWire. USB requires {{the presence of}} a <b>bus</b> <b>master,</b> typically a PC, which connects point to point with the USB slave. This allows for simpler (and lower-cost) peripherals, at the cost of lowered functionality of the bus. Intelligent hubs are required to connect multiple USB devices to a single USB <b>bus</b> <b>master.</b> By contrast, FireWire is essentially a peer-to-peer network (where any device may serve as the host or client), allowing multiple devices to be connected on one bus.|$|R

50|$|With <b>bus</b> <b>mastering,</b> each card {{could talk}} to another directly. This allowed {{performance}} that was independent of the CPU. One potential drawback of multi-master design was the possible collisions when more than one card would try to <b>bus</b> <b>master,</b> but Micro Channel included an arbitration feature to correct for these situations, and also allowed a master to use a burst-mode. Micro Channel cards had complete control for up to 12 milliseconds. This was long enough to permit {{the maximum number of}} other devices on the bus to buffer inbound data from over-runnable devices like tape and communications.|$|R
50|$|The ZV port is {{a direct}} {{connection}} between the PC card slot and VGA controller. Video data is transferred in real time without any buffering, removing the need for <b>bus</b> <b>mastering</b> or arbitration.|$|R
25|$|This {{standard}} supports standard memory cycles with {{lengths of}} 1 byte to 4 kilobytes of data, short memory cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes that have much less overhead compared to standard memory cycles, and I/O cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes of data which are low overhead as well. This significantly reduces overhead {{compared to the}} LPC bus, where all cycles except for the 128-byte firmware hub read cycle spends more than one-half {{of all of the}} bus's throughput and time in overhead. The standard memory cycle allows a length of anywhere from 1 byte to 4 kilobytes in order to allow its larger overhead to be amortised over a large transaction. eSPI slaves are allowed to initiate <b>bus</b> <b>master</b> versions of all of the memory cycles. <b>Bus</b> <b>master</b> I/O cycles, which were introduced by the LPC bus specification, and ISA-style DMA including the 32-bit variant introduced by the LPC bus specification, are not present in eSPI.
