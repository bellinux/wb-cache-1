40|$|Breast shape malformations are {{deformities}} of {{the breast}} contour involving the inferior <b>breast</b> <b>pole.</b> They range from minor forms such as a high submammary fold to major forms such as the tubular breast. The malformation implies an altered relationship between the mammary parenchyma and the superficial fascial system (SFS). The surgical correction consists of the releasing of the gland from all the connections with the surrounding tissues. In some cases, once the glandular tissue is freed from the constricting SFS, the parenchyma spreads revealing a sufficient volume to obtain a normal breast. If hypoplasia {{of the breast}} or inferior quadrant hypoplasia is present, {{the use of an}} implant is mandatory...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Quadrantectomy is an oncologically safe {{procedure}} {{for the treatment}} of early-stage breast cancer, but it often results in poor aesthetic outcomes such as breast shape deformity, which is more visible if the tumour is located in the lower pole. We recommend the use of the transverse incision, which retains the oncological advantages of the quadrantectomy while leading to better aesthetical results. METHOD: We evaluated the clinical results of 24 patients with breast cancer who underwent quadrantectomy of the lower <b>breast</b> <b>pole</b> and volume replacement with remodelling through three posterior scorings from January 2012 to January 2014, with cosmetic evaluations performed according to the criteria set by the Japanese Breast Cancer Society. RESULTS: Minimum follow-up after surgery was 2 years, with an average of 28. 4 months. Among treated patients, the percentage of complications was extremely low and the degree of satisfaction fairly good. Moreover, the assessment of the medical team matched patient self-assessments. CONCLUSION: Immediate breast reconstruction of a defect performed after a quadrantectomy of the lower <b>breast</b> <b>pole</b> using the "posterior scoring technique" provided better cosmetic results compared to the transposition of residual breast tissue. This technique provides reliable and reproducible results, and it also appears to be rather successful on patients with small-moderate breasts {{in the absence of a}} certain degree of ptosis, therefore increasing its already considerable appeal.

25|$|When {{compared}} to the results achieved with a silicone-gel breast implant, the saline implant can yield acceptable results, of increased breast-size, smoother hemisphere-contour, and realistic texture; yet, it is likelier to cause cosmetic problems, such as the rippling and the wrinkling of the breast-envelope skin, accelerated lower <b>breast</b> <b>pole</b> stretch, and technical problems, such {{as the presence of}} the implant being noticeable to the eye and to the touch. The occurrence of such cosmetic problems is likelier {{in the case of the}} woman with very little breast tissue, and in the case of the woman who requires post-mastectomy breast reconstruction; thus, the silicone-gel implant is the technically superior prosthetic device for breast augmentation, and for breast reconstruction. In the case of the woman with much breast tissue, for whom sub-muscular emplacement is the recommended surgical approach, saline breast implants can produce an aesthetic result much like that afforded by silicone breast implants, albeit with greater implant palpability.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The global use of {{acellular}} dermal matrices as {{an adjunct}} to tissue expander or implant-based breast reconstruction, by surgeons wishing to cover and support the inferior <b>breast</b> <b>pole,</b> has increased in frequency in the last two decades. However despite the reported enhanced cosmetic outcomes, issues regarding their cost effectiveness have led to their infrequent use within the UK National Health Service and the need for an equally efficacious but cheaper alternative. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report two patients requiring bilateral revision breast surgery for severely asymmetrical, tender, ptotic breasts and cosmetically poor abdomens. Both were denied assisted acellular dermal matrix reconstructive surgery on the state NHS system and unable to afford the private costs. We therefore utilised free dermal fat grafts, harvested from concomitant abdominoplasties to extend the pectoralis major muscle and smoothen surface irregularities. DISCUSSION: Both patients achieved excellent cosmetic outcomes and aside from a small, spontaneously resolving abdominal site seroma in one patient, have remained free of any complications for over two years. This cost effective procedure is only feasible in patients with an adequate pannus who are amenable to the extra surgery and resultant scarring. CONCLUSION: We herein report the use of free dermal fat graft in revision aesthetic and reconstructive surgery in a manner akin to recent acellular dermal matrix use. The comparable enhanced aesthetic outcomes, minimal complication rate and substantial cost savings merit dissemination to a global audience and encourage surgeons to consider this economic alternative...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Reconstruction of {{a breast}} after mastectomy using the {{contralateral}} lower <b>pole</b> <b>breast</b> flap is an appealing procedure because {{it uses the}} tissues {{that were going to}} be excised during reduction of the sound breast to achieve symmetry. Literature mentioned that these flaps are supplied by the lower internal mammary artery perforators (IMAPs) with no further details. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the site, size, and number of the 4 th and 5 th IMAPs by using preoperative color Duplex ultrasound and intraoperative exploration. Method: Twenty breasts in 10 patients who presented for reduction mammoplasty were included in this study. Preoperative color duplex was used to determine IMAPs in the 4 th and 5 th intercostal spaces. These perforators were localized intraoperatively. Intravenous fluorescein injection was used to determine the perfusion of the lower <b>pole</b> <b>breast</b> flap on the basis of these perforators. Results: Statistically, the 4 th IMAPs diameters were significantly larger than the 5 th IMAPs diameters (P <. 05). The lower <b>pole</b> <b>breast</b> flap was perfused through these perforators. Conclusion: Color Duplex ultrasound is an accurate tool to preoperatively determine the 4 th and 5 th IMAPs. Breast reconstruction following mastectomy is a feasible option to help in restoring the body’s shape and image of the afflicted women. There are multiple surgical procedures for the reconstruction of the female breast, including the use of a mammary prosthesis (implant) or various autologous tissues. Theoretically, regarding autologous reconstruction, the lowest donor site morbidity could be achieved by using tissue that would be otherwise rejected during an operation necessary for a different reason. Adoption of this principle was the cause behind the introduction of the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap for breast reconstruction. 1, 2 Likewise, in properly selected postmastectomy patients in whom th...|$|R
40|$|In breast augmentation, {{surgeons}} usually {{choose a}} pocket {{location for the}} implant behind breast paren-chyma (retromammary), partially behind the pectoralis major muscle (partial retropectoral), or totally behind pectoralis major and serratus (total submuscular). Each of these implant pocket locations has specific indications, but each also has {{a unique set of}} tradeoffs. When applied {{to a wide range of}} breast types, each pocket location has limitations. Glandular ptotic and constricted lower <b>pole</b> <b>breasts</b> offer unique challenges that often are not solved without tradeoffs when using a strictly retromammary, partial retropectoral, or total submuscular pocket.

40|$|Summary:. Women desire {{beautiful}} breasts {{that are}} functional, pain free, and without foreign material. Vertical scars, insufficient elevation, inadequate upper pole fullness, nipple numbness, {{and loss of}} breast feeding are undesirable. Relieving pain attributed to enlarged breasts has required significant tissue removal. Software analysis of chest images, physical measurements, and desires are combined to generate a surgical blueprint. The breast is divided horizontally into two components preserving the neurovascular supply and major lactiferous ducts. The skin flap cephalad to the areola provides external coverage. The areola remains attached to a deepithelialized mound, which is rotated into a cone. Dermal straps originating {{from the base of}} the cone are looped through the pectoralis major muscle and the cone repeatedly. Weight transfer to the pectoralis major muscles eliminates pain in 54 % and decreases pain in 38 %. Incisions are concealed at the areola cutaneous junction and in the shadow of the <b>breast.</b> Upper <b>pole</b> fullness increased in 86 % without implants or fat transfer. Nipple sensation was increased in 37 % and unchanged in 44 %. Overall results were excellent in 50 % and good in 36 %. Complications consisted of dog-ears, periareolar infection, and fat necrosis. No patient required a return to the operation room. Combing computer-aided design with plastic surgical principles creates beautiful, functional breasts without foreign material. Vertical scars are avoided, and weight transfer relieves pain...|$|R
40|$|Summary:. Breast {{asymmetry}} has a {{wide spectrum}} of presentations with several employable strategies for surgical correction. Historically, the external oblique muscle {{has proven to be a}} versatile flap option for the reconstruction of both local and distant defects. It has also been described for use in breast reconstruction for coverage of the lower pole of implant prostheses. The external oblique muscle flap can be harvested in several ways to capture overlying fat and skin. In this study, we describe the use of a superiorly based partial rectus and external oblique flap for surgical correction of lower <b>pole</b> <b>breast</b> hypoplasia. This flap provides vascularized autologous volume to the lower <b>pole</b> of the <b>breast</b> with minimal donor morbidity. Other advantages of this flap are that it can increase the nipple to inframammary fold distance and lower the inframammary fold. This technique represents an evolution of an under-utilized flap and is the first study describing the use of the external oblique flap in the management of breast asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} to reconstruction of the superiorly placed hypoplastic nipple areola complex (NAC) {{with the aim of}} retaining sensation of the nipple and avoiding scars on the upper <b>pole</b> of the <b>breast.</b> We used this novel approach for a 38 year old lady with right sided Poland sequence. She had a previously (ruptured) subcutaneous right breast implant and subsequent DIEP breast reconstruction. The hypoplastic NAC remained superiorly placed. Nipple reconstruction was then performed, along with superior <b>pole</b> <b>breast</b> lipofilling and a left sided symmetrising mastopexy. A modified CV flap was used to reconstruct the right nipple using stored cartilage (from previous DIEP surgery). The new nipple was sited close enough to the existing hypoplastic NAC to allow it to be incorporated into the new areola, which was reconstructed with an areola graft from left breast. The theory is that the hypoplastic nipple would be disguised in the reconstructed areola with the appearance more like a montgomery tubercle than a NAC. The patient retains neurovascularity and hence sensation within this area, and {{there is no need for}} any scars above the NAC. Although, complicated by some flap and graft necrosis and need for post-operative tattooing to improve cosmesis, we would advocate the use of our technique with some minor adjustments...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tissue {{reinforcement}} with allogeneic or xenogeneic acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) {{is increasingly}} used in single-stage (direct-to-implant) and 2 -stage implant-based breast reconstruction following mastectomy. ADMs allow surgeons to control implant position and obviate {{the need for}} submuscular implant placement. Here, we review the benefits and risks of using ADMs in implant-based breast reconstruction based on available data. Methods: A comprehensive analysis of the literature with focus on recent publications was performed. Additional information regarding {{the proper use of}} ADMs was based on our institutional experience. Results: ADM use may improve definition of the lateral confines of the <b>breast</b> and lower <b>pole</b> projection. It may facilitate direct-to-implant procedures and improve aesthetic outcomes. The effect of ADMs on complication rates remains controversial. Known patient risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and radiotherapy should be considered during patient selection. For patients with healthy, well-vascularized skin envelopes, ADM-assisted direct-to- implant reconstruction is a safe and cost-effective alternative to 2 -stage implant reconstruction, with low complication rates. ADMs may be used to treat capsular contracture, and limited available data further suggest the possibility that ADMs may reduce the risk of capsular contracture. Novel synthetic or biosynthetic tissue reinforcement devices with different physical and ease-of-use properties than ADMs are emerging options for reconstructive surgeons and patients who seek to avoid tissue products from human or mammalian cadavers. Conclusions: ADM-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction may improve aesthetic outcomes. However, appropriate patient selection, surgical technique, and postoperative management are critical for its success, including minimizing the risk of complications...|$|R
