40|$|A {{range of}} plastic {{consumer}} products and components thereof have been analysed by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry {{in a low}} density mode for Br as a surrogate for brominated flame retardant (BFR) content. Bromine was detected in about 42 % of 267 analyses performed on electronic (and electrical) samples and 18 % of 789 analyses performed on non-electronic samples, with respective concentrations ranging from 1. 8 to 171, 000 μgg(- 1) and 2. 6 to 28, 500 μgg(- 1). Amongst the electronic items, the highest concentrations of Br were encountered in relatively small appliances, many of which predated 2005 (e. g. a fan heater, <b>boiler</b> <b>thermostat</b> and smoke detector, and various rechargers, light bulb collars and printed circuit boards), and usually in association with Sb, a component of antimony oxide flame retardant synergists, and Pb, a heavy metal additive and contaminant. Amongst the non-electronic samples, Br concentrations were highest in items of jewellery, a coffee stirrer, a child's puzzle, a picture frame, and various clothes hangers, Christmas decorations and thermos cup lids, and were often associated {{with the presence of}} Sb and Pb. These observations, coupled with the presence of Br at concentrations below those required for flame-retardancy in a wider range of electronic and non-electronic items, are consistent with the widespread recycling of electronic plastic waste. That most Br-contaminated items were black suggests the current and recent demand for black plastics in particular is met, at least partially, through this route. Given many Br-contaminated items would evade the attention of the end-user and recycler, their disposal by conventional municipal means affords a course of BFR entry into the environment and, for food-contact items, a means of exposure to humans...|$|E
50|$|By {{acting as}} an {{operating}} control on a three-way powered mixing valve or proportional injection pump system that modulates the supply distribution hot water temperature. The mixing valve or mixing pump system recirculates the return water temperature and adds proportionally supply hot {{water from the}} boiler for tempering to achieve the desired supply water temperature. Another method is to adjust <b>boiler</b> temperature from <b>thermostat</b> activity. This indoor reset control. It is more responsive to real needs inside the building.|$|R
5000|$|Crosthwait’s {{expertise}} was on air ventilation, central air conditioning, {{and heat}} transfer systems. With this knowledge he created many different heating systems, refrigeration methods, temperature regulating devices, and vacuum pumps. For these inventions he holds 39 United States patents, {{as well as}} 80 international patents. [...] In the 1920s and 1930s Crosthwait invented a vacuum pump, a <b>boiler,</b> and a <b>thermostat</b> control, all for more effective heating systems for larger buildings. Some of his greatest accomplishments were for creating the heating systems for the Rockefeller Center and New York’s Radio City Music Hall.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{improved}} performances and thermal comfort of individual forced hot water heating systems equipped with a gas fired wall boiler, for homes. The problems of such systems are due to the high power of the burner which causes cyclic running. Furthermore, the installation of a room thermostat is imposed by the French thermal regulations. Developed independently from the <b>boiler,</b> the <b>thermostat</b> does not fit its environment. The manual aquastat set point adjustment at the boiler {{can lead to a}} set point conflicting with that of the thermostat. Hence, the authors have developed a new room thermostat, based on a fuzzy logic function, which takes into account the system reactions. This thermostat assimilates the characteristics of the different parts of the system: boiler, heaters, building, climate, etc. The new thermostat was tested in simulation and good results were obtained. Then, it was validated experimentally. Individual heating system Simulation Experimentation in situ Regulation Fuzzy logic Comfort...|$|R
