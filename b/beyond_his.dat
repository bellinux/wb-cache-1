5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E

5|$|Bayley's {{tenure in}} Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 {{when he was}} asked to leave during a band meeting. The {{dismissal}} took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour, although Janick Gers has since stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs which were <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> natural register.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beyond</b> <b>his</b> chairmanships, Owen's {{committee}} assignments included service {{inter alia}} on: (i) Banking and Currency {{after the end}} of his chairmanship; (ii) Indian Affairs in all but the 64th Congress; and (iii) Appropriations from the 62nd through the 67th Congress.|$|E
5|$|Deane Malott, {{who became}} {{president}} of Cornell in 1951, was much less sympathetic, and instructed Morrison to curtail all activities <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> academic field. Morrison agreed {{to do so in}} 1954. Nonetheless, {{he was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The cantata {{is unique}} in Bach's church cantatas in its {{structure}} of arias combined with chorale instead of recitatives. Performed one week after , it shows Bach's emphasis on the chorale even <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> second cycle of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the duel, Parlement awarded Carrouges a further six {{thousand}} livres in gold and a position within the Royal Household. Such rewards enabled Carrouge to begin further legal action, attempting to exert his earlier claim to Arnou-le-Faucon. However, this land which Carrouges so coveted remained <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> reach. Count Pierre, who held the land, never forgave Carrouges the death of his favourite, and held the estates from him in court.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> military conquests. His campaigns {{greatly increased}} contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves {{got a sense of}} belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beyond</b> <b>his</b> {{role in the}} series, Kain {{has also}} {{featured}} in tie-in comics, and in Crystal Dynamics' Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. In all of his voiced appearances, he has been played by actor Simon Templeman. He has been favorably received by video game critics and enthusiasts, with praise attributed to his antagonistic role in , and {{his status as a}} strong example of a memorable, nuanced antihero in the medium.|$|E

5|$|Due in part {{to these}} {{personal}} trials, he made no momentous contributions to Congress <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> reliable positions representing Virginia's interests, with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record. He did serve {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. There are notable disparities between Tucker's more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later. In his essay On Instructions to Representatives, he provides an explanation in political theory—an inevitable obligation to think one way and yet vote another, in compliance with constituent preferences.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} last four decades of PedroII's reign were marked by {{continuous}} internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither PedroII nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E
5|$|For decades, Nielsen's music {{did not win}} {{recognition}} outside Denmark. The first recording was in 1933: Georg Høeberg {{with the}} Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra for Dancord. The first live recording was produced in 1950 with Erik Tuxen conducting the same orchestra at the Edinburgh Festival. An international breakthrough was made only when Leonard Bernstein recorded the symphony with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1962 for CBS. This recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> home country, and {{is considered one of}} the finest recorded accounts of the symphony.|$|E

5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> property rights theory. He argues {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|Having {{personal}} experience with worker safety concerns, Lynch found himself with aspirations <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> trade. When a 1979 blizzard forced his project in Wisconsin to shut down, he spent the extra time taking courses at the University of Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter, his father was diagnosed with cancer, and so Lynch returned to Boston. In the early 1980s Lynch {{was elected to the}} executive board of the Iron Workers Local 7 union. At age 30 he was elected president of the board, the youngest in the local's history. During this time he spent his nights and weekends attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology, from which he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in construction management in 1988.|$|E
5|$|He {{then made}} way to Egypt, {{arriving}} to a tumultuous reception in January AD 19. He had gone there to relieve a famine {{in the country}} vital to Rome's food supply. The move upset Tiberius, because it had violated an order by Augustus that no senator shall enter the province without consulting the emperor and the Senate (Egypt was an imperial province, and belonged to the emperor). He returned to Syria by summer, where he found that Piso had either ignored or revoked his orders to the cities and legions. Germanicus in turn ordered Piso's recall to Rome, although this action was probably <b>beyond</b> <b>his</b> authority.|$|E
