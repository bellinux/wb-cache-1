40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{modelling}} approach for euro area {{goods and services}} trade volumes and prices on the basis <b>of</b> a <b>break-down</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>data</b> into their intra- and extra-area components. Using the evidence from the newly estimated trade equations, the paper gives new insights into two important issues. The first issue concerns the exchange-rate pass-through (ERPT) to euro area import prices. The second issue relates to substitution effects between intra- and extra-area trade. These issues are further elaborated through simulation analyses using the ECB 2 ̆ 019 s area-wide model (AWM). The simulations illustrate the impact of external and domestic shocks to trade in the euro area, in particular on intra- and extra-area trade. The richer dynamics from this disaggregated perspective provide additional insights and elucidate transmission channels of shocks that are not detectable from an aggregate (i. e. total trade) perspective. For instance, one interesting finding is that {{an appreciation of the}} euro has a significant downward impact on intra euro area trade...|$|R

40|$|Cathepsin D {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{for the first time}} using an immunocyto-chemical approach and fluorescence microscopy.

The enzyme is associated with lysosome-like organelles: it also has a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in these cells. We have showni by the use of specific inhibi-tory antisera to the tissue proteinase cathepsin I) (2, 3) that this enzyme is mainly responsible for the autolytic degradation of proteoglycan in chicken arid rabbit cartilage (9, 21).

Hydrogen assisted build-up of nano-porosity is addressed. Growth of sub-nanometer wide stalactitic pores owing to increasing aggregation of neutral oxygen vacancies offering {{a means to}} permeate hydrogen into the alloy is explored by density functional theory. The Wagnerian channel utilizes charge separation allowing charged oxygen vacancies and electrons to move separately from nominal anode to nominal cathode. This process becomes increasingly controlled by the charging of the barrier oxide resulting in sub-parabolic rate law for oxide growth. The <b>break-down</b> <b>of</b> the barrier oxide is understood to be preceded by avalanching hydrogen pick-up in the alloy. Pore mediated diffusion allows water to effectively short circuit the barrier oxide...|$|R

40|$|Inside the cell, proteases act {{in concert}} in the {{degradation}} of proteins and peptides. In {{order to understand the}} significance of an individual proteolytic activity within an ensemble of proteases, protocols and probes are required that enable a quantitative determination of the contribution of a protease to the <b>break-down</b> <b>of</b> a given substrate. Here we present a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probe and protocols for a quantitative determination of proteolytic activities inside the endolysosomal compartment. A peptide substrate that is readily cleaved by different cathepsins is flanked by fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine-labeled lysine residues. Efficient endolysosomal targeting of the substrate is achieved by N-terminal elongation with the cell-penetrating peptide nona-arginine. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin has a small, but significant effect on the <b>break-down</b> <b>of</b> the substrate, thus demonstrating that only a minor fraction of the peptide reaches the cytoplasm in its intact form. Nona-arginine therefore constitutes a highly efficient low-molecular-weight moiety for targeting the endolysosomal compartment...|$|R
