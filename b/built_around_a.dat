5|$|Auberge d'Italie was {{originally}} {{built in the}} Mannerist style, but the building acquired a mainly Baroque character due to the 1680s renovation. The building has a rectangular plan with its rooms are <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> central courtyard, a layout typical of Italian Renaissance palazzi and Cassar's other auberges in Valletta such as Auberge d'Aragon. The courtyard contains a triumphal arch which {{is thought to have}} been designed by Romano Carapecchia.|$|E
5|$|Dorset {{contains}} {{a range of}} privately funded independent schools.

5|$|In 1978, Bonfire {{shifted to}} a wedding-cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged {{on top of}} lower stacks. The {{structure}} was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> fortified centerpole, made from two telephone poles. Although tradition stated that if Bonfire burned through midnight A would win the following day's game, {{with the introduction of}} the wedding cake design Bonfire began to fall quickly, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Wressle Castle is {{a ruined}} palace-fortress in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, built for Thomas Percy in the 1390s. It is privately owned and {{not open to}} the public. Wressle Castle {{originally}} consisted of four ranges <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> central courtyard; there was a tower at each corner, and the structure was entered through a gatehouse in the east wall, facing the village.|$|E
5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended {{with the addition of a}} large house, <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> courtyard to the south-west.|$|E

5|$|Nouakchott is <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{which runs}} {{northeast}} {{through the city}} centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas {{in the north and}} the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.|$|E
5|$|Specific design {{elements}} of the GCV were contracted out, though the Army designed the architecture and retained overall responsibility for synchronization. This contrasted with the former FCS manned ground vehicles program where contractors had {{more control over the}} design. The GCV was to be networked and offer improved survivability, while using the state-of-the-art mobility and power management functions. The military released classified details of the FCS Manned Ground Vehicles program to interested contractors to be utilized in design proposals for the GCV. The GCV family was to be <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> common chassis.|$|E
5|$|The American music {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these companies do not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese general, {{convinced}} of the impossibility of taking Badajoz by assault, changed his strategy and began a circumvallation of the town, {{in order to try}} to isolate it completely. The Spanish, meanwhile, were reinforcing their own defensive fortifications with extensive works, mainly ravelins built between the medieval towers. Various outlying forts were also strengthened with the aim of obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing them to build a larger circumvallation line. One of these forts was San Miguel, a star fort able to accommodate 600 infantry, <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> hermitage. It had five earthen bulwarks and an artillery-proof parapet.|$|E
5|$|A second {{satellite}} studio, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, {{opened in}} 1989 with 40 employees. Its offices were {{located within the}} Disney-MGM Studios theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, and visitors were allowed to tour the studio and observe animators at work. That same year, the studio released The Little Mermaid, which became a keystone achievement in Disney's history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who'd been co-directors on The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid earned $84 million at the North American box office, a record for the studio. The film was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, {{who was also a}} co-producer and story consultant on the film. The Little Mermaid won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Song and for Best Original Score.|$|E
5|$|Against this, the Japanese force, {{commanded}} personally by Horii, was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> core of four infantry battalions. Three {{of these}} were drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting {{since the start of}} the campaign, and one was part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. These troops were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75mm guns, two 37mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not all available at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, place this figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle.|$|E

5|$|Alsos {{interviewed the}} Italian Minister for Communications, the Chief of Naval Ordnance, {{the staff of}} the Italian Naval Academy, and Italian {{scientists}} at the University of Naples, and examined what captured technical documents could be found. There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith's S-Force. <b>Built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome {{on the heels of the}} advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|Hearth-tax {{assessments}} of 1674 show the original hall {{to have been}} one of the largest houses in Cheshire, its 42 hearths being surpassed only by Cholmondeley House and Rocksavage, neither of which have survived. As depicted in a painting of around 1710, the original building was square with sides of around , and featured gabled projecting bays and groups of octagonal chimney stacks. <b>Built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> central open courtyard, the interior had a great hall and long gallery; the main entrance led to a screens passage and the main staircase was in a small east hall. Externally, there was a walled forecourt and formal walled gardens; a range of separate service buildings was located to the west.|$|E

5|$|In 1750, now well-known, the {{architect}} received an important commission to remodel Euston Hall in East Anglia, the Suffolk country {{seat of the}} influential 2nd Duke of Grafton. The original house, built circa 1666 in the French style, was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> central court with large pavilions at each corner. While keeping the original layout, Brettingham formalised the fenestration and imposed a more classically severe order whereby the pavilions were transformed to towers in the Palladian fashion (similar to those of Inigo Jones's at Wilton House). The pavilions' domes were replaced by low pyramid roofs similar to those at Holkham. Brettingham also created the large service courtyard at Euston that now acts as the entrance court to the mansion, which today is {{only a fraction of}} its former size.|$|E
5|$|The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) was a German {{mountain}} {{infantry division}} of the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II. It was composed of German officers and Bosnian Muslim soldiers. Named Kama after a small dagger used by Balkan shepherds, {{it was one of}} the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS during World War II. Formed on 19 June 1944, it was <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> cadre from the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) but did not reach its full strength and never saw action as a formation.|$|E
5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms <b>built</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> central courtyard, with an arcade of arches on one side of the courtyard being the principal means of access.|$|E
