50|$|Compared to carrier-wave telecommunications, natural audio {{contains}} {{a variety of}} frequencies. It is advantageous to separate frequency bands prior to beamforming because different frequencies have different optimal <b>beamform</b> filters (and hence can be treated as separate problems, in parallel, and then recombined afterward). Properly isolating these bands involves specialized non-standard filter banks. In contrast, for example, the standard FFT band-filters implicitly assume that the only frequencies present in the signal are exact harmonics; frequencies which lie between these harmonics will typically activate all of the FFT channels (which is not what is wanted in a <b>beamform</b> analysis). Instead, filters can be designed in which only local frequencies are detected by each channel (while retaining the recombination property {{to be able to}} reconstruct the original signal), and these are typically non-orthogonal unlike the FFT basis.|$|E
40|$|A 70 -element {{microphone}} {{phased array}} {{was used to}} identify noise sources in the plume of a solid rocket motor. An environment chamber was built and other precautions were taken to protect the sensitive condenser microphones from rain, thunderstorms and other environmental elements during prolonged stay in the outdoor test stand. A camera mounted {{at the center of}} the array was used to photograph the plume. In the first phase of the study the array was placed in an anechoic chamber for calibration, and validation of the indigenous Matlab(R) based <b>beamform</b> software. It was found that the "advanced" <b>beamform</b> methods, such as CLEAN-SC was partially successful in identifying speaker sources placed closer than the Rayleigh criteria. To participate in the field test all equipments were shipped to NASA Marshal Space Flight Center, where the elements of the array hardware were rebuilt around the test stand. The sensitive amplifiers and the data acquisition hardware were placed in a safe basement, and 100 m long cables were used to connect the microphones, Kulites and the camera. The array chamber and the microphones were found to withstand the environmental elements as well as the shaking from the rocket plume generated noise. The <b>beamform</b> map was superimposed on a photo of the rocket plume to readily identify the source distribution. It was found that the plume made an exceptionally long, > 30 diameter, noise source over a large frequency range. The shock pattern created spatial modulation of the noise source. Interestingly, the concrete pad of the horizontal test stand was found to be a good acoustic reflector: the <b>beamform</b> map showed two distinct source distributions- the plume and its reflection on the pad. The array was found to be most effective in the frequency range of 2 kHz to 10 kHz. As expected, the classical <b>beamform</b> method excessively smeared the noise sources at lower frequencies and produced excessive side-lobes at higher frequencies. The "advanced" <b>beamform</b> routine CLEAN-SC created a series of lumped sources which may be unphysical.

40|$|Collaborative {{localization}} {{and discrimination}} of multiple acoustic sources {{is an important}} problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Localization approaches can be categorized as signal-based and feature-based methods. The signal-based methods are not suitable for collaborative localization in WSNs because they require transmission of raw acoustic data. In feature-based methods, signal features are extracted at each sensor and the localization is done by multisensor fusion of the extracted features. Such methods are suitable for WSNs due to their lower bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we present a feature-based localization and discrimination approach for multiple harmonic acoustic sources in WSNs. The approach uses acoustic <b>beamform</b> and Power Spectral Density (PSD) data from each sensor as the features for multisensor fusion, localization, and discrimination. We use a graphical model to formulate the problem, and employ maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation for estimating {{the position of the}} sources as well as their fundamental and dominant harmonic frequencies. We present simulation and experimental results for source localization and discrimination, to demonstrate our approach.

The <b>beamform</b> maps show {{that many of the}} tones in the experimental data come from their corresponding Mach radius. If the phased array points to the Mach radius associated with a tone then {{it is likely that the}} tone is a result of the loading and thickness noise on the blades. In this case, the phased array correctly points to where the noise is coming from and indicates the axial location of the loudest source in the image but not necessarily the correct vertical location. If the phased array does not point to the Mach radius associated with a tone then some mechanism other than loading and thickness noise may control the amplitude of the tone. In this case, the phased array may or may not point to the actual source. If the source is not rotating it is likely that the phased array points to the source. If the source is rotating it is likely that the phased array indicates the axial location of the loudest source but not necessarily the correct vertical location. These results indicate that you have to be careful in how you interpret phased array data obtained on an open rotor since they may show the tones coming from a location other than the source location.

The source broadcasts the data to the relays, {{some or all of}} which cooperatively <b>beamform</b> to forward the data to the destination. We generalize the standard approaches for cooperative communications in two key respects: (i) we explicitly model and factor in the cost of acquiring channel state information (CSI), and (ii) we consider more general selection rules for the relays and compute the optimal one among them. In particular, we consider simple relay selection and outage criteria that exploit the inherent diversity of relay networks and satisfy a mandated outage constraint. These criteria include as special cases serveral relay selection criteria proposed in the literature. We obtain expressions for the total energy consumption for general relay selection and outage criteria for the non-homogeneous case, in which different relay links have different mean channel power gains, and the homogeneous case, in which the relay links statistics are identical. We characterize the structure of the optimal transmission scheme. Numerical results show that the cost of training and feedback of CSI is significant. The optimal strategy is to use a varying subset (and number) or relay nodes to cooperatively <b>beamform</b> at any given time. Depending on the relative location of the relays, the source, and the destination, numerical computations show energy savings of about 16 % when an optimal relay selection rule is used.
