Prvu je 1968. objavio Vladimir Premec. Budući da je on nekritički preuzimao iz bibliograﬁja koje su objavili Pietro Donazzolo (1912) i Paola Maria Arcari (1935), mnoge njegove jedinice su nepot- pune i netočne. Druga {{hrvatska}} bibliograﬁja o Petriću iz 1979. godine, koju potpisuju Vladimir Premec i Franjo Zenko, od prve se razlikuje tek po četrnaest novih jedinica. U trećoj hrvatskoj bibliograﬁji o Petriću, koja je objavljena 1993., bibliograﬁju iz 1979. godine dopunile su Mihaela Girardi Karšulin i Ljerka Schifﬂer sa 160 novih jedinica, i to ne samo iz razdoblja od 1979. do 1993., no među njima ponovo ima nepotpunih jedinica. Četvrtu hrvatsku bibliograﬁju sastavio je Ivica Martinović 1997. godine da bi prikazao razvoj petrićologije u razdoblju između dviju Petrićevih obljetnica (1979 - 1997) i upozorio na hrvatski doprinos u tom razdoblju. U njoj su sve jedinice potpune, a s metodološkog stajališta ova je bibliograﬁja ogledni primjer kako sastavljati bibliografske jedinice. Osim analize i usporedbe četiriju hrvatskih bibliograﬁja o Petriću, ovakvo je istraživanje produbilo naše spoznaje o utjecaju i opusu Petrićeva djela, dapače ponudilo je nove bibliografske jedinice o Petriću iz najranijega razdoblja do kraja 18. stoljeća. To date, Croatian researchers of philosophi- cal heritage have compiled four bibliographies on Frane Petrić. The ﬁrst bibliography {{owes its}} compilation to Vladimir Premec, published {{in his work}} Franciskus Patricijus in 1968; the second {{was the result of}} co-authorship of Vladimir Pre- mec and Franjo Zenko in 1979, occasioning the 450 th anniversary of Petrić’s birth as an unpagi- nated supplement of the Zagreb reprint of Petrić’s Nova de universis philosophia; the third was published in 1993 in the journal Studia historiae philosophiae Croaticae, its authors being Vladimir Premec, Franjo Zenko, Mihaela Girardi Karšulin and Ljerka Schifﬂer; the fourth bibliography was compiled by Ivica Martinović and published in the journal Dubrovnik in 1997. The first three bibliographies cover the period from Petrić’s time to the moment of publication, while Martinović’s bibliography “Bibliograﬁja o Frani Petriću između dviju ob-ljetnica 1979. - 1997. ” spans a period be- tween two anniversaries. Premec’s “Bibliograﬁja radova o Patriciju” (“Bibliography of the works on Patricije”) contains 401 entries and has earned general appraisal for two main reasons: he is the ﬁrst Croatian scholar to have submitted a bibliography on Frane Petrić; his bibliography serves as a valuable source for a more detailed study of Petrić’s life and work. Regrettably, this bibliography is not ﬂawless. Ap- parently as many as 195 entries are incomplete, mainly because into his bibliography Premec included almost all the entries printed in the two earlier bibliographies of Petrić: that published in 1912 by Pietro Donazzolo and the 1935 bibliogra- phy, the author of which was Paola Maria Arcari. From these two Italian scholars Premec simply borrowed 294 entries together with the original comments, errors and inaccuracies. Despite this fact the contribution of Premec’s bibliography is very valuable. “Bibliograﬁja radova o Patriciju” brings as many as 66 new entries, which, ha- ving been previously published, may have been included in the bibliography compiled by Dona- zzolo and Arcari. Many of the “new” entries owe their content to Croatian authors, as, for example, Franjo Jelašić, Franjo Marković, Tin Ujević or Nikola Žic. Premec’s bibliography surpassed its Italian predecessors in the following: entries on Petrić dominate in his bibliography; the latter afﬁrms the Croatian scientiﬁc and publicistic con- tribution {{to the study of the}} life and work of the Cres philosopher. Apart from being incomplete, many entries in Premec’s bibliography are also incorrect. It thus includes entries which have no reference to Petrić, as, for example, the ﬁrst edition of Bibliotheca universalis published by Konrad Gesner in 1545 and Mémoires of Jean Pierre Niceron (1727 - 1745) in 43 volumes. Bibliographies from 1979 and 1993 owe much to Premec’s bibliography: the former brings only 14 new entries, while the latter as many as 160, thanks mainly to greater scholarly interest in Frane Petrić initiated by the Institute of Phi- losophy in Zagreb and the editorial policy of its journal Prilozi za istraživanje hrvatske ﬁlozofske baštine oriented towards publishing contributions on Petrić. Since the authors of the 1979 and 1993 bibliographies have adopted the entries from Pre- mec’s earlier bibliography, both suffer from an abundance of incomplete and faulty bibliographi- cal data. In the triple issue of the journal Dubrovnik, occasioning the 400 th anniversary of Petrić’s death, Ivica Martinović published “Bibliograﬁja o Frani Petriću između dviju obljetnica 1979. - 1997. ” (“Bibliography on Frane Petrić between two anniversaries 1979 - 1997 ”), including 229 entries. Viewed methodologically, the entries of this bibliography follow the scholarly guidelines of bibliography entry writing, exemplifying in terms of style and content a standard <b>bibliographical</b> <b>unit.</b> When unable to trace a bibliographical entry, Martinović, unlike his predecessors, made a refe- rence to his source - the distinguished ISIS Cu- rrent Bibliography. Incomplete and inaccurate bibliographic en- tries that characterize the first three Croatian bibliographies on Petrić as well as the two listed by the two Italian authors call for a prompt com- pilation of a new bibliography on Petrić, which, with special regard for the earlier period, would be based on accurate data and compiled according to consistent methodological rules as the ones Ivica Martinović has introduced in his special biblio- graphy on Petrić.

Prikupljajući podatke za prilog o našim arhivima, uočila se potreba za bibliografijom radova o svim državnim arhivima u Republici Hrvatskoj. Tako je bibliografiji radova o područnim državnim arhivima pridodana bibliografija radova o Hrvatskom državnom arhivu. Uključeni su samo radovi koji se odnose na arhive kao ustanove; u tom smislu ovaj rad može poslužiti izradi neke buduće opsežnije bibliografije. In June 2003 Section for Municipal Archives (SMA) of the International Council on Archives (ICA) {{started the}} work on the World Bibliography on the Municipal Archives. Austria, as the host of the {{forthcoming}} ICA Congress, was obligated to make the bibliography for the Central and East Europe, and asked for help in gathering <b>bibliographical</b> <b>units</b> concerning archives as institutions. The starting point in preparing bibliography was Arhivski fondovi i zbirke u arhivima i arhivskim odjelima u Socijalističkoj Republici Hrvatskoj (Guide through Archival Fonds and Collections in the Republic of Croatia), published in 1984. Along with this source, library catalogs and reference works were consulted as well, and all regional archives were asked to send lists of editions concerning their institutions published after 1984, which they all did. While collecting data for the contribution about our regional archives, the need for the bibliography of editions about all state archives in the Republic of Croatia was recognized, because the last work of that kind was completed, as it has already been mentioned, twenty years ago. For that reason, bibliography about the Croatian State Archives was added to the original bibliography. Since included references cover only works about archives as institutions, this work can, in that sense, in the future, serve as the basis of some more comprehensive bibliography...|$|R

Suprotstavljajući obilježje endemičnosti prema etnokartografičnosti (mogućnosti komparativnog iščitavanja i zaključivanja na temelju raširenosti neke pojave), autorica pronalazi i donosi nove spoznaje do kojih je došla radom na ovoj nadasve zanimljivoj, sasvim posebnoj i u svjetskim okvirima jedinstvenoj pojavi. Starting {{from the}} {{phenomenon}} of virgins (virdžine/toelije), the girls offered by a vow, {{the author of this}} article is reflecting on ‘the margins of ethnological maps’ on the achievements of ethnological cartography in the case when we are encountering a disadvantageous situation – the endemic nature of the phenomenon, its limited geographical distribution; in ethno-cartographic sense, a narrow, small area. By contrasting the endemic nature with ethno-cartography (the possibility of comparative analysis and drawing conclusions of the basis of a geographical distribution of a given phenomena), the author has, while working on this interesting, specific and unique phenomenon, come to some new conclusions and findings. This article discusses {{the phenomenon of}} virgins exclusively in the context of questions based on ethnological cartography and also analyses theoretical-methodological aspects of ethno-cartographic technique, an auxiliary method used in historical ethnology. In the works of sociologist Vera Stein Erlich, the author finds elements which could be linked to ethnological cartography, but only in the section when Vera Stein claims that a space, a plane of contemporariness, a synchronic frame, can outline and be the projection of a time flow, of diachronic frame, which is exactly the basis of ethno-cartographic technique. The phenomenon of virgins is analyzed as an endemic phenomenon which is not only accepted, but also institutionalized and codified through common law, which is its basic differentia specifica, as compared with other examples of cross-dressing in European region. In her quest for virgins the author is using two sources: a) the questionnaires of the Ethnological Atlas, b) accounts from literature where she found 104 examples in 54 <b>bibliographical</b> <b>units</b> written by 45 authors in 7 languages! Even though the author used this valuable and, as the article showed, necessary supplements to the questionnaires, she also pointed to a number of problems which she encountered during the research of this endemic social phenomenon as well as to internal and external reasons which made this addition not only a benefit, but also a necessity. Insufficient precision of the questions from the questionnaires of Ethnological Atlas was experimentally confirmed through verification done with these questionnaires during the field research in the Southern Istria. The set framework of this phenomenon in the limited area of the local conditions of patriarchal way of life of this part of the Dinaric region at its core – Albanian-Montenegro border – enabled us (together with the analysis of the key elements of the phenomenon of virgins which were not the immediate topic of this article), to discover multiple inter-relationships between this phenomenon and a specific type of patriarchic way of life – tribal type of patriarchy. This could be observed not only on the macro level of the entire map, but also on the micro level on the example of Montenegro where the virgins were rare in the Old Montenegro and quite common in the Mountains, the region where the tribal lore was more prominent. On the Baumann’s map of the world this phenomenon was singled out as unique, but was interpreted as the survival of the ancient cult function of virgins which, according to the author, wrongly links this phenomenon to the evolutionist assumptions on the idea of survivals, in this case of the female cult function which virgins supposedly used to have in ancient times, but which was later los...|$|R

Šime Peričića te njegova nedavnog umirovljenja, autor donosi cjelovit popis njegovih objavljenih radova zaključno s 2002. godinom, uz pridodane najosnovnije podatke o njegovu dosadašnjem životu i djelu. On the {{occasion}} of the fortieth anniversary of the scholarly career of the worthy Dalmatian and Croatian historian from Zadar Dr Šime Peričić and on {{the occasion}} of his retirement, the Institute for Historical Sciences of HAZU in Zadar wishes with this introductory note and the listing of his entire bibliography to give credit to his longstanding research activities. This is particularly pertinent if one notes that the most fruitful scholarly years of his career were spent in this institution. Šime Peričić was born in Sukošan near Zadar on December 30, 1936. He went to elementary school in the place of his birth and completed his high-school education in Zadar. For a period of time afterwards he worked as an office-worker and teacher. In 1964 he became an archivist in the State Archive in Zadar where he gradually began to do scholarly research, collecting and exploring original documents pertaining to the economic, social, cultural and political past of Zadar and the entire Dalmatia region from the XVIIth to the XXth century. In the forthcoming decade he will base the majority of his scholarly and professional publications which today number around 240 <b>bibliographical</b> <b>units</b> on this archival research activities. The same year he was employed in the Zadar Archive he {{became a member of the}} Society of Archive Employees of Croatia (Društvo arhivskih radnika Hrvatske), a member of the Historical Society of Croatia (Povijesno društvo Hrvatske) and of the central Croatian cultural and publishing society Matica Hrvatska. In 1969 he was elected a member associate of the Society for Researching and Developing Maritime Affairs of Yugoslavia (Društvo za proučavanje i unapređenje pomorstva Jugoslavije). In addition he has been a permanent associate of the Zagreb Institute for Croatian History (Institut za hrvatsku povijest) from its establishment in 1971. Very active in his scholarly endeavors during the sixties and seventies, he rounded off the first part of his scholarly career in 1975 with a defense of his PhD thesis entitled Dalmacija uoči pada Mletačke Republike (Dalmatia on the Eve of the Fall of the Venetian Republic) at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zadar. In 1981 he moved to the Institute for Historical Sciences of JAZU (now HAZU) in Zadar, where he began working as a higher scholarly associate. In 1984 he became a scientific advisor. From 1984 to 1991 he was the director of the Academy’s Institute and served for a time on the editorial board of the journal Radovi Zavoda za povijesne znanosti JAZU u Zadru. In addition, he was on the editorial board of the journal Pomorski zbornik from Rijeka, the serial edition Prošlost Zadra (The Past of Zadar) and many other publications. The results of his research into the economic, social, cultural and political past of Zadar, its vicinity and the whole of Dalmatia during the last decades will remain an indipensible point of reference for scholars and members of the profession and the cultural public at large. This research has produced a series of precious scholarly books and contributions in scholarly and professional publications in different editions, journals and newspapers. However, knowing his dedication to his profession it is to be hoped that in the years to come Dr Šime Peričić will continue to enrich our Dalmatian and Croatian historiography with new scholarly and professional insights. Therefore, at the end of this brief note it remains to wish him the best of health and many more years of scholarly work for his own satisfaction and for the benefit of Croatian historical science...|$|R
