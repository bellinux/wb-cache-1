5|$|As of 2003 {{there were}} still 138 Allied men with no known grave in the area, and they are commemorated at the Groesbeek Memorial. However, {{evidence}} of the battle is often discovered even today, and the bodies of Allied servicemen are reinterred at the Airborne Cemetery. When found, bodies are exhumed and Dutch Graves Registration staff attempt to identify them <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> reburied. One soldier of the Border Regiment was discovered and reburied in the cemetery in 2005 and another who had previously been unidentified was reburied in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data {{when they are}} requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E
5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the {{decision}} to allow athletes to return to participation was frequently based on the grade of concussion.

5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E

While Double D admires {{the bounty of}} nature, Eddy discovers a giant spiderweb and fearfully {{suggests}} that they leave. His friends are intrigued by its enormous size however, and Ed starts bouncing on the web. Suddenly, nearby voices start chanting the Eds' names. Double D and Eddy urge Ed to climb down from the web, but {{he is unable to}} break free on his own. After his friends manage to pull him down, the three of them frantically try to run away. <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able to escape the forest though, they fall into a muddy swamp and are surrounded by three seemingly ominous figures.|$|E

Narodne Novine is available through a paid subscription as print, or for free online. Parliamentary debates and other proceedings {{are the subject of}} news coverage by media of Croatia, and Saborska televizija was set up in 2007 in addition as an IPTV channel broadcasting all plenary sessions of the parliament. Finally, the Parliament's Public Relations Department publishes a news bulletin available to all institutions and citizens of Croatia through a print paid subscription, and online for free.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E
