50|$|Upon impact, a {{joint in}} the crash barrier parted, the {{suspension}} of the vehicle went under the barrier, and the car hit a stanchion head-on. The front end was destroyed.

50|$|Excepting {{the case}} of {{vehicles}} with beam axles and vehicles having no suspension, in practice it is normal for inboard brakes to be mounted rigidly {{with respect to the}} body of the vehicle, often to the differential casing. This is done to move the weight of the braking mechanism from being carried by the wheels directly (unsprung weight), to being carried indirectly by the wheels via the suspension (sprung mass). This then necessitates a means of transferring braking torque from the brake mechanism to the wheel, which is capable of operating despite the relative movement between body and wheel. Driven wheels already have shafting (or chains in older vehicles) which serve this purpose so there is no penalty for them, but undriven wheels require a similar mechanism which is then called a <b>brake</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The new Lotus 72 {{was a very}} {{innovative}} car, featuring {{torsion bar}} suspension, hip-mounted radiators, inboard front brakes and an overhanging rear wing. The 72 originally had suspension problems, and Jochen Rindt took a lucky victory in Monaco in the old 49 when Jack Brabham crashed on the last lap while leading. But when antidive and antisquat were designed out of the suspension, the car quickly showed its superiority, and Rindt dominated the championship until he was killed at Monza when a <b>brake</b> <b>shaft</b> broke. Rindt had only recently begun to wear a shoulder harness, but refused to wear crotch straps because he felt they slowed his exit from {{the car in the}} event of fire. When the car hit the barrier head-on, Rindt submarined forward and the lap belt inflicted fatal head and neck injuries.|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} is a Salisbury 4HU {{unit with}} a hypoid spiral bevel gear. It provides final drive reduction ratios ranging from 2.88:1 to 3.54:1, {{depending upon the}} Jaguar model. The bolts that attach the differential to the subframe have small holes through their heads {{so that they can}} be safety wired to prevent them coming undone, which would otherwise be difficult to detect since they can only be accessed when the whole suspension assembly is removed from the car. A limited slip differential was standard on some models and optional on others.

5000|$|In 1970 GAZ-21 Volga was {{replaced}} by GAZ-24 and the V8 adoption followed soon, dubbed GAZ-24-24. As the sedan's standard gearbox was now a four on the floor manual, the selector lever was accordingly altered. Unofficially these cars were called [...] "Chasers", and despite their novelty, the engine torque was disproportional to the chassis ability (to prevent excessive burnouts, the factory improvised by adding a 100 kg metal plate into the boot rather than altering the suspension design). This meant a very low service life and also required very professional driving. For that reason, the factory did not even bother creating a special select indicator, and externally it resembled a manual transmission gearshift lever (some cars even lacked a single brake pedal, and instead had the clutch/brake pedal layout that dubbed each other). The GAZ-24 had the common cord-actuated parking brakes, thus the central <b>shaft</b> <b>brake</b> was removed and replaced by an extension housing to fit the shorter driveshaft of the GAZ-24. GAZ-24-24 would be produced alongside standard GAZ-24 until 1985. That year the car got a major facelift and internal modernisation with engine and chassis elements from the GAZ-3102 Volga, resulting in the GAZ-24-10 model. The Chaser became GAZ-24-34 and was produced until 1993.|$|R
5000|$|For the British GP, Lotus cars {{founder and}} Team Lotus {{principal}} Colin Chapman started {{to enter a}} third car with Emerson Fittipaldi. With the reliable 49C, the young Brazilian finished his first three GPs while Miles had to retire in both races, dogged by a hairline fracture in the water pipes,leading to retirement at quarter distance and slowing his progress during the race at Brands and Hockenheim, when finally running with a 72, close to Rindt's 72 specifications, {{he would have been}} reasonably competitive. Miles qualified seventh at Brands Hatch, 1.2 seconds slower than Rindt on pole, who beat Brabham on the finishing line to win the British GP. Rindt scored a final victory at Hockenheim where Miles qualified tenth and diced with Surtees and Denny Hulme, until the Lotus 72's Cosworth blew. With the three car team, John Miles' car did not get the same attention as Chapman obviously saw Fittipaldi as the future, as his old Lotus was seriously prepared and finished eighth and fourth in the British and German races, while the failure to discover, the fracture leaking water saw Miles retired at both races and had blown three Cosworth V8s during the practice sessions. During the Hockenheim practice sessions, Miles spent many laps providing a slipsteam tow to enable Fittipaldi to qualify. Rindt said [...] "a monkey could have won in the car" [...] (the 72) and told Miles who qualified tenth, two seconds behind Rindt, that he was mystified than Miles didn't drive faster, as two seconds slower was no safer in Rindt's view. This may have been true in a Lotus 72 as Miles qualified on the fifth row again at the next race in Austria, a new, high speed lethal circuit. Miles found himself without braking on the fourth lap: 'coming through the downhill before the final corner, my left front <b>brake</b> <b>shaft</b> broke ' Matters came to a head at the Italian GP, where Chapman ordered Miles to follow Rindt in running a new Lotus 72 without front and rear wings {{to take advantage of the}} Monza circuit's long straights and fast, low-downforce corners. Miles reluctantly complied but was concerned by the wingless 72's handling on the straights. His teammate Rindt was killed when one of the brake shafts on his new Type 72 failed and his car veered off the track, ploughing into the steel barrier which was placed too high for the revolutionary wedge design of the 72. Rindt, who had only recently acquiesced to wearing a simple lap belt, slid underneath and had his throat cut by the belt buckle. That was too much for Miles, who was widely regarded as too cerebral and sensitive to fit Chapman's idea of a race driver, and he left the team. The team skipped the next race in Canada, and at Watkins Glen, Reine Wisell drove the second Lotus car, while Fittipaldi won, thereby securing both championships for Lotus.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 81 Excessive rotor {{vibrations}} {{are one of}} {{the leading}} causes of damage to pump components, particularly to bearings, shaft seals, and premature wear of labyrinth surfaces. Under an EPRI contract which was awarded to Sulzer in 1983, a full scale three-stage test pump was built which has been extensively tested for rotordynamic behavior. Design conditions selected for this pump are typical for fossil plants with subcritical steam generation. The pump was installed in a closed loop. To investigate rotordynamic behavior experimentally, the pump had to be equipped with sophisticated instrumentation including shaft vibration measurements within the pump. The influence of different parameters such as labyrinth clearances, amount of unbalance, swirl brakes, and flowrate is described. Experimental results (i. e., unbalance response) are compared with analytical results using a rotordynamic code based on finite element approach. In boiler feed pump systems, for a number of reasons, sudden loss of suction pressure can occur. In such cases, vaporization in the pump occurs accompanied by two phase flow conditions, large hydraulic forces, loss of damping, high rotor amplitudes, with possible contact between rotor and stator. This condition was simulated with the test loop. The influence of such a loss of suction incident on pump behavior, especially shaft vibrations, is described. The conclusions highlight the importance of the labyrinths on rotordynamic behavior, in particular the influence of swirl <b>brakes</b> to reduce <b>shaft</b> vibration amplitudes. If the analytical results have to compare well with measured vibrations, excellent quantitative knowledge of bearing, labyrinth and impeller interaction dynamic coefficients is essential...|$|R
