5|$|On {{the night}} of November 12, 1964, Armando Schmerber and a {{passenger}} were driving home after drinking at a tavern and bowling alley in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California when their car skidded {{off the road and}} struck a tree. Schmerber and his companion were injured in the crash and taken to a hospital for treatment. When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused. Although they did not possess a search warrant, officers instructed attending physicians to take a <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> from Schmerber. The <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest. The <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> was ultimately admitted into evidence at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors. Schmerber objected to the admissibility of the <b>blood</b> <b>sample,</b> claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, and his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.|$|E

5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
40|$|Prenatal {{diagnosis}} of genetic defects was done using fetal <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> in 167 at-risk pregnancies, by fetal skin biopsy in 15 pregnancies, and by fetal liver biopsy in 8 pregnancies. Fetal <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> {{was done by}} fetoscopy through January 1985 and by sonographically directed percutaneous umbilical <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> since then. In our series, cytogenetics has become the major indication for fetal <b>blood</b> <b>sampling,</b> increasing from 6 % of the cases with fetoscopy to 48 % with umbilical <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> Fetoscopy provided pure fetal blood in 61 % of cases while umbilical <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> provided pure fetal blood 97 % of the time.

The cavity perturbation technique in the frequency range between 2 and 3 GHz was used in this study. It is observed that the dielectric constant of pregnant women’s <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> is higher than that of non-pregnant women’s <b>blood</b> <b>samples,</b> and the conductivity of pregnant women’s <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> is higher than that of non-pregnant women’s <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> This is a novel in-vitro method of determining pregnancy.

5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis.|$|E
5|$|F. On November 18, 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that Rashid Ramzi of Bahrain {{had been stripped}} of {{the gold medal in}} the men's 1500 m race. Ramzi had been the first athlete from Bahrain to win an Olympic gold medal. His frozen <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> was re-tested and found to contain traces of Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), a stamina-building blood-booster. Kenyan Asbel Kipruto Kiprop was upgraded to gold, Nicholas Willis of New Zealand was given the silver and Mehdi Baala of France received the bronze.|$|E
30|$|Tc- 99 m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99 mTc-exametazime, 99 mTc-HMAO) is a single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) radiotracer for CBF assessment [2]. Our previous {{study reported that}} rat CBF could be quantified using 99 mTc-HMPAO [3]. Quantitative assessment of CBF using 99 mTc-HMPAO requires input function, which is generally assessed by arterial <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> Arterial cannulation would be invasive for small animals and difficult to repeat in the same animal {{over the long term}} [4]. In addition, abundant and frequent <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> can affect the physiological condition, including blood pressure, blood cell count, and plasma hormone levels [5, 6]. Although <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> systems using microfluidic technologies have been developed {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> from small animals [4, 7], they cannot entirely obviate the need for arterial cannulation and <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> Therefore, evaluation of the input function without <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> would be desirable for CBF quantification in small animals.|$|R
30|$|Repeated {{arterial}} <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> {{was performed}} on the arterial side after the blood had passed the detector. During the first 3  min after radiotracer injection, around 20 -μl arterial <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were continuously collected every 2 to 3  s using pre-weighted sample tubes. Afterwards, the shunt was closed. Further manual 40 -μl <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were taken at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60  min after injection. Radioactivity in <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> was measured in a 1 -detector Wallac gamma counter (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Wellesley, MA, USA), which was cross-calibrated with the PET camera.|$|R
40|$|Maternal-fetal {{exchange}} of a potent tobacco-related human carcinogen, 4 -aminobiphenyl, was studied in smoking (n= 14) and nonsmoking (n= 38) pregnant women. /V-Hydroxy- 4 -aminobiphenyl, the active metabolite of 4 -aminobiphenyl, forms chemical addition products (adducts) with hemoglobin. Levels of 4 -aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adducts were measured in maternal-fetal paired <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from smoking and nonsmoking women during labor and delivery. Carcinogen-hemoglobin adducts were detected in all maternal and fetal <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> Levels of such adducts {{were significantly higher}} (f <. 001) in maternal and fetal <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> from smokers: the mean 4 -aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct level was 92 ± 54 pg/g of hemoglobin in <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> from fetuses of smokers, and 17 ± 13 pg/g of hemoglobin in <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> fro...|$|R
5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, as September (Michael Cerveris) the Observer, watches, a <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> {{from the}} child is drawn discreetly by one of Fauxlivia's captors posing as an orderly, who {{transfers}} it to Brandon (Ryan McDonald), who is revealed to have developed the accelerated pregnancy procedure under Walternate's orders. Meanwhile, Lincoln and Charlie become somewhat distrustful of Walternate after learning what he hid from them. They consider that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) disappeared {{around the same time}} that Fauxlivia returned, and wonder what else Walternate is hiding from them.|$|E
5|$|The {{background}} check leads Mulder to Senator Richard Matheson (Raymond J. Barry), {{which results in}} a dead end. Scully discovers Skinner's <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> and, after checking, she finds that Skinner's blood contains multiplying carbon. Meanwhile, Skinner ends up in hospital following a gunfight in the FBI parking garage. Mulder and Scully reunite at the hospital, where Mulder tells Scully that Skinner was investigating a health funding bill called S.R. 819. Later, the physicist dies of the same carbon blood condition from which Skinner is sick.|$|E

5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E

5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a <b>blood</b> <b>sample,</b> are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} {{enough from}} {{the events of the}} previous episode, Olivia is released from the hospital, and is watched by the shapeshifter who has killed Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) and adopted his appearance. Peter (Joshua Jackson) learns of mysterious disappearances taking place in Lansdale, and the Fringe team arrives to investigate. Walter finds a blue, paralytic substance at the scene, which he suspects is from mutated DNA. The investigation leads to a local resident, Andre Hughes (John Savage), who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth. Olivia begins to develop super-hearing as a result of crossing to the parallel universe, and hears someone else in Hughes' house despite his saying he's the only one there.

40|$|The {{presence}} of Ehrlichia canis DNA in <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> from 47 Aruban domestic dogs, exhibiting signs of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME), was tested. PCR amplification and Reverse line blot hybridization techniques {{were used in}} order to test for the {{presence of}} E. canis DNA in the <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> Ehrlichia canis DNA was only detected in one (2. 1 %) of the 47 <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> Serological testing for Ehrlichia canis antibodies using the Snap® 3 Dx ® test was also performed on the 47 <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> Out of those 47 <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> 22 (46. 8 %) were positive for E. canis antibodies. In order to test the effectivityof the treatment of CME, <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were taken at 30 days and 60 days post treatment. The PCR amplification, Reverse line blot hybridization (RLB) and serological testing methods were repeated for these <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> as well. None of these <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were positive for E. canis DNA, but 38 % of the <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> which were previously negative on the Snap® 3 Dx ® test were now positive. This finding suggests that the methods used for demonstrating E. canis DNA in this research were insensitive. The <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were also tested for other tick borne pathogens using the PCR and RLB methods. Respectively Babesia canis vogeli DNA was present in 6 (12. 8 %) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was present in 1 (2. 1 %) of the 47 pretreatment <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> This {{is the first time that}} Babesia canis vogeli infections have been identified in the Aruban dog population, more research will be needed in order to determine the clinical significance of this infection. A. phagocytophilum is a zoonotic disease spread by ticks of the Ixodus species, until now only Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks have been identified among the Aruban dog population. The positive A. phagocytophilum result could have been due to a cross reaction with A. platys on the RLB. More research is needed on the tick species present in the Aruban dog population in order to determine the relevance of A. phagocytophilum infections in dogs as well as its zoonotic risk...|$|R

5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a <b>blood</b> <b>sample</b> or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E
