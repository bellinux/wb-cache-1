The NBC network, which usually uploads Saturday Night Live digital shorts to its official site and YouTube channel immediately following broadcast, did not do so for Dear Sister due to music clearance issues.

Officers stated that all clues found thus far had been fruitless. The results from the blood-stained sand were expected to arrive the day before, but due to delays at the laboratory, the results had not come in. By April 11, the officers were still hard at work on the case. Presley said that his department and other authorities had not relaxed for one minute since the discovery of the crime. He also stated that the $500 reward was still being offered and that no tip, no matter how small, was left without a thorough investigation.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, NBC {{president}} Herbert Schlosser {{approached his}} vice president of late night programming, Dick Ebersol, {{and asked him to}} create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot. At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller, Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances that would attract 18- to 34-year-old viewers. By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, Michael O'Donoghue, Gilda Radner, and George Coe. The show was originally called NBC's Saturday Night, because Saturday Night Live was in use <b>by</b> <b>Saturday</b> Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC. NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26, 1977.|$|E

25|$|In June 2010, {{during the}} {{build-up}} to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer– after Steven Gerrard, Pelé and David Beckham– {{to be represented}} as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London. Another waxwork of him {{was presented at the}} Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013. In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named CR7 (Cosmos Redshift 7) in tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo in reference to his CR7 mantle (his initials and shirt number). On 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed the Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport. The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented. Neither the bust nor the name change were unanimous, actually far form a consensus, as the former was ridicularized <b>by</b> <b>Saturday</b> Night Live's character Cecilia Giminez portrayed by comedian and actress Kate McKinnon, with the latter being subject to much debate and controversy locally by politicians and citizens who even started a petition against the move.|$|E
25|$|As {{in western}} New York, the storm struck {{suddenly}} {{during the day}} Friday, with zero visibility, and blowing and drifting snow making roads impassable, and stranding many vehicles. Looting of radios from abandoned cars, as well as looting of soda pop from a truck was reported. Friday night, 250people were stranded in the International Nickel Company plant in Port Colborne. Although schools closed when informed of the impending storm, the rapid onset of the storm resulted in about 1,000 students being stranded overnight, January 28, in Port Colborne and Wainfleet schools (about 2,000 students were stranded in the Niagara region altogether). <b>By</b> <b>Saturday,</b> January 29, night at 6 p.m., 800 students were still trapped, with 600 of them in Wainfleet and Port Colborne. On Sunday, the remaining students {{were taken from the}} schools {{with the help of the}} militia; some students were housed in nearby houses. In some areas, buses had become stranded trying to take children home from school Friday, so bus drivers took the children to nearby houses.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before dawn, Indian {{security}} forces began {{an attack on}} Nariman House that lasted until after sundown. The operation began when 22 NSG Commandos rappelled out from an Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopter {{on the roof of}} the building. NSG Commandos were in position in the adjacent buildings to provide cover fire to the assault team if needed. Commandos entered the building from the top and two loud blasts were heard followed by heavy gunfire. Most of the operation was broadcast live on television as news footage showed troops abseiling from a helicopter into the building and soldiers on the ground closing in. Initially it was reported that five hostages were killed, but it was later upgraded to six deaths, eight <b>by</b> <b>Saturday</b> morning after two missing Israelis made contact with the Israeli Foreign Ministry. When the raid ended at sundown everyone inside the building was dead, including the rabbi and his wife. An Indian commando, Havaldar Gajendra Singh Bisht, was killed during the operation. According to ZAKA members, at least one hostage, Holtzberg, might have been killed in the crossfire when the commandos moved in; this was rejected by government authorities as stories and irresponsible comments.|$|E
