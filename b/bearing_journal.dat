500|$|To {{make the}} R as compact as possible, several design {{modifications}} {{were made in}} comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage. The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short crankshaft <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> known as the [...] "big end". This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an articulated type.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Copper, {{aluminum}} and tin–lead based alloys {{are widely used}} as <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> materials in tri-bological applications.

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most bearing caps are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the <b>bearing</b> <b>journal,</b> and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the bearing cap from each side.|$|E
50|$|At 05:50 on 20 December 1984, the train, {{carrying}} {{more than}} 1000000 L (835 t) of four-star petrol in thirteen tankers entered the tunnel on the Yorkshire (north) side travelling at 40 mph. One-third {{of the way}} through the tunnel, a defective-axle <b>bearing</b> (<b>journal</b> bearing) derailed the fourth tanker, which caused the derailment of those behind. Only the locomotive and the first three tankers remained on the rails. One of the derailed tankers fell on its side and began to leak petrol into the tunnel. Vapour from the leaking petrol was probably ignited by the damaged axle box.|$|E

Each of the cars was built using low-alloy, high-tensile steel, and constructed using the welded-girder technique. The trucks on the train's passenger cars were developed from locomotive trucks, with outside-mounted swing hangers spaced 96 in apart (instead of the typical practice of mounting them 56 in apart {{on the inside of}} the trucks) and rolling <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> boxes, which helped to improve truck alignment, smooth the train's ride, and reduce body roll on curves from 28 in to 6 in.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a sensibility {{analysis for the}} <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> of combustion engines mass balancing systems. Applying it, it's possible to improve the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> and avoid possible failures. This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> main parameters (radial clearance, <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> diameter and <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> length) on the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> as well as the selection of the lubrication system groove suitable for the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> length, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> diameter, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases. At last, it's found that the white metals (Babbitts) are considered the most advantageous and indicated materials for these <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> and that the lubrication system grooves should be circumferential.

By creating texture or micro dimple on a hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> pressure increases and significant improvement has been achieved in its load carrying capacity, lubricant flow rate, coefficient of friction etc. In a present work numerical analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of using negative spherical surface texture on hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> surface and it is compared with normal <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> i. e. <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> without texture. We can take any other profile also but spherical profile is easy to fabricate by laser technology or etching process. The Reynolds equation is solved numerically with the help of central finite difference method and analysis is done on the effect of texture height, asperity ratio and number of textures on the <b>journal</b> <b>bearing.</b> Here we also determine the behavior of parameters of hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> (texture and without texture) with increase in eccentricity ratio.

5000|$|The [...] is {{the only}} engine in this family and was {{introduced}} in 1970 and produced for 10 years. It has a 4.125 in bore and a 3.75 in stroke. The 400 differed from other small blocks in that the cylinders were siamesed and therefore required 'steam' holes in the block, head gaskets, and heads to help alleviate 'hot-spots' in the cooling system at the point above the siamesed cylinders. Overheating and damage are likely if head gaskets or heads without 'steam' holes are used on a 400 block. The 400 {{is the only}} engine that uses a 2.65" [...] main <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> and a 2.10" [...] rod <b>bearing</b> <b>journal.</b> The connecting rod was also 400 specific being 5.565" [...] {{as opposed to the}} 5.7" [...] rod used in all other small block Chevrolet engines. The 400 was made in 4-bolt main journal from 1970 to 1972 and in 2-bolt main journal from 1973 to 1980. The 400 can have either 2 or 3 freeze-plugs per side though all 400 blocks have the provisions for a 3rd freeze-plug on each side. The 400 was rated at 245-265 horsepower (grossHP net) through its life. The 400 saw extensive use in full-size Chevrolet and GMC trucks; K5 Blazer/Jimmy, 1/2-ton, 3/4-ton, 1-ton, and even larger 'medium duty' trucks had an option to be equipped with a 400. The engine was available in midsize A-Body and full-size B-Body passenger cars {{until the end of the}} 1976 model year. Early models produced 265 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor. All 400s came with a two-barrel carburetor with a four-barrel carburetor option becoming available in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Lubrication of {{piston rings}} is {{difficult}} {{and has been a}} driving force to improvements in the quality of motor oil. The oil must survive high temperatures and harsh conditions with a high-speed sliding contact. Lubrication is particularly difficult as the rings have an oscillating motion rather than continuous rotation, as for a <b>bearing</b> <b>journal.</b> At the limits of piston movement, the ring stops and reverses direction. This disrupts the normal oil wedge effect of a hydrodynamic bearing, leading to pronounced wear and the formation of a 'step' in the cylinder bore around the height of the upper ring. Noting that some sleeve valve engines suffered far less from such wear, complex designs such as a rotating cylinder liner have been considered, just to address this problem.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{generation}} of Oldsmobile V8s was produced from 1964-1990. Most of these engines were very similar, using the same bore centers and a 9.33 in deck height, raised on [...] "big-block" [...] versions to 10.625 in. Big-block and Diesel versions also increased the 2.5 in main <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> to 3.0 in for increased strength. All generation-2 small-block Olds V8s used a stroke of 3.385 in. The big-block engines initially used a forged crankshaft with a stroke of 3.975" [...] for the 1965-1967 425 and 400 CID versions; starting in 1968, both the 400 CID L and the 455 CID L big blocks used a stroke of 4.25 in, with crankshaft material changed to cast iron except in a few rare cases.|$|E
40|$|A new {{hydrodynamic}} bearing concept, the wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{is being developed}} because it has better stability characteristics than plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> while maintaining similar load capacity. An analysis code to predict the steady state and dynamic performance of the wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is also part of}} the development. To verify numerical predictions and contrast the wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing's</b> stability characteristics to a plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> tests were conducted at NASA Lewis Research Center using an air bearing test rig. Bearing film pressures were measured at 16 ports located around the bearing circumference at the middle of the bearing length. The pressure measurements for both a plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> and a wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> compared favorably with numerical predictions. Both bearings were tested with no radial load to determine the speed threshold for self-excited fractional frequency whirl. The plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> started to whirl immediately upon shaft start-up. The wave journal did not incur self-excited whirl until 800 to 900 rpm as predicted by the analysis. Furthermore, the wave bearing's geometry limited the whirl orbit to less than the bearing's clearance. In contrast, the plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> did not limit the whirl orbit, causing it to rub...|$|R

50|$|The WHE-25 is {{designed}} with six connecting rods sharing one crankpin on the crankshaft. The standard design for such connection {{is with a}} master connecting rod connected to one piston and the remaining rods connected to pins in the big end of the master rod. Harry Schoell, inventor of the WHE, also invented {{what he called a}} 'spider bearing', which is a disk that can rotate around the crankpin, and has one <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> around its periphery for each of the six connecting rods. While this design eliminates the need for a separate master rod, it introduces one uncontrolled degree of freedom, i.e., the spider bearing itself can rotate in one direction until its motion is stopped by impacting with the connecting rods, then rotate in the other direction through some angle before it is stopped by again impacting connecting rods.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the <b>bearing</b> <b>journal.</b> Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E
50|$|Roller {{burnishing}} is {{a method}} of cold working metal surfaces to induce compressive residual stresses and enhance surface roughness qualities. The tooling typically consists of a hardened sphere or cylindrical roller. These tools are pressed onto/across the part being processed. The part (or the tool in some applications) must be moving at a constant rate of speed, for example {{in the case of}} roller burnishing a part on a lathe, the part is spinning and the burnishing tool is moved across the surface as a constant rate; therefore, producing a very consistent finish across the part. Another application is thrust bearing surfaces of some production crankshafts. A dual roller (cylindrical) tool is moved into the thrust <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> of a crankshaft, while the crankshaft is spinning the tool is indexed (so each roller is perpendicular to the thrust surface while backing each other up) deforming the surfaces. So the diameters of each roller added together (compensated for elastic deformation) equals the finish dimension of the thrust bearing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{high-performance}} turbocharged 1.6 L (1598 cc) engine {{with central}} direct injection has 79.0 mm bore and 81.5 mm stroke, with cylinder pressure of 130 bar and compression ratio of 9.5:1 for Performance version and 10.5:1 for Eco version. It uses a grey cast-iron block with die-cast aluminum bedplate, aluminum cylinder head, chain-driven DOHC valvetrain with hydraulic tensioners, dual continuous variable cam phasing, and forged steel crankshaft. The engine has twin balance shafts and specially designed cam cover to improve NVH, while optimized compressor geometry, acoustic resonators and overall air handling help reduce noise by 2 dB. Centrally placed injector allows optimal operation in both stratified and homogeneous charge ignition. Optimized main <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> diameter, roller cam followers, and PVD coated piston rings reduce friction. Starting in 2013, the engine began to replace turbocharged 1.6 L Family I Ecotec engine in Opel cars, and in 2014-2015 it will replace naturally aspirated 1.6 L and 1.8 L Family 1 engines in Chevrolet cars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{small end}} {{attaches}} to the piston pin, gudgeon pin or wrist pin, which is currently most often press fit into the connecting rod but can swivel in the piston, a [...] "floating wrist pin" [...] design. The big end connects to the <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> on the crank throw, in most engines running on replaceable bearing shells accessible via the connecting rod bolts which hold the bearing [...] "cap" [...] onto the big end. Typically there is a pinhole bored through the bearing and the big end of the connecting rod so that pressurized lubricating motor oil squirts out onto the thrust side of the cylinder wall to lubricate the travel of the pistons and piston rings. Most small two-stroke engines and some single cylinder four-stroke engines avoid {{the need for a}} pumped lubrication system by using a rolling-element bearing instead, however this requires the crankshaft to be pressed apart and then back together in order to replace a connecting rod.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the crank pin <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank pin bearing journals, the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|E

50|$|A tunnel {{crankshaft}} {{is considered}} to be a 'tunnel' if the outside diameter over the outer race of the installed bearings is larger than the maximum size of the webs.

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E
5000|$|The HiPo {{engine was}} {{engineered}} to increase performance and high-RPM reliability over standard 289 fare. It had solid lifters with hotter cam timing; 10.5:1 compression; a dual point, centrifugal advance distributor; smaller combustion chamber heads with cast spring cups and screw-in studs; low-restriction exhaust manifolds; and a bigger, manual-choke 595 CFM carburetor (the standard 289-4V was 480 CFM). The water pump, fuel pump, and alternator/generator pulleys were altered, fewer vanes, extra spring, and larger diameter, respectively; to help handle the higher engine speeds. Even the HiPo’s fan was unique. Bottom-end improvements included a flaw-free selected standard block, thicker {{main bearing caps}} and crankshaft damper/balancer, larger-diameter rod bolts, a crankshaft made from 80% nodular iron {{as opposed to the}} regular items at 40%, all were checked for correct 'nodularity' by polishing an area of the rear counterweight and comparing that surface using a magnification arrangement against a picture datum, increased crankshaft counterweighting to compensate for the heavier connecting rod big ends, the increased external counter weighting at the front was split between the crankshaft damper and a supplementary counterweight place adjacent to the front main <b>bearing</b> <b>journal</b> (all designed to reduce the 'bending moment' in the crankshaft at high-rpm), all for high-rpm reliability.
