40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the role of social capital and <b>bridging</b> <b>networks</b> on {{entrepreneurial}} activity in three different regions in Sweden. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical base of the paper comprises 120 in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs and other stakeholders in three municipalities in Sweden, statistical data from Statistics Sweden and a large postal survey conducted by the Confederation of Swedish Enterprises. Findings – The <b>bridging</b> <b>networks</b> between local civil servants and local politicians on the one hand and entrepreneurs on the other are pivotal for the development of an entrepreneurial community. Research limitations/implications – Despite the same rational-legal framework, this paper shows how the cognitive dimension of social capital influences the level of entrepreneurship in three municipalities. The importance of <b>bridging</b> <b>networks</b> is also highlighted. Practical implications – An open channel of communication between politicians and entrepreneurs allows the former to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the latter. By widening the network, more actors are involved in local and regional development, thereby raising the level of competence and resources. Originality/value – Using three different sets of data, this paper offers a deeper understanding into the complex nature of <b>bridging</b> <b>networks</b> between politics and business.

Specifically, it focuses on the associations between ethnic networks, community social capital, and self-rated health (SRH) among female marriage migrants. For empirical testing, secondary analysis of a large nationally representative sample (NSMF 2009) is conducted. Given the clustered data structure (individuals nested in communities), a series of two-level random intercepts and slopes models are fitted to probe the relationships between SRH and interpersonal (bonding and <b>bridging)</b> <b>networks</b> among foreign-born wives in Korea. In addition to direct effects, cross-level interaction effects are investigated using hierarchical linear modeling. While adjusting for confounders, <b>bridging</b> (inter-ethnic) <b>networks</b> are significantly linked with better health. Bonding (co-ethnic) networks, to the contrary, are negatively associated with immigrant health. Net of individual-level covariates, living in a commuijnity with more aggregate bridging social capital is positively linked with health. Community-level bonding social capital, however, is not a significant predictor. Lastly, two cross-level interaction terms are found. First, the positive relationship between <b>bridging</b> <b>network</b> and health is stronger in residential contexts with more aggregate bridging social capital. Second, it is weaker in communities with more aggregate bonding social capital...|$|R
