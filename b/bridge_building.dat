The Mackinac Bridge opened on November 1, 1957, the Portage Lake Lift Bridge, the largest {{double-deck}} lift bridge was completed in August 1959, and the International Bridge opened across the St. Marys River three years later on October 31, 1962. The State Highway Department started erecting mileposts along the Interstates in 1963, and later expanded the practice to other freeways and used the mileages to number the interchanges along I-94.|$|E
5|$|The prosperous {{industry}} {{which had}} sprung {{up around the}} new iron industry required vast numbers of largely unskilled workers to mine ironstone {{and work in the}} blast furnace plants. Coatbridge therefore became a popular destination for vast numbers of Irish (especially from County Donegal in Ulster) arriving in Scotland. The iron bars and plates produced in Coatbridge iron works were the raw materials needed throughout the British Empire for railways, construction, <b>bridge</b> <b>building</b> and shipbuilding. One example of uses Coatbridge' iron was put to included armour plating for British ships fighting in the Crimean War.|$|E

5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on <b>Bridge</b> <b>Building,</b> had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E

25|$|A paleographic {{analysis}} of the Greek letter forms yields a 5th- or 6th-century AD construction date for the bridge. With the bulk of Roman masonry bridges resting on semi-circular arches, or, to a lesser extent, on segmental arches, the Karamagara Bridge represents an equally rare and early instance {{of the use of}} pointed arches not only in late antique <b>bridge</b> <b>building,</b> but also in the history of architecture overall. Along with other late Roman and Sassanian examples, mostly evidenced in early church building in Syria and Mesopotamia, the bridge proves the pre-Islamic origin of the pointed arch in Near Eastern architecture, which the Muslim conquerors subsequently adopted and built on.|$|E

25|$|Faced with {{competitive}} pressures (especially {{as regards}} shipbuilding), Harland & Wolff sought to shift and broaden their portfolio, focusing less on shipbuilding {{and more on}} design and structural engineering, as well as ship repair, offshore construction projects and competing for other projects to do with metal engineering and construction.

25|$|The {{bridge with}} the most slender piers was the three-span Ponte San Lorenzo in Padua, Italy. A {{favourable}} ratio between pier thickness and span is considered a particularly important parameter in <b>bridge</b> <b>building,</b> since wide openings reduce stream velocities which tend to undermine the foundations and cause collapse. The approximately 1.70m thick piers of the Ponte San Lorenzo are as slender as one-eighth of the span. In some Roman bridges, the ratio still reached one-fifth, but a common pier thickness was around {{one third of the}} span. Having been completed sometime between 47 and 30BC, the San Lorenzo Bridge also represents one of the earliest segmental arch bridges in the world with a span to rise ratio of 3.7to1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fibre optic sensors {{have proven}} to be ideal {{transducers}} for structural monitoring. Being durable, stable and insensitive to external perturbations, they are particularly interesting for the long-term health assessment of civil and geotechnical structures. Many different fibre optic sensor technologies exist and offer a wide range of performances and suitability for different applications. The most widely used sensing techniques include point sensors (Fibre Bragg Gratings and Fabry-Perot interferometers), long-gauge sensors (SOFO) and distributed sensors (Raman and Brillouin scattering sensors). These sensing technologies are now widely used in routine application for health monitoring of structures such as <b>bridges,</b> <b>buildings,</b> monuments, tunnels, dams, dykes, pipelines, landslides and many others. This contribution reviews these systems and technologies and presents some significant application examples, in particular to <b>Bridges,</b> <b>Buildings,</b> Geostructures and Pipelines. 1.
