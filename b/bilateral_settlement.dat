Recognition by the UK itself through a <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlement</b> would be the [...] "first prize", in Smith's words, as it would end sanctions and constitutional ambiguity and make foreign acceptance, at least in the West, far more likely. Considering their country a potentially important player in the Cold War as a [...] "bastion against communism" [...] in southern Africa, the RF posited that some Western countries might recognise UDI even without a prior Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement. Specifically, it expected {{diplomatic recognition}} from South Africa and Portugal, and thought that France might recognise Rhodesia to annoy Britain and create a precedent for an independent Quebec. But although South Africa and Portugal gave economic, military and limited political support to the post-UDI government (as did France and other nations, to a lesser extent), neither they nor any other country ever recognised Rhodesia as a de jure independent state. Rhodesia's unsuccessful attempts to win Western support and recognition included offers to the US government in 1966 and 1967, ignored by Lyndon B Johnson's administration, to provide Rhodesian troops to fight alongside the Americans and other anti-communist forces in Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Within {{the current}} Internet, {{autonomous}} ISPs implement bilateral agreements, with each ISP establishing agreements that suit its own local objective to maximize its profit. Peering agreements based on local views and <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlements,</b> while expedient, encourage selfish routing strategies and discriminatory interconnections. From a more global perspective, such settlements reduce aggregate profits, limit {{the stability of}} routes, and discourage potentially useful peering/connectivity arrangements, thereby unnecessarily balkanizing the Internet. We show that if the distribution of profits is enforced at a global level, then there exist profit-sharing mechanisms derived from the coalition games concept of Shapley value and its extensions that will encourage these selfish ISPs who seek to maximize their own profits to converge to a Nash equilibrium. We show that these profit-sharing schemes exhibit several fairness properties that support the argument that this distribution of profits is desirable. In addition, at the Nash equilibrium point, the routing and connecting/peering strategies maximize aggregate network profits and encourage ISP connectivity so as to limit balkanization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Internet {{includes}} {{thousands of}} Internet service providers (ISPs) which are interconnected to provide connectivity and service for end-users. Traditionally, the settlement between the ISPs are determined based on bilateral agreements {{that result from}} pair-wise negotiations. Although this settlement mechanism is intuitive and easy to implement, it does not encourage network-wide cooperation, as the bilateral charges typically do {{not lead to a}} fair division of revenue among all ISPs that are involved in carrying the same flows of traffic. This problem is getting more severe with various emerging new Internet business models. In this paper, we try to determine the existence and realizabil-ity of bilateral prices that can achieve fair revenue division among ISPs. In particular, we use Shapley value as the basis for deriving fair prices. Under a quite general topology and traffic model, we find that there exists prices that make the revenue division under <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlement</b> equal to that calculated under Shapley value. The corresponding “fair price ” exhibits several nice and desirable characteristics. Moreover, it could be realized approximately. I...|$|E
40|$|The World Trade Organization (WTO) {{is one of}} {{the most}} visible and contested {{institutions}} within the global economic governance architecture. Both proponents and opponents of trade liberalization regularly voice discontent with the institution’s functioning and its effect on the economies of its members. Of particular interest is the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), often described as the organization’s flagship body. The WTO DSU helps parties to settle disputes related to the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions drafted and agreed upon over several trade negotiation rounds. This paper presents a game-theoretic approach to analyze whether the WTO DSU ensures equal access and outcomes to all parties who are part of a trade dispute. It particularly addresses the costs of litigation. The paper argues that due to these issues, developing countries will not reap equal benefits from the usage of the WTO DSU as their developed counterparts. Developing countries will, due to a relative higher cost of WTO litigation, be worse off, both as a plaintiff and as a defendant. They will file less complaints and settle for less beneficial outcomes. We also find that <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlement</b> is a very important feature in the WTO DSU. nrpages: 28 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-period model {{to analyze the}} need for bank reserves {{in the presence of}} other liquid assets like Treasury securities. If a pair of banks settle bank transfers without bank reserves, they must prepare extra liquidity for interbank payments, because depositors'demand for timely payments causes a hold-up problem in the <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlement</b> of bank transfers. In light of this result, the interbank payment system provided by the central bank can be regarded as an implicit interbank settlement contract to save liquidity. The central bank is necessary for this contract as the custodian of collateral. Bank reserves can be characterized as the balances of liquid collateral submitted by banks to participate into this contract. This result explains the rate-of-return dominance puzzle and the need for substitution between bank reserves and other liquid assets simultaneously. The optimal contract is the floor system, not only because it pays interest on bank reserves, but also because it eliminates the over- the-counter interbank money market. The model indicates it is efficient if all banks share the same custodian of collateral, which justifies the current practice that a public institution provides the interbank payment system. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{incentives}} countries face in trade litigation within the new WTO dispute settlement system. Our analysis yields {{a number of}} interesting predictions, First, because sanctions are ruled out during the litigation process, the dispute settlement system does not preclude all new trade restrictions. However, the agenda-setting capacity of the complainant, including its right to force a decision, make trade restrictions less attractive than under the WTO's predecessor, GATT. Second, the system's appellate review provides the losing defendant with strong incentives to delay negative findings, and both parties with a possibility to signal their determinacy in fighting the case. Third, a relatively weak implementation procedure potentially reinforces incentives to violate WTO trade rules. Fourth, <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlements</b> are more likely {{at an early stage}} in the process and are biased toward the expected outcome of the formal dispute settlement procedure.

40|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} and commonly used energy carrier in the world. In coal-producing countries, coal is often the cheapest fuel for electricity and heat production. Prices of steam coals offered by exporters on international markets reflect current economic and market conditions and are also related to the prices of other fossil fuels like crude oil and natural gas. International coal-market observations and analyses lead {{to the conclusion that}} steam-coal prices depend only on heating value. In Polish practice, steam-coal prices are calculated using a price formula in which coal price is a function of three quality parameters: net calorific value, ash content and sulphur content, and a price of [`]basic' or [`]reference' coal (which means: coal of defined quality). This paper presents the results of international coal-market analyses of relationships between coal price and quality and describes the Polish coal-pricing system.

40|$|At {{the time}} the Uruguay Round Agreements were passed by Congress, {{particular}} concern was expressed about their implications for U. S. national sovereignty. Concern was sufficiently great that the Clinton Administration committed its support {{to the creation of}} a commission that would review each adverse decision against the United States by the WTO. The commission was designed such that the outcome of its review process might trigger a serious Congressional consideration of U. S. withdrawal from the WTO. While the so-called Dole Commission was never created, the Congressional controversy surrounding the ratification of the Uruguay Round Agreement has led to particular concern with USTR performance at the WTO. Curiously, enhanced Congressional concern has not gone hand in hand with more resources for USTR. Over the 1990 s, USTR has rarely asked for, and, until 2000 has not received additional resources for its work. The analysis here shows that if the USTR is concerned not only about the number of cases it wins but also about its rate of success, having more resources may have an ambiguous impact on the USTR's rate of success. Depending on how relatively promising are the additional cases that may yet be brought by USTR to the WTO, and how usefully additional resources may be applied to existing cases, it is possible that more resources can lower USTR's success rate. This is true, though for different reasons, when explicit allowance is made for the response by the other party to the dispute to a USTR commitment of additional resources. More resources cannot explain the increased use that the USTR has made since the WTO was established, because until recently USTR has received no additional resources. Rather, a more predictable DSM may have encouraged more rather than fewer cases to be brought to the WTO in preference to further efforts at extra-WTO <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlements.</b> ...|$|R

An advantage of such settlements is determined by the amount of money which can be spared by the Russian importers of Chinese products in case of direct trade.   The topic of the article encompasses the analysis of export-import operations and national currencies’ use, in particular, the yuan, in the cross-border settlements between Russia and China. The objective {{of this article is to}} reveal the role of China in the international activities of the Russian near-border regions on the basis of the analysis of export and import statistics database. The hypothesis of this article is that the dynamics of Chinese imports to the Russian nearborder regions correlates with the amount of the yuans traded on the Moscow Stock Exchange. The article produces forecasts of Chinese imports to the Russian near-border regions and the amount of money, which can be spared by the Russian importers in the case of a transition in <b>bilateral</b> <b>settlements</b> to the yuan.

40|$|Restricted until 29 Sep. 2012. This thesis {{examines}} {{the variations in}} both the level of patent protection and changes therein across countries and over time. The main finding is that both domestic economic, political and legal characteristics as well as bilateral and multilateral dispute settlement mechanisms are important in raising countries’ patent rights protection in the past decades.; More specifically, my studies confirm that domestic economic development, associated with R&D investment, {{is the main reason}} for countries to improve their patent protection, with human capital, political freedom and trade openness as contributing factors. Furthermore, Common Law countries and German Civil Law countries tend to provide higher protection for patent rights than French Civil Law countries, although its effect on patent protection might not be direct but probably only indirect through its effect on R&D and trade openness. Last but not least, <b>bilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> mechanisms, represented by the U. S. ’s Special 301 placements and Section 306 monitoring, have significantly and consistently positive effects on propelling target countries to provide higher legislative protection for patents, just as bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with the U. S. do. Designating a country as “Priority Foreign County”, which is the most severe but seldom used instrument of “unilateral aggressiveness”, did not by itself contribute to the improvement of patent protection according to the results. It does, however, work with other bilateral coercive means. The strengthened WTO dispute settlement mechanism only plays a marginal effect on countries’ patent protection over time. The <b>bilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> mechanisms represented by the U. S. Trade Representative’s Special 301 placements and other monitoring procedures and bilateral incentives resulting from the BITs between the U. S. and other countries overwhelmed domestic economic, political and legal characteristics in explaining the improvement of patent protection over time. I also show that autocratic regimes are more vulnerable to bilateral pressures asking for improving patent protection.; This thesis contributes to our understanding of patent protection in particular and IPR protection in general.

40|$|Japan's recent {{trade policy}} is {{sometimes}} characterised as 'aggressive legalism' {{in the sense}} that it aggressively utilises the multilateral trade rules embodied in the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organisation in dealing with disputes with its trade partners. This policy may appear to be a marked departure from Japan's past practice of favouring <b>bilateral,</b> non-legal <b>settlement</b> of trade disputes. Upon closer examination, however, while Japan has been moderately active in using the WTO dispute settlement process for resolving its trade disputes, it behaves more like a country that resorts to surgical strikes on selected targets (usually the United States) under a powerful cover of the European Community. Compared to Japan, Korea's attitude in the WTO is more aggressive. While the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is not content with the status quo and is seeking to expand its aggressiveness in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, it faces an uphill battle. One of the difficulties facing trade officials in Japan may be the lack of a national system for lodging WTO complaints, open to any citizens or firms, like Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974 or the European Trade Barriers Regulation. Nonetheless, in the historical context, Japan is far more aggressive than in the past in utilising the rules of the GATT/WTO to advance its national interests.

40|$|The {{squeeze in}} United States dollar {{liquidity}} that emerged {{with the global}} financial crisis highlighted the risks inherent in the current global financial system. Asia was adversely affected by the crisis {{not only because of}} its dependence on trade, but also because of its heavy reliance on the US dollar for regional and international transactions. As Asia's role in the global economy continues to expand, its dependence on the US dollar is bound to increase, raising further its vulnerability to future liquidity shocks. The use of regional currencies for <b>bilateral</b> trade <b>settlement</b> could reduce such vulnerability. As demonstrated by the renminbi trade settlement scheme piloted between the People's Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; and Macao, China, the existence of appropriate financial infrastructure could reduce the relatively larger costs of bilateral currency transactions compared with triangular transactions through the United States dollar. As most central banks are securities depositories of government bonds, combining trade settlement with government bond securities settlement could also have large synergy effects without substantial extra costs. This proposal does not require full liberalization of the capital account or full deregulation of capital markets, and is more politically feasible in transition. As such, extending the trade settlement scheme to the rest of Asia and appending a government bond payment and securities settlement system could be a practical solution to international monetary system reform and the diversification of settlement currencies...|$|R

The bilateral trade cost in different countries and regions vary greatly, especially in some countries, the trade cost increases in a certain extent. Even signing FTA with China, the trade cost is still high, and the bilateral trade cost between China and countries that along with the “Belt and Road” is not only higher than that between China and developed countries, but also higher than that between China and developing countries. The policy implication is that reducing the aggregate trade cost is still arduous, and the regional structure of bilateral trade cost should be improved, free-trade zone should play an effective role. Since the trade cost, from a full sense, includes transportation cost, information cost, policy barriers cost, contract implementation cost, legal and regulation cost and distribution costs, reducing trade cost should take these components into consideration in order to further promote the implementation of the strategy of the “Belt and Road”. The following aspects should be paid attention: (1) Speeding up the construction of railways, highways, ports and other hardware infrastructure, which is the most basic link to reduce the transport trade costs. (2) Make efforts to promote the interoperability of information and communication technology in the internet era, to strengthen cultural exchanges, to reduce information costs and distribution costs. (3) Actively carry out the financial cooperation and gradually implement the <b>bilateral</b> currency <b>settlement,</b> reduce the cost of currency exchange. (4) To coordinate the interconnection of rules, regulations, standards, policies, laws and so on, for example, there are differences between China and the United States in the railway width standard, which are the objective obstacles that cannot be overcome. However, the interoperability in legal, institutional and policy can reduce the cost of contract execution and policy barriers. (5) We should give full play to the existing silk-road fund and the Asian infrastructure investment bank to reduce trade cost, or to learn from the EU to strengthen the interoperability of infrastructure and to alleviate the financial constraints of the difficult situation.|$|R

But, these settlements can also operate {{at the opposite end}} of the spectrum, with far more substantial consequences. Correctly structured, these settlement offers allow defendants to preclude the certification of a class action. These settlements thus offer an incredibly powerful tool in deterring or rendering impotent nuisance-value litigation by de facto converting any claim from an opt-out class action into an opt-in settlement. While arbitration provisions have been used as a mechanism for preventing class certification, they inherently can only reach contractual relationships; <b>bilateral</b> mass <b>settlements</b> are not so constricted, allowing them to reach any mass claim. This transition from opt-out to opt-in mechanisms upends the traditionally assumed relationship between the interests of compensation, deterrence, and legitimacy with respect to mass wrongs. This balance is far more complex than has been posited in the existing analyses and demonstrates that the twin fundamental assumptions of our class action system are not unchanging truths but instead mere default positions. Indeed, in this new world, defendants now have the ability to prevent almost every class from being certified against them—yet, as the analysis demonstrates, they may not choose to do so. In short, this Article seeks to replace our conception of the public aggregate litigation system with a new, more comprehensive model that also incorporates the private ordering that is driving this new emerging generation of aggregate claims mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Concerns about {{counterfeiting}} and piracy {{are becoming}} increasingly widespread and have now taken on an international dimension. Higher standards of intellectual property protection are being set multilaterally and through the inclusion of intellectual property provisions in bilateral trade agreements. The EU Strategy for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Third Countries has undertaken to revisit the approach to the intellectual property rights chapter of bilateral agreements, including the clarification and strengthening of the enforcement clauses. This approach should be reconsidered {{in the light of}} ongoing negotiations on bilateral trade agreements with a number of trading partners such as Korea, India, and ASEAN, while negotiations on bilateral trade with Ukraine and Russia are also being considered. If the Lisbon Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) comes into force, the European Parliament will have a significantly enhanced role to play in the negotiation of such agreements, including the power of veto. In scrutinising and giving consent to agreements, it is recommended that the European Parliament takes account of the following: (1) if intellectual property enforcement provisions are to be included in agreements, this must be done on the basis of adequate evidence on the level of counterfeiting and piracy and its effects; (2) intellectual property rights are private rights and the main responsibility for taking measures to protect and enforce intellectual property rights should lie with individual right holders; (3) the European Parliament should consider carefully the need to balance flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement with the need for additional provisions in bilateral agreements to fight counterfeiting and piracy; (4) agreements that contain provisions on recourse to <b>bilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> mechanisms risk weakening the multilateral dispute settlement system; (5) provisions in agreements that expand the scope of border measures to cover exports as well as goods in transit or transhipment should not be unnecessarily burdensome and should be subject to the availability of judicial review; (6) the European Parliament should encourage the EU to undertake needs assessments in third countries to ensure that adequate and appropriate technical and financial cooperation is made available on mutually agreed terms and conditions in order to assist with the training of police, customs officers, judiciary and other government officials; (7) it would be advantageous to establish a parliamentary forum or an inter-parliamentary observatory to monitor and assess the impact of bilateral agreements in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores from a {{regional}} perspective the distorted nature of trade in energy products within the CIS countries. The persistence of pricing distortions, barter arrangements, and discriminatory access to pipelines, {{as well as}} failure to honor contracts, has disrupted and distorted energy exports to non-CIS countries, undermined energy sector reforms, and distorted investment decisions. The paper focuses on cross-border issues as an integral component of the wider problem of inefficient energy use within the CIS. Several policy recommendations are proposed, including measures to foster greater competition, reduce state involvement, and promote regional cooperation.

40|$|The European Union 2 ̆ 7 s {{policies}} {{towards the}} states on its new, post- 2004 enlargement, external borders (the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Cotonou project) present complementary yet competing tendencies: {{the establishment of}} Pax Mercatoria (the model historically developed in and by the EC itself, wherein international political stability is facilitated by economic interdependence) {{and the pursuit of}} Pax Europea (the establishment of a European zone of superior international economic, political and legal influence). The balance between these will ultimately be struck by the cumulative economic, political and social effects of the new legal arrangements. This paper focuses on one issue affecting this balance, the role of trade dispute resolution provisions in the EU 2 ̆ 7 s Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), and their 2 ̆ 7 juridical interface 2 ̆ 7 with the dispute settlement system of the WTO. I argue that the dispute settlement provisions of most EC RTAs (and their practice) contribute to the maintenance and management of the EC 2 ̆ 7 s regional economic pre-eminence by encouraging and perpetuating non-judicialized, <b>bilateral</b> diplomatic dispute <b>settlement</b> in which the EC enjoys distinct advantages. This substitutes and subverts the more judicialized, rule-based dispute resolution system that is available on a formal basis in the WTO, and on an unutilized basis in most EC RTAs. In this regard, existing EC RTA dispute settlement does not conform to the theoretical requisites for the achievement of a regional Pax Mercatoria (which in my analysis include effectiveness, automaticity, and legalized juridical interface with the WTO), but is rather more designed in furtherance of a Pax Europea. This contradicts the Pax Mercatoria ethos of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s contemporary regional policies, is contrary to the EU 2 ̆ 7 s advocacy of the rule of law, and depicts the EU as a 2 ̆ 7 poor man 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 hegemon {{in the shadow of the}} United States. It is therefore in the interest of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s own initiatives to reform the dispute settlement procedures in its regional trade agreements, to bring them more in line with its strategic statements, by introducing improved, judicialized dispute settlement in RTAs...|$|R
