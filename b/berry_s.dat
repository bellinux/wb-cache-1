40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} transcriptional regulation by growth hormone (GH) remain unknown. We report here that GH receptor immunoreactivity {{can be demonstrated}} in the nuclei of GH-responsive rat and rabbit tissues at both the light and electron micrograph level using monoclonal antibodies to the receptor extracellular domain. Nuclear staining is heterogeneous and associated with both chromatin and the nuclear membrane. To confirm these observations, nuclei were isolated from rabbit liver by two methods, one involving extensive nonionic detergent washes. Scatchard analysis of nuclear fractions revealed high affinity somatogenic receptor in nuclear membranes, nucleoplasm, and chromatin fractions. A panel of GH receptor monoclonal antibodies was used to further define these nuclear binding sites as being antigenically identical to microsomal receptor {{in all but one}} case. In addition, affinity cross-linking experiments showed the somatogenic binding subunit to have a reduced Mr of 67, 000, similar to the Mr of the GH binding protein. We propose that the association of a GH binding protein with the nucleus may provide a means whereby GH can regulate the transcription of specific genes either directly or indirectly through nuclear kinase C activation. This speculation is congruent with the recent demonstration of a GH response element by Yoon et al. (Yoon, J. B., <b>Berry,</b> <b>S.</b> A., Seelig, S., and Towle, H. C. (1990) J. Biol.

40|$|In {{metallic}} ferromagnets, external voltages induce {{charge and}} spin-polarized currents. Additionally, {{there can be}} magnetization dynamics, where the magnetic moments precess in time in response to external magnetic fields. The exchange interaction strongly couples the spin-polarized currents with the magnetization dynamics. In this way, external voltages can induce magnetization dynamics or, vice versa, external magnetic fields can induce currents. In ferromagnets, the long-range dipole interaction leads {{to the formation of}} magnetic domains, regions of aligned magnetic moments. In between the magnetic domains, there are domain walls, where the magnetization gradually varies. Such domain walls move in response to external magnetic fields. Previous studies have shown that a moving domain wall in ferromagnets generates a spin-motive force on the conduction electrons. In turn, the spin-motive force generates currents. Experimentally, the spin-motive induced currents have been detected. So far, research in this field has neglected the ubiquitous Coulomb interaction between the electrons. The central question we address is how Coulomb interaction between electrons affects the transport of the electrons subject to the spin-motive forces. To study this question, we first reproduce the known results of spin-motive forces when the magnetic domain wall is of the Neel type. The moving domain wall generates a spin-polarized electric current. We discuss its <b>Berry</b> <b>s</b> phase origin. Beyond previous studies, we find that the Coulomb interaction between the electrons leads to the screening of the spin-motive induced accumulated charges. The screening takes within the Thomas-Fermi screening length, which is very short in high-density metals. While screening strongly modifies the accumulated charges in the ferromagnets, the domain wall motion induced currents remains unaffected due to current conservation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of 3 independent essays on economic theory. Each essay {{is meant to be}} read separately, including footnotes and appendices. In particular, essays 2 and 3 include specific bibliography. The general bibliography is included {{at the end of the}} thesis. The first essay reviews some well known conceptual and empirical problems that appear when economic theorists deal with preferences and choice theory, in general. While assessing those problems, the essay lays the ground for a detailed discussion of the possibility of preference learning, formation and change. The essay concludes proposing a theoretical framework to study these phenomena. The second essay, although independent from the first, is also devoted to the issue of preference change. In particular, it studies the possibility that cultural preferences evolve as a result of the combination of technological innovation and cultural transmission mechanisms. At the same time, it allows for the possibility that those cultural preferences determine the short term outcome of economic variables. In addition, it builds a framework where the combination of technological innovation, cultural transmission and economic structure lead to a process of endogenous preference heterogeneity and clustering. Hence it provides a model to understand how culture and the economic structure interact and coevolve. The third essay presents some theoretical problems that arise when using the concept of a matching function as a modelling device for the labor market. In particular, necessary conditions for the ratio of the number of matches per job searcher to be interpreted as the average job finding probability are established. References [Abel, 1990] Abel, A.

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the experiences of 5 th - 9 th-grade Russian-speaking pupils in Helsinki municipal schools. The {{aim of the research}} is to examine relation between children s subjective psychological well-being and their acculturation type and to investigate other factors, first and foremost social network and duration of stay in Finland, that influence psychological well-being of children. The study also aims to describe main problems Russian-speaking children face in schools, and the sources, from which children get help. It is a quantitative study, based on the data collected by questionnaire survey and analyzed by computer statistical program SPSS 14. 0. The questionnaire survey was carried out by the researcher in autumn 2006 and the data was analyzed in 2007. The research was conducted with the permission of Helsinki Educational Board. Theoretical foundation for the research is provided by John <b>Berry</b> <b>s</b> two-dimensional acculturation model. According to the results of the research Russian-speaking children are satisfied with life in Finland and report to have high level of subjective well-being. Duration of staying in Finland has positive effect on the subjective well-being as well as good relations within family, especially with the mother. Subjective well-being is also influenced by the acculturation strategy that child selects: it is connected to the host culture national identity, like in assimilation and integration strategies, while marginalization strategy results in the high level of stress. Although Russians belong to the immigrant group, which is not physically visible in the society, the respondents do perceive national discrimination from peer pupils in schools. The survey shows that some of the teachers also contribute to this problem by not intervening into bullying or making themselves insulting comments about Russians. The national discrimination appears more often in schools with higher number of Russian-speaking pupils and it is perceived more by those children, who had lived longer in Finland. The research revealed one risk-group among Russian-speaking children a group of children, that has no-one in their surrounding, with whom they could share own problems. This group consists of one tenth of the respondents, mostly represented by boys, who select marginalization acculturation strategy. Their situation can lead to a high level of stress and depression as well as other psychological and mental problems. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|A single {{polypeptide}} chain may {{access to an}} astronomical amount of conformers[1]. Nature selected only a trivial number of them through evolution, composing an alphabet of scaffolds, which can afford the complete set of chemical reactions needed to support life[2]. These structural templates are so stable to allow several mutations without disruption of the global folding even reaching the ability to bind several exogenous cofactors. In this perspective metal cofactors {{play a crucial role}} in regulation and catalysis of several processes. Nature is able to modulate the chemistry of metals adopting only few ligands and slightly different geometries[3]. Thus, understanding how the fine-tuning of the scaffolds hosting them imparts the wide spectrum of reactivity is of crucial interest both in the fields of structural biology and bioinorganic chemistry. Several scaffolds and metal binding motifs are object of intense work in the literature[4]. In this PhD work, we focused on the four-helix bundle as scaffold for metal binding sites in the context of protein de novo design, to obtain basic biochemical components for biosensing or catalysis. In order to accomplish our objectives we chose to expand the designable space of a well-characterized de novo designed family of metalloproteins, the DFs (Due-Ferro). DF 1, the progenitor of the family, bears a dicarboxylate bridged dinuclear metal center in its hydrophobic core constituted by the four-helix bundle unit[5]. We investigated the opportunity to find new chemical properties[6, 7] by loosening on the one side and tightening on the other the C 2 symmetric environment of the metal cofactor, giving raise to two new class of de novo designed proteins: DF-Click and QF. Previous attempts to design asymmetrical DFs gave successful results[8, 9], even resulting in catalytic activity towards different oxidation reaction[8] upon redesign of the metal binding site[7]. We implemented an alternative synthetic approach to generate new DF analogues by means of copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), also known as “Click Chemistry”[10]. Our design strategy led to a helix-loop-helix heterodimer, obtained through side chain chemical ligation, affording the DF-Click series. The design, synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of an analogue of this series named DF-Click 1, which was inspired to the hydroxylase component of the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs) [11], was completed during the PhD research activity by means of solution NMR, circular dichroism, UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. Further, as we were interested in the metal properties induced by an asymmetrical site, we also evaluated the opportunity to design a model with a higher degree of symmetry. We aimed to the synthesis of a D 2 symmetric homotetramer able to bind a tetranuclear metal cofactor. We named this novel de novo designed protein class QF (Quattro Ferro). It consists of four helix strands each one bearing the ExxH binding motif as in helix 2 of DF 1. It was inspired to the cubane like Mn-O cluster found in Photosystem II, where four manganese ions provide the oxidative equivalents necessary for the four electrons oxidation of water. During the PhD work, the design process, synthesis and spectroscopic analysis of four analogues were accomplished: W 45 Y 27 and W 45 Y 28, which derive from the ab initio design of a protein crystal with predetermined topology; QF 6 and QF 33, whose design derives from the serendipitous finding of an already deposited crystal structure of a GCN 4 mutant with a similar crystal topology, but without the desired polarity. A combination of NMR and X-Ray analysis confirms the correctness of the design. Spectroscopic analysis intended to ascertain the metal binding stoichiometry and geometry is under course.
