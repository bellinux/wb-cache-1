25|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> {{press is}} also known for its high {{capacity}} throughput, as {{it is designed to}} handle excess capacity. It has low initial costs and low energy running costs, however, if throughput is less than 4 million gallons per day, the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> press may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical dewatering methods such as drying beds or reed beds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>filter</b> {{designs are}} crafted using {{manufacturer}} design and performance data, operating installations, pilot testing, surveys of similar plants {{and testing of}} the wastewater solids to obtain a desired dewatered solid percentage from the sludge or slurry to be processed.|$|E
25|$|Belt {{filters are}} less {{effective}} at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a digester, {{the use of}} belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs. Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time. Water and time wastage, {{as well as the}} associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using effluents.|$|E
50|$|Wash deinking {{consists}} of a washing stage where dispersants are added to wash out the printing inks. When the pulp slurry is dewatered (thickened), the medium to fine particles are washed out. This process is most useful for removing particles smaller than about 30 µm, like water-based inks, fillers, coating particles, fines and micro stickies. This process is more common when making deinked pulp for tissue. The processing equipment are <b>belt</b> <b>filters,</b> pressure <b>belt</b> <b>filters,</b> disk filters and static filters. This stage is much more efficient than normal washing / dewatering stages.|$|R
25|$|Some {{dewatering}} objectives include {{reducing the}} volume {{to reduce the}} transport and storage costs, removing liquids before landfill disposal, reducing fuel requirements before further drying or incineration, producing adequate material for composting, avoiding runoff and pooling when used for land applications, and optimizing other drying processes. <b>Belt</b> <b>filters</b> are specifically designed {{for each of these}} particular applications and feeds.|$|R
25|$|The minimum cake {{discharge}} thickness for horizontal <b>belt</b> press <b>filters</b> is in {{the region}} of 5mm.|$|R
25|$|Belt {{filters are}} {{considered}} simple and reliable, with good availability, low staffing, easy maintenance {{and a long}} life. The <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> is most advantageous when installed such that it is open and viewable at floor level for easier adjustment and monitoring. This is of course subject to what lighting and ventilation will allow.|$|E
25|$|The <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> {{is mainly}} used for {{dewatering}} of sludge and slurry and juice extraction from apples, pears and other fruits, {{as well as}} grapes for winemaking, etc. Belt filters are used both municipally and industrially {{in a range of}} areas including urban sewage and wastewater treatment, metallurgy and mining, steel plants, coal plants, breweries, dyeing, tanneries, as well as chemical and paper factories.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} separation processes {{similar to the}} <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> press used for dewatering, including centrifuges, vacuum-disc filters, and the {{plate and frame filter}} press. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing, belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{performance}} of a <b>belt</b> press <b>filter</b> is improved where variations in parameters such as sludge type, feed solids concentration and conditioning are minimised.|$|R
25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} dewatering options are a thickener, deep bed thickening, belt presses and membrane filter presses. In general centrifuges and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the <b>belt</b> press <b>filter,</b> for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. <b>Belt</b> press <b>filters</b> in general have the lowest flocculant consumption {{for any of the}} listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.|$|R
30|$|The {{success of}} {{dewatering}} FCPW {{is the key}} to emplacement of dewatered FCPW. Disk <b>belt</b> <b>filters</b> and deep cone paste thickeners have been used in this application with mixed success. In some cases powdered limestone additions have been used it as a drying and cementing agent to achieve the proper moisture-density relationship suggested by laboratory testing. These applications have been in some cases limited to sites with concerns regarding potential stability or environmental problems associated with the disposal structure. In general most of the industry avoids mixing different wastes due to permitting and/or a long-term environmental liability concerns.|$|R
25|$|The {{applications}} of a <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> are only {{limited to the}} sludges, slurry or mashed fruit that it can process. The sludges from municipal use include raw, anaerobically digested and aerobically digested sludges, alum sludge, lime softening sludge and river water silt. In industry, any sludge or slurry is sourced from food processing wastes, pulp and paper wastes, chemical sludges, pharmaceutical wastes, industrial waste processing sludges, and petrochemical wastes. These wastes can include mixed sludge, mineral slurry, dust sediment, selected coal washing mud, biological sludge, primary sludge, and straw, wood or waste paper pulp.|$|E
25|$|The V-fold belt {{is similar}} to the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> press with the main {{difference}} being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.|$|E
25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> (sometimes {{called a}} belt press filter, or <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> press) is an {{industrial}} machine, used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the dewatering of sludges in the chemical industry, mining and water treatment. <b>Belt</b> <b>filter</b> presses {{are also used}} {{in the production of}} apple juice, cider and winemaking. The process of filtration is primarily obtained by passing a pair of filtering cloths and belts through a system of rollers.

2500|$|Belt {{filters are}} very {{versatile}} and {{are made to}} suit the sludges, slurries or mashed fruit to be processed. For a feed or treatment process which produces unpleasant odours, volatile emissions, pathogens and hazardous gases like hydrogen sulphide the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> can include fume hoods or even be completely enclosed in a gas tight housing. [...] Due to the reduced visibility and increased corrosion associated with enclosure, the <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> process can also be automated.

2500|$|The <b>belt</b> <b>filter</b> {{press is}} often used in {{wastewater}} treatment, and thus the odour of the feed sludge, volatile emissions and the chemicals used in treatment, may become a problem.

Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths. Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cost and}} {{effectiveness}} of three solids thickening processes, i. e., gravity thickening settlers (GTS), inclined <b>belt</b> <b>filters</b> (IBF), geotextile bag filters (GBF), were individually evaluated with the biosolids backwash produced in intensive aquaculture systems equipped with microscreen drum filters and radial-flow settlers. The IBF produced the cleanest discharge and highest treatment efficiencies, likely reflecting the rapid efficiency with which solids are separated from wastewater. The GBF was the least effective process, i. e., GBF leachate contained the highest concentrations of TP, TN, and cBOD. However, GBF was most effective for sludge volume reduction. Capital cost estimates for an IBF were {{more than twice that}} of GTS and GBF of similar treatment capacity. The GTS had the lowest capital and annual operating cost estimates. The estimated annual operating cost of the GBF was orders of magnitude higher than the IBF and GTS, due to the high cost to replace bags...|$|R

As an alternative to primary settlers in treating municipal wastewater, Salsnes, a subsidiary company of Trojan Technologies offers rotating <b>belt</b> <b>filters</b> (RBF) to treat the wastewater. A bench scale filtration unit of the RBF was developed to investigate the effect of varying water qualities from several wastewater plants in London, Ontario on the performance of the filter. The unit can achieve up to 80 % reduction in total suspended solids (TSS), and 60 % reduction in COD. As expected, flux of the filter meshes decreases with continuous filtration, while TSS, COD removal efficiency increases due to cake filtration.
