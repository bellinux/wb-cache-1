5|$|Although a honeyeater, {{the striped}} honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as <b>being</b> <b>of</b> least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Ancestry {{information}} {{reported in}} the 2000 Census reflects the diversity of Teaneck residents, with no single country accounting {{for more than a}} small fraction of the population. Residents listed Italian (6.2%), German (6.0%), Russian (5.3%), Irish (5.1%) and Polish (4.2%) as the most common countries of ancestry, and an additional 4.3% listed United States. 6.3% of residents identified themselves as <b>being</b> <b>of</b> West Indian ancestry, of which 3.4% were from Jamaica.|$|E

5|$|Both Pyrrhocorax {{species have}} {{extensive}} geographical ranges and large populations; neither {{is thought to}} approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and they are therefore evaluated as <b>being</b> <b>of</b> Least Concern. However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small and isolated.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{quoted a}} passage from Aristotle's Physics II 8 in The Origin of Species, which entertains the {{possibility}} of a selection process following the random combination of body parts.

5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the European nightjar range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total global {{population of}} 2–6million individuals. Although {{there appears to be}} a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as <b>being</b> <b>of</b> Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Fragmentation of {{woodland}} {{can lead}} to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' range is still expanding.

5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{range over}} a large area of Africa and southern Asia.

Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|Host-parasite mimicry is a {{situation}} where a parasite mimics its own host. As with mimicry of the female sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic <b>being</b> <b>of</b> the same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
