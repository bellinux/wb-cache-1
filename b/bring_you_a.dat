500|$|On 17 June 1947, {{serialisation}} of {{the story}} paused after Hergé disappeared. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown {{as a result of}} overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote, [...] "Life has spoilt me... I no longer draw like I breathe, as I used to not so long ago. Tintin is no longer me... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> new episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, our friend is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E

2500|$|Doctor Who and the Terror of the Autons, {{written by}} Dicks, gives further clarity {{to the history}} between the Doctor and the Master. When the Time Lord (played by David Garth in the {{original}} serial) comes to warn the Doctor, he states [...] "I've come to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> warning, {{an old friend of}} yours has arrived on Earth. These days he calls himself The Master." [...] The narrative states that [...] " [...] had been behind several interplanetary wars, always disappearing from the scene before he could be brought to justice. If ever he were caught, his fate would be far worse than the Doctor's exile. Once captured by the Time Lords, the Master's life-stream would be thrown into reverse. Not only would he no longer exist, he never would have existed." [...] The Doctor asks [...] "Is his TARDIS still working?". The Time Lord replies [...] "I'm afraid so. He got away before it could be de-energised." [...] "Then he was luckier than I" [...] said the Doctor sadly. He had never really got used to his exile. The Time Lord replies [...] "Don't be bitter Doctor, your punishment was comparatively light".|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{develops}} {{this discussion}} of games into the key {{notion of a}} language-game. Wittgenstein introduces the term using simple examples, but intends it {{to be used for}} the many ways in which we use language. The central component of language games is that they are uses of language, and language is used in multifarious ways. For example, in one language-game, a word might be used to stand for (or refer to) an object, but in another the same word might be used for giving orders, or for asking questions, and so on. The famous example is {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "game". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, [...] "war games". These are all different uses of the word [...] "games". Wittgenstein also gives the example of [...] "Water!", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or as an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word [...] "water" [...] has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society.|$|E
