25|$|Meanwhile, in Grand Valley {{with the}} promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each {{bringing}} more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. Rosser, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that “I’ll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> a town of any kind is ever built here". So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, two miles west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this quarter section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.|$|E
500|$|The British Royal House faced {{a serious}} problem during the First World War because of its blood ties to the ruling family of Germany, Britain's prime adversary in the war. Before the war, the British royal family had been known as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1910, George V became King {{on the death of}} his father, King Edward VII, and {{remained}} king throughout the war. He was the first cousin of the German Kaiser WilhelmII, who came to symbolise all the horrors of the war. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the German Royal House of Württemberg. During the war H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's [...] "alien and uninspiring court", and George famously replied: [...] "I may be uninspiring, but I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I'm alien." ...|$|E

As the song opens, she tells her lover, [...] "I can't let you go", and that she will not allow another woman to take everything she owns, including the chinchilla coats and {{the house on the}} coast. Knowles screams the refrain—"Ring the alarm, I've been doin this too long / But I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I see another chick on your arm"—"through a thick fog of distortion", as noted by Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that she chants the lines with grit and urgency, while Breihan wrote that she sings them [...] "with a frantic intensity". Knowles later declares that her relationship is [...] "not the picture perfect movie everyone would assume".|$|E

500|$|William Corder (born 1803) {{was the son}} of a local {{farmer and}} had a {{reputation}} as something of a fraudster and a ladies' man. He was known as [...] "Foxey" [...] at school because of his sly manner. He had fraudulently sold his father's pigs, although his father had settled the matter without involving the law, but Corder had not changed his behaviour. He later obtained money by passing a forged cheque for £93 and he had helped local thief Samuel [...] "Beauty" [...] Smith steal a pig from a neighbouring village. When Smith was questioned by the local constable over the theft, he made a prophetic statement concerning Corder: [...] "I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> he will not be hung some of these days". Corder had been sent to London in disgrace after his fraudulent sale of the pigs, but he was recalled to Polstead when his brother Thomas drowned attempting to cross a frozen pond. His father and three brothers all died within 18 months of each other and only William remained to run the farm with his mother.|$|E
500|$|On 4 August 1914 the King {{wrote in}} his diary, [...] "I held a council at 10.45 to declare war with Germany. It is a terrible {{catastrophe}} {{but it is not}} our fault.... Please to God it may soon be over." [...] From 1914 to 1918, Britain and its allies were at war with the Central Powers, led by the German Empire. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II, who for the British public came to symbolise all the horrors of the war, was the King's first cousin. The King's paternal grandfather was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; consequently, the King and his children bore the titles Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke and Duchess of Saxony. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the German Dukes of Württemberg. The King had brothers-in-law and cousins who were British subjects but who bore German titles such as Duke and Duchess of Teck, Prince and Princess of Battenberg, and Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein. When H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's [...] "alien and uninspiring court", George famously replied: [...] "I may be uninspiring, but I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I'm alien." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his term, Scott was {{dogged by}} rumors of heavy {{drinking}} and {{frequent use of}} profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> it will." [...] When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, [...] "Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" [...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E

Her growing popularity led to the Pacific Science Center extending an invitation to Ray to take over the nearly-bankrupt science museum for an annual salary of $20,000. Ray jumped at the opportunity and immediately began a top-to-bottom overhaul of the center, declaring [...] "I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I'm going to become a landlady to a hoary old museum."

After fears of violence across the Arab world proved exaggerated following {{the beginning of the}} Afghan War, commentators dismissed the Arab street as apathetic and harmless, only to suddenly reclaim it as an object of fear when popular protests erupted all over the region in response to Israel's 2002 invasion of the West Bank.

2500|$|The {{absence of}} any other combatants had bought Serapis a {{considerable}} amount of time. Bonhomme Richard’s gun decks were now so badly damaged that most of the British shots were passing straight through without touching anything, and the great guns were almost completely silenced. There were almost as many fires to be extinguished as there were aboard Serapis, but on the other hand, the hold was filling with water because one of the pumps was in ruins. Commodore Jones was exhausted, and apparently slumped on the chicken coop for a brief rest. Somehow (according to his later memoirs), a rumour went around that he was dead or dying, and his gunner and carpenter, both wounded, hastily consulted with the master-at-arms. Together they decided, a little before 10pm, to surrender by striking the ship’s colours, but the flag had already been shot away, so their only option was to shout. Captain Pearson shouted back, asking whether the Americans had really struck their colours. Possibly his Lieutenant of Marines relayed this message. Certainly, Jones’s reply was firmly negative. Jones himself recalled shouting {{something along the lines of}} [...] "I have not yet thought of it, but I am determined to make you strike," [...] at which point, presumably, the surrendering officers realised he was still very much alive and returned to their duties. A much more dramatic version appeared in newspapers within days of the event, allegedly based on the testimony of an ex-crewman who thought he heard something like [...] "I may sink, but I’ll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I strike", and witnessed the captain using his pistols to shoot the three officers who were attempting to surrender ...|$|E
2500|$|While Powys's {{starting}} {{point in this}} novel is the historical facts about Owen Glendower and the early fifteenth century, found {{in the works of}} historians such as J. E. Lloyd and J. H. Wylie, he also draws on legend, especially those relating to the mysterious disappearance of Glendower, and the idea that he was a magician. In addition Powys makes use of literature, including the poetry of Iolo Goch, Shakespeare's Henry IV (Part I), and Lady Charlotte Guest's The Mabinogion, a collection of eleven prose stories collated from medieval Welsh manuscripts. The Welsh mythology of this latter work, especially the Four Branches of the Mabinogi (from which Guest derived her title), is particularly important in Owen Glendower and in Powys's next novel [...] Jeremy Hooker sees The Mabinogion as having [...] "a significant presence [...] through character's knowledge of its stories and identification of themselves or others with figures or incidents in the stories". When Rhisiart, for example, first sees Owen Glendower, he remarks, [...] "I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> he doesn't look like [...] Pryderi!", while earlier, in Chapter Two, Tegolin remarks that when Rhisiart defended her he [...] "looked like Pwyll [...] riding against Halfgan [...] King of Annwn. Indeed there are [...] "almost fifty allusions to these four [...] tales"' (The Four Branches of the Mabinogi) in the novel, though [...] "some that are fairly obscure and inconspicuous". Two thirds of Powys's allusions are from [...] "Branwen, daughter of Llŷr", whose main character is Brân the Blessed, Bendigeidfran, a giant and king of Britain, who Powys associates with the fortress of Rhisiart's ancestors, Castell Dinas Brân (though there is no known connection with the castle and this mythological hero). There are also important associations between Bran and another setting in the novel, Harlech. Powys also draws on [...] "Culhwch and Olwen" [...] (a tale about a hero connected with King Arthur and his warriors), the [...] "Book of Taliesin", both also found in Guest's Mabinogion, as well as mentioning Merlin, and the poet Aneirin, so that is [...] "clear that [...] intended his ideal reader to be made perpetually aware of the ancient Welsh mythical and literary heritage". Pryderi, Pwll, and Bran are midway [...] "between gods and human beings", and can move [...] "freely between the human world and Annwn, the Welsh 'Otherworld'". Jeremy Hooker, {{goes so far as to}} propose that [...] "the mythology is more essential, more integral, to this romance than its historical circumstances are". However, Glen Cavaliero suggests that [...] "the mythogical element" [...] is more [...] "a kind of continuous undertow" [...] and [...] "for the most part it is the outward action which carries the message of the [...] ".|$|E
