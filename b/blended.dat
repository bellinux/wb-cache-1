EVA {{was added}} into PC/PLA <b>blends</b> as a {{modifier}} {{for improving the}} impact strength of <b>blends,</b> and meanwhile the thermal properties and rheological properties of <b>blends</b> should also be influenced. PC/PLA/EVA <b>blends</b> were prepared by melt <b>blending</b> and the catalyst DBTO was added into the <b>blends</b> in <b>blending</b> process to catalyze the transesterification of PC and EVA for improving the compatibility of <b>blends.</b> The effects of <b>blend</b> composition and transesterification on the thermal and rheological properties of <b>blends</b> were investigated.
