25|$|Fossils of Hesperosaurus {{have since}} 1985 {{been found in}} the state of Wyoming and Montana in the United States of America. The type species Hesperosaurus mjosi was named in 2001. It is from an older part of the Morrison Formation, and so a little older than other Morrison stegosaurs. Several {{relatively}} complete skeletons of Hesperosaurus are known. One specimen preserves the first known impression of the horn sheath of a stegosaurian <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} aisle wall are three {{monument}}s all of white marble on black marble back plates. One is to Mrs Penelope Cholmeley (died 1821 aged 75 years), {{the sister of}} Montague Chomeley. Her remains were interred at Twyford, Middlesex. The monument <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> is straight sided with top and bottom curved and facetted. The raised inscription plaque is oblong with a 45° cut at each corner, over which is a moulded shelf, on which sits an urn with 'cloth' swagging attached and topped with a flambeau. Floriate devices are a boss {{each side of the}} urn, bell flower ribbons hanging from the shelf either side of the plaque, and an oval flower and leaf spray below. The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and co-heiress of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved. The raised inscription plaque is rectilinear, and sits on a square-edged stepped shelf supported by curved brackets with embossed acanthus decoration, with a device of two strapped palm leaves below. At each side of the plaque is a hanging folded drape attached to a moulded cornice. At each side of the cornice top is a conch shell which provides the holding point for a plain swag that springs from a knot above; between the swagging is a raised cross. The monument was provided by George Wilcox of Piccadilly. Above this monument is one smaller to James Harrison Cholmeley (1808–1854), of a scrolled plaque on a straight sided <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> with a pointed top; above the scroll sits a decorative crest.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>backing</b> <b>plates</b> on the {{radiation}} dose received by thin nylon films were calculated using recently developed multilayer electron transport codes.

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for attaching strain gages to substrates is described. A strain gage having a <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> {{is attached to}} a substrate by using a foil of brazing material between the <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> and substrate. A pair of electrodes that are connected to a current source, are applied to opposite sides of the <b>backing</b> <b>plate,</b> so that heating of the structure occurs primarily along the relatively highly conductive foil of brazing material. Field installations are facilitated by utilizing a <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> with wings extending at an upward incline from either side of the <b>backing</b> <b>plate,</b> by attaching the electrodes to the wings to perform the brazing operation, and by breaking off the wings after the brazing is completed...|$|R
25|$|The normal {{method of}} {{installation}} of a large spinner on a light aircraft involves installing a circular spinner <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> over the engine driveshaft, then the propeller, followed by a spinner front plate. The spinner dome is then mounted over this assembly and secured with screws to the back and front plates. Small plates are usually fitted behind the propeller {{to fill in the}} spinner dome cutouts and are secured to the backplate again with screws. Some spinner designs do not incorporate the front plate, although these are not suitable for higher-powered engines.|$|E
25|$|The 1st century AD saw the {{widespread}} use of plate fibulae. Plate fibulae consist of a flat plate. Since there is little space between the fibula body and the pin (there is no arch to the body), plate fibulae could not be used to fasten much material and were therefore mainly decorative. Most plate fibulae have a hinge assembly on the <b>back.</b> <b>Plate</b> fibulae are generally associated with women’s graves. The most common forms of plate fibula in the 1st century AD were round (disc), diamond, oval and lunula (crescent- or moon-shaped).|$|E
25|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two different types}} of relief. There are carvings of a hand with a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> that are very closely related technically and formally with complete sculptures. In addition, there are also flat reliefs, in which the figures are only a few centimeters carved into the stone. These reliefs are continuing Assyrian and Persian, or pre-Hellenistic, traditions and are visually similar to paintings. Here, as in the painting, there are narrative representations. The figures are mostly frontally facing the viewer. Especially in southwest present-day Iran, in ancient Elymais, many rock reliefs were carved in open air sites in this style. Their execution is mostly rather coarse.|$|E

40|$|Brush seal dynamic {{behavior}} is {{strongly related to}} pressure and flow fields. Developments in brush seal design have led to geometric modifications to control flow field and consequent brush seal issues including blow-down, hang-up, and pressure stiffening. Some of the geometric enhancements {{have been found to}} have common use as <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> modifications. Over the two decades of brush seal evolution, many <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations have been suggested in numerous patent disclosures. Even so, literature on the effects of geometric modifications on pressure and flow fields remains limited. This study numerically investigates brush seal pressure and flow fields for such common conceptual <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations as single and multiple grooves, with and without by-pass passages. The CFD analysis presented employs a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations outlining important flow features is discussed. Results indicate that <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations have a decisive role in shaping seal pressure fields. In general, it has been found that all cases having bypass configuration leak more. Moreover, the major portion of the seal leakage through fence height is fed from the <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> cavity. The single <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> groove forms a constant pressure behind the bristle pack. In contrast, multiple grooves form multiple constant pressure regions...|$|R
40|$|A spring-mounted rasp bar sheller for com is {{described}} herein. The sheller comprises {{a plurality of}} spaced apart rasp bars mounted on a combine or sheller cylinder. Each of the rasp bars has studs secured thereto which extend therefrom through the cylinder <b>backing</b> <b>plates.</b> Springs are mounted on the studs behind the <b>backing</b> <b>plates</b> for yieldably urging the rasp bar inwardly towards the <b>backing</b> <b>plate.</b> Centrifugal force causes the rasp bar to move out radially towards the concave as the cylinder is rotated. During shelling, impact forces on the rasp bars deflect them radially inwardly. Filler plates are also disclosed for preventing the com from becoming lodged between the <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> and the rasp bars...|$|R
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

40|$|The use of moissanite (single crystal SiC) for <b>backing</b> <b>plates</b> within diamond anvil cells (DACs) {{has been}} developed.

2500|$|One-dollar {{bills were}} again {{the subject of}} {{experimentation}} in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a web-fed Intaglio printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRN's, the BEP sent out a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes {{within the confines of}} their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was actually designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems, operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. [...] Web notes can be identified by the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> number next to [...] and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a {{study was}} {{published}} on the soft parts visible with the [...] "Victoria" [...] specimen. It preserves both true impressions of the skin into the surrounding sediment, and natural casts, where the spaces {{left behind by the}} rotting of the soft body parts have been filled in with sediment. Additionally on some areas a black layer is present, possibly consisting of organic remains or bacterial mats. A part of the lower trunk flank shows rows of small hexagonal, non-overlapping, convex scales, two to seven millimetres in diameter. Higher on the flank two rosette structures are visible with larger central scales, one being twenty by ten millimetres in size, the other ten by eight millimetres. Apart from the scales, an impression of the lower side of a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> has been found, covering about two hundred square centimetres. This shows no scales but a smooth surface with low parallel vertical ridges. As it is a true impression, with the life animal grooves would have been present. These grooves would have been about half a millimetre deep and stood about two millimetres apart. The impression probably represented the horn sheath of the plate, as would be confirmed by vertical traces of veins. It is the first direct proof of such sheaths with any stegosaurian. The study considered the presence of a sheath to be a strong indication that the plate had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate as a whole and provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly coloured. Thermoregulation, on the other hand — another often assumed rôle of the plates — would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the horn covering.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the same}} wall, {{immediately}} to the west, is a [...] tall by [...] wide monument completely of figured black or white marble, erected by Edmund Turnor (1619–1707) during his lifetime. Sitting on a white stepped base, and attached to a white <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> which runs to the entablature, is a pedestal. The pedestal’s central panel contains inscriptions within a white bolection mould. Set back on either side are inset white oblong raised panels—the top has a projected moulding following the plinth’s horizontal facets. Above is an aedicule of inscriptions on a black field with wide white bolection mould surround, contained between a column each side of black shaft, and white base, stylobate and ionic capital, beneath the entablature. The entablature contains a white architrave with a plain black frieze above. From the front face of the cornice hangs two heraldic shields. The curved pediment is segmented, with the central open part containing a decorative urn. The inscriptions on the monument appear white, but were reported in 1806 as gilded. The upper panel inscription is to Sir Edmund Turnor—brother of Sir Christopher Turnor [...] (1607–1675), Baron of the Exchequer in 1660—and his wife, Dame Margaret (1627–1679). Turnor, knighted in 1663, was the youngest son of Christopher Turnor (died 1619) of Milton Erneyst, {{and was the first}} Turnor to take possession of the Stoke Rochford estates through marriage settlement for Margaret, the daughter of Sir John Harrison of Balls Park, Hertfordshire and his wife, Margaret, of Fanshawe Gate Hall, Derbyshire. The pedestal inscription is to John Turnor, son to Sir Edmund and Dame Margaret. John Turnor was buried at Bath Abbey in 1719. He married Diana (buried 1736), the only child of Algernon Cecil, son to the Earl of Salisbury. John and Diana's only surviving son, Edmund, was buried at Grantham in 1763. Edmund had married Elizabeth, co-heir of Henry Ferne of Snitterton Hall, Derbyshire. Elizabeth was buried at Hammersmith in 1763. Also recorded is John (died 1752), the younger son of Edmund and Elizabeth, who was captain in the King’s Regiment of Dragoon Guards in the battles of Detingen and Fonteny, and died at Kirmond, near where he was buried.|$|E
