5000|$|The quick-connector {{fittings}} {{which allow}} hoses {{to be easily}} attached and removed from the ports come in two mechanical varieties, namely <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> and <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> which are not interchangeable. Historically, <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> kegs were used primarily by the Coca-Cola company, while <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs were used primarily by Pepsi. On a <b>pin</b> <b>lock</b> keg, there are metal posts (pins) extending horizontally from around the port. When the connector is attached, these pins hold it in place. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has two pins, while the [...] "liquid out" [...] has three, {{making it impossible to}} accidentally switch the gas-versus-liquid hoses (which would harmlessly result in carbon dioxide bubbling up through the drink, while gas but no drink would be dispensed). <b>Ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs have ridges in the ports, which are gripped by small metal balls in the connectors. Both types of kegs are fairly easy to find, though ball-lock seem to be more common.As a result of demand from home brewers, second hand kegs are becoming progressively more scarce and in recent years brand new kegs have come onto the market, manufactured in China to the same specifications.|$|R

The color of the plastic signifies whether the line contains gas (grey) versus liquid (black); these specimens are both for liquid lines.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> <b>pin.</b> The <b>lock</b> block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is installed, an apertured-end portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R

40|$|A {{multifunction}} <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> is fabricated from a semi-flexible or elastic material. The <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> is {{also designed}} {{to function as}} a seal. The pin section serves especially to temporarily close up a threaded recess such as a drill hole. The deformable plastics pin effects a seal against the thread in the drill hole as the pin is screwed into the hole. USE - Multifunction blocking pin for use especially to temporarily close up and protect holes otherwise exposed to galvanic process. ADVANTAGE - Single-use pin is automatically inserted and provides low-cost system for protecting especially threaded components...|$|R

5000|$|This game {{featured}} new {{speech by}} Penelope Ann Miller (Margo Lane), John Lone (Shiwan Khan), and Tim Curry (Farley Claymore) (reprising their respective roles), {{as well as}} speech from the movie. The Shadow's speech for this game was provided by Williams/Midway voice actor, Tim Kitzrow. The game's noted features include player-controlled ball diverters {{on the left and}} right ramps, a magnetic <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> (which freezes the ball and pulls the ball inside the <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> for Shadow Multiball), and a Breakout-style upper playfield, called [...] "The Battlefield".|$|R
5000|$|Multiball: To start multiball, {{light the}} <b>lock</b> <b>ball</b> shot by hitting the [...] "Lite" [...] and [...] "Lock" [...] targets and then {{successfully}} shooting {{the ball in}} the <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> also called the [...] "No Way Out" [...] Hazard; doing this 3 times will start multiball.|$|R

40|$|Two damaged I stage {{compressor}} rotor blades {{along with two}} <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> belonging to an aeroengine were forwarded to the laboratory for investigation. Fractographic examination showed that the blade number 24 had fractured by sudden overload such as impact. The fracturing of this blade was secondary in nature and subsequent to the primary failure. Evidences suggest that the dislodgement of blade number 5 {{was responsible for the}} engine failure. The dislodgement of the whole blade without any breakage is not possible unless the locking mechanism fails. It appears most probable that in this particular case, this was possible due to an assembly error wherein a <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> of length 27. 0 mm was used against the specification of 32. 0 mm...|$|R
50|$|The Cam Profile Switching (CPS) {{system uses}} a tri-lobe {{camshaft}} to switch between two different cam profiles. One cam profile provides low valve lift, {{while the other}} cam profile has a high valve lift. The low valve lift cam profile is used at low to mid engine speeds to maintain idling quality and reduce emissions, while the high lift cam profile is used when the engine is spinning at mid to high engine speeds improve peak horsepower and torque. Unlike the other similar variable valve timing systems such as the Honda VTEC, the Toyota VVT-i and the Mitsubishi MIVEC which use rocker arm <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing, the CPS system uses direct-acting tappets with <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing and lift profile.|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} 3-ball multiball where each ball is {{launched}} through three separate 'Lift-Off' stages. This is {{placed at the}} upper left of the playfield inside a maze-like <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism.|$|R

50|$|Additionally three lights labeled U, S and A are lit when a ball {{rolls over}} them. They are worth 2,000 points each. Spelling USA {{increases}} {{the end of}} ball bonus multiplier (a multiplication factor for points earned and awarded when {{the ball in play}} drains). There are three pop bumpers that are worth 100 points when unlit and 1,000 points when lit. Two or three ball multiball is started by hitting one ball up a <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> or two <b>balls</b> up two different <b>ball</b> <b>locks</b> and then shooting a ball up the center ramp when the drop target is down.|$|R
50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old <b>lock</b> <b>pins</b> with new <b>lock</b> <b>pins.</b> <b>Locks</b> are usually re keyed to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin sits flush with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the <b>lock</b> has 5 <b>pins.</b> Different brand <b>locks</b> each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them. Many manufacturers offer product specific manuals. Information disclosed in manufacturer manuals is often otherwise difficult to find, as is locksmith material in general.|$|R
50|$|On 16 October 1961, Fokker F27-100 Friendship ZK-BXB Kotuku, {{moments from}} {{boarding}} passerngers and crew at Invercargill airport suffered an undercarriage failure when the portside main leg retracted. Ground crew had just removed the safety <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> when the leg retracted. It {{was discovered that}} an undercarriage selector valve had failed.|$|R
40|$|Ninged {{structure}} prevents inadvertent use. Forward {{motion of}} foot on yoke plate necessary to operate brake pedal. Downward force on yoke plate turns locking/releasing laver, which then pushes <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> into indexing hole.

5000|$|Monolock Hinge: The {{purpose of}} this design {{is to create a}} lower profile receiver. The system {{integrates}} the hinge and locking system. The MonoLock Hinge pivots on significantly more surface area than guns with conventional low profile receivers. Rectangular <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> provide additional strength while a wear-in relief feature allows for wear without hindering lock-up.|$|R
25|$|Ball lock: Each time a ball {{goes into}} a {{specific}} hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. When the player has locked the required number of balls (often three), the multiball feature starts. On some games, the <b>balls</b> are physically <b>locked</b> in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual <b>ball</b> <b>locks</b> instead, in which the game merely keeps count {{of the number of}} <b>locked</b> <b>balls</b> and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough when it is time for them to be released.|$|R

The attached USB cable has a clear transparent cover incorporating eight toroidal ceramic surge suppressing magnets close to the adapter.|$|R
5000|$|Safe {{cracking}} {{is opening}} a safe without a combination or key. There are many methods to safe cracking ranging from brute force methods to guessing the combination. The easiest method {{that can be}} used on many safes is [...] "safe bouncing", which involves hitting the safe on top; this may cause the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> to budge, opening the safe.|$|R
40|$|The design, development, {{and testing}} of a release {{mechanism}} for use in two life science experiments on the Spacelab 1, 4, and D 1 missions is described. The mechanism is a self latching <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> device actuated by a linear solenoid. An unusual feature is the tapering of the <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> plunger {{to give it a}} near constant breakout force for release under a wide range of loads. The selection of the design, based on the design requirements, is discussed. A number of problems occurred during development and test, including problems caused by human factors that became apparent after initial delivery for crewtraining sessions. These problems and their solutions are described to assist in the design {{and testing of}} similar mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{lock screw}} of {{propeller}} spinner of an aircraft {{was found to}} have fractured by fatigue. Evidences suggest that excessive pre-tension due to over tightening of the lock screw is the most probable reason for the fatigue crack initiation.

50|$|It is not {{recommended}} that kegs be sanitized with bleach. To avoid unpleasant residuals, sanitize kegs with an iodine or oxygen based sanitizer. Sanitizers like Star-San and B-Brite are commonly used. The <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> valves may be unscrewed using wrenches to allow further cleaning or replacement of O-rings or poppet valves.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has {{experienced}} numerous {{problems in the}} past, due partly to its age, but mainly due to the increasing numbers of heavy goods vehicles and heavily laden farm vehicles which ignore the weight limit on the bridge. Issues have included the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> falling out of place, cracks forming in the supporting structure, and jamming of the swing mechanism, which has caused heavy traffic delays and tailbacks.|$|R
50|$|The {{legs are}} then locked {{in place with}} <b>locking</b> <b>pins.</b> The {{carriage}} is lowered via the hydraulic jack so that the legs touch the ground; integral stakes are then hammered into the ground.
