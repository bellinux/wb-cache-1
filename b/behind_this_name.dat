It was rebuilt during the year 2001 and 2002. After the renovation in March, 2002 Horse show ground was renamed as Zahoor Elahi sadium in honour of the late politician Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi.|$|E
2500|$|The Cincinnati Times-Star {{editorial}} board {{proposed that the}} new highway be named [...] "Fort Washington Freeway". The fort's gunpowder magazine had been rediscovered {{a few years earlier}} on land near the highway's path. Supporters of the Fort Washington name included the Cincinnati Enquirer {{editorial board}} and Mrs. William T. Buckner, a representative of the Daughters of the American Revolution and Daughters of 1812 whose great-grandfather William Henry Harrison once served at the fort. On February 20, 1958, the state's Anthony Wayne Parkway Board threw its support <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> and also proposed naming the Mill Creek and Northeast expressways after General Anthony Wayne and George Rogers Clark, respectively. Other suggestions for the distributor included [...] "Queen City Freeway" [...] (after the city's nickname, [...] "Queen City of the West"), [...] "Cincinnati Gateway", [...] "Queen's Freeway", and [...] "Cincinnatus Parkway" [...] (after Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, the city's namesake). The city chose [...] "Fort Washington Way" [...] that March.|$|E

50|$|Carddass (Kādodasu) {{is a name}} {{given to}} Bandai's card vending {{machines}} and, thus, a generic term given to the cards sold by these machines. The name comes from AMeDAS (Automated Meterological Data Acquisition System), a system in Japan used for gathering weather data. The aim <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>naming</b> is to make Carddass an information source for kids. Carddass is a registered trademark of Bandai.|$|R

50|$|A {{group of}} over 100 authors {{write for the}} magazines, sold in many kiosks and over newsagents. Rolf Kalmuczak, who is the major author <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name,</b> made the TKKG series famous as Stefan Wolf.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} this road {{received}} its name in 1959, the vicinity was already acknowledged as Kampung Ma'arof. Information extracted from street naming documents presents the person <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> to be Ma'arof bin Malim (died 1944), who was an employee at the Bungsar Electric Power Station and presumably the headman of the village.|$|E
5000|$|During the Vietnam War, conscripted Australian {{soldiers}} were derisively called [...] "Koala soldiers" [...] by regular army personnel. The rationale <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> {{was that they}} were 'not to be exported or shot at.' It is now commonplace within the civilian population to use this nickname to refer to any deployment of troops with restricted rules of engagement.|$|E
50|$|The Latin {{specific}} epithet relicta {{refers to}} a remnant, primitive, left <b>behind</b> and relict. <b>This</b> <b>name</b> was chosen due to the diminishing size {{of the population of}} irises found on the mountains in Italy.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{commonly}} known <b>name</b> <b>this</b> colourful hill carries, the locals {{of the town}} of Purmamarca also refer to it as the Hill of the Seven Skirts. This is an unofficial name, and not many people other than those who live here refer to it this way. The reasoning <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> second <b>name</b> is because of the resemblance between the colours on the hill and that of the traditional, long skirts worn by Andean women.|$|R
50|$|Sandymount Green is a {{triangular}} park located {{next to the}} village. The houses along {{the south side of}} the green are part of what once was Sandymount Castle and the roads <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> bear the <b>name.</b> There are some shops, restaurants and cafés around the green.|$|R

5000|$|Eghlid's name {{might come}} from [...] "kelid," [...] which means key in Persian. Up {{to the recent}} years, older people {{used to call it}} [...] "kelil." [...] The main reason <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> is that it was the main gateway to Fars, and {{specially}} Persepolis in the old ages and the road called [...] "royal road" [...] used to pass through it. other routes to Persepolis were mountainous and difficult to pass.|$|E
5000|$|Josephus {{explains}} in The Jewish War that John was {{also known as}} [...] "Hyrcanus", but does not explain the reason <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name.</b> The only other primary source, the Books of the Maccabees, never used this name with respect to John, with the single reference to Hyrcanus in 2 Maccabees 3:11 referring to a man to whom {{some of the money}} in the Temple belonged during the c. 178 BCE visit of Heliodorus.|$|E

5000|$|Oatway's {{full name}} is Anthony Philip David Terry Frank Donald Stanley Gerry Gordon Stephen James Oatway. The reason <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> rather unusual <b>name</b> {{is the fact}} that both his parents were Queens Park Rangers fans, and decided to give their son the names of QPR's entire 1973 first team squad. When his parents told his aunt the {{proposed}} name, she said [...] "he'd look a right Charlie", and the name stuck. His son, also called Charlie, spent several years working through football developmental squads, including 2009/10 with Bognor Regis Town FC and 2012/13 with Brighton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} named after the Bendera Merah Putih, the flag of Indonesia. But there is another meaning <b>behind</b> the <b>naming</b> <b>this</b> bridge. During the {{occurrence}} of sectarian conflict in Maluku in the period between 1999 and 2002, the Christian group was called the [...] "red group", while Muslim group called the [...] "white group". Thus the bridge was meant to {{become a symbol of}} peace, unity and solidarity among the people of Maluku.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{very unusual}} story <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name.</b> Colin was born as 'Colin Edwin Thompson'. When he became an actor he had to change his name because no actor can have the same name. He took his middle name and changed the spelling. His idol was an actor called Ed Wynn and changed his name so it had the same spelling. The name Edwynn is not Welsh, Scottish or Irish or any other name. It was made up.|$|E
5000|$|Abihu {{was one of}} {{the priests}} whose name means [...] "son of Judah." [...] According to Gundry the author of Matthew liked the meaning <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> and it was slight {{modified}} to become Abiud. Eliezer succeeded Abihu and his name is changed to Eliakim by the author of Matthew, linking him to the Eliakim mentioned in Isaiah 22 and to Jehoiakim, a king that was left out of the earlier narrative. Azariah, another priest, had his name shortened to create the name Azor.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 19th century sergeant-major Popov founded on the Grushevka River a Cossack stanitsa of Alexandro-Grushevskaya (...) [...] While the exact reasoning <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> is unclear, {{it is possible that the}} name was given in honor of Emperor Alexander I. Twelve Cossacks and fourteen peasant serfs lived in the stanitsa at that time. By the mid-19th century, fifty-seven coal mines operated in this area. In 1867, it was granted town status and renamed Gornoye Grushevskoye Poseleniye (...) [...] The name was changed to Alexandrovsk-Grushevsky (...) in 1881.|$|E
40|$|Ayurvedic {{medicines}} {{are based}} on plants, animals extract and minerals both in single ingredient drugs and compound formulations. Ayurvedic compound formulations are mainly {{divided into two groups}} viz. (1) Kasthausadhi (predominantly plant drugs) and (2). Rasausadhi (predominantly metals and minerals). There are several categories of Kasthausadhi formulations such as Asavaristra, Avleha, Ghrita Churna, Taila etc. and of Rasausadhis such as Bhasma, Pisti, Lauha, Kupipakva, Rasayana etc. The Ayurvedic drugs are derived from vegetable sources from the various parts of the plant like root, leaf, flower, fruit extrude or plant as a whole. The five well known Panchmula are also the root of various drugs. The Kantaka panchmula is described broadly by Acharya Sushurta first time. The Karmarda, Gokshura, Sareyaka, Satavari and Himsra are taken as Kantaka panchmula. The main reason <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> Kantaka <b>name</b> is the presence of kantaka ~ thorn in these 5 plants and the mula ~ root of these plant is taken...|$|R

They also announced that they would start writing a new album tentatively in January 2013. In an interview with Alternative Press on September 25, 2012, Raneri stated the intention of making more volumes of cover EPs as the reasoning <b>behind</b> <b>naming</b> <b>this</b> first one Covers Volume #1. Previously they had announced {{that they would be}} going on tour with Taking Back Sunday for their [...] "Tell All Your Friends" [...] 10 Year Anniversary Tour, which for Bayside started on October 4, 2012, and ended on November 23, 2012 in their hometown of New York City.

5000|$|The name [...] "Thiruvankulam" [...] {{is derived}} from the word Thiru-vayaram-kulam. The legend <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> is related to Lord Shiva and Parasurama Muni. The Siva temple at Thiruvankulam is one out of four other Siva temples, Parasurama Muni had built consecutively. Other 3 temples are Kureekkad, Perunninakulam and Trikkathara. It is {{believed}} that Muni saw Siva lying spread across all these places. So he built temples at places where he saw Siva’s head, nabhi, stomach and leg. The [...] "Prathishta" [...] in Thrivankulam Temple is considered as [...] "Swayambhoo" [...] - self-born.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reasoning}} <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> {{has been}} subject to some speculation and debate. One theory, put forth by Edmund Johansen, a veteran player of the game, to the French researcher Alan Borvo, is that [...] "fine" [...] {{in this case is}} a euphemism for [...] "offering", used to avoid the wrath of Christian priests and evangelists. Sáhkku was considered a sinful game by such people, who saw traces of Sámi pre-Christian worship in it, and called it [...] "The Devils Game". According to Johansens theory, it was in fact correct that the [...] "King" [...] piece had earlier been seen by players as representing a non-Christian deity in the game, and that the mens and womens [...] "recruiting" [...] of it implicitly happens through offerings.|$|E

5000|$|Founded by the Phoenicians, Anemurium {{was then}} {{occupied}} by the Assyrians and Hittites. During the Hittite period in the twelfth century BC, the ruler Tuthalia IV, granted Anemurium to Mattuvata who had taken refuge in his kingdom. Mattuvata {{took advantage of the}} Hittites’ weakness, establishing his own kingdom with Anemurium as its capital. His rule extended as far as Afyon, in central Anatolia. At the end of the twelfth century the area was occupied by a nomadic tribe that had come from across the Caucasus mountains. The tribe was called by the ancient Greeks the [...] "Wind people" [...] (Ἀνέμου γένος) after whom the city was named. The exact reasons <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> are lost in time. The most probable explanation however, is that they worshiped a god of wind, perhaps similar to the Greek Aeolus, as their main deity. Then the city came {{under the control of the}} Phoenicians again, and later Persians. In 333 BC Alexander the Great brought this coast within his Macedonian Empire, and he was succeeded by Seleucids and then Ancient Romans. The coast was given by Mark Anthony to Cleopatra as a wedding present and Roman coins have been discovered in the course of excavation, dating to the years between Emperors Titus (AD 79-81) and Valevianus (AD 253-259).The Romans were succeeded by the Byzantines.|$|E
40|$|Construction {{consulting}} {{companies of}} today {{are a part}} of what has been called the knowledge society. The reason <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> <b>name</b> is the increasing importance of intangible assets as the major source of wealth creation in construction industry. As such, Knowledge Management (KM) has become a critical concern for construction consulting companies to improve project performance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse Malaysian practitioner’s perception on KM in the construction consulting companies. The finding of this study was based on an analysis of transcribed data from semi-structured interviews conducted on Malaysian practitioners in the construction consulting companies to identify pattern and themes accordingly. The findings of the study indicate that all participants have expressed the significant contributions of KM to their success as a professional construction consultant in Malaysia.   These participants shared a common characteristic of being professional in construction industry such as they agreed that manage database (data record) and filing system is perceived as important and also the professionals must build extensive social and business networks both locally and overseas that were relevant and have impact on their business success. The professionals have a personal desire to learn and they preferred to learn informally from a variety of people that they can access usually through discussion, seminar/conference and media. Learning from personal experience and experiences from others through learn on job and mentoring were a common characteristics among all the professionals and all of them strongly prescribed that such transfer of learning’s will enable one to shortcut learning and improve their knowledge. However, both internal and external environmental factors have equal impact on the transfer of knowledge in construction consulting companies. Internally, personal interest has the biggest impact followed by culture, commitment from management, incentive or reward for the staff and openness or willingness (more on trust) to share and listen. Externally, business factor/competition has the biggest impact on transfer of knowledge in construction consulting companies.   </span...|$|E
