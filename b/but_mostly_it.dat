5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|Mafiosi {{generally}} do not involve themselves {{in the management of}} the businesses they protect or arbitrate. Lack of competence is a common reason, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> is to divest themselves of any interests that may conflict with their roles as protectors and arbitrators. This makes them more trusted by their clients, who need not fear their businesses being taken over.|$|E

In addition to the ashstone the Canberra Formation has layers of green-grey to reddish dacite, also tuff, quartz andesite, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> is calcareous shale, limestone or sandstone.

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave a {{negative}} review. He disliked {{the characterization of}} Chuck Barris and commented that [...] "with its multiplicity of over-stylized looks and slick gimmicks, Dangerous Mind was doubtless more stimulating to direct than {{it will be for}} audiences to experience." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote a mixed critique. [...] "George Clooney is eager to show how much he has learned {{at the hands of the}} A-list filmmakers he has toiled under. So we get a style that is about 50% Steven Soderbergh and 50% Coen brothers. Sometimes it works, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> comes across as too artsy, with all sorts of bizarre angles and unusual shots." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "psychedelic" [...] and as an anthem to Marijuana, rather than one about drunkenness. Brad Wete for Entertainment Weekly explained that Mars was [...] "ready to drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol" [...] and tipped [...] "find out what concoction Mars and Marley are whipping up" [...] by watching the clip. Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time". He furthered that Damian, [...] "might as well be in McDonald's commercials. I guess this song is supposed to make you THINK about stuff [...] <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> makes me try to find someone to blame for this".|$|E
2500|$|According to Kirshbaum, {{over the}} years the Israeli Government has {{continued}} to cancel and modify some of the Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> has added more as it has continued to extend its declared state of emergency. For example, even though the Prevention of Infiltration Law of 1954 is not labelled as an official [...] "Emergency Regulation," [...] it extends the applicability of the [...] "Defence (Emergency) Regulation 112" [...] of 1945 giving the Minister of Defence extraordinary powers of deportation for accused infiltrators even before they are convicted (Articles 30 & 32), and makes itself subject to cancellation when the Knesset ends the State of Emergency upon which all of the Emergency Regulations are dependent.|$|E

5000|$|Leaving My Empire {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} several Irish music blogs and websites. State.ie called it [...] "a record that will appeal {{as much to}} your whistling dairy deliverer as your cooler than cool younger brother.", while Swearimnotpaul.com said [...] "This album {{is a lot of}} things, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it’s</b> fun." ...|$|R

2500|$|Co-written by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall, Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera was a three-hour-long {{musical comedy}} (Vivian {{called it a}} [...] "comic opera"), {{produced}} by Ki, directed by Vivian (working with both actors and orchestra at the same time), and performed on the Old Pro over a two-week run up to Christmas in December 1985. Stinkfoot's cast and orchestra consisted of the employees, as well as regulars who'd graced Theklas stage. Its set made use of Theklas curious layout. Its conception {{was based on a}} series of tales Ki wrote about a New York City alley cat and on Vivian's life as a Bonzo frontman. In its final form, it was a surreal and dazzling cross-cultural mix of music hall, Broadway, and Thirties screwball comedies. <b>But</b> <b>mostly,</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "just being itself," [...] as Vivian would say. It played to sell-out audiences every single night of its run, attracted people from Scotland to the USA, and it garnered wonderful, if slightly puzzled, reviews from not only the Bristol press, but The Guardian and The Times.|$|E

5000|$|ContractMusic {{said that}} [...] "Live With Me" [...] "has a certain dark and sexy groove going on. Partly it's the trade-mark lush, sensual {{synthetic}} bass sounds that do <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it's</b> the authentic soul vocals of Terry Callier that lift this single out of ordinariness {{and up into}} the realms of unforgettable musical moments."http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/massiveattackx21x02x06 ...|$|R

60|$|Far down in {{the valley}} from out of a black shed--the only sign of man's handiwork for many miles--it came--something grey at first, moving slowly as though being pushed down a slight incline, then afloat in the air, {{gathering}} speed--something between a torpedo with wings and a great prehistoric insect. Now and then it described strange circles, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> came towards them as swift and as true as an arrow shot from a bow. The two men looked at one another--the shorter, to whose cheeks the Cumberland winds had brought no trace of colour, gave vent to a hoarse exclamation.|$|E
60|$|THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it {{was after}} eight o'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade {{thinking}} about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing {{there was a little}} breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly.|$|E
60|$|He {{came to the}} large, brilliantly-lighted cafe. It was Sunday evening, and {{the place}} was full. Men, Florentines, many, many men sat in groups and in twos and threes at the little marble tables. They were mostly in dark clothes or black overcoats. They had mostly been {{drinking}} just a cup of coffee--others however had glasses of wine or liquor. <b>But</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> {{was just a little}} coffee-tray with a tiny coffee pot and a cup and saucer. There was a faint film of tobacco smoke. And the men were all talking: talking, talking with that peculiar intensity of the Florentines. Aaron felt the intense, compressed sound of many half-secret voices. For the little groups and couples abated their voices, none wished that others should hear what they said.|$|E

Paquita is bullied by Rina Marcela because she's poor, fatherless, and has skin rash all over her face and body. <b>But</b> <b>mostly,</b> <b>it's</b> because Rina Marcela has feeling for Andres. After realizing the situation, Chavela Vargas, Soledad's aunt and a tarot reader, home-schools her.|$|R

60|$|The {{spirit of}} self-forgetfulness, the simple devotion to a vast {{humanitarian}} idea which inspired the thought and stress of that revolutionary time, had left its mark upon Giorgio {{in a sort}} of austere contempt for all personal advantage. This man, whom the lowest class in Sulaco suspected of having a buried hoard in his kitchen, had all his life despised money. The leaders of his youth had lived poor, had died poor. It had been a habit of his mind to disregard to-morrow. It was engendered partly by an existence of excitement, adventure, and wild warfare. <b>But</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> was a matter of principle. It did not resemble the carelessness of a condottiere, it was a puritanism of conduct, born of stern enthusiasm like the puritanism of religion.|$|E
6000|$|No one can {{forecast}} the moment when, or the place where, a block may happen; <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> occurs in mid-afternoon, {{at the intersection}} of some street where a line of vehicles is crossing the channel of the torrent. Suddenly all is at a stand-still, and one of those wonderful English policemen, who look so slight and young after the vast blue bulks of our Irish force, shows himself {{in the middle of the}} channel, and holds back its rapids with the quiet gesture of extended hands. The currents and counter-currents gather and press from the rear and solidify, but in the narrow fissure the policeman stands motionless, with only some such slight stir of his extended hands as a cat imparts to her [...] "conscious tail" [...] when she waits to spring upon her prey.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{church of}} which I am a bishop {{is just a}} part of our poor human struggle, small and pitiful as one thinks of it here {{in the light of the}} advent of God's Kingdom, but very great, very great indeed, ancient and high and venerable, in {{comparison}} with me. <b>But</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> is human. It is most human. For my story is the church's story, and the church's story is mine. Here I could almost believe myself the church itself. The world saw a light, the nations that were sitting in darkness saw a great light. Even as I saw God. And then the church began to forget and lose itself among secondary things. As I have done.... It tried to express the truth and lost itself in a maze of theology. It tried to bring order into the world and sold its faith to Constantine. These men who had professed the Invisible King of the World, shirked his service. It is a most terrible disaster that Christianity has sold itself to emperors and kings. They forged a saying of the Master's that we should render unto Ceasar the things that are Ceasar's and unto God the things that are God's....|$|E
5000|$|An AfterEllen review {{discussed}} Jess {{and said}} [...] "I think it’s partly because she’s such an effective wolf in sheep’s clothing, whereas every other villain proudly owns their evil. <b>But</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it’s</b> Georgia Chara’s performance, which combines tenderness and ruthlessness {{in a way}} I’ve never seen before. WAIT. Yes I have. Jess is like that bunny rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, {{that no one has}} the good sense to be afraid of because it looks so cute and sweet and innocent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{original}} broadcasting, Lawrence Journal-World gave an unfavorable review, stating [...] "Take two first-rate character actors, the prodigiously talented John Lithgow and James Woods. Give them a script unworthy of their powers. Watch their light blast through the holes in it like laser beams. The film has its moments, to be sure, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it's</b> the pleasure of watching these two pros at work. [...] "The Boys" [...] is somewhere between drama and black comedy, a modified Felix-and-Oscar story hinged on passive smoking, cancer and male bonding." ...|$|R
5000|$|I’ll Give You the Sun {{received}} an overwhelming amount of positive reviews. The New York Times praised {{the novel by}} calling it, “Breathtaking. You get the sense the characters are bursting through the words, breaking free of normal metaphors and constructions, jubilantly trying to rise up from the prison of language…” Likewise, The Guardian said that I’ll Give You the Sun is “… About many things: grief, sexuality, creativity, bravery, identity, guilt. <b>But</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it’s</b> about love… This book will make you realize how beautiful words can be.” ...|$|R
60|$|Phelps' was one {{of these}} little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a {{different}} length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.|$|E
60|$|Generically, the Thanksgiving {{story is}} cheerfuller in its drama and simpler in its persons than the Christmas story. Rarely has it {{dealt with the}} supernatural, either the {{apparition}} of ghosts or the intervention of angels. The weather being so much milder {{at the close of}} November than it is a month later, very little can be done with the elements; though on the coast a northeasterly storm has been, and can be, very usefully employed. The Thanksgiving story is more restricted in its range; the scene is still mostly in New England, and the characters are of New England extraction, who come home from the West usually, or New York, for the event of the little drama, whatever it may be. It may be the reconciliation of kinsfolk who have quarrelled; or the union of lovers long estranged; or husbands and wives who have had hard words and parted; or mothers who had thought their sons dead in California and find themselves agreeably disappointed in their return; or fathers who for old time's sake receive back their erring and conveniently dying daughters. The notes are not many which this simple music sounds, but they have a Sabbath tone, mostly, and win the listener to kindlier thoughts and better moods. The art is at its highest in some strong sketch of Rose Terry Cooke's, or some perfectly satisfying study of Miss Jewett's, or some graphic situation of Miss Wilkins's; and then it is a very fine art. <b>But</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> is poor and rude enough, and makes openly, shamelessly, for the reader's emotions, as well as his morals. It is inclined to be rather descriptive. The turkey, the pumpkin, the corn-field, figure throughout; and the leafless woods are blue and cold against the evening sky behind the low hip-roofed, old-fashioned homestead. The parlance is usually the Yankee dialect and its Western modifications.|$|E
60|$|Something, a faint, faint {{consciousness}} of this, visits even the sad heart of age on any New York night {{when it is}} not raining too hard, and one thinks only of getting indoors, where all nights are alike. <b>But</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>it</b> comes when the autumn is dreaming toward winter in that interlude of the seasons which we call Indian Summer. It is a stretch of time which we have handsomely bestowed upon our aborigines, in compensation for the four seasons we have taken from them, like some of those Reservations which we have left them in lieu of the immeasurable lands we have alienated. It used to be longer than it is now; it used to be several weeks long; in the sense of childhood, it was almost months. It is still qualitatively the same, and it is more than any other time expressive of the New York temperament, perhaps because we have honored in the civic ideal the polity of our Indian predecessors, and in Tammany and its recurrently triumphant braves, have kept their memory green. But if this is not so, the spiritual fact remains, and under the sky of the Election Night you feel New York as you do in no other hour. The sense extends through the other autumn nights till that night, sure to come, when the pensive weather breaks in tears, and the next day it rains and rains, and the streets stream with the flood, and the dull air reeks with a sort of inner steam, hot, close, and sticky as a brother: a brother whose wants are many and whose resources are few. The morning after the storm, there will be a keen thrill in the air, keen but wholesome and bracing as a good resolution and not necessarily more lasting. The asphalt has been washed as clean as a renovated conscience, and the city presses forward again to the future in which alone it has its being, with the gay confidence of a sinner who has forgiven himself his sins and is no longer sorry for them.|$|E
