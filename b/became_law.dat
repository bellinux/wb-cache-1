In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the Reform Bill to widen the franchise to include women. The petition, which was supported by the MP and philosopher John Stuart Mill, was ignored and the bill <b>became</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

25|$|Governor's action. All passed bills, {{except the}} budget bill and {{constitutional}} amendments, must {{be presented to}} the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may veto bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it <b>becomes</b> <b>law.</b> The budget bill, however, <b>becomes</b> <b>law</b> upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they <b>become</b> <b>law</b> only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.|$|R
25|$|Take {{no action}} on the {{legislation}} within the above timeframethe bill <b>becomes</b> <b>law,</b> as if the president had signed it, unless Congress by their adjournment prevents its return, in which case a it does not <b>become</b> <b>law</b> (a legislative maneuver known as a pocket veto).|$|R
5|$|Solis {{supported}} legislation {{aimed at}} {{reducing the number of}} teen pregnancies within Latina and African American communities and sponsored a bill, that <b>became</b> <b>law</b> in 2003, that granted U.S.citizenship to immigrants after one year of military service instead of the previous three years.|$|E
5|$|The first {{same-sex}} wedding {{took place}} eight {{days after the}} bill <b>became</b> <b>law,</b> and was celebrated in the council chamber in the Madrid suburb of Tres Cantos by Carlos Baturín and Emilio Menéndez.

5|$|Though the act won easy {{passage through}} the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen {{reserved}} royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, {{the court found that}} it was unconstitutional, and it never <b>became</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under the Constitution, every {{bill passed}} by the House of Assembly must be {{presented}} to the governor for approval before it <b>becomes</b> <b>law.</b> The governor may choose to sign it and make it law, veto it and return it to the House, or take no action, however. If he or she vetoes the bill, a two-thirds majority of the House may override it, and the bill will <b>become</b> <b>law</b> without the governor's signature. If the governor does not act, the bill will automatically <b>become</b> <b>law</b> after a 30-day period.|$|R

5|$|In January 2006, Reed {{introduced}} a bill to authorize scholastic teaching of the textbook The Bible and Its Influence by the non-partisan, ecumenical Bible Literacy Project. The bible curriculum bill, which came {{a few years after}} Democrats opposed Republican attempts to promote teaching a translation of the scriptures, was an attempt to preempt a Republican attempt to display the Ten Commandments in schools. Faith is an area where Georgia Democrats differ from the national party. The bill passed in the State Senate by a 50–1 margin on February 3, and it eventually <b>became</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|On November 13, 1818, Hawes married Hetty Morrison Nicholas of Lexington. He pursued {{classical}} studies at Transylvania University, then studied law under Robert C. Wickliffe. Hawes and Wickliffe <b>became</b> <b>law</b> partners upon the former's {{admission to the}} bar in 1818. Due to overcrowding of the bar in Lexington, Hawes moved to Winchester in 1824. While there, he became part owner of a rope and bagging factory with Benjamin H. Buckner.|$|E
50|$|If the Congress {{overrides}} {{the veto}} by {{a two-thirds vote}} in each house, it <b>becomes</b> <b>law</b> without the President's signature. Otherwise, the bill fails to <b>become</b> <b>law</b> unless it is presented to the President again and the President chooses to sign it. Historically, the Congress overrides the Presidential veto 7% of the time.|$|R
5000|$|Others {{have argued}} that the issue is due to a {{drafting}} error during the legislative process. [...] Yale Law School Professor Abbe Gluck said that the unusual maneuver of having the ACA <b>become</b> <b>law</b> through reconciliation required a preliminary version of the bill to <b>become</b> <b>law</b> without the [...] "usual legislative clean-up process".|$|R

The American Bases Act <b>became</b> <b>law</b> in Newfoundland on June 11, 1941. As Earle (1998) finds, Newfoundland girls married American personnel by the thousands. In 1948 there was a short-lived but growing movement {{for some sort of}} economic union with the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970. This time the measure made it through both houses of Congress and <b>became</b> <b>law</b> on 22 December. As a result, all U.S. ground troops and advisors were barred from participating in military actions in Laos or Cambodia, while the air war being conducted in both countries by the U.S. Air Force was ignored.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} reelected Sherman {{to another}} six-year term that year, and when (after a three-month vacation in Europe) he resumed his seat he again {{turned to the}} greenback question. Public support for greenbacks had grown, especially among businesspeople who thought withdrawal would lead to lower prices. When a bill passed the House suspending the authority to retire greenbacks under the Contraction Act, Sherman supported it in the Senate. It passed the Senate 33–4, and <b>became</b> <b>law</b> in 1868.|$|E

2500|$|This clause {{is known}} as the Presentment Clause. Before a bill <b>becomes</b> <b>law,</b> it must be {{presented}} to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it <b>becomes</b> <b>law.</b> If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the veto, although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then <b>become</b> <b>law</b> unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill <b>becomes</b> <b>law,</b> unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a [...] "pocket veto", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to <b>become</b> <b>law</b> unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a [...] "default enactment." ...|$|R
50|$|Example 4: If the U.S. Congress {{passes a}} bill, the president's {{signature}} of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby {{the president did not}} sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential veto, {{does not mean that the}} bill has not <b>become</b> <b>law</b> (it could still have <b>become</b> <b>law</b> through a congressional override).|$|R
5|$|The Reich Forestry Office under Göring {{enforced}} {{regulations that}} required foresters {{to plant a}} wide variety of trees to ensure suitable habitat for wildlife and a new Reich Animal Protection Act <b>became</b> <b>law</b> in 1933. The regime enacted the Reich Nature Protection Act in 1935 to protect the natural landscape from excessive economic development and it allowed for the expropriation of privately owned land to create nature preserves and aided in long-range planning. Perfunctory efforts were made to curb air pollution, but little enforcement of existing legislation was undertaken once the war began.|$|E
5|$|The current {{design of}} the seal was {{standardized}} by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. During {{the meeting of the}} General Assembly, Representative Taylor I. Morris introduced legislation to standardize the design of the state seal. His bill described a seal that depicts a woodsman chopping a sycamore tree, while an American Bison runs in the foreground and the sun rises in the background. The leaves of the state tree, the tulip, were to be the border design. The bill passed the assembly that session and <b>became</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it <b>became</b> <b>law.</b> She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure <b>became</b> <b>law.</b> Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
5|$|An outspoken {{advocate}} of prohibition, he made substantial {{donations to the}} Prohibition Party and Indiana's prohibitionist leader Frank Hanly. Haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in Indiana for the U.S. Senate in 1916 as a prohibition candidate and remained active in the party until prohibition <b>became</b> <b>law.</b> Later, he became a philanthropist and served two terms {{as president of the}} YMCA, five years on the Indiana Board of Education, and was {{an active member of the}} Presbyterian church. After his death from complications arising from influenza, his Kokomo mansion was converted into the Elwood Haynes Museum and is open to the public where many of his original inventions and automobiles are on display.|$|E
5|$|Benn {{continued}} his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had {{members in the}} same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., {{who were going to}} receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, <b>became</b> <b>law</b> shortly after 6pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made {{at the time of his}} election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.|$|E
