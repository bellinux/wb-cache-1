5|$|Eventually NSB felt {{confident}} that they had found a technical solution that would be satisfactory, and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre, Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class. Units 2227–2232 were delivered in 1987, and put into regular service on the Sørland Line. Although better than the first series, the second series was also prone to technical problems, and never entered regular service on the Bergen Line. During the 1990s, they were also put into service on the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. The units were never well-liked by NSB, {{in part because of}} the <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> the first series had given, and partly because the number of available units was unpredictable. It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently. The locomotives had been designed to haul a six-car train, but NSB regularly needed to haul eight-car trains, and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16.|$|E

25|$|Roman law {{recognized}} rape as a {{crime in}} which the victim bore no guilt and a capital crime. The rape of a woman was considered an attack on her family and father's honour, and rape victims were shamed for allowing the <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> in her father's honour. As a matter of law, rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property.|$|E
25|$|In the {{meantime}} Feyenoord was placed under special guardianship {{because of their}} financial problems. In the Eredivisie the team was underperforming and Feyenoord hooligans gave the club a <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> in Europe due to several incidents. Blackburn Rovers midfielder Morten Gamst Pedersen {{was hit by a}} plastic beer cup thrown from the crowd during a UEFA Cup match. A few weeks later in Nancy Feyenoord hooligans damaged the city prior to the match versus AS Nancy and during the match they broke through walls of glass, forcing the police to use tear gas, causing a 30-minute suspension of the match.|$|E
25|$|According to Breslov tradition, {{a number}} of {{prominent}} figures of Hasidut supported Rebbe Nachman against the Shpoler Zeide's opposition, including Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, Rabbi Gedalia of Linitz, Rabbi Zev Wolf of Charni-Ostrov, and Rabbi Avraham of Kalisk. Breslov traditions further relate, that at one point, {{a number of}} Hasidic rabbis gathered in Berditchev to place the Shpoler Zeide in cherem (a rabbinic form of excommunication) for showing contempt to a true Torah scholar. Their effort was nixed, however, when someone convinced Rabbi Levi Yitzchok that it would give the city Barditcev a <b>bad</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E

In June 2010 after giving Lalit Modi who was chairman IPL and vice-president BCCI during IPL season 3, {{a fair hearing}} through the BCCI disciplinary committee, he suspended Lalit Modi for his misdemeanors which brought a <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> to the administration of Cricket and the game itself. For this he was lauded nationwide for restoring some of the harm done to cricket's image after the Lalit Modi affair.

25|$|In 1805, Loison led a {{division}} in Napoleon's Grande Armée during the Ulm Campaign {{and served in}} the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 and 1807. He saw much action in the Peninsular War including all three invasions of Portugal, though not always with distinction. In Portugal he earned a <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> for his harshness and the inhabitants called him Maneta or One-Hand. For a brief period, he commanded Michel Ney's famous VI Corps. During the French invasion of Russia he assembled a reserve division, which was later destroyed by the extreme cold weather. He served in the War of the Sixth Coalition before a harsh rebuke from the emperor effectively ended his military career. Loison {{is one of the}} names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe.|$|E
500|$|The {{additional}} weight, {{going from}} the 18.4 tons (Ausf A) to about 25 tons(Ausf J), of these modifications strained the chassis. The overloaded and primitive leaf-spring suspension gave its crew a shaky ride, earning the Panzer IV the nickname [...] "ravistin" [...] ("shaker") in Finnish Service. This not only affected crew comfort, but also hampered the accurate aiming of the main gun. What exactly caused this vibration that gave the PzKw IVJ such a <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> among Finnish tank crews remains somewhat unclear, but suspension {{seems to be the}} most likely suspect.|$|E
50|$|Most monarchs {{inherited}} the throne {{and did not}} give <b>bad</b> posthumous <b>names</b> to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. Emperor Aizong of Jin and Chongzhen Emperor had different names from different people. Qin Hui, of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored. After the Song dynasty few received <b>bad</b> <b>names.</b> <b>Bad</b> monarchs of the Joseon dynasty did not receive posthumous names.|$|R

500|$|Bird, who was {{a member}} of the London Electrical Society, was {{innovative}} in the field of the medical use of electricity, designing much of his own equipment. [...] In his time, electrical treatment had acquired a <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> in the medical profession through its widespread use by quack practitioners. [...] Bird made efforts to oppose this quackery, and was instrumental in bringing medical electrotherapy into the mainstream. [...] He was quick to adopt new instruments of all kinds; he invented a new variant of the Daniell cell in 1837 and made important discoveries in electrometallurgy with it. [...] He was not only innovative in the electrical field, but he also designed a flexible stethoscope, and in 1840 published the first description of such an instrument.|$|E
500|$|Crime stories {{grabbed the}} {{headlines}} in the 1920s and 1930s. After Prohibition took effect in 1920 until its demise in 1933, it opened up a financial bonanza for criminal activity, especially underground bootlegging and the smuggling of liquor into Chicago, Gary, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Evansville and other thirsty cities. Enforcement was haphazard; the Anti-Saloon League {{was more of a}} lobbying agency and never rallied community support for enforcement. The KKK called for punishment of bootleggers and set up the [...] "Horse Thief Detective Association" [...] (HTDA) to make extra-legal raids on speakeasies and gambling joints. It seldom cooperated with law enforcement or the state or federal courts. Instead gave enforcement a <b>bad</b> <b>name.</b> Arthur Gillom, a Republican elected state attorney general over Klan opposition in 1924, did not tolerate its extra-legal operations. Instead, [...] "He stressed the dangers of citizens relinquishing their constitutional rights and personal freedoms, and emphasized the importance of representative government (at all levels), states' rights, and the concept of separation of church and state." [...] When Rev. Shumaker proposed that [...] "personal liberty had to be sacrificed in order to save people," [...] Gilliom replied that surrendering power and individual freedoms was a slippery slope to centralized government and tyranny.|$|E

2500|$|The halftracks were {{initially}} extremely unpopular and dubbed [...] "Purple Heart Boxes" [...] (a grim {{reference to the}} US Army's decoration for combat wounds) by American troops. The chief complaints centered on the complete lack of overhead protection from airbursting artillery shells and that the armor was inadequate against machine gun fire. Omar Bradley quoted in his report about half-tracks that it was [...] "a competent and dependable contrivance. Its <b>bad</b> <b>name</b> resulted from the inexperience of our troops who attempted {{to use it for}} too many things".

Great opposition came from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London but royal assent was given for assay offices in both Birmingham and Sheffield on the same day. Eventually this filtered out much of the poor workmanship of silver and jewellery in Birmingham, keeping mainly the higher-quality jewellery produced, which ultimately enabled the town {{to become one of}} the most important silver manufacturing centres in the 19th century.|$|E
