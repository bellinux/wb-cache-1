5|$|Within {{the school}} {{there was an}} infant school for {{children}} under six, a primary school for children under ten, {{and there was a}} preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years. When entering the school, each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of the community {{who was in charge of}} his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise. The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School (George Ripley, George Bradford, John Sullivan Dwight) as well as several women (Ripley's wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, as well as Georgianna <b>Bruce</b> and Abby <b>Morton).</b> Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, being able to speak ten himself. Dwight taught music as well as Latin. Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts. The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered pedagogy that has been compared to the later reforms of John Dewey. Sophia Ripley's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she only missed two classes in six years.|$|R

50|$|Rudd got {{his first}} {{position}} at CBS News as a writer through the influence of his friend Walter Cronkite. Rudd reported from around the world, including tours as a correspondent in Bonn, Berlin, and Moscow. He was an anchor of the CBS Morning News from 1973 to 1977 when the CBS morning news program {{was more of a}} news summary similar to the format of The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. At times, Rudd was paired with various other CBS anchors, including, briefly in 1973, Sally Quinn, and later, <b>Bruce</b> <b>Morton</b> and Richard Threlkeld, the latter two based in Washington.|$|E

5000|$|In 1999, then Dean of the Montana State University Library, <b>Bruce</b> <b>Morton,</b> {{and local}} angling legend Bud Lilly {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} forming a world-class collection of literature on trout and salmonids. Montana State University, because of its historic fisheries science program and proximity to {{hundreds of miles of}} blue ribbon fisheries, {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Trout U." [...] Lilly, through his connections with the angling industry, organized an initial donation of over 10,000 volumes from an anonymous collector in Montana. From this donation, an initial collection of over 4,000 titles was established. Through the work of special collections librarian James Thull and Montana State University Library Scholar in Residence Paul Schullery, the collection grew to over 10,000 volumes by 2011.|$|E
50|$|Maria Shriver, who {{had joined}} CBS as a West Coast feature {{reporter}} in 1983, and Forrest Sawyer, new to the network, were named co-anchors of The CBS Morning News on August 30, 1985. After a respectable year albeit still placing third in the ratings, Shriver and Sawyer made their last appearance on the program on August 1, 1986, after CBS announced that the early morning timeslot would leave control of the news division, {{to be replaced by}} a new show produced by a newly created unit in the CBS Broadcast Group. Prodded by network affiliates, CBS decided that an entertainment format might work better against Good Morning America and Today, and planning began for a new show that would come to be called The Morning Program. <b>Bruce</b> <b>Morton</b> and Faith Daniels became the first in a string of substitutes to host Morning News until it left the air.|$|E
50|$|The {{organizational}} {{meeting for}} an Australian MAF (AMAF) organization {{was held on}} June 30, 1947. Early members included Edwin “Harry” Hartwig, Leonard Buck, John Nimmo, <b>Bruce</b> <b>Morton</b> and Ken Cooper. After {{the purchase of a}} de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft in 1949, Hartwig and Alex Friend undertook a survey of northern Australia. Hartwig then completed a needs assessment survey in New Guinea. In 1951 Hartwig, along with Bob and Betty Hutchins of MAF-US, established service in New Guinea, based at Madang. On August 6, 1951, Hartwig was killed when his aircraft crashed in the Asaroka Pass in the Central New Guinea Highlands. In the years following, work in Papua New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea (later called Irian Jaya, now Papua, Indonesia) continued through the joint efforts of the Australian and U.S. MAF organizations. Later, AMAF established service in central and north Australia (Arnhem Land), Borneo, and Bougainville.|$|E
5000|$|On August 6, 1973, after Hart was {{replaced}} (he eventually went to NBC), {{in an effort}} to emulate Today, Rudd was teamed up with former Washington Post reporter Sally Quinn. Unfortunately for CBS, within days, the hugely publicized pairing of what was dubbed by the press as [...] "the beauty and the grouch" [...] (respectively referring to Quinn and Rudd) {{turned out to be a}} disaster. Quinn was gone after six months, leaving after the February 1, 1974 telecast. A much more experienced correspondent, <b>Bruce</b> <b>Morton,</b> later took over the Washington desk, remaining there until 1977. During that period, the newscast had evolved into a well-crafted package delivered in a straightforward manner, much like Cronkite's evening newscast. Despite the anchor turnover through the years, the broadcast had set a consistent tone which emphasized news and ideas over celebrity gossip or self-help tips. The anchor desk was subsequently shared by the team of Lesley Stahl and Richard Threlkeld, while Morton and Rudd returned to respectively provide feature reports and commentary.|$|E
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1999 Anthony <b>Bruce</b> <b>Morton.</b> Electric power engineering, {{as it applies to}} low-voltage power reticulation in buildings and industrial sites, is ripe for a ‘paradigm shift’ to bring it properly into the Electronic Age. The conventional alternating-current approach, now over a hundred years old, is increasingly unsatisfactory {{from the point of view}} of plant and appliance requirements. Alternative approaches can deliver substantial cost savings, higher efficiencies, power quality improvements, and greater safety. Power reticulation systems in the future can be expected to differ from present systems in two key respects. The first is a greatly increased role for direct current; the second is the augmentation of the power system with a wide range of ‘management’ technologies. Combining these two trends, which can already be observed today, leads to consideration of ‘managed DC’ power reticulation systems, operating from AC bulk supply mains via AC-DC converters.
