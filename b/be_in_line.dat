A rail project was announced in 2008 to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the transport needs of SCORE, but as yet no construction work has begun despite an anticipated completion date in 2015. In 2017, the Sarawak government proposed a light rail system (Kuching Line) connecting Kuching, Samarahan and Serian divisions with anticipated completion in 2020. Currently, buses are the primary mode of public transportation in Sarawak with interstate services connecting the state to Sabah, Brunei, and Pontianak (Indonesia).|$|E
5|$|The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, {{suggested}} extrajudicially {{during a}} 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient interest test {{with the same}} rigour as the UK courts. A more stringent application of the sufficient interest test would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the green-light approach that the courts adopt in administrative law. Under this approach, the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the executive to adhere to. Accordingly, the courts may adopt a more discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will unnecessarily curtail the executive's ability to carry out good governance.|$|E

25|$|Within the Sydney diocese {{there are}} parishes which support {{a range of}} doctrinal {{positions}} or use formal liturgical styles of worship that differ from the Evangelicalism which is dominant within the diocese. Differences can become politicised prior to the election of an archbishop {{with a number of}} clergy coalescing into like-minded groups. The two most visible groups are The Anglican Church League who support the Diocese's majority Evangelical position and Anglicans Together who are more theologically broad in their understanding of the Bible and promote a diversity of liturgical practice, which they believe to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the Lambeth Quadrilateral.|$|E
25|$|In Sri Lanka, {{temporary}} ordination is not practised, and a monk {{leaving the}} order is frowned upon. The continuing {{influence of the}} caste system in Sri Lanka {{plays a role in}} the taboo against temporary or permanent ordination as a bhikkhu in some orders. Though Sri Lankan orders are often organized along caste lines, men who ordain as monks temporarily pass outside of the conventional caste system, and as such during their time as monks may act (or be treated) {{in a way that would}} not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the expected duties and privileges of their caste.|$|E
25|$|Below is a table {{displaying}} {{a number of}} these loans. Currently some of the etymologies are being referenced to an Urdu dictionary, so {{it should be noted that}} Gujarati's singular masculine o corresponds to Urdu ā, neuter ũ groups into ā as Urdu has no neuter gender, and Urdu's Persian z is not upheld in Gujarati and corresponds to j or jh. In contrast to modern Persian, the pronunciation of these loans into Gujarati and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as that of Indian-recited Persian, seems to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with Persian spoken in Afghanistan and Central Asia, perhaps 500years ago.|$|E

Asquith summoned Wilson to London and personally offered him a corps, and Kitchener told him the corps command was to be “only temporary pending something better”, although Wilson thought impractical his suggestion that he simultaneously continue to perform Anglo-French liaison duties. Jeffery suggests Kitchener may have seen Wilson as a potential ally against Robertson.|$|E

In response, lawyers representing Durbin submitted a letter claiming {{the information in the}} ad was false and that the radio stations would be liable for airing the ad, with the possibility of losing their FCC license.

25|$|Wherein it {{concerns}} states and rulers, Plato has made interesting arguments. For instance he asks which is better—a bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant. He {{argues that it}} is better to be ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the Republic as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Plato suggests the ship's crew to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.|$|E
