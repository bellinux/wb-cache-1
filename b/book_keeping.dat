5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error. It cited several breaches of provincial law regarding {{the operation of}} commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive {{if they have been}} working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log <b>book</b> <b>keeping,</b> and the lack of a contingency plan in the event of poor weather.

They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first half}} of the 19th century saw the {{introduction}} of the first state schools in Christchurch. The earliest school in the town was founded around c.1140 but this disappeared with the dissolution of the monasteries. Later a free school was established in St. Michael's Loft in the Priory. In 1662 this became a grammar school and then in 1828 it became a private academy under control of the vicar. It closed in 1869 when schooling became more widely available through the National Schools. There were also a number of private and boarding schools for those who could afford the fees such as Christchurch School in Purewell which was established in 1827. It described itself as [...] "an upper middle class, modern school", and was run by Josiah Evans. The first National School opened in the High Street in 1829 on land given to the mayor and burgesses by Sir George Henry Rose. There were 354 pupils noted in a report of 1831. These buildings were sold to James Druitt in 1866 and the new school was built in Wick Lane by which time there were 490 pupils in attendance. Another school established around the same time was an independent school attached to the Congregational Church in Millhams Street. This was enlarged in 1880 to take 400 pupils. It closed in 1926 when Clarendon Road Junior School opened. A new technical school was inaugurated in 1898. Classes were held in various buildings throughout the town until additions to the Town Hall in 1903 provided classrooms. <b>Book</b> <b>keeping,</b> maths, languages, wood carving, science, needlework and art were taught there.|$|E
