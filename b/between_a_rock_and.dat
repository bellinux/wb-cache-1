Their 1985 release <b>Between</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's {{status as an}} icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, <b>Between</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> a Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E

30|$|Drilling {{operations}} in a borehole {{can lead to}} problems when the friction between the drilling equipments <b>and</b> the host <b>rock</b> are not well identified. This paper reports an experimental program carried out to characterize the shear behavior of <b>an</b> interface <b>between</b> <b>a</b> shale <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> the steel parts of the drilling equipment (bottom hole assembly and casing). Direct shear tests were performed with an advanced shear box, on interfaces made up of shale specimens and steel plates both in natural and water re-saturated conditions. The shear tests were performed at different normal stress levels from 2 to 12  MPa and {{the results show that}} the shear stress increases when the normal stress is increased. While the cohesion strength between the steel plate and shale is almost zero in a dry condition, this parameter reaches about 1  MPa in the presence of water. The average friction coefficient is determined to be 0.45 in the dry condition and it decreases to 0.21 when water is present. These findings should allow engineers involved in drilling operations and casing installation to assess more accurately the forces required to pull tools out of the borehole when problems arise. Therefore, this information could help to mitigate the risks encountered during well drilling.|$|R

This live album became their first album with any kind of chart success in the UK. Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as [...] "a group who played with orchestras", both feeling that the Concerto was a distraction that would get in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance [...] "you could put the five smiles together, and it would have spanned the Thames." [...] Lord would also write the Gemini Suite, another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the Concerto for Group and Orchestra wasn't bad but the Gemini Suite was horrible and very disjointed. Roger Glover later claimed Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.|$|R
