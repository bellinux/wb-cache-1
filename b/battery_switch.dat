40|$|Recently, the {{deployment}} of electric vehicles (EV) has been recognised as a key element for establishing sustainable transport systems within countries. Research {{studies have been conducted}} to tackle challenges regarding the commercial introduction of EV. However, the current plug-in EV infrastructure poses operational limitations, causing users refusing to change from fossil-fuelled vehicles to EV. To eliminate the limitations of long charging time and huge infrastructure costs of the current EV models, an intelligent battery information management system (IBIS) is designed for supporting <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> logistics operations. The system shows the potential value of the <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> management and the minimization of the supply chain cost. A case study in launching the proposed model in Hong Kong is conducted. The result provides a practical solution to balance the level of battery charging efficiency in the battery management hub, service rate of <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> stations, and the inventory cost of holding batteries.

25|$|The Better Place {{network was}} the first modern {{commercial}} deployment of the battery switching model. The Renault Fluence Z.E. {{was the first}} electric car enabled with switchable battery technology available for the Better Place network in operation in Israel and Denmark. Better Place used the same technology to swap batteries that F-16 jet fighter aircraft use to load their bombs. Better Place launched its first battery-swapping station in Israel, in Kiryat Ekron, near Rehovot in March 2011. The battery exchange process took five minutes. , about 600 Fluence Z.E.s had been sold in the country.

By late 2012 the company began to suffer financial difficulties, and decided to put on hold the roll out in Australia and reduce its non-core activities in North America, as the company decided to concentrate its resources on its two existing markets. On 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about [...] million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi. Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We {{introduce}} a practically important and theoretically challenging problem: finding the minimum cost path for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) {{in a network}} with refueling and <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> stations, considering electricity and gasoline as sources of energy with different cost structures and limitations. We show that this problem is NP-complete even though its electric vehicle and conventional vehicle special cases are polynomially solvable. We propose three solution techniques: (1) a mixed integer quadratically constrained program that incorporates non-fuel costs such as vehicle depreciation, battery degradation and stopping, (2) a dynamic programming based heuristic and (3) a shortest path heuristic. We conduct extensive computational experiments using both real world road network data and artificially generated road networks of various sizes and provide signifi- cant insights {{about the effects of}} driver preferences and the availability of <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> stations on the PHEV economics. In particular, our findings show that increasing the number of <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> stations {{may not be enough to}} overcome the range anxiety of the drivers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The cycle {{performance}} and the capacity fading model of 18650 Li-ion batteries {{and the possibility of}} dual-battery switching technology applied in marine buoys were studied. The recycling capacity fading data of 18650 li-ion batteries were gained and the data were fit by Matlab cttool toolbox. A fitting curve more in line with the scatters was gained. The number of cycles was calculated when the battery capacity remaining 80 %. Then the normal working time and the working time using <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> theory of a buoy were calculated under that specific number of cycles. The results show that the 18650 li-ion battery capacity fading model adheres more to the power function model than linear function model. Its correlation coefficient reaches 0. 9811 and it shows a high fitting degree. The longevity of the battery pack using <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> technology is 28. 79 % longer than the traditional single battery pack.

5000|$|With {{areas around}} cities covered with battery {{switching}} stations, also called battery-swap stations, drivers would potentially have electric cars with an unlimited driving range for long distance trips. The QuickDrop <b>battery</b> <b>switch</b> system would enable Renault Fluence Z.E.'s battery, the only vehicle {{deployed in the}} Better Place network, to be swapped in approximately three minutes at dedicated battery exchange stations. [...] The actual robotic battery-switching operation took about five minutes in the deployed stations.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of a <b>battery</b> <b>switching</b> station (BSS) for {{electric}} buses (EBs) that captures the predictability of bus operation. We schedule battery charging in the BSS so that every EB arrives to find a <b>battery</b> ready for <b>switching.</b> We develop an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal schedule. It uses dual decomposition to decouple the charging decisions at different charging boxes so that independent subproblems can be solved in parallel at individual charging boxes, making the algorithm inherently scalable as the size of the BSS grows. We propose a direct projection method that solves these subproblems rapidly. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed approach is far more efficient and scalable than generic algorithms and existing solvers...|$|R
