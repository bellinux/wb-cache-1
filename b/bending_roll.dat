The widening of all cell gap widths {{is proportional to the}} <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> displacement until a cell cracks in parallel to the bending rolls due to the tensile stress in the cells. At this point, the crack opens abruptly while the two parallel cell gaps next to the cracked cell close simultaneously by the same distance in sum. From here on, the cell gaps and the cell crack increases proportionally to the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> displacement. Since the distance between the centers of mass of both cracked cell parts is independent of the crack position, the crack width is also independent of the crack position for single cracks. Multiple parallel cracks in solar cells have smaller crack widths according to this model. Laminates without a backsheet show about 30 % larger crack widths...|$|E

40|$|In {{the tube}} bending {{industry}} a process is considered flexible if {{it allows the}} forming of different curvature radii, {{without the need for}} a machine setup or a tool change. This is possible by numerically controlling one or more moving dies or rolls which are able to produce different radii. Unlike conventional tube bending processes, where the tube is clamped at its end and bent around a fixed die, bending with variable radius generally requires that the tube is axially fed into the forming area. A flexible bending operation is traditionally operated by dividing it into an opening phase (the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> is moving) and a steady phase (the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> is on hold and the tube is axially fed). A technological limit of the process is its intrinsic variability, e. g. measured in terms of repeatability of the obtained bent angle. An FEM based sensitivity analysis is shown in the paper in order to verify which input parameters of the incoming tubes (dimensions, material properties, etc.) are more influential on the results in terms of repeatability. The presence of the two opening and steady phases, with different mechanical conditions is an obstacle to the production of an aesthetic tube with a constant, uniform curvature radius. As a result, the real curvature radius moving along the tube spine will have some variations, which may also transform into defects, such as wrinkling or bumps. A modification of the traditionally operated control curves is proposed in the paper in order to improve the uniformity of the obtained curvature radius. Finally, a method is proposed for optimizing the control curves, under the presence of noise factors...|$|E

The purposes of roll shifting are primarily to control the strip shape and crown by improving the <b>bending</b> <b>roll</b> effect, to reduce the edge drop of the strip, and to maintain the uniform wear and thermal crown of the working rolls. In order to minimize or eliminate the scarring and scotch marks caused by axial shifting of the rolls, the contact zone must be kept in a non-all statical friction state. The non-all statical friction condition may be met by controlling the shifting velocity.

40|$|This work {{presents}} improved {{technology for}} attaining high-quality rolled metal strip. The {{new technology is}} based on an innovative method to model both the static and dynamic characteristics of rolling mill deflection, and it applies equally to both cluster-type and non cluster-type rolling mill configurations. By effectively combining numerical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with analytical solid mechanics, the devised approach delivers a rapid, accurate, flexible, high-fidelity model useful for optimizing many important rolling parameters. The associated static deflection model enables computation of the thickness profile and corresponding flatness of the rolled strip. Accurate methods of predicting the strip thickness profile and strip flatness are important in rolling mill design, rolling schedule set-up, control of mill flatness actuators, and optimization of ground roll profiles. The corresponding dynamic deflection model enables solution of the standard eigenvalue problem to determine natural frequencies and modes of vibration. The presented method for solving the roll-stack deflection problem offers several important advantages over traditional methods. In particular, it includes continuity of elastic foundations, non-iterative solution when using pre-determined elastic foundation moduli, continuous third-order displacement fields, simple stress-field determination, the ability to calculate dynamic characteristics, and a comparatively faster solution time. Consistent with the most advanced existing methods, the presented method accommodates loading conditions that represent roll crowning, roll <b>bending,</b> <b>roll</b> shifting, and roll crossing mechanisms. Validation of the static model is provided by comparing results and solution time with large-scale, commercial finite element simulations.
