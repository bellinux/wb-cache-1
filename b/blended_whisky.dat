25|$|<b>Blended</b> <b>whisky</b> is {{made from}} a mixture of {{different}} types of whisky. A blend may contain whisky from many distilleries so that the blender can produce a flavour consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit the name of a distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whisky is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are the product of one distillery, as is common in Canada. American <b>blended</b> <b>whisky</b> may contain neutral spirits.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey refined {{a design}} {{originally}} created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much {{more efficiently than}} the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the grain whisky distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The <b>blended</b> <b>whisky</b> proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the <b>blended</b> <b>whisky</b> was more popular on the international market.|$|E

25|$|In 1831, Aeneas Coffey {{patented}} the Coffey still, {{allowing for}} cheaper {{and more efficient}} distillation of whisky. In 1850, Andrew Usher began producing a <b>blended</b> <b>whisky</b> that mixed traditional pot still whisky with that from the new Coffey still. The new distillation method was scoffed at by some Irish distillers, who clung to their traditional pot stills. Many Irish contended that the new product was, in fact, not whisky at all.|$|E
