5|$|Heskey's {{place in}} the England squad had been placed under {{scrutiny}} in 2003 {{with the emergence of}} Wayne Rooney into the England squad. However, despite being criticised for his lack of international goals, he continued to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the international squad and took over the captaincy from Michael Owen after he was substituted when England beat Serbia and Montenegro 2–1 in his hometown of Leicester in June 2003. Heskey was named in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2004, but failed to perform well, and was the subject of much criticism. He came on as a substitute while England were leading 1–0 against France and fouled Claude Makélélé {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, giving away a direct free kick from which France equalised. England eventually lost 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Manchester {{hosted the}} 2002 Commonwealth Games which was, {{at a cost}} of £200M for the {{sporting}} facilities and a further £470M for local infrastructure, by far the biggest and most expensive sporting event held in the UK and the first to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of urban regeneration. A mix of new and existing facilities were used. New amenities included the Manchester Aquatics Centre, Bolton Arena, the National Squash Centre, and the City of Manchester Stadium. The Manchester Velodrome was built as part of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. After the Commonwealth Games the City of Manchester Stadium was converted for football use, and the adjacent warm-up track upgraded to become the Manchester Regional Arena. Other facilities continue to be used by elite athletes. Cambridge Policy Consultants estimate 4,500full-time jobs as a direct consequence, and Grattan points to other long-term benefits accruing from publicity and the improvement of the area's image.|$|E
5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|E

5|$|Alonso {{was born}} {{in the small town of}} Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, Periko Alonso, won La Liga twice in {{successive}} seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he joined Barcelona. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career. Xabi Alonso lived in the city of Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián (Donostia) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha (Shell Beach). On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, Mikel Arteta, and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability. He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, Mikel, to CE Sabadell's training ground to practice together. Alonso was influenced by his father's playing, taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal. At an early age, he decided to play as a defensive midfielder, a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball well. This talent would later prove to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of his club and international career.|$|E

Furthermore, remote sensing is the best and perhaps only possible way to study the Amazon on a large-scale.|$|E

The Bentendō Temple was destroyed during World War II, and the present one is a reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|The {{convection}} of the Earth's mantle is {{a chaotic}} process (in {{the sense of}} fluid dynamics), which is thought to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the motion of plates. Plate motion {{should not be confused}} with continental drift which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are coupled since descending lithosphere is an essential component of convection in the mantle. The observed continental drift is a complicated relationship between the forces causing oceanic lithosphere to sink and the movements within Earth's mantle.|$|E

Moreover, he strongly believed that developing alliances with consumers is necessary for setting research priorities, and that research results should be easily accessible to {{people who need to}} make decisions about their own health.|$|E

25|$|Any Prime Minister of India can't make {{decision}} of plebiscite unilaterally, bill of plebiscite must be passed {{in both houses}} of Parliament of India with a massive 2/3rd majority, then it requires assent by President of India, and if that decision is against Basic structure of Indian Constitution then Supreme Court of India can outlaw or abolish that decision. Preamble and article 3 of part 2 of Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir says 'Jammu and Kashmir is and shall <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the Union of India'. This constitution has been adopted by elected Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly in 1956 when Nehru was Prime Minister of India.|$|E
25|$|Females can mate {{during their}} 1st fall, but some do not breed until their 2nd year. Males become reproductively active during their 2nd year. Breeding occurs {{in and around}} hibernacula in fall. During the {{breeding}} season, Indiana bats undergo a phenomenon known as swarming. During this activity, large numbers of bats fly {{in and out of}} caves from sunset to sunrise. Swarming mainly occurs during August to September and is thought to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of mating. Bats have been observed copulating in caves until early October. During the swarming/breeding period, very few bats are found roosting within the hibernacula during the day. Limited mating may also occur at the end of hibernation.|$|E
25|$|Toys: Toys {{are various}} items on, above, or beneath the playfield (items beneath the playfield visible through windows) or {{attached}} to the cabinet (usually to the backbox). Usually, each toy is unique to the machine it was made for, and reflects {{the theme of the}} game. They may be visual only, and have no effect on game play; they may be alternate ways of performing common game functions (for example, instead of using a drop hole to hold the ball, a hand or claw might reach out, grab the ball, and capture it that way); or they may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> of the game rules and play (for instance, having a smaller playfield over the main playfield that can be tilted right and left by the player, using the flipper buttons).|$|E
