5|$|Although the {{official}} website of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats consider {{them as the}} same team, the Tiger-Cats, Hamilton Alerts, Hamilton Tigers and Hamilton Flying Wildcats are all listed separately <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> latter three were active, the teams competed as separate franchises. The Tigers and Flying Wildcats merged in 1950 to create the Tiger-Cats.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E

50|$|It is {{so named}} <b>because</b> <b>when</b> viewing <b>the</b> board bottom with the nose down, {{the outline of}} the tail {{somewhat}} resembles the ears and dome of the Batman's cowl.|$|R
25|$|The ECU is {{programmed}} to disregard differences in wheel rotative speed below a critical threshold, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> car is turning, the two wheels towards {{the center of}} the curve turn slower than the outer two. For this same reason, a differential is used in virtually all roadgoing vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Today the Komondor is {{a fairly}} common breed in Hungary, its country of origin. Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories {{say that this is}} <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they had to kill the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.|$|E
25|$|The High Court's {{decision}} in Teo Soh Lung remains the authority {{on whether the}} basic features doctrine applies in Singapore law, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> decision was appealed the Court of Appeal held it was unnecessary for it {{to decide whether the}} power of Parliament to amend the Constitution can ever be limited. It left the issue open for {{decision in}} a future case.|$|E
50|$|Note that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{attacker}} and defender {{have the}} same number of dice the probability of a successful attack is always under 50%. This is <b>because</b> <b>when</b> both <b>the</b> attacker and defender roll the same total, the defender wins.|$|R

5000|$|This {{spelling}} rule {{does not}} {{have a great deal of}} effect on actual Russian pronunciation, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> unstressed, <b>the</b> vowels о and е are weakened to a very weak sound like the schwa.|$|R
25|$|A {{story of}} the {{founding}} of the city goes as follows: Seleucus asked the Babylonian priests which day would be best to found the city. The priest calculated the day, but, wanting the founding to fail, told Seleucus a different date. The plot failed however, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> correct day came, Seleucus' soldiers spontaneously started to build the city. When questioned, the priests admitted their deed.|$|E
25|$|The Indians and Australians had {{exploited}} a good batting surface, but {{the pitch}} which had rapidly worn out, aiding spinners {{to a large}} extent, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ball pitched on the rough and the footholds on the batsmen's end, it would turn alarmingly and would keep low as well, {{making it difficult for}} the batsmen to play some attacking shots. However, the Australian batsmen decided to tackle this situation by the mean they knew best: all-out attack.|$|E
25|$|A T-coil {{consists}} of a metal core (or rod) around which ultra-fine wire is coiled. T-coils are also called induction coils <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> coil is placed in a magnetic field, an alternating electric current is induced in the wire (Ross, 2002b; Ross, 2004). The T-coil detects magnetic energy and transduces (converts) it to electrical energy. In the United States, the Telecommunications Industry Association's TIA-1083 standard, specifies how analog handsets can interact with telecoil devices, to ensure the optimal performance.|$|E
5000|$|But in a {{language}} where modulo has {{the sign of the}} dividend, that is incorrect, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> [...] (<b>the</b> dividend) is negative and odd, [...] mod 2 returns −1, and the function returns false.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with many}} rice-based desserts, {{it is best}} to eat mango sticky rice {{directly}} after it is purchased or cooked <b>because</b> <b>when</b> refrigerated, <b>the</b> glutinous sticky rice turns hard and the coconut milk expires quickly.|$|R
50|$|Gull-wing {{doors are}} {{a type of}} door that are hinged on their {{uppermost}} edge, at the roof rather than the side. They are so named <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> opened, <b>the</b> doors evoke {{the image of a}} seagull opening its wings.|$|R
25|$|This was {{necessary}} <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first copies {{of this edition}} arrived {{in the country at}} the end of 1870, President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's opposition took advantage of the modifications in the legal code sanctioned by Congress to initiate a media campaign against the government. For this reason Victorino de la Plaza and Aurelio Prado were appointed to compare both versions and report on the existing differences. While they were doing so, on January 1, 1871 President Sarmiento's decree declared the Buenos Aires edition to be official.|$|E
25|$|Retrograde orbit: An orbit with an {{inclination}} of {{more than}} 90°. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them {{is much greater than}} for a prograde orbit. This is <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{radiation}} {{absorbed dose}} {{is the amount}} energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The SI unit for dose is grays (Gy or J/kg). Dosimeters are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to ionizing radiation, change measurable physical attributes {{to a degree that}} can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose (dosimetry) involves exposing one or more dosimeters along with the target material.|$|E
50|$|This is <b>because</b> <b>when</b> heating, <b>the</b> work {{used to run}} {{the device}} is {{converted}} to heat and adds to the desired effect, whereas if the desired effect is cooling the heat resulting from the input work is just an unwanted byproduct.|$|R
50|$|Glucose reduces resazurin to resorufin {{which will}} then be reduced again to a colorless {{compound}} dihydroresorufin. When dihydroresorufin is shaken, it is oxidized back to resorufin <b>because</b> <b>when</b> shook, <b>the</b> oxygen in the bottle will oxidize dihydroresorufin and make it back into resorufin.|$|R
50|$|Many autobiographies are {{excellent}} examples of motivated self-enhancement, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> recalling <b>the</b> {{events that have}} taken place in one's life, {{there is a tendency to}} make oneself appear to be more involved in positive experiences, though others may remember the event differently.|$|R
25|$|Arnot {{was still}} in Britain but Charles Swan and Dan Crawford were present. Msiri and his {{officials}} could not read English and Sharpe described the agreement favourably, but Arnot had advised Msiri to have any treaties translated, and Swan now gave the same advice. For this the missionaries were later criticised by the British, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> treaty's real contents were revealed to Msiri, enraged, he sent Sharpe away empty-handed. Sharpe was sure Msiri would not sign away his sovereignty to any other power, and he advised Johnston to wait until he was 'out of the way'.|$|E
25|$|If {{the claim}} is {{accepted}} then the maximum Oyster fare minus {{the cost of the}} journey will be refunded. The user will be asked to nominate and make a journey from a specific Tube, DLR, London Overground or National Rail station, or Tram stop. On touching in or out, the refund is loaded to the card. The only way to collect a refund is as part of an actual journey, otherwise a further penalty fare is charged. This is <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> passenger touches the reader with their Oyster card, not only will the refund go on to the card, but a new journey will start.|$|E
25|$|The contemporaries {{believed}} that the plague in Riga continued <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Russian forces lifted the siege, the influx of fresh air swirled and further distributed the plague's bad air throughout the city. Some Russian measures, however, really contributed {{to the spread of}} the plague: Sheremetev allowed 114 Swedish government officials to leave for Dünamünde and from there for Stockholm with all their families and households, taking the plague with them; also captured sick soldiers were sent to the isle of Ösel (Øsel, Saaremaa) off the Estonian coast, while the healthy were integrated into Sheremetev's corps. Refugees from Dünamünde also carried the plague to Ösel, where the fortress of Arensburg was depopulated by the disease.|$|E

50|$|Supes (Louise Hall) is Pugwalls mother. Pugwall {{calls his}} mum Supes <b>because</b> <b>when</b> she cleans <b>the</b> house she is like Superman, {{speeding}} {{around the house}} at super-speed.|$|R
50|$|White Ring Moon - The Moon of magic. It is worshiped by wizards. It {{is called}} ring moon <b>because</b> it <b>when</b> <b>the</b> gods of the Moon {{left for a}} higher plane of existence, it split in two forming a ring.|$|R
25|$|Taro was {{consumed}} by the early Romans {{in much the same}} way the potato is today. They called this root vegetable colocasia. The Roman cookbook Apicius mentions several methods for preparing taro, including boiling, preparing with sauces, and cooking with meat or fowl. After the fall of the Roman Empire the use of taro dwindled in Europe. This was largely due to the decline of trade and commerce with Egypt, previously controlled by Rome. It is still important to note the Taro <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Spanish and Portuguese sailed to the new world, they brought taro along with them. Taro has remained popular in the Canary Islands. Recently there has been renewed interest in exotic foods and consumption is increasing.|$|E
25|$|The {{father of}} a man arrested in a July 2006 sting by Perverted-Justice {{appeared}} before a Georgia Superior Court judge to seek an arrest warrant for Perverted-Justice Xavier Von Erck, stating that Von Erck solicited the commission of a felony from the man. The judge found that probable cause existed to believe Von Erck impersonated a girl and solicited {{the man with the}} intent for him to commit a felony, but declined to issue the warrant <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> act occurred, there was no actual girl and thus no crime occurred. The act of soliciting a felony is itself a felony. Attorney Gary Gerrard filed an appeal with the Georgia Court of Appeals, alleging that under Georgia law, solicitation is a felony whether or not a crime occurred. That appeal was ultimately rejected.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides and Nachmanides {{differed}} {{about the}} reason for the sacrificial system. Maimonides wrote that {{the reason for}} the offerings was <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Israelites lived in Egypt and Chaldea, the Egyptians worshipped sheep and the Chaldeans worshipped demons in the form of goats. And people in India never slaughter cattle. Thus God commanded the Israelites to slaughter cattle, sheep, and goats to God, so that worshipers of the other lands would know that God required the very act that they considered to be the utmost sin, and through that act God would forgive Israel's sins. God thus intended to cure the people of the other nations of false beliefs, which Maimonides characterized as diseases of the soul, for diseases are healed by medicines that are antithetical to the diseases.|$|E
5000|$|The name Chaca is <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> {{removed from}} <b>the</b> water, they will rapidly repeat the sound [...] "chaca". Only C. chaca makes these sounds; the other species do not.|$|R
30|$|One {{should also}} be {{cautious}} when comparing field results to studies of injected methylmercury. Injected methylmercury is considered much more embryo-toxic than maternally-derived methylmercury <b>because,</b> <b>when</b> injected, <b>the</b> mercury is unbound which allows it to more readily {{come into contact with}} the membrane around the embryo (Heinz et al. 2006).|$|R
5000|$|This {{plane wave}} {{spectrum}} {{representation of the}} electromagnetic field is the basic foundation of Fourier optics (this point cannot be emphasized strongly enough), <b>because</b> <b>when</b> z=0, <b>the</b> equation above simply becomes a Fourier transform (FT) relationship between the field and its plane wave content (hence the name, [...] "Fourier optics").|$|R
