5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss was merely a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road)</b> the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|E
50|$|The {{passing of}} {{automobiles}} to Corson's inlet has naturally left giant, mogul-like <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> oddly evenly spaced, all reaching {{the same height}} and depth (approx. 3 feet).|$|R
50|$|But {{like any}} journey worth making, there are {{inevitable}} <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> - and struggles with both herself and others around her {{eventually led to}} Leanne taking a well-earned break to embrace alternative projects.|$|R
50|$|Steering {{geometry}} changes due to <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{may cause}} <b>the</b> front wheels to steer {{in different directions}} together or independent of each other. The steering linkage should be designed to minimize this effect.|$|R
25|$|The Spurs christened the SBC Center {{in style}} on November 1, 2002 by {{defeating}} the Toronto Raptors 91–72. The Spurs {{would not get}} off to a flying start as they had just a 19–13 record heading into January. In January the Spurs began to gel and seemed prepped to make a run, when they embarked on their annual Rodeo Road Trip, a nine-game road trip from January 25 to February 16. However, it would be hardly a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for the charging Spurs, who won eight of the nine and began to climb their way to first place. The Spurs went on to erase their seven-game deficit and finished the season in a tie with the Dallas Mavericks for {{the best record in the}} NBA (60–22). Thanks to a tiebreaker, the Spurs won their third straight Division title as Tim Duncan claimed his second straight NBA MVP.|$|E
25|$|After their disappointing {{second round}} collapse, the Spurs looked {{to regain the}} NBA crown. With the {{acquisition}} of guard Brent Barry from Seattle, the Spurs would {{get off to a}} quick start, posting a 12–3 record in November. The Spurs would stay hot through December as they established a 25–6 record entering the New Year. With the later additions of center Nazr Mohammed from New York (acquired in a midseason trade of Malik Rose), and veteran forward Glenn Robinson from free agency, alongside regulars Bruce Bowen, Robert Horry, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Tim Duncan, the Spurs would be near the top in the Western Conference all season, battling the Phoenix Suns for {{the best record in the}} NBA. Just as it appeared the Spurs would cruise toward the playoffs their season suddenly hit a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> when Tim Duncan suffered an ankle injury. The Spurs struggled the rest of the season, finishing just 59–23. However, by the time the playoffs rolled around, Duncan was ready to return.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} {{their show}} on May 3, 2009, at the Van Andel Arena, Troy Reimink {{made a point}} of Crahan's absence, suggesting that while it could have seriously disrupted the tour, it seemed like [...] "merely a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for Slipknot." [...] Reimink said the band's 17 song setlist, featuring songs from all their albums, [...] "demonstrated the group's skill at assembling relentlessly aggressive songs punctuated with fleeting, occasionally incongruous bits of melody." [...] While noting that Slipknot were [...] "not [...] thing", he described the show as [...] "an exercise in finely calculated chaos", rating the show 2.5 out of 4. Diana Nollen of The Gazette reviewed Slipknot's show in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, describing their stage show as a [...] "sophisticated sideshow of garish masks and growling lyrics." [...] Nollen made a note of their on-stage antics saying that [...] "it's rather entertaining as they lumber across the stage and climb on each other's percussion stations like baboons from hell." [...] Citing the singles [...] "Before I Forget" [...] and [...] "Psychosocial" [...] as particular highlights of the setlist, she concluded her review by saying that the [...] "final visual punch" [...] of drummer Joey Jordison's kit raising, tipping and rotating above the stage was like [...] "a demented version of an Adventureland ride." ...|$|E
5000|$|A swingarm, or [...] "swinging arm" [...] (UK), {{originally}} {{known as}} a swing fork or pivoted fork, is {{the main component of}} the rear suspension of most modern motorcycles and ATVs. It is used to hold the rear axle firmly, while pivoting vertically, to allow the suspension to absorb <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tru Life's career {{started in}} 1999 after being signed to Dreamworks Records. His album, Cryin' Out Loud, was {{scheduled}} to be released in November 2001. In an interview, Tru Life says [...] "They weren't ready to do black music", and [...] "there were too many <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> and I couldn't move." ...|$|R
5000|$|When any wheel leaves {{contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{there is a}} change <b>in</b> handling, so <b>the</b> {{suspension}} should keep all four (or three) wheels on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> spite of hard cornering, swerving and <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> It {{is very important for}} handling, as well as other reasons, not to run out of suspension travel and [...] "bottom" [...] or [...] "top".|$|R
2500|$|The restaurant's {{name was}} devised on a {{cancelled}} 1936 road trip to California, in which Beverly spilled a picnic basket of chicken after Rubye hit a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> while {{driving on the}} Oklahoma prairie. Rubye remarked {{something to the effect}} of [...] "This is really chicken in the rough". After this occurred, they turned around and headed back to Oklahoma City. Another notion is that the name was devised on a family picnic [...] "where silverware had been forgotten", and that the consumption of the chicken without silverware constituted eating it [...] "in the rough", using one's hands. However, the official website of the chain states that the former occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfgang Förster {{wrote that}} the German {{timetable}} of deployment had required its armies to reach a line from Thionville to Sedan and Mons by the 22nd day of mobilisation (23 August), which was achieved ahead of schedule. In Bulletin Belge des Sciences Militaires, a four-day delay was claimed. John Buchan wrote that [...] "The triumph was moral – an advertisement {{to the world that}} the ancient faiths of country and duty could still nerve the arm for battle, and that the German idol, for all its splendour, had feet of clay". In 2007, Foley called the neutralisation of the Belgian defences at Liège sufficient to enable the German right wing to squeeze through, a small <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for the Germans, who had mobilised in two weeks and were ready to invade France by 20 August.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} point of {{distinction between the}} two rules is in the matter of award of damages. Damages awardable where the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher applies will be ordinary or compensatory; but in cases where the rule applicable is the one laid down in MC Mehta’s case the court can allow exemplary damages, and the bigger and more prosperous the enterprise, the greater can be the amount of compensation payable by it. A small <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was encountered in Charan Lal Sahu v. Union of India and doubts were expressed as to the quantum of damages payable. But the Supreme Court set all doubts aside in another landmark decision in the case of Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India where, it was held that the rule laid down in Mehta’s case was not obiter and was appropriate and suited to the conditions prevailing in our country.|$|E

30|$|This {{contrast}} {{leaves us}} with the “macropuzzles”: we have much work left to do to piece together a plausible story not only of what went wrong, but why it went wrong. What were the political economy mechanisms that derailed Argentina <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century? A century ago, despite some <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>the</b> country was prosperous and literate, in a temperate zone, economically open, had reasonably tolerable rule of law, and was progressing towards macroeconomic stability and a liberal constitutional democracy. It was not so unlike the other settler countries. Today, a century later, it looks very different.|$|R
