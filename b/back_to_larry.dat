50|$|Anna goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Larry.</b> Distraught, Dan confronts Larry at {{his office}} and has {{to come to terms}} with the fact that Anna no longer wants him. Larry {{recommends}} Dan go back to Alice and reveals that he had seen her in the strip club. He lies for Alice at first and tells Dan that they did not sleep together, since Alice feared that, if Dan found out, he would not want her any more. At the end, Larry decides to hurt Dan and reveals the truth—that they had slept together.|$|E

When Glimpy and the others burst into Maxie's storeroom, Fingers rushes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Larry's</b> office and there recognizes Milly as Muggs's sister. At that moment, Muggs and the boys come to Milly's rescue and apprehend Larry and Fingers.

60|$|They hurried <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where <b>Larry</b> {{had been}} left, {{and found him}} still nursing his ankle, which had swollen {{to the size of}} his knee. He tried to stand upon it, but the pain was so great he was glad enough to sit down again.|$|R
50|$|Broad bounced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> outpoint <b>Larry</b> Alexander over 12 {{rounds in}} 1983 then {{knockout}} contender Eddie Gregg in 8 rounds {{to win the}} NABF title in 1984.

50|$|As the {{underground}} comix market petered {{out in the}} mid-to-late 1970s, Rip Off Press shifted focus to other cartoonists and other comics (including in their long-running anthology Rip Off Comix). (By this point co-founders Moriaty and Jackson had long since gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Texas.) <b>Larry</b> Gonick published his Cartoon History of the Universe with Rip Off Press from 1978-1992. Cartoonist Jay Kinney joined the company as an editor in 1981, but left {{after a few months}} on the job. Cartoonist Guy Colwell began freelancing for Rip Off Press in the production department beginning in 1980; he worked on-and-off for the company through c. 1990.|$|R
50|$|Just before {{training}} camp, Pro Bowl cornerback Ty Law {{was added}} to Kansas City's lineup to strengthen the defense. To help the offense, Left tackle Kyle Turley made his first appearance post-two-year absence from the NFL, and Running back Michael Bennett was acquired <b>to</b> <b>back</b> up <b>Larry</b> Johnson. The Chiefs signed quarterback Casey Printers, who had success in the Canadian Football League, to their practice squad.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, a late-season rally {{allowed the}} Celtics {{to catch the}} Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. The team {{finished}} 51-31 and again matched up with the Indiana Pacers in the first round, this time sweeping the series 3 games to 0. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics lost a grueling 7 game series to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 4 games to 3. Due <b>to</b> <b>back</b> problems, <b>Larry</b> Bird played in only 45 of the 82 regular season games, and only 4 of the 10 playoff games.|$|R
5000|$|He and Amita {{spend at}} least twenty hours a week doing DØ research, though, in [...] "End Game", Larry has a crisis of faith {{regarding}} his Higgs boson work, wondering {{if he is a}} hypocrite to be searching for something he may not want to find. Charlie points out to him the problem isn't that Larry wouldn't find the Higgs boson, but that he would and his feelings would be the same as his trip to the ISS. The question becomes moot in early 2009 when Larry's Higgs research is stopped due to problems at CERN. In [...] "When Worlds Collide", it is revealed that Megan is leaving the FBI <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> east, <b>to</b> which <b>Larry</b> says that their relationship has never depended on geographic proximity.|$|R
5000|$|All {{goes well}} until {{the night of}} the highly {{anticipated}} World Championship match with Killer Kilduff (Al Hill). Only a few moments into the first round, Kilduff plants a left hook at Curly, sending him into the crowd, landing on Larry and crushing his violin. Frantic, Larry scurries the streets, looking for anything that is playing [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel," [...] while Curly is being battered by the boxer. Larry finds a radio playing the tune, takes it and heads <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the arena. <b>Larry</b> arrives at the arena a few minutes later with the radio. The song ends moments later just as Curly is about to knock out Kilduff, when the radio announcer is about to tell the children's story involving [...] "Peter Rabbit", causing Moe to crash the radio on Larry's head, ruining the box. Moe sends <b>Larry</b> <b>back</b> out <b>to</b> find something else playing [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel".|$|R
5000|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> R. Helyer (as {{well as to}} {{many other}} scholars), Demetrius in this text is Demetrius III Eucaerus (95-88 BCE), the Seleucid king who {{defeated}} Alexander Jannaeus in battle, but was forced <b>to</b> withdraw <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Syria. Accordingly, by [...] "the Flattery-Seekers", the Pharisees were probably meant.|$|R

50|$|Back in the courtroom, Moe ends {{his story}} by {{concluding}} {{that he must}} go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bed for six additional months. The judge takes pity on the poor Stooge, and finds him not guilty. Joe and Larry are disgusted by the ruling and are about to get theirs. But thanks <b>to</b> <b>Larry's</b> tough skull the axe is now broken and Moe begins to lose his nerves again.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, <b>Larry</b> convinces Anna <b>to</b> see him {{one last}} time; she agrees {{to sleep with}} him so that he will sign the divorce papers and leave her alone. Dan {{suspects}} the affair, to which Anna confesses, and following their argument, she returns <b>to</b> <b>Larry.</b> Distraught, Dan confronts <b>Larry</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> get Anna <b>back.</b> Instead, Larry tells him Alice's whereabouts, and suggests that he go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her. Suddenly, however, out of a sheer malicious impulse, he also tells {{him that he had}} a one-night stand with her.|$|R
