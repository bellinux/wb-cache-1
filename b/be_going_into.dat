The group includes Steven Melnick, a structural engineer, and Dr. Hellura Lyle, CDC employee specializing in pathogens. Scully, however, decides the plan will work better if Doggett acts as her eyes and ears while she analyzes the situation from up in the Transit Control Center. Using cameras and microphones, she will watch and hear what is happening. After the plans are made, Doggett leads the team into the dark tunnel.|$|E

The following Saturday, Liverpool put out a weakened side against Fulham ahead of their semi-final first leg with Chelsea and won 2–0, with Jermaine Pennant and Peter Crouch getting on the scoresheet. On 22 April, Liverpool played Chelsea at Anfield in the Champions League semi-final first leg. Liverpool looked to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the second leg with a 1–0 advantage through Dirk Kuyt, but {{in the final minute}} of stoppage time John Arne Riise accidentally headed a Salomon Kalou cross into his own net, giving Chelsea a slight advantage through the away goal. The next Saturday, at Birmingham City, Liverpool again put out a weakened side before the 2nd leg with Chelsea. Damien Plessis started again, and Liverpool fought back from 2–0 down to 2–2, with Crouch and Benayoun scoring. That point secured fourth spot for Liverpool. The next Wednesday Liverpool played Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final at Stamford Bridge, but lost 3–2 in extra time (4–3 on aggregate), sending Liverpool out of the Champions League.|$|E

500|$|Rogers Hornsby had to {{determine}} who he would put in to replace Haines as pitcher. Although Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a complete game {{the day before and}} may have spent the night drinking, Hornsby decided to trust him after Alexander said he [...] "had it in easy in there" [...] in Game6 and would be ready whenever Hornsby needed him. The first two pitches thrown by Alexander to batter Tony Lazzeri went for a strike and a ball, respectively. On the third pitch, Lazzeri hit a fly ball down the left field line. The ball initially appeared to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the stands for a grand slam, but at the last minute, it curved several feet into the stands in foul territory. Alexander then threw a fastball that Lazzeri swung late at and missed for strike three, ending the inning and the Yankees' threat.|$|E
500|$|Before the race, {{there were}} no clear favourites for the gold medal.

She wrote that she expected Lucy Hall (Great Britain), Hewitt and Densham to be strong on the swim leg {{along with a few}} other athletes. Sherwood thought that if that there was a large group of athletes together on the run then many of the competitors would fancy their chances at winning. Sherwood wrote, [...] "Most importantly every athlete will <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the race knowing they have a chance." [...] Sherwood's thoughts were similar to those of New Zealander Kate McIlroy who said, [...] "It’s funny, the women’s race seems at the moment there is probably 25 girls that could win it on the day." [...] On the website Triathlete Courtney Baird said that the race favourites were Paula Findlay (Canada), Jenkins, Hewitt and Densham.|$|E

[...] While Draper thought this a tragedy at the time, he later looked at it as a great turning point in his career, freeing him for work that would eventually bring him prominence in his profession. [...] Draper was allowed to finish the course, after which one of his older classmates, Dr. Hugh Cumming, was put in charge of a scientific study of shellfish and water pollution. [...] Cumming then put Draper in charge of a small laboratory in Colonial Beach, Virginia where he spent the next year studying the bacteriological contamination of oysters in the Potomac River. [...] Since both Washington D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia dumped their raw sewage into the river, Draper was to answer the question of whether oysters were affected 68 miles downstream. [...] He discovered that the pollution had been neutralized by natural processes much further upstream, and thus had no effect where he ran most of his tests. [...] The study was important to ease fears that pollution might be affecting the extensive oyster beds near Point Lookout, Maryland, much further downstream.|$|E
