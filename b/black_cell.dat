25|$|Racial {{minorities}} use {{cell phones}} {{more often than}} any other device to connect to the Internet. In 2010, 76% of Hispanic, 79% of Black, and 85% of White adults were using cell phones. 34% of White cell phone owners, 40% of Hispanic cell phone owners, and 51% of <b>Black</b> <b>cell</b> phone owners use their phones to access the Internet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I grant thee pardon," [...] {{said the}} knight, [...] "but tell thee plainly, an thou dost face me so again, I will truly send thee to the <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> for a week. Now get thee away." ...|$|E
60|$|One day Otto stood uncertainly at {{the doorway}} of {{a room in the}} {{imperial}} castle, hesitating before he entered; and yet there was nothing so very dreadful within, only one poor girl whose heart fluttered more than his. Poor little Pauline, whom he had not seen since that last day in the <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> at Trutz-Drachen.|$|E
5000|$|Corollary: there {{cannot be}} a {{continuous}} path, using either vertical, horizontal or diagonal steps, of white cells from one cell {{lying on the}} edge of the board to a different cell like that, that encloses some <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> inside, because otherwise, the <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> won't be connected.|$|R
5000|$|No two <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> may be {{horizontally}} or vertically adjacent.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{discusses}} a new architecture for {{a cellular}} elastic solid with a chess board structure, consisted from {{positive and negative}} stiffness materials. The negative stiffness mechanism is {{defined in terms of}} the Eshelbyâ€™s steps: 1) remove the <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> BC from the composite and allow them to undergo a stress-free biaxial deformation in the [111] direction, becoming trigonal; 2) apply a surface biaxial traction to the <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> BC and the white cells WC to bring the <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> BC back into the matrix, by assuring the continuity of displacements and normal stresses across the boundaries. The properties of such materials are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> {{must not}} cover {{an area of}} 2x2 cells or larger.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> {{cannot be}} {{surrounded}} by black cells. This is equivalent to saying that the black 7-cell hexagon shape is not allowed.|$|E
50|$|Most recipes produce red keratin {{and muscle}} fibers, {{blue or green}} {{collagen}} and bone, light red or pink cytoplasm, and dark brown to <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei.|$|E
50|$|There may be <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> {{that are}} not {{accounted}} for by the indicative cells.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cells</b> do {{not touch}} each other orthogonally (they do not share a side).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> of {{the board}} (including the 0-cells) must form a single edge-connected cluster.|$|R
50|$|Light Up {{is played}} on a {{rectangular}} grid of white and black cells. The player places light bulbs in white cells such that no two bulbs shine on each other, until the entire grid is lit up. A bulb sends rays of light horizontally and vertically, illuminating its entire row and column unless its light is blocked by a <b>black</b> <b>cell.</b> A <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> may have a number on it from 0 to 4, indicating how many bulbs must be placed adjacent to its four sides; for example, a cell with a 4 must have four bulbs around it, one on each side, and a cell with a 0 cannot have a bulb next to any of its sides. An unnumbered <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> may have any number of light bulbs adjacent to it, or none. Bulbs placed diagonally adjacent to a numbered cell do {{not contribute to the}} bulb count.|$|E
5000|$|... (key) (Races in bold {{indicate}} pole position; {{races in}} italics indicate fastest lap. An empty <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> {{indicates that the}} class did not compete at that particular championship round.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Any segment {{travelling}} {{from a black}} circle {{must travel}} two cells in that direction without intersecting {{another part of the}} loop or the outer border; each <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> must have two such segments at a right angle. The logical combination of those two statements is that if a segment from a <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> cannot be drawn in some orthogonal direction, a segment in the opposite direction must be drawn. For example, if one cannot legally travel up two cells from a black circle, then the loop must travel down from that black circle for two cells. This has two common results: ...|$|E
5000|$|There must be {{only one}} sea, which {{is not allowed to}} contain [...] "pools", i.e. 2x2 areas of <b>black</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Cell</b> death (<b>black</b> <b>cells</b> in the simulation) impacts {{the balance}} of the {{proliferation}} rate, and can potentially influence the migration direction.|$|R
5000|$|Each cell {{containing}} a non-zero number is considered white {{and must be}} part of an edge-connected cluster of exactly that many white cells (including the numbered cell). The white clusters are enclosed by <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> or the edge of the board. Thus, a cell {{containing a}} '1' must be enclosed by <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> and/or the game board, a cell containing a '2' must have one edge-connected neighboring white cell, etc. White clusters cannot contain more than one number.|$|R
50|$|Any {{number that}} has two {{identical}} numbers {{on opposite sides}} of itself cannot be black, because one of the two identical numbers must be black, and it cannot be adjacent to another <b>black</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
50|$|The body is {{dark brown}} {{with a wide}} white band across the abdomen. The wings are dark brown. The forewing has a <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> spot and three white spots near the pale brown {{marginal}} area.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 45 - 48 mm. The upperside is white. The forewing has black wedges at {{the apex}} and outer margins and a <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> spot. The female forewing markings are more diffuse, with additional postmedian black spots. Adults are on wing year round in Baja California. They feed on flower nectar.|$|E
50|$|Results to {{the right}} and top of the <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> are first round games, those to the left and below are second round games.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> {{cannot be}} adjacent, {{although}} {{they can be}} diagonal to one another. The remaining numbered cells must be all connected to each other.|$|R
5000|$|Symmetry Heyawake {{is played}} like Heyawake, but clues {{indicate}} whether {{the pattern of}} <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> in a room is rotationally symmetric around its centre or not.|$|R
50|$|For each {{indicative}} cell, its number {{indicates the}} count of the black cells that lie in that row or column {{in the direction of}} its arrow. Indicative cells can never be black, and do not count as a <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> for the purpose of satisfying other indicative cells, although the loop cannot pass through them.|$|E

In 2010, 76% of Hispanic, 79% of Black, and 85% of White adults were using cell phones. 34% of White cell phone owners, 40% of Hispanic cell phone owners, and 51% of <b>Black</b> <b>cell</b> phone owners use their phones to access the Internet.|$|E
50|$|Masson's trichrome is (as {{the name}} implies) a three-colour {{staining}} protocol. The recipe {{has evolved from}} Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding connective tissue. Most recipes produce red keratin and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of collagen and bone, light red or pink staining of cytoplasm, and <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei.|$|E
50|$|Like sudoku, the solver must {{fill the}} {{remaining}} white cells with numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to n in puzzles with N cells per side) such that each {{row and column}} contains unique digits. Whereas Sudoku has the additional constraint of 3x3 boxes, in Str8ts rows and columns are divided by <b>blacks</b> <b>cells.</b> Additional clues are set {{in some of the}} <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> - these numbers remove that digit as an option in the row and column. Such digits do not form part of any straight.|$|R
5000|$|Rule 5 is the {{defining}} {{rule of the}} puzzle; <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> must be placed to prevent any (orthogonal) lines of white cells that cross two room borders ("spanners").|$|R
5000|$|All <b>black</b> <b>cells</b> must {{eventually}} be connected. If {{there is a}} black region with only one possible way to connect {{to the rest of}} the board, the sole connecting pathway must be black.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 38 - 51 mm. The {{upper surface}} of the males is lemon yellow with a dark wide border cut by yellow veins. Females are often white, with a small <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> spot. The border is incomplete or lacking. The underside of both sexes is dirty green. Adults are on wing from June to August. They feed on flower nectar.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 45 - 57 mm. The body is reddish {{brown with}} a wide white band across the abdomen. The forewing upperside is reddish brown with a <b>black</b> <b>cell</b> spot and three white spots near the gray marginal area. A pale streak runs from the cell spot to the inner margin of the wing. The hindwing upperside is dark brown.|$|E
50|$|Under surface: forewing bearing {{two very}} large rounded ocelli between the medians and two much smaller ones between the upper radial {{and the upper}} median. The {{proximal}} median spots narrow, irregular. Discal spot <b>black.</b> <b>Cell</b> with two very broad white longitudinal bands, posteriorly confluent. Hindwing predominantly red brown with a silver-white median band about 3 mm in breadth. There are three anal ocelli with black irises.|$|E
5000|$|The cipher is a {{transposition}} based grille cipher, {{consisting of}} a grid with 25 columns and 24 rows. Each row contains 10 randomly placed white cells (to be filled with text) and 15 <b>black</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
