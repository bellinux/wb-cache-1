40|$|Thesis (MSc (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Due to the {{inherent}} hazardous characteristics associated with dolomite and development on dolomite, quantification of the stability attributes related to dolomite is essential. In {{large parts of}} South Africa, development on dolomite is inevitable due to the location thereof. The {{purpose of this study}} is to define an implementation framework for decision-making with regards to development on dolomite. The decision-making process is based on a dolomite stability investigation conducted by AGES North West (AGES, 2012) within Sarafina, Ikageng. The results from this study are interpreted by means of a decision support system that is based on the geo-environmental setting of the study area and the geotechnical properties related to the subsurface profile. This includes but is not limited to: Geo-environmental site conditions: • Drainage • Topography • Geophysical conditions • Regional geological conditions • Local geological conditions • Regional groundwater conditions • Local groundwater conditions Geotechnical stability of the dolomite based on the hazard characterisation and evaluation procedures: • Percussion drilling data • Receptacle development • Mobilisation agencies • Potential surface manifestation development space • Nature and mobilisation potential of the <b>blanketing</b> <b>layer</b> • The bedrock morphology These parameters are all inter-related and affect each other in various ways. During the study the importance of site specific observations and interpretations are emphasized. Master...|$|E

In case of numerical analysis by ANSYS program, dominant frequency (DF) was computed by free vibration analysis. Soil mechanic tests for thirteen samples to design IDL formula were carried out. In terms of critical condition for earthquake effect such as resonance, five physical small models were tested using vibrator table under the dominant frequency with scale parameter 1 / 100. As a result, dam was significantly damaged without <b>blanket</b> <b>layer</b> IDL. In order to reduce damage, the best performance was observed using <b>blanket</b> <b>layer</b> (IDL) when this layer was expanded below the reservoir region.

40|$|Crystal-growth {{rates in}} {{amorphous}} fast growth phase-change layers and a FIB processed phase-change {{random access memory}} (PRAM) line cell were measured at various temperatures using in situ heating in a transmission electron microscope. A procedure is presented here that allows the computer controlled detection {{of the position of}} the amorphous-crystalline interface in an image and subsequently, from a time series of images the computer controlled quantification of the pure crystal growth rate is determined. The growth rate (without nucleation) of the fast-growth material in the <b>blanket</b> <b>layers</b> is of interest for comparison with the identical material used in the PRAM line cells. The activation energy for growth in the blanket films as measured by in situ TEM was found to be 3. 0 eV. The activation energy related to the retention times of the PRAM line cells as measured by in situ heating and electrical characterization in a probe station was found to be 2. 7 eV. More interestingly the equivalent retention times calculated for the <b>blanket</b> <b>layers</b> are much higher than the retention times observed for the PRAM line cells; a shift of about 25 oC occurs.

40|$|We present {{metallization}} {{approaches for}} silicon heterojunction solar cells by plating onto a structured seed layer. Our approaches {{do not require}} expensive processing steps or consumables. The process starts with a full area deposition of a dielectric or alternatively a <b>blanket</b> metal <b>layer</b> such as Al onto indium tin oxide (ITO). Next, the grid-shaped seed layer is applied via printing or laser-transfer. An efficiency of 22. 2 % was obtained using a dielectric layer and laser-transfer, outperforming screen-printing by 0. 4 %. Applying Al instead of a dielectric has the advantage that the plating current spreads more homogeneously on the solar cell surface, which is of particular importance for plating on bifacial solar cells.

40|$|Piping {{is one of}} the {{possible}} failure mechanism for dams and levees with a sandy foundation. Water flowing through the foundation causes the onset of grain transport, due to which shallow pipes are formed at the interface of the sandy layer and an impermeable <b>blanket</b> <b>layer.</b> In the past, the mechanism has been investigated predominantly in densely packed sands, in which the process was observed to start at the downstream side (backward erosion). Recently performed experiments in loose sand (van Beek et al. 2009) showed a different failure mechanism (forward erosion). In this article additional experiments of piping in loose sands are described for investigating the relevance of the forward process for practice. In these experiments the type of process was found to be dependent on the presence of shear resistance between sand box cover and top sand grains, that causes grains to be fixed geometrically. Without this shear resistance the process was found to be forward, whereas with this shear resistance the process was found to be backward oriented. The change in degree of fixity and relative density as a result of loading is investigated with electrical density measurements. The experiments show that the forward process is not relevant for levees in practice, in which the cohesive <b>blanket</b> <b>layer</b> causes the sand grains to be fixed properly...|$|R

30|$|The {{sporadic}} layers {{are classified}} into several types {{according to the}} different mechanisms of formation and the latitudes at which they are observed. The development of Es layers is strongly associated with particle precipitation at high latitudes (Kirkwood and Nilsson 2000). At middle and low latitudes, a comprehensive study by Whitehead (1989) {{has shown that the}} E region ionization enhancements can be formed due to vertical shear caused by opposite horizontal neutral winds, which in turn can be driven by gravity waves (Hook 1970; Lanchester et al. 1991; Jayachandran 1991) or tidal motions (Chimmonas 1971). The Es layers formed by wind shear lead to ionization enhancements that block the upper ionosphere to low-frequency radio soundings (Devasia et al. 2004) and may lead to amplitude scintillations at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies (Seif et al. 2015). Therefore, these layers are classified as <b>blanketing</b> <b>layers</b> (Esb) (e.g., Reddy and Devasia 1973, 1981; Rastogi 1997; Devasia et al. 2004). The characteristics of the different types of Es layer observed in different latitudinal sector are summarized by Resende et al. (2013).|$|R

Adelaida Cellars also sources small quantities of grapes from neighboring sites such as The Glenrose Vineyard, a planting that is contiguous to Viking Estate Vineyard.|$|R
30|$|The Es layers formation, at low {{and middle}} latitudes, depends {{essentially}} on the vertical wind shear {{associated with the}} tidal winds. In this process, the metallic ions are strongly Lorentz-forced to move vertically {{and they can be}} converged in a thin layer due to meridional or zonal wind components in opposite directions (Axford 1963; Chimonas and Axford 1968). Since the plasma must remain neutral, the electrons follow the magnetic field lines, which, in turn, allow that a new layer can be created (Haldoupis et al. 2007). Generally, these winds are driven by diurnal, semidiurnal and terdiurnal tides present in the E region (Mathews 1998; Wilkinson et al. 1992; Haldoupis 2011; Oikonomou et al. 2014; Pignalberi et al. 2014). These sporadic E layers are classified as <b>blanketing</b> <b>layers</b> (Esb) (see, for example, Piggot and Rawer 1972) due to their capacity of (partially or totally) blocking the reflection of radio waves from the upper layers. These layers are formed by winds at latitudes away from the magnetic equator and have a major occurrence during the summer due to larger metallic particles entrance in the atmosphere during this period (Haldoupis et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Piping is an {{important}} failure mechanism of flood defense structures. A dike fails due to piping when a head difference causes first the uplift of an inland <b>blanket</b> <b>layer,</b> and subsequently soil erosion due to a ground water flow. Spatial variability of subsoil parameters causes the probability of piping failure to increase, often to unacceptable levels. The general research question is: How can we incorporate spatial variability in a flood defense system design dealing with the piping failure mechanism? The question in solved in three steps: first by quantifying the spatial variability in subsoil parameters, second by assessing the influence of this spatial variability on the piping mechanism and third by analyzing optimal decisions to deal with unacceptable situations. There are two new models presented in this thesis. The first model, is a simple design model that uses historical failures to assess the piping safety. The second model describes the formation of piping erosion paths in spatial variable soils. Especially the second model might potentially lead to improvements in piping modeling and potentially in cost reductions. The main conclusions from this thesis is that the piping mechanism and influence of spatial variability in the subsoil are a very significant threat to flood defenses. However, performing local soil measurements in combination with local dike improvements can be a cost-effective method to deal with unacceptable piping failure probabilities.

40|$|Abstract: A {{computer-controlled}} {{procedure is}} outlined here that first determines {{the position of}} the amorphous-crystalline interface in an image. Subsequently, from a time series of these images, the velocity of the crystal growth front is quantified. The procedure presented here can be useful {{for a wide range of}} applications, and we apply the new approach to determine growth rates in a so-called fast-growth-type phase-change material. The growth rate ~without nucleation! of this material is of interest for comparison with identical material used in phase-change random access memory cells. Crystal growth rates in the amorphous phase-change layers have been measured at various temperatures using in situ heating in a transmission electron microscope. Doped SbTe films ~ 20 nm thick! were deposited on silicon nitride membranes, and samples with and without silicon oxide capping layer were studied. The activation energy for growth was found to be 3. 0 eV. The samples without capping layer exhibit a nucleation rate that is an order of magnitude higher than the samples with a silicon oxide capping layer. This difference can be attributed to the partial oxidation of the phase-change layer in air. However, the growth rates of the samples with and without capping are quite comparable.

40|$|An {{innovation}} {{was created}} for the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor for integration of low-temperature detector chips with a silicon backshort and a silicon photonic choke through flipchip bonding. Indium bumps are typically patterned using liftoff processes, which require thick resist. In some applications, {{it is necessary to}} locate the bumps close to high-aspect-ratio structures such as wafer through-holes. In those cases, liftoff processes are challenging, and require complicated and time-consuming spray coating technology if the high-aspect-ratio structures are delineated prior to the indium bump process. Alternatively, processing the indium bumps first is limited by compatibility of the indium with subsequent processing. The present invention allows for locating bumps arbitrarily close to multiple-level high-aspect-ratio structures, and for indium bumps to be formed without liftoff resist. The process uses the poor step coverage of indium deposited on a silicon wafer that has been previously etched to delineate the location of the indium bumps. The silicon pattern can be processed through standard lithography prior to adding the high-aspect-ratio structures. Typically, high-aspectratio structures require a thick resist layer so this layer can easily cover the silicon topography. For multiple levels of topography, the silicon can be easily conformally coated through standard processes. A <b>blanket</b> <b>layer</b> of indium is then deposited onto the full wafer; bump bonding only occurs at the high points of the topography...|$|R

50|$|Practical {{engineering}} designs {{must first}} {{take into account}} safety as the primary goal. All designs should incorporate passive cooling in combination with refractory materials to prevent melting and reconfiguration of fissionables into geometries capable of un-intentional criticality. <b>Blanket</b> <b>layers</b> of Lithium bearing compounds will generally be included {{as part of the}} design to generate Tritium to allow the system to be self-supporting for one of the key fuel element components. Tritium, because of its relatively short half-life and extremely high radioactivity, is best generated on site to obviate the necessity of transportation from a remote location. D-T fuel can be manufactured on site using Deuterium derived from heavy water production and Tritium generated in the hybrid reactor itself. Nuclear spallation to generate additional neutrons can be used to enhance the fission output, with the caveat that this is a tradeoff between the number of neutrons (typically 20-30 neutrons per spallation event) against a reduction of the individual energy of each neutron. This is a consideration if the reactor is to use natural Thorium as a fuel. While high energy (0.17c) neutrons produced from fusion events are capable of directly causing fission in both Thorium and U-238, the lower energy neutrons produced by spallation generally cannot. This is a tradeoff which affects the mixture of fuels against the degree of spallation used in the design.|$|R

The present embodiment of PPP machine employs two polishing wheels, radially spanning the wafer surface on a counter-gimbaled base. The PPP machine is deployed to experimentally investigate the role of the process parameters on the surface roughness evolution, and the effective material removal rate. Two sets of copper and aluminum <b>blanket</b> <b>layers</b> were polished under a range of applied down force, polishing wheel speed and transverse feed rate to examine the scalability of the process parameters for different material constants. The experimental measurements along with the topological details of the polishing pad have been utilized to develop a mechanistic model of the process. The model employs the soft wheel-workpiece macroscopic contact, the polishing wheel roughness and its amplification to the local contact pressure, the kinematics of abrasive grits at the local scale, and the collective contribution of these individual micro-events to induce an effective material removal rate at the macroscale. The model shows the dependence of the material removal on the ratio of wheel rotational to feed speed for the PPP process, in a form of an asymptote that is scaled by the surface hardness of each material. The PPP machine exploits this insight and utilizes an oblique grinding technique that obviates the traditional trade-off between MRR and planarization efficiency...|$|R

The reason Si 0 2 needs to be replaced is the extremely high levels of leakage current displayed in ultrathin layers required for sub- 90 nm CMOS. The main part of the thesis consists of an electrical characterisation section, where the layers are evaluated in terms of their electrical reliability when fabricated into MOS devices, so as to determine their maximum operating voltage and performance during expected device lifetime. Techniques used include constant voltage stress, constant current stress, ramped voltage stress, charge pumping to determine interface state densities and stress induced leakage current measurements. Conventional methods of determining reliability are also evaluated.

40|$|With CMOS scaling emerging, new {{materials}} are {{being introduced to}} maintain performance enhancement in line with Moore’s law. Currently, many candidate materials are under investigation to address the workfunction tuning issue in the future generation of transistors. According to the literature [1], {{some of the most}} likely candidates to be used as metal gate electrodes include Titanium based materials like TiN, Tantalum based materials like TaN, Mo and Ru. One common property of all these materials is their global outstanding corrosion resistance to chemicals used in wafer cleaning. These materials can be implemented in an integration scheme where thin metal layers are inserted between the high-k dielectric and the PolySilicon (PolySi) electrode during the gate stack formation. As a result, these new metal gates create a risk of galvanic enhanced corrosion at the gate electrode level during wet cleaning or etching. Formerly the galvanic corrosion was encountered only in the back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) structures for instance between the copper interconnects and the metal barrier [2]. This problem was recently reported during the silicon oxide hardmask removal on the top of PolySi/metal transistors in dilute HF where PolySi was suffering enhanced corrosion upon coupling to metal gates [3].

In order to better understand some of the details within MLI design and construction, GRC has been investigating the heat loads caused by multiple types of seams. To date testing has been completed with 20 layer and 50 <b>layer</b> <b>blankets.</b> Although a truly seamless blanket is not practical, a blanket lay-up where each individual layer was overlapped and tapped together was used as a baseline for the other seams tests. Other seams concepts tested included: an overlap where the complete blanket was overlapped on top of itself; a butt joint were the blankets were just trimmed and butted up against each other, and a staggered butt joint where the seam in the out layers is offset from the seam in the inner layers. Measured performance is based on a preliminary analysis of rod calibration tests conducted prior to the start of seams testing. Baseline performance for the 50 <b>layer</b> <b>blanket</b> showed a measured heat load of 0. 46 Watts with a degradation to about 0. 47 Watts in the seamed blankets. Baseline performance for the 20 <b>layer</b> <b>blanket</b> showed a measured heat load of 0. 57 Watts. Heat loads for the seamed tests are still begin analyzed. So far analysis work has suggested the need for corrections due to heat loads from both the heater leads and the instrumentation wires. A careful re-examination of the calibration test results with these factors accounted for is also underway. This presentation will discuss the theory of seams in MLI, our test results to date, and the uncertainties in our measurements...|$|R
