5|$|In 1282, {{war with}} Wales broke out again; {{this time it}} would not <b>be</b> <b>simply</b> a punitive campaign, but a {{full-scale}} war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted {{to fight the war}} with paid forces, but the nobility insisted {{on the use of the}} feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 129495, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.|$|E
50|$|Ayer defines {{truth as}} the {{criterion}} by which empirical propositions are validated. To {{say that a}} proposition <b>is</b> true <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> to assert it, {{and to say that}} a proposition <b>is</b> false <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> to assert a contradictory proposition. Thus, truth and falsehood <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> signs of assertion or denial of empirically verifiable propositions.|$|R

5|$|Kings did {{not rule}} alone, but rather governed {{together}} with the leading churchmen and nobles. While Northumbria lacks the body of charters which {{shed light on the}} institutions of the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, sufficient evidence survives for historians to reconstruct some aspects of Northumbrian political life. The evidence for Northumbria survives largely in Latin documents, and these use the words dux and patricius to describe the leading noblemen of the kingdom. The word dux is usually translated by the Old English word ealdorman. The historian Alan Thacker estimates that there were about eight men holding the title of dux in late Northumbria. The title patricius is usually translated as patrician, which ultimately means noble, but in the latter days of the Roman Empire represented a high-ranking position, second only to the emperor. The meaning of the title in Northumbria is unclear, but it appears that there was only one patricius. While it may <b>be</b> <b>simply</b> an alternative to dux, it might represent a position approximating to that of the Mayor of the Palace in late Merovingian Francia.|$|E
