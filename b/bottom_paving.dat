40|$|The {{widely used}} low {{pressure}} culverts are operated in the drop range between 1. 5 and 5. 0 meters. They distinguish by the near critical pairing mode of bays: in the downstream the true hydraulic jump does not develop. In {{this case the}} undular hydraulic jump develops in the downstream. Article {{is devoted to the}} issues of the improvement of <b>bottom</b> <b>paving</b> structures in low pressure constructions and the technology of its erecting. Features of controlling the near-critical flows arising during the operation are analyzed. Possible ways of technology improvement of structures are given illustrated by the example of <b>bottom</b> <b>paving</b> structures with guide elements. Results of hydraulic researches validating this construction are given...|$|E

60|$|Smoke, {{with the}} dog-team, turned south. His quest was Surprise Lake and the mythical Two Cabins. His {{traverse}} was {{to cut the}} headwaters of the Indian River and cross the unknown region over the mountains to the Stewart River. Here, somewhere, rumour persisted, was Surprise Lake, surrounded by jagged mountains and glaciers, its <b>bottom</b> <b>paved</b> with raw gold. Old-timers, it was said, whose very names were forgotten in the frosts of earlier years, had dived into the icy waters of Surprise Lake and fetched lump-gold to the surface in both hands. At different times, parties of old-timers had penetrated the forbidding fastness and sampled the lake's golden bottom. But the water was too cold. Some died in the water, being pulled up dead. Others died later of consumption. And one who had gone down never did come up. All survivors had planned to return and drain the lake, yet none had ever gone back. Disaster always smote them. One man fell into an air-hole below Forty Mile; another was killed and eaten by his dogs; a third was crushed by a falling tree. And so the tale ran. Surprise Lake was a hoodoo; its location was unremembered; and the gold still <b>paved</b> its undrained <b>bottom.</b>|$|R

50|$|The smaller, {{circular}} cairn was excavated {{up to its}} foundations. A slab covering {{was found}} in the cavity as grave robbers appeared to have tried robbing the tomb's interior. It revealed a trapezoidal slab-built cist of 4 ft in length with a <b>paved</b> <b>bottom.</b> The cist has a rubble stone lining, partly surviving. The ring is 15 ft in diameter; compared to the large sized boulder setting, it is indicative that an outer circular enclosure wall existed at one time.|$|R
40|$|To {{predict the}} {{inception}} of sediment motion, Shields diagram remains {{the most widely used}} criterion in engineering practice so far. However, this approach faces several limitations and a number of gaps in knowledge still remain. The present research aims to provide new knowledge about {{the inception of}} motion in rivers with coarse sediments. A series of experiments was conducted in a flume horizontal 6 m long and 15 cm wide. The <b>bottom</b> was <b>paved,</b> either entirely or partly, with gravels of approximately 12 mm in diameter. Ultrasonic sensors were used to measure the water depth, a flowmeter for the discharge, an ultrasonic velocity profiler (UVP) transducer for the flow velocity. Three different thresholds were defined to distinguish between the following states: no motion, vibration of stones, local motion, and large scale motion. The overwhelming influence of turbulence was emphasized by the conducted tests. This paper details the results of these experiments and demonstrates the need for further research in order to better quantify these effects. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|The park's popular {{landmark}} and namesake was the natural, spring-fed Linden Lake, {{which was}} originally a watering hole {{for the village}} livestock. As the population grew, ice-skating became a popular winter activity. In 1912, the lake was drained for cleaning, the fish and turtles temporarily moved to other parks. All mud and stones were removed; the lake <b>bottom</b> was <b>paved</b> in concrete, and a fountain was installed {{in the center of}} the lake. The restored lake was only 2 ft deep, to prevent drowning from skating on thin ice. Also that year, a memorial was erected in honor of Hugo E. Kruse, a local resident who was killed in the explosion of the [...] in Havana, Cuba, which triggered the Spanish-American War. In 1917, the onset of World War I overshadowed memories of the Spanish-American War, and today, only a plaque under the park's flagpole remains to commemorate the American fighters killed in that war, including Kruse.|$|R

40|$|The major {{topographic}} features, or provinces, {{beyond the}} continental slope off the Atlantic {{coast of the}} United States are (1) Sohm Plain, (2) Hatteras Plain, (3) Nares Plain, (4) Blake Basin, (5) Blake Plateau-Bahama Banks, and (6) Bermuda Rise. The whole of the described area is {{commonly referred to as}} the North American Basin. This basin is bounded on the north by Newfoundland Ridge and on the south by Puerto Rico Trench. Topographic features of note within the basin are the divide and the area of depressions between Sohm and Hatteras Plains, the sharply crested Blake Ridge, and the Puerto Rico Ridge. Recently accumulated data on deep-sea oores has given good evidence that the silt and sand covering the abyssal plains are displaced continental sediments in a virtually quartz-free oceanic environment. These sediments were deposited on a primary volcanic bottom. The primary or volcanic bottom is characterized by abyssal hills and seamounts, and the sediment bottom is characterized by abyssal plains, which extend seaward from the continental margins. On the Blake Plateau, bottom photographs and dredge hauls in the axis of the stream show that locally sediment has been removed and the <b>bottom</b> is <b>paved</b> with crusts and nodules of manganese. Photographs and dredged samples from the outer part of the New England Seamount, Chain and Caryn Peak also indicate extensive encrustations of manganese oxide which acts as a binding agent in areas of ooze or other organic debris and thus helps to stabilize the bottom...|$|R
60|$|Third. When he saith {{that the}} street {{of the city}} was pure gold, he alludes to the floor in Solomon's temple, which was {{overlaid}} with gold (1 Kings 6:30). He alludes to Solomon's chariot also, whose <b>bottom</b> was <b>paved</b> with love, and overlaid with gold (Can 3:10). By the floor of the temple, we are to understand the way of holiness; and by the chariot of Solomon, the triumphant glory of that way. Again, in that he saith this street is gold, he would have us to understand the worth and treasure that is laid up in the ways of God, and of a truly gracious heart. First for the worth and treasure that is laid up in the ways of God. They beget light (Psa 119:130), they change the heart, they lead from death, the devil, and hell, to life, God, and the kingdom of heaven (Psa 119:9; Pro 2). In them God walks, and those that walk there also are sure to meet with him (Isa 64:5). O this way, it is the way which 'no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen'; 'It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.--The gold and the crystal cannot equal it; and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. No mention shall be made of coral or of pearls; for the price of wisdom is above rubies' (Job 28:7,15-18,28). All the ways of God they are pleasantness, and all his paths are peace, and ought to be preferred before our necessary food (Pro 3:17).|$|R
60|$|It {{is a very}} {{agreeable}} place: not striking as to scenery, {{but with}} a pleasant rural aspect. A stone bridge of five arches crosses the river Severn (which is the communication between Windermere Lake and Morecambe Bay) close to the house, which sits low--and well sheltered {{in the lap of}} hills,--an old-fashioned inn, where the landlord and his people have a simple and friendly way of dealing with their guests, and yet provide them with all sorts of facilities for being comfortable. They load our supper and breakfast tables with trout, cold beef, ham, toast, and muffins; and give us three fair courses for dinner, and excellent wine, the cost of all which remains to be seen. This {{is not one of the}} celebrated stations among the lakes; but twice a day the stage-coach passes from Milnethorpe towards Ulverton, and twice returns, and three times a little steamer passes to and fro between our hotel and the head of the lake. Young ladies, in broad-brimmed hats, stroll about, or row on the river in the light shallops, of which there are abundance; sportsmen sit on the benches under the windows of the hotel, arranging their fishing-tackle; phaetons and post-chaises, with postilions in scarlet jackets and white breeches, with one high-topped boot, and the other leathered far up on the leg to guard against friction between the horses, dash up to the door. Morning and night comes the stage-coach, and we inspect the outside passengers, almost face to face with us, from our parlor-windows, up one pair of stairs. Little boys, and J----- among them, spend hours on hours fishing in the clear, shallow river for the perch, chubs, and minnows that may be seen flashing, like gleams of light over the flat stones with which the <b>bottom</b> is <b>paved.</b> I cannot answer for the other boys, but J----- catches nothing.|$|R
40|$|U radu se raspravlja o obzidanoj lokvi Krušovici kao unikatnom spomeniku tradicijskog graditeljstva na otoku Visu. Svojim nazivom lokva koji se sačuvao u narodu svjedoči o davnoj prošlosti otoka u kojoj je danas zaboravljeno stočarstvo bilo značajna grana privređivanja, a svojim oblikom svjedoči o transformacijama otočke ekonomije polovicom devetnaestog stoljeća u kojima je u novoj funkciji bunara imala značajno mjesto u komiškoj tradicijskoj kulturi. In {{the medieval}} {{economy of the}} island of Vis, along with {{agriculture}} and fishing, livestock breeding was an important branch of earning. Over time, livestock breeding has been declining, although {{in the middle of}} the 19 th century, cheese was one of the island’s major export products. At the end of the 19 th and in the 20 th century, livestock breeding completely vanished from the island. Two ponds registered in an Austrian cadastral survey in the first part of the 19 th century testify about the livestock landscape of the island of Vis; the pond in Velo polje and Krušovica pond. Krušovica pond is particularly interesting since the transformation of the island’s economy transformed it as well, adapting it to the new function. Krušovica pond was created as a natural accumulation of rainwater on the clay ground of the Krušovica hill between Podhumlje and Dračevo field. It is laid on the pastures, far away from the village. During the time of the island’s economy transformation when livestock breeding gave way to viticulture and fishing, the pond was further deepened and reinforced with a dry-wall base, the <b>bottom</b> was <b>paved</b> with stone plates, and stairs for descending into the water were built on three sides. It was transformed into a well, the water of which was used for washing laundry by people from Podhumlje, Žena Glava, and Duboka. The fact that Krušovica pond was given a special cadastral number (parcel) and that it was noted in blue in 1834 on the cadastral map, indicates that it was reinforced before (or during) the making of the Austrian cadastre. Three paths lead to Krušovica. Every village had its own access to Krušovica and its own stairs for descending into the water, i. e. its own place next to the pond. Krušovica is a unique monument of traditional architecture on the island of Vis. Its name "pond" (lokva, in Croatian) which was preserved among people, testifies about the ancient past of the island in which now-forgotten livestock breeding was an important branch of earning, while with its shape it testifies about the transformations of the island’s economy {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century in which, in its new function as a well, it had a significant place in the traditional culture of Komiža...|$|R
