5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on the topic is left to be done, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> lesson to be learnt is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic.

25|$|The {{defeat of}} Lempira's revolt, the {{establishment}} of the bishopric (first at Trujillo, then at Comayagua after Pedraza's death), and the decline in fighting among rival Spanish factions all contributed to expanded settlement and increased economic activity in the 1540s. A variety of agricultural activities was developed, including cattle ranching and, for a time, the harvesting of large quantities of sarsaparilla root. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> economic activity of 16th-century Honduras was mining gold and silver.|$|E
25|$|The 2CV {{used the}} fixed-profile convertible, where {{the doors and}} upper side {{elements}} of its bodywork remain fixed, while its fabric soft top can be opened. This reduces weight and lowers the centre of gravity, and allows the carrying of long or irregularly shaped items, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> reason was that fabric was cheaper than steel which was in short supply and expensive after the war.

25|$|When the Finnish Civil War {{broke out}} at the end of January 1918, all {{production}} was stopped, just like in all factories of Southern Finland. The last salaries were paid on 5 February, and the white-collar workers left the plant for few days later, after taking all the important documents into a safe place.

25|$|Lost both {{practice}} matches to New Zealand and Pakistan, Sri Lanka {{entered into}} the Super 10 stage as the underdogs, not as the defending champions. First match was against Afghanistan, where they batted first and scored 153/7 in 20 overs with brilliant fifty by afghan captain Asghar Stanikzai. Sri Lanka started the chasing with a magnificent start, where they took 41 runs in powerplay. Chandimal eventually got out for 18 runs and Thirimanne also backed him in to pavilion after scored 6 runs. Thisara Perera and Chamara Kapugedera scored some shots, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> performance came from the veteran Tillakaratne Dilshan.

25|$|Új Előre (New Forward) (1921–1937) — Új Előre was a Communist Party-sponsored {{publication}} {{from the}} outset and it gave great attention to the ongoing situation in Hungary {{in the aftermath of}} the failed 1919 Hungarian Revolution. The publication was nominally edited by an American citizen, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> editorial work was done by an editorial board dominated by emigrants from Soviet Hungary, including Lajos Köves, János Lassen, and Lajos Bebrits. In 1931 the publication was moved from New York City to Cleveland, a decision which was reversed in 1937. Economic problems combined with a desire to remake the publication as a less partisan Popular Front newspaper led to its discontinuation in 1937 in favor of the weekly Amerikai Magyar Világ.|$|E
500|$|Maura O'Malley of Bustle also lauded the {{development}} of the character ahead of season 12 saying, [...] "When the series began, Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life. She had graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. Hopefully, the new season of Grey's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman — and she will be just fine." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bible usually {{uses the}} name of God in the {{singular}} (e.g., [...] or [...] ), generally using the terms in a very general sense rather than referring to any special designation of God.

2500|$|The Holocene began about 10,000 years ago. It is {{the current}} interglacial period, and it {{has proven to be}} a {{relatively}} stable environment of the Earth. There have been natural environmental fluctuations during the Holocene, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable. This stability and resilience has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive. According to Rockström et al., we [...] "have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life, and how we have organized society, technologies, and economies around them, that we must take the range within which Earth System processes varied in the Holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state." ...|$|E
2500|$|Any form {{of cooking}} will destroy some {{nutrients}} in food, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> variables are {{how much water}} {{is used in the}} cooking, how long the food is cooked, and at what temperature. Nutrients are primarily lost by leaching into cooking water, which tends to make microwave cooking healthier, given the shorter cooking times it requires. [...] Like other heating methods, microwaving converts vitamin B12 from an active to inactive form; the amount of conversion depends on the temperature reached, as well as the cooking time. Boiled food reaches a maximum of [...] (the boiling point of water), whereas microwaved food can get locally hotter than this, leading to faster breakdown of vitamin B12. The higher rate of loss is partially offset by the shorter cooking times required.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, {{there are}} several events, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> element is the control of three to six sheep by one or two highly trained dogs {{under the control of}} a single handler. Both time and {{obedience}} play a part, as competitors are penalized if a sheep strays from the prescribed course. [...] Another popular event involves having the dog split six sheep into two groups of three and conducting each group in turn to small pens through a defined course by heading dogs. The group not being led is guarded by one of the two dogs, an eye-dog (from its ability to keep the sheep still by head movement alone). This is more difficult than it sounds because the two groups of sheep invariably try to stay together.|$|E

2500|$|Conceptually, {{fraudulent}} {{trading is}} similar to a fraudulent conveyance, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> distinction is that an application to have a transaction set aside as a fraudulent conveyance usually requires to the third party beneficiary to disgorge the benefit of the conveyance to undo the loss to the company's assets, whereas a court order in relation to fraudulent trading it is the responsible parties (usually the directors) who must make up the loss and the third party beneficiaries will usually retain the benefit. [...] However, it is perfectly possible for a single transaction to be simultaneously fraudulent trading and a fraudulent conveyance, and to be the subject on concurrent applications. [...] Some legal systems permit a director who makes a contribution to the company's assets pursuant to an order for fraudulent trading to subrogated to any claim that the company might have with respect to a fraudulent conveyance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s [...] and early 1950s, Leslie Collier, an English {{microbiologist}} {{working at the}} Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, developed a method for producing a heat-stable freeze-dried vaccine in powdered form. Collier added 0.5% phenol to the vaccine {{to reduce the number}} of bacterial contaminants <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> stage was to add 5% peptone to the liquid vaccine before it was dispensed into ampoules. This protected the virus during the freeze drying process. After drying the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen. Like other vaccines, once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1–2 [...] days at ambient temperatures. However, the dried vaccine was 100% effective when reconstituted after 6 months storage at [...] allowing it to be transported to, and stored in, remote tropical areas. Collier's method was increasingly used and, with minor modifications, became the standard for vaccine production adopted by the WHO Smallpox Eradication Unit when it initiated its global Smallpox Eradication Campaign in 1967, at which time 23 of 59 manufacturers were using the Lister strain.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:00 A.M. on 11 May, Billotte {{diverted}} {{most of the}} French 23rd Fighter Group (Fighter Groupement 23) {{to cover}} the advance of the First Army and its neighbouring units. After more fighters had been removed for bomber escort missions, few fighters were left to cover the cavalry. The Allied bombers concentrated on retarding the dangerous advance of Hoepner's Panzers. Prioux's ground reconnaissances fell back before the Panzers, toward {{the main body of}} French cavalry, which was established in strongpoints along a 40km front with the 2d DLM from Huy on the Meuse and north, then westward along the Mehaigne creek. The 3d DLM formed a front from the area of Crehen to Orp and then northward along the Petite Gette stream to the area of Tirlemont. The battleground which Prioux chose consisted of a plateau with occasional woods, a dense road network, extended localities and a few isolated large farms. The Mehaigne and Petite Gette were small streams flowing within two-to-three-meter-deep rock cuts with many crossing points, often fordable by tracked vehicles, and offering good cover for would-be infiltrators. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> terrain feature was the ridge running from Hannut through Crehen and Merdorp. [...] North of the ridge, the Petite Gette flowed north into the Escaut river, south of it, the Mehaigne flowed south into the Meuse. This ridge formed a natural corridor for mechanized forces.|$|E
