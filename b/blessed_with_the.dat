There are two important protected areas {{in the region that}} are a home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, people of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals.|$|E

Brazil has played host to many an ASP tour event over the past 30 years. Former contest sites include Rio de Janeiro, Barra de Tijuca and Saquarema, but the past four years have seen the tour set up shop in Florianópolis.|$|E

Old women could be seen early in the mornings topping and tailing bean sprouts, the skins of frogs being peeled, the newly killed snakes being skinned and the centuries-old panaceas being dispensed by women <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> power of healing.|$|E

The black border around the yellow cross signifies the black death that came to our shores and nearly wiped out the population but through our resilience as a people we overcame that threat and made us the proud people we are today.|$|E

500|$|Writing about Cher's musical output {{during the}} 1960s, Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Rock was {{subsequently}} <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> staggering blues exclamations of Janis Joplin {{in the late}} '60s and the raw poetic force of Patti Smith in the mid-'70s. Yet no one matched the pure, seductive wallop of Cher". By contrast, her vocal performances during the 1970s were described by Eder as [...] "dramatic, highly intense... almost as much 'acted' as sung". First heard in the 1980 record Black Rose, Cher employed sharper, more aggressive vocals in her hard rock-oriented albums, establishing her sexually confident image. For the 1995 album It's a Man's World, she restrained her vocals, singing in higher registers and without vibrato.|$|E

500|$|The player's {{character}} {{takes on}} the role of an adventurer in Eorzea under the Seventh Umbral Era who joins one of the three Grand Companies. The Order of the Twin Adder, Gridania's Grand Company, is led by Elder Seedseer Kan-E-Senna, an even-headed child of the forest who is <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> power of prophecy. Ul'dah's Immortal Flames are led by Flame General Raubahn Aldynn, a Highlander from Ala Mhigo and bodyguard of reigning sultana Nanamo Ul Namo. Raubahn climbed out of poverty through his martial skill while fighting in the Coliseum. The Maelstrom of Limsa Lominsa is led by Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, a cunning former pirate who instituted a harsh conscription service to bring the pirate fleets under her command. Other allies include Minfilia and her Scions of the Seventh Dawn, an organization formed from the union of the Path of the Twelve and Archon Louisoix's Circle of Knowing which were active during the Sixth Astral Era. Members include Thancred, Yda, Papalymo, Urianger, and Y'shtola, the last of whom represents Final Fantasy XIV in crossover games such as [...] and Dissidia Final Fantasy. Louisoix's twin grandchildren, Alphinaud and Alisaie, travel from Sharlayan following in his footsteps to attempt to aid the nations of Eorzea. Finally, Cid Garlond {{is the head of the}} Garlond Ironworks, a technology company which builds airships and weapons for the Alliance.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with all}} of her {{previous}} releases, Zola Jesus's vocals and delivery in Conatus have been unanimously praised by critics. Frank Mojica of Consequence of Sound argued that [...] "ome singers are <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rare sort of voice that's unmistakably theirs, and Nika Roza Danilova is one such artist. Under her stage name Zola Jesus, the opera-trained Danilova has paired vocals that are akin to a siren's call with neo-gothic synths that carry the listener to an often sinister land of mystery." ...|$|E

5000|$|The first blessing, chanted {{before the}} haftarah portion read, {{uses the same}} melody as the haftarah chant itself, also in minor mode. For this reason, many prayerbooks print this first <b>blessing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cantillation marks used in the Bible itself for the books of the Prophets, {{possibly}} the only instance of a non-biblical text to be equipped with such marks.

These records illustrate that during Kulottunga’s time the Cholas had crushed the rebellions of Pandyans and were in complete control of the south. The smaller leyden grant of Kulottunga {{as well as his}} Suchindram temple(in Kanyakumari Dist.) [...] inscription testify this.|$|E
2500|$|Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski criticized Khrushchev in 1978 {{for failing}} to make any {{analysis}} of the system Stalin presided over. [...] "Stalin had simply been a criminal and a maniac, personally to blame for all the nation's defeats and misfortunes. As to how, and in what social conditions, a bloodthirsty paranoiac could for twenty-five years exercise unlimited despotic power over a country of two hundred million inhabitants, which throughout that period had been <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most progressive and democratic system of government in human history—to this enigma the speech offered no clue whatever. All that was certain was that the Soviet system and the party itself remained impeccably pure and bore no responsibility for the tyrant's atrocities." ...|$|E

5000|$|The actual benediction or blessing follows {{exposition}} of the Blessed Sacrament, i.e., the placing of the consecrated Host in a monstrance set upon the altar {{or at least}} {{exposition of}} a ciborium containing the Blessed Sacrament. Thus [...] "the <b>blessing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist is preceded by a reasonable time for readings of the word of God, songs, prayers, and a period for silent prayer", while [...] "exposition merely {{for the purpose of}} giving benediction is prohibited".|$|R
2500|$|A {{few years}} after her mother's death, the father failed in business. Although <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of her sister Elizabeth, Hannah felt [...] the need of adding her share to the family support. She turned to sewing, {{knitting}} and spinning, finding the most profit, however, in weaving bobbin lace. But after the Revolutionary War, when lace was imported, this resource failed, and she was left in a desperate condition. It was {{at this time that}} she found a financial support in teaching Greek and Latin to three young men living in the vicinity of her home. One of these, Pitt Clarke, was afterwards the pastor of the church at Norton, Massachusetts, for over 40 years. In his autobiography published in the [...] "History of Norton," [...] he says, in referring to Adams: [...] "Under her tuition principally I fitted for college, and was admitted into Cambridge University, July, 1786." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{criticisms of}} Makin's An Essay point to {{her use of}} a {{masculine}} persona and her call {{for the education of}} [...] "rich" [...] women and girls. While her use of a masculine persona gives credence to masculine-centered ideologies and confirms that only men are capable of participating in the intellectual debate of the public sphere, taking on a male voice does give Makin more freedom. Also, as Mitzi Myers points out, [...] "the male voice is always there in pro-women writing, whether formally personified or not" [...] (1985:180). Universal educational models for all levels of society are not Makin's aim. Makin's pro-education treatise is directed towards women and girls of means. She alludes {{to the fact that the}} women and girls who should be educated are those [...] "persons that God has <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> things of this world, that have competent natural parts" [...] (Makin 1673). In other words, those that are rich and have spare time may make better use of their time [...] "in gaining arts, and tongues" [...] (Makin 1673), rather than [...] "to trifle away so many precious minutes merely to polish their hands and feet, to curl their locks, to dress and trim their bodies" [...] (Makin 1673).|$|E
2500|$|Michael Wildes from The Christian Manifesto lavished praise {{upon the}} album's unorthodox {{production}} and theologically deep, highly skilled lyricism. He wrote that [...] "it's {{hard to talk}} about such a creative album and do it the justice it deserves", and commented of the album's production that [...] "Talking about organic, your mother's favorite gardening tools can be heard making rhythms and beats on this number." [...] Christian Music Zine's Anthony Peronto praised the chemistry and group dynamic between Beautiful Eulogy's three members. He concluded that With nary a flaw to be found and undeniable growth by each member, Beautiful Eulogy have exceeded all expectations and delivered their best work yet. Though I want to resist repeating my thoughts on Beautiful Eulogy's debut album I can't say {{it any other way}} than this slight paraphrasing: This is the most musically creative hip hop album I've heard since, well... Satellite Kite. Jessica Cooper of Indie Vision Music summarized that All of Instruments of Mercy is fresh in sound, featuring loops of new beats and sounds that stick to the lyrics like glue. Beautiful Eulogy continues to be consistent in their collaborative works and are undoubtedly <b>blessed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> words and musical talent to produce something that's cohesive, poetic, and undeniably beautiful from beginning to end. Jesus Freak Hideout's Mark Rice praised the rapping skills of Odd Thomas and Braille, Courtland Urbano's production, and the lyrical focus of the album. He remarked that [...] "It is hard not to marvel at the sheer talent of these three individuals, whether it is in the crisp vocals, wonderful production, or the dense and theologically provoking lyrics." ...|$|E
50|$|In the Orthodox Church liturgical blessings are {{performed}} over people, objects, or are given at specific points during divine services. A priest or bishop usually <b>blesses</b> <b>with</b> his hand, but may use a blessing cross, candles, an icon, the Chalice or Gospel Book to bestow blessings, always making the Sign of the Cross therewith. When <b>blessing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hand, a priest uses his right hand, holding his fingers {{so that they}} form the Greek letters IC XC, the monogram of Jesus Christ. A bishop does the same, except he uses both hands, or may hold the crozier in his left hand, using both to make the Sign of the Cross. A bishop may also <b>bless</b> <b>with</b> special candlesticks known as the dikirion and trikirion.|$|R

50|$|The rite now {{in force}} for the Latin Church {{requires}} the use of incense {{at the beginning of the}} exposition and before the blessing, if the Blessed Sacrament is exposed in a monstrance, but not if a ciborium is used.
