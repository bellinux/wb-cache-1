5000|$|There {{are many}} methods {{available}} for determining mechanical grain damage. The simplest method involves visible {{inspection of the}} grain. The USDA lists the threshold for <b>broken</b> <b>grain</b> to be anything that will fit through a 12/64 and 8/64 inch round-hole sieve for maize and soybeans respectively as listed above. This does not account to any cracks or defects in the leftover grain itself. In 1976, Chowdhury and Buchele developed a Numerical Damage Index for maize. They proposed a system that characterized the damage to each kernel {{on a scale from}} D1 (no defects) to D5 (very severely damaged). The procedure then takes a weighted average of the amount of kernels assigned to each level to obtain a standardized measure of mechanical damage. This approach is based on visual observations, which carry with them a large amount of variability due to the individual conducting the test. Therefore, other researchers have attempted to measure mechanical damage in more concrete ways. For example, one method is to use a dye that will adhere only to the broken areas of the kernel. From there, the dye is washed off with some type of solvent and measured using a calorimetric technique. [...] A more recently developed technique uses the dielectric properties of the grain to measure the damage level. [...] This method proved to very accurately measure the number of damaged kernels.|$|E

The mechanised thresher was evaluated at various threshing drum speeds (550 rpm, 600 rpm and 650 rpm) and feeding rates (200 kgh– 1, 400 kgh– 1 and 600 kgh– 1). Results showed that threshing was satisfactory at grain moisture content between 16. 9 % w. b. and 18. 0 % w. b. for both rice varieties. Threshing efficiency increased from 94. 6 % to 95. 8 % with {{no significant difference}} observed whereas cleaning efficiency decreased significantly from 84. 2 % to 81. 6 % with increasing feed rate irrespective of rice variety. Again, threshing efficiency increased with increasing drum rotational speed, irrespective of feed rate and rice variety.

Consequently, in artisanal parboiling, the initial soaking temperature should be about 90 C and the steaming time should be more than 8 min, ideally, about 12 min. On cooking, more severely parboiled rice samples had firmer textures than mildly parboiled samples.

40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} {{for three}} P-wave attenuation mechanisms in sedimentary rocks {{are given a}} unified theoretical framework. Two of the models concern wave-induced flow due to heterogeneity in the elastic moduli at mesoscopic scales (scales greater than grain sizes but smaller than wavelengths). In the first model, the heterogeneity is due to lithological variations (e. g., mixtures of sands and clays) with a single fluid saturating all the pores. In the second model, a single uniform lithology is saturated in mesoscopic ''patches'' by two immiscible fluids (e. g., air and water). In the third model, the heterogeneity is at ''microscopic'' grain scales (<b>broken</b> <b>grain</b> contacts and/or micro-cracks in the grains) and the associated fluid response corresponds to ''squirt flow''. The model of squirt flow derived here reduces to proper limits {{as any of the}} fluid bulk modulus, crack porosity, and/or frequency is reduced to zero. It is shown that squirt flow is incapable of explaining the measured level of loss (10 {sup - 2 } < Q{sup - 1 } < 10 {sup - 1 }) within the seismic band of frequencies (1 to 10 {sup 4 } Hz); however, either of the two mesoscopic scale models easily produce enough attenuation to explain the field data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Parboiling {{is a set}} of {{operations}} needed for the production of a gelatinized product. Scientifically it is a thermal treatment process done on rice and other cereals. Water and heat are two essential elements to transform the natural cereal into “parboiled ” cereal. In rice, it is done to produce gelatinized or parboiled rice. Parboiling, if examined carefully has other scientific benefits beyond easy milling and reducing <b>broken</b> <b>grains.</b> Unfortunately, the technology has received little attention in terms of research as far as food processing or preservation is concern. As part of an ongoing research to assess the extent to which parboiling affect the migration of vitamin B 1, a preliminary survey was conducted between October, 2012 and December, 2012 in the three northern regions of Ghana to elucidate the scientific principles behind the practice and to what extend processors understand these principles. This work also aimed at high lighting the practice so as to encourage people to adapt indigenous technologies which may have more beneficial health effects. Eighty (80) processors in the three northern regions drawn by purposive sampling methods were interviewed using structured and semi structured questionnaires. The results showed that 100 % of the people engaged in parboiling business are women with over 70 % of them having no formal education and therefore are unaware of any effects of parboiling on nutritional elements. It became clear that parboiling increased the flavour and taste of the rice thus making it attractive to eat. However, the respondents only mentioned less <b>broken</b> <b>grains,</b> easy dehusking, ease of cooking, increase quantity, better prices, and parboiling being a norm as some of the reasons why they carry out rice parboiling. From the outcome of this survey it’s recommended more studies be done on the subject to ascertain the nutritional impact of the practice. Also, the processors need to b...|$|R

Demonstrable solute gradients occurred only across those tissues of the grain crease between the crease sieve tubes and the endosperm cavity, a distance of just 1 millimeter. However, while the sucrose concentration in the sieve tubes was almost tenfold that in the endosperm cavity sap, total amino acids were only threefold higher, and the potassium concentrations of the two were equal.

Thercfore, {{it is of}} {{paramount}} i*portarr"r to apply appropriate postharvest handting technologies for rice production One of iurrently available technologies is the rice polishing pr*err using a water foggrng syst???m. This system is intended to irnprove upp"**"" (shininess) md physical qualrty of ricc. The reference for quality ui*a*t of rice in Indonesia is the SNI 0 l- 6128 - 1999. The objective {{of this research was}} to deternine the quality of rice produced fiom a milling process which iacorporates a fogging system in the polishing step. Rice samples- were obtained frsm a Cooperative Center in Sidrap regency in South Sulawesi- The samples were analyzed in Processing Laboratory in the Depar. hent- of Agricultural Technology at Hdsanuddin University. Parameters analyzed were moisture conteflt and &e percentage of Whole <b>grains,</b> <b>broken</b> <b>grains,</b> fine grains, red graiq yello#damage grain, and calcified grain. The appearance of tho rice quality of ifr" *o produced oan be classified into grades III, IV, and V of Indonesian p. odirced &om this poliihing process was. bright and shiny. The overall Standard (SNI 0 1 - 61 28 - 1 999) ...|$|R

Experimental work was performed to establish the existence of the unsteady state in the process of ultra-precision grinding with a common abrasive wheel. From the results of the observation of the wheel topography, the whole grinding process in the unsteady state was separated into three stages, namely cutting by grains peaks, micro-cutting by micro-edges of the <b>broken</b> <b>grains,</b> and rubbing without material removal. By utilizing the common abrasive wheel newly redressed to damage the finished surface of silicon nitride and comparing the finished surface with the damaged surface in aspects of their scanning electronic microscope (SEM) pattern and surface roughness, the existence of cutting and micro-cutting actions in the unsteady-state grinding process was confirmed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.
