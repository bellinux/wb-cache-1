50|$|With {{no strong}} central nuclear energy source, the {{interior}} of a brown dwarf is in a rapid boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, convection sets up conditions {{for the development of a}} strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The flare observed by Chandra from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of lightning. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non flaring period is also a significant result. It sets the lowest observational limit on steady X-ray power produced by a <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star,</b> and shows that coronas cease to exist as the surface temperature of a brown dwarf cools below about 2500 °C and becomes electrically neutral.|$|E
5000|$|Randall hypothesizes a {{plane of}} dark matter exists roughly on {{the plane of the}} Milky Way galaxy. As the Sun oscillates in its orbit around the center of the galaxy, it passes through the dark matter. The {{resulting}} gravitational disturbances destabilize bodies in the Oort cloud, resulting in increased Earth impacts, such as the one that caused the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event resulting in the extinction of dinosaurs. Formation of a plane requires that a fraction of the dark matter have different properties than the bulk of it, described by Randall as [...] "dissipative dark matter" [...] in a paper co-authored with Harvard physics professor Matthew Reece. Astrophysicist Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute, while noting the idea is interesting, states the evidence is [...] "far from compelling". Astrophysicist Coryn Bailer-Jones of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and physicist Adrian Melott question the statistical analysis used to determine the periodicity of impacts, with Jones also noting impacts could be from asteroids rather than objects originating in the Oort cloud. Physicist Konstantinos Dimopoulos offers that a proposal from a world-renowned cosmologist is certainly credible, but notes the [...] "need to make dark matter weirder than it already is" [...] violates Occam's razor. Additionally, the Nemesis theory, a currently unseen <b>brown</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> orbiting the Sun, could also explain periodic impacts. Randall rebuts such criticism by noting that it could be [...] "simpler to say that dark matter is like our matter, in that it's different particles with different forces", adding [...] "the other answer is that the world's complicated, so Occam's razor isn't always {{the best way to go}} about things." ...|$|E
