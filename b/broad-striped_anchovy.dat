The <b>Broad-striped</b> <b>anchovy</b> is found in the west Atlantic along the North American coast from Nova Scotia and the Maine coast scarcely, and abundantly from the Chesapeake bay to the West Indies and Uruguay. It is found most commonly in shoals along coastal waters, as deep as 73 m (40 fathoms) although mostly found water more shallow than this. The <b>broad-striped</b> <b>anchovy</b> spawns in spring. Their eggs are pelagic and hatch within 48 hours at regular spring temperatures. At young ages, it eats copepods, but as the fish ages, its diet begins to consist of other small crustaceans, molluscs, and worm larvae. It is an important food staple for large commercial fishes, such as the American seatrout. It is commonly eaten by birds. It is elongate with a large eye and protuberant snout, as well as a large eye, protuberant snout, large mouth and underslung jaw. Its anal fin is quite short and its front fin lies beneath the end of the dorsal fin. It is grey-green with black dots, but its notable feature is its silvery stripe from head to tail.|$|E
