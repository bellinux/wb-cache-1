500|$|Colbert {{spoke in}} the persona of the {{character}} he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of a conservative pundit in the fashion of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. He began by satirizing mass surveillance, joking [...] "If anybody needs anything else at their tables, just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers. Someone from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail." [...] While many of his jokes were directed at President Bush, he also lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, but several segments were lifted—largely unchanged—from The Colbert Report, including parts of the [...] "truthiness" [...] monologue from the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from [...] "the gut" [...] rather than the brain and denounced books as [...] "all fact, no heart". Colbert framed {{this part of the}} speech as though he were agreeing with Bush's philosophies, saying that he and <b>Bush</b> <b>are</b> [...] "not brainiacs on the nerd patrol", implicitly criticizing the way Bush positioned himself as an anti-intellectual.|$|E

2500|$|Evidence of {{numerous}} historical and genealogical links between Bunce Island and the United States has been found. In 2013 historians reported learning that two U.S. presidents, George H.

Their ancestor Thomas Walker (AKA [...] "Beau Walker") came from Bristol, one of Britain's principal slaving ports.

One of his descendants, Dorothy (Walker) Bush, {{was the mother of}} George H.W. Bush.|$|E

6000|$|III. Fear not the heat, though {{full and}} high The sun has {{scorched}} the autumn sky, And scarce a forest straggler now To shade us spreads a greenwood bough; These fields {{have seen a}} hotter day Than e'er was fired by sunny ray, Yet one mile on--yon shattered hedge Crests the soft hill whose long smooth ridge [...] Looks on the field below, And sinks so gently on the dale That not the folds of Beauty's veil [...] In easier curves can flow. Brief space from thence, the ground again Ascending slowly from the plain [...] Forms an opposing screen, Which, with its crest of upland ground, Shuts the horizon all around. [...] The softened vale between Slopes smooth and fair for courser's tread; Not the most timid maid need dread To give her snow-white palfrey head [...] On that wide stubble-ground; Nor wood, nor tree, nor <b>bush</b> <b>are</b> there, Her course to intercept or scare, [...] Nor fosse nor fence are found, Save where, from out her shattered bowers, Rise Hougomont's dismantled towers.|$|E
60|$|Without {{returning}} the salutations of the Bedouins, who loudly summoned {{us to stop}} {{and give them the}} news, we trotted forwards in search of a deserted sheep-fold. At sunset we passed, upon an eminence on our left, the ruins of an ancient settlement, called after its patron Saint, Ao Barhe: and both sides of the mountain road were flanked by tracts of prairie-land, beautifully purpling in the evening air. After a ride of thirty-five miles, we arrived at a large fold, where, by removing the inner thorn-fences, we found fresh grass for our starving beasts. The night was raw and windy, and thick mists deepened into a drizzle, which did not quench our thirst, but easily drenched the saddle cloths, our only bedding. In one sense, however, the foul weather was propitious to us. Our track might easily have been followed by some enterprising son of Yunis Jibril; these tracts of thorny <b>bush</b> <b>are</b> favourite places for cattle lifting; moreover the fire was kept blazing all night, yet our mules were not stolen.|$|E

Innumerable overcoats of the quality prescribed hung empty all day in the corridors, but as the clock struck six each was exactly filled, and the little figures, split apart into trousers or moulded into a single thickness, jerked rapidly with angular forward motion along the pavement; then dropped into darkness. Beneath the pavement, sunk in the earth, hollow drains lined with yellow light for ever conveyed them this way and that, and large letters upon enamel plates represented in the underworld the parks, squares, and circuses of the upper. [...] "Marble Arch--Shepherd's Bush"--to the majority the Arch and the <b>Bush</b> <b>are</b> eternally white letters upon a blue ground. Only at one point--it may be Acton, Holloway, Kensal Rise, Caledonian Road--does the name mean shops where you buy things, and houses, in one of which, down to the right, where the pollard trees grow out of the paving stones, there is a square curtained window, and a bedroom.|$|E

60|$|I {{have just}} said that nature is always imaginative, {{but it does not}} follow that her {{imagination}} is always of high subject, or that the imagination of all the parts is of a like and sympathetic kind; the boughs of every bramble <b>bush</b> <b>are</b> imaginatively arranged, so are those of every oak and cedar; but it does not follow that there is imaginative sympathy between bramble and cedar. There are few natural scenes whose harmonies are not conceivably improvable either by banishment of some discordant point, or by addition of some sympathetic one; it constantly happens that there is a profuseness too great to be comprehended, or an inequality in the pitch, meaning, and intensity of different parts. The imagination will banish all that is extraneous, it will seize out of the many threads of different feeling which nature has suffered to become entangled, one only, and where that seems thin and likely to break, it will spin it stouter, and in doing this, it never knots, but weaves in the new thread, so that all its work looks as pure and true as nature itself, and cannot be guessed from it but by its exceeding simplicity, (known from it, it cannot be,) so that herein we find another test of the imaginative work, that it looks always {{as if it had been}} gathered straight from nature, whereas the unimaginative shows its joints and knots, and is visibly composition.|$|E
