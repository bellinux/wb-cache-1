5|$|Cerny and Flanagan first {{collaborated on}} a video game based on Michael Jackson's Thriller. The project was {{canceled}} and the two began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became Marble Madness. Development lasted 10months. Following the North American video game crash of 1983, video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience {{through the use of}} a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two-player mode. Cerny designed Marble Madness in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by miniature golf and captivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a play field's contours influenced the ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to a race against time.|$|E

30|$|The German {{government}} has still been guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> waste and pollution prevention are the foremost aims {{to develop a}} circular economy. The prevention could be reached by a change of production technologies to cleaner production. Further on the better reuse and recycling of waste and better and more recycling friendly construction of goods are demanded to fulfil higher recycling rates.|$|R
50|$|The {{romantic school}} had as its organ the Conciliatore {{established}} in 1818 at Milan, {{on the staff}} of which were Silvio Pellico, Ludovico di Breme, Giovile Scalvini, Tommaso Grossi, Giovanni Berchet, Samuele Biava, and Alessandro Manzoni. All were influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that,</b> especially in Germany, constituted the movement called Romanticism. In Italy the course of literary reform took another direction.|$|R

25|$|Abruptly {{changing}} the subject, Nancy declares that Charlie believes {{that they are}} dead. She continues to dig into Charlie, sarcastically saying that no wonders are possible. Leslie and Sarah catch on to her meaning, to some degree, but Leslie is confused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> reality is an illusion. When Leslie asks Charlie to explain it, Charlie becomes angry.|$|E
25|$|The Casimir {{effect can}} be {{understood}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the presence of conducting metals and dielectrics alters the vacuum expectation value of {{the energy of the}} second quantized electromagnetic field. Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the Casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.|$|E
25|$|This MPI {{research}} group, {{headed by}} Daniel Haun, investigates {{the social and}} cognitive foundations of human communication in infancy specifically on infants' developing social cognition and social motivation {{in relation to their}} emerging prelinguistic communication within social and cultural contexts. Their work is motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> there is a psychological basis of human communication that develops ontogenetically prior to language and can be first expressed in gestures.|$|E

25|$|The hero {{discovers that}} these beings, who call {{themselves}} Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to transmit information, get rid of pain, and put others to sleep. The narrator is offended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who {{turns out to be}} a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1938, Kirchner became {{increasingly}} {{upset with the}} situation in Germany. After Austria was annexed by Germany in the Anschluss, Kirchner became disturbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Germany might invade Switzerland. On 15 June 1938, Kirchner {{took his own life}} by gunshot in front of his home in Frauenkirch. Three days later, Kirchner was laid to rest in the Waldfriedhof cemetery. Erna continued to live in the house until her death in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Several dozen Italian anarchists {{left the}} United States for Mexico. Some have {{suggested}} {{they did so}} because of cowardice. Nothing could be more false. The idea to go to Mexico arose {{in the minds of}} several comrades who were alarmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that,</b> remaining in the United States, they would be forcibly restrained from leaving for Europe, where the revolution that had burst out in Russia that February promised to spread all over the continent.|$|E

25|$|The {{struggle}} with the world is framed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine {{and give us a}} larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence Mee enthusiastically {{accepted}} {{the position of}} League treasurer in 1977. Remaining as board members were Christiaan M.N.T. Op 't Roodt and Willem P. Roelofs, who were eager to quickly establish a procedure to keep the Stelo's value constant and to publish the result {{within the framework of}} the Esperanto movement. Under the editorship of Op 't Roodt, the Universal League's new periodical Bulteno was guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the value of the Stelo would remain constant, unaffected by inflation.|$|E
25|$|Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) is {{the head}} of the Homicide Division of the San Francisco Police Department. He and Monk have been good friends since Monk was on the police force, and he {{continues}} to be Monk's friend throughout the series. He does his best to help Monk but is occasionally annoyed by Monk's phobias and the damage they can cause. In the first two seasons, Stottlemeyer is reluctant to work with Monk, seemingly annoyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he could not handle his cases himself. By seasons three and four, his faith in Monk's contribution is well-cemented and his collaboration unquestionable.|$|E

50|$|Lexical scoping {{was used}} for ALGOL and has been picked up in most other {{languages}} since then. Deep binding, which approximates static (lexical) scoping, was introduced in LISP 1.5 (via the Funarg device developed by Steve Russell, working under John McCarthy). The original Lisp interpreter (1960) and most early Lisps used dynamic scoping, but descendants of dynamically scoped languages often adopt static scoping; Common Lisp and Scheme (with SRFI 15) have both dynamic and static scoping. Perl is another language with dynamic scoping that added static scoping afterwards. Languages like Pascal and C have always had lexical scoping, since they are both influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> went into ALGOL 60 (although C did not include lexically nested functions).|$|R
25|$|The novels show several {{competing}} religions, {{in imitation}} of religion's centrality to the Middle Ages, and to suit the author's perception {{of himself as a}} lapsed Catholic with atheist or agnostic habits. To evade the difficulty of inventing religions, George R. R. Martin based the series' major religions on real religious systems. The fictional history of Westeros shows how each religion evolved. Each of the religions reflects its culture's temperament. When questioned, Martin regards any (real or fictional) religion's claim to truth with suspicion, and is not satisfied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a benevolent God allows for a world full of suffering.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth's {{mother died}} in 1828, and is buried at St Michael's Church, Ledbury, next to her {{daughter}} Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke, Elizabeth's aunt, helped {{to care for the}} children, and she had clashes with Elizabeth's strong will. In 1831 Elizabeth's grandmother, Elizabeth Moulton, died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor, the place was seized and put up for sale to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings, he would not discuss his situation and the family was haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> they might have to move to Jamaica.|$|E
25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E

50|$|Moreno's ideas {{may have}} {{influenced}} some of the pioneers of family therapy, but also there were developments in general science, namely, cybernetic theory, developed in the mid-1940s, and noting the nature of circularity and feedback in complex systems. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> relationships themselves could be problematic became quite apparent. So, diagnostically, in the sense not of naming a disease or disorder, but just helping people think through what was really going on, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of relational disorder was nothing new.|$|R
25|$|The Franck–Condon principle, in its {{canonical}} form, {{applies only}} {{to changes in the}} vibrational levels of a molecule {{in the course of a}} change in electronic levels by either absorption or emission of a photon. The physical intuition of this principle is anchored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the nuclear coordinates of the atoms constituting the molecule do not have time to change during the very brief amount of time involved in an electronic transition. However, this physical intuition can be, and is indeed, routinely extended to interactions between light-absorbing or emitting molecules (chromophores) and their environment. Franck–Condon metaphors are appropriate because molecules often interact strongly with surrounding molecules, particularly in liquids and solids, and these interactions modify the nuclear coordinates of the chromophore in ways closely analogous to the molecular vibrations considered by the Franck–Condon principle.|$|E
25|$|Silent Hills screenwriter, Roger Avary, {{used the}} town of Centralia, Pennsylvania as an {{inspiration}} for {{the town of}} Silent Hill; Avary commented that as a boy, his father, who was a mining engineer, used to tell him stories about Centralia, where coal deposits from the local mine caught fire and released toxic gases into the town, as well as creating sinkholes when the abandoned mineshafts and coal seams began to collapse. This forced the town to evacuate forever. Avary was fascinated since childhood <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> fires underneath the town would be burning {{for such a long}} time. When the script was finished, a studio memo was sent to Gans and Avary that voiced concerns about the lack of a male presence in the film, since the original story contained a nearly all female cast. Gans and Avary added Christopher's character (named after Gans) and subplot and the script was approved.|$|E
25|$|In December 1776, John Burgoyne {{returned}} to London to set strategy with Lord George Germain. Burgoyne's {{plan was to}} establish control of the Champlain-George-Hudson route from New York to Quebec, isolating New England. Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies, where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance. Howe instead argued capturing Philadelphia and defeating Washington was a priority. Germain approved this plan, leaving Howe unable to assist Burgoyne. Washington himself was baffled by Howe's choices. Alden argues Howe was influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that,</b> upon success, he would not receive credit, but Burgoyne. Controversy persists over whether Germain approved Burgoyne's plan after reading Howe's, and whether he shared this information with his subordinates. Howe was not given any explicit orders to assist Burgoyne, however, a copy Germain sent to Quebec explicitly stated Howe was to assist Burgoyne's efforts. Another letter stated Howe should launch his campaign against Philadelphia as intended, while allowing enough time to assist Burgoyne. Black argues Germain either left his generals too much latitude, or without a clear direction.|$|E

50|$|Soane was {{initiated}} on 1 December 1813 as a freemason. Soane {{did not like}} organised religion and was a Deist. Soane was influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> belonged to <b>the</b> enlightenment, and had read Voltaire's and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's works. He was taken ill on 27 December 1813 and was incapacitated until 28 March 1814, when he underwent an operation by Astley Cooper on his bladder to remove a fistula. For {{the first time since}} his Grand Tour Soane decided to travel abroad, he set off on 15 August 1815 for Paris returning on 5 September. In the summer of 1816, a friend, Barbara Hofland, persuaded him to take a holiday in Harrogate, there they visited Knaresborough, Plompton and its rocks, Ripon, Newby Hall, Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal Park, Castle Howard, Harewood House and Masham.|$|R
