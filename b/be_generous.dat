5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to <b>be</b> <b>generous</b> in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were {{a thing of the}} past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) was Charles VI's {{uncle and}} a {{powerful}} figure in the kingdom, {{as well as the}} most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the famous International Gothic illuminated manuscript, and also commissioned the Holy Thorn Reliquary, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the Valois court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry had special reason to <b>be</b> <b>generous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} <b>be</b> <b>generous</b> and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
50|$|Consistency is the {{covariation}} {{of behavior}} across time. If Jane <b>is</b> <b>generous</b> all the time, she shows high consistency. If Jane <b>is</b> rarely <b>generous</b> or <b>is</b> <b>generous</b> only at specific times, perhaps around the holidays, she shows low consistency. High consistency {{is attributed to}} the person (Jane <b>is</b> a <b>generous</b> person), while low consistency is attributed to the circumstance (the holidays make people generous).|$|R

25|$|Pope Innocent IV {{granted to}} the abbey in 1246, {{on the anniversary of}} its consecration, an indulgence lasting forty days {{intended}} to attract visitors who would hopefully <b>be</b> <b>generous</b> with their alms-giving.

And the Guise dancers (disguised dancers) also wished to avoid any punishment for their mocking songs embarrassing the local gentry.|$|E

25|$|Early on, {{development}} costs were minimal, {{and video games}} could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell {{hundreds of thousands of}} copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often <b>be</b> <b>generous</b> with benefits, such as royalties on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as Origin Systems, Sierra Entertainment, Capcom, Activision and Electronic Arts.|$|E
25|$|Bogart could <b>be</b> <b>generous</b> with actors, {{particularly}} those who were blacklisted, down on their luck, or having personal problems. During the filming of the Edward Dmytryk directed The Left Hand of God (1955), he noticed his co-star Gene Tierney {{having a hard time}} remembering her lines and behaving oddly. He coached Tierney, feeding her lines. He was familiar with mental illness from his sister's bouts of depression, and encouraged Tierney to seek treatment. He also stood behind Joan Bennett and insisted on her as his co-star in Michael Curtiz's We're No Angels when an ugly public scandal made her persona non grata with Jack Warner.|$|E
25|$|Fire: The fire {{signs are}} Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly fire signs will be energetic, {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic, with {{a need to}} be {{in the center of the}} action making things happen. They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can <b>be</b> <b>generous,</b> warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and prefer to have control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking fire signs will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic and shy, and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

25|$|Between 1905 and 1916 {{he was the}} Head Master of Eton College. While at Eton Lyttelton {{continued}} the reforms introduced into the curriculum by his predecessor Edmond Warre which resulted in boys being able to enter the school having done no Greek, {{and being able to}} specialize in mathematics, modern languages, science, or history. His Christian principles made his position difficult after the outbreak of the First World War, especially after he preached a sermon at St Margaret's, Westminster, in March 1915, in which he said that the whole German nation should not be condemned and that any peace settlement should <b>be</b> <b>generous.</b> This led to a public storm of protest, and perhaps partly as a result Lyttelton resigned in 1916.|$|E
25|$|His enemies exaggerated his faults; e.g. his {{supposed}} miserliness. In fact, {{it seems}} that his thriftiness {{was the result of}} long years spent in obscurity (when his income was uncertain and scanty) rather than part of his character, because he could also <b>be</b> <b>generous.</b> We know that he helped his nephew Jean-François when he came to Paris and also helped establish the career of Claude-Bénigne Balbastre in the capital. Furthermore, he gave his daughter Marie-Louise a considerable dowry when she became a Visitandine nun in 1750, and he paid a pension to one of his sisters when she became ill. Financial security came late to him, following the success of his stage works and the grant of a royal pension (a few months before his death, he was also ennobled and made a knight of the Ordre de Saint-Michel). But he did not change his way of life, keeping his worn-out clothes, his single pair of shoes, and his old furniture. After his death, it was discovered that he only possessed one dilapidated single-keyboard harpsichord in his rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, yet he also had a bag containing 1691 gold louis.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of April 21 the Texian army attacked Santa Anna's camp near Lynchburg Ferry. The Mexican army was taken by surprise, and the Battle of San Jacinto was essentially over after 18minutes. During the fighting, many of the Texian soldiers repeatedly cried [...] "Remember the Alamo!" [...] as they slaughtered fleeing Mexican troops. Santa Anna was captured the following day, and reportedly told Houston: [...] "That man may consider himself born to no common destiny who has conquered the Napoleon of the West. And now it remains for him to <b>be</b> <b>generous</b> to the vanquished." [...] Houston replied, [...] "You should have remembered that at the Alamo". Santa Anna's life was spared, and {{he was forced to}} order his troops out of Texas, ending Mexican control of the province and bestowing some legitimacy on the new republic.|$|E

500|$|Thome {{was born}} in Peoria, Illinois, on August 27, 1970, the {{youngest}} of five children. Everyone within the blue-collar Thome family played sports: Jim's grandmother was hired at a local Caterpillar plant solely {{to play for the}} company's softball team; his father built bulldozers for Caterpillar and played slow-pitch softball; his aunt {{is a member of the}} Women's Softball Hall of Fame; and his two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at Limestone High School. Thome learned to play baseball from his father on a tennis court, and also played basketball in what he described as the [...] "ghetto" [...] of Peoria, noting that he was the only white kid there but that he earned the respect of his fellow players. One day during his youth, Thome sneaked into the Cubs' clubhouse at Wrigley Field in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain an autograph from his favorite player, Dave Kingman. Though Thome received signatures from several other players, this experience influenced him to <b>be</b> <b>generous</b> with signing autographs for fans during his playing career.|$|E
500|$|A {{faithful}} Catholic, Robert {{was married}} to Gertrude Talbot, daughter of the recusant John Talbot of Grafton. [...] He inherited the Tudor Huddington Court near Worcester, along with a significant fortune with which {{he was known to}} <b>be</b> <b>generous.</b> [...] Under Robert, Huddington Court became a known refuge for priests. The proclamation for his capture, issued following the plot's failure, described him as [...] "a man of mean stature, and rather low than otherwise; square made, somewhat stooping; near 40 years of age; his hair and beard brown; his beard not much, and his hair short." [...] The Jesuit John Gerard wrote that he was [...] "esteemed in his life {{to be one of the}} wisest and most resolute and sufficient gentlemen in Worcestershire". [...] Gerard's appraisal of Thomas was just as complimentary. [...] He was apparently an intelligent, witty and educated man, who could speak Latin, Italian, Spanish and French. [...] "He was of mean stature, but strong and comely and very valient, about 33 years old or somewhat more." [...] Thomas worked as a servant to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle. [...] He was educated as a lawyer, but following several years of dissipation travelled to Flanders and enrolled in the English army. [...] He fought against Catholic Spain in the Low Countries, France and possibly against the Turks in Central Europe. [...] However, by 1600 his views had changed; citing his belief in the injustice of fighting against the power of Catholic Spain, like his elder brother he became a passionate Catholic. Travelling as 'Mr Winter of Worcestershire', from 24 February 1601 he spent 13days in Rome for the jubilee, [...] and later that year and into 1602 travelled to Spain, to petition the Council on behalf of the Catholic rebels left leaderless by the execution of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. [...] Father Henry Garnet, perhaps thinking that the purpose behind Thomas's visit was to gain financial support for impoverished English Catholics, sent him to Superior Father Joseph Creswell, who made the introductions to the Spanish. [...] This trip to Spain later became the first of two visits to be dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason, but Thomas's timing was unfortunate, coming as it did so soon after Spain's failed attack in Ireland, and he received only vague assurances of their support. [...] In England he met with the Spanish embassy Don Juan de Tassis, who in August 1603 landed at Dover to help negotiate an Anglo-Spanish treaty. [...] Tassis quickly realised that any chance of a successful Catholic rebellion was unlikely, and discounted Thomas's claim that, with funding, [...] "3,000 Catholics" [...] would be available for the cause. [...] After meeting with King James he wrote to Spain emphasising the need to prioritise peace with England over the freedom of her Catholics.|$|E
