40|$|To {{reduce costs}} {{and enhance the}} {{research}} quality in clinical trials (CT) a more systematic approach is needed for CT automatization {{as well as for}} enhancing interoperability at various levels of the research process. To this aim a conceptual model of CTs should be developed. At the base of any modelling approach there are partitioning criteria which enable us to dominate the complexity of the modelled universe. In this report we introduce an original analysis method based on stakeholders ’ concerns to partition the CT conceptual domain in stakeholder-oriented sub-domains. Mental representations of stakeholders related to each concern are identified as clusters of concepts related to each other. We consider such a cluster as a semantic rationale for the associated concern. The concepts found in the semantic rationales populate the universe of discourse specific to each stakeholder and compose the stakeholder’s vocabulary. Some concepts are shared with other stakeholders while others are specific to one stakeholder, some concepts are CT specific while others are medical or general concepts. In this way a concern-oriented ontology of the CT can be created. The method is illustrated for the subject selection criteria, a component of a CT project, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|Cooking is {{imperative}} for beans {{owing to the}} presence of compounds that can negatively affect nutritional value. Additionally, the heating of beans can increase protein digestibility and induce desirable sensory properties. However, cooking also causes considerable changes in the composition of numerous chemical constituents, including amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. For this, effects of domestic cooking on the essential element concentrations in various beans species (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were investigated using jalo, fradinho, rajado, rosinha, bolinha, black, and common species. Elemental determination was made with flame atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry after sample digestion in a closed-vessel microwave oven using a diluted oxidant mixture. Analytical methods were evaluated with an addition and recovery test and analysis of certified reference materials (apple and citrus leaves). Ca, Cu, K, and Mg were present mainly in rajado, Cu in jalo, Fe in black, S and Zn in fradinho, and P in rosinha species. Thermal treatment did not affect Cu, Fe, S, and Zn concentrations, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> increased <b>Ca,</b> K, Mg, P, and Zn concentrations in jalo and black species.

40|$|Optimization is {{the branch}} of {{mathematics}} concerned with finding {{the best way to}} complete a task. Certainly, some tasks are easy, and we need not rely on optimization to tackle them. But many others are much more difficult, so much so that we may have very little hope of completing them satisfactorily—let alone optimally—without optimization. For example, suppose a friend of ours does volunteer work for a Meals-on-Wheels program. Once a week she bikes to the Meals-on-Wheels headquarters and picks up 20 meals and a list of 20 names and addresses. She then gets in the Meals-on-Wheels van, delivers the meals, and returns to headquarters. Her goal is to drop off the meals in an order that will minimize the number of miles she’ll travel, as this will minimize fuel consumption, pollutant emissions, and the amount of time she’ll spend on the job. Is her task—planning the route she’ll take—an easy one? It depends. If all of the addresses are on the same road, then it is extremely easy; the optimal route will be obvious to anyone who takes a look at a map. <b>But</b> if not, <b>it</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} PACAPs on [Ca 2 +]i were {{compared}} to those of carbachol in human neuroblastoma NB-OK- 1 cells. PACAP(1 - 27) and PACAP(1 - 38) increased [Ca 2 +]i in a biphasic manner: a transient rise and a secondary plateau. The transient phase reflected the mobilization of [Ca 2 +]i pool(s) via the inositol phosphate pathway. The modest sustained plateau required extracellular Ca 2 +. Carbachol also increased [Ca 2 +]i in a biphasic manner, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> mobilized intracellular <b>Ca</b> 2 + pool(s) with a higher efficacy than PACAPs, then greatly increased Ca 2 + entry, this being accompanied by a more marked and prolonged elevation of IP 3 and IP 4 than with PACAPs.

40|$|Biomass was the {{dominating}} {{source of}} energy for human activities until the middle 19 th century, when coal, oil, gas and other energy sources became increasingly important <b>but</b> <b>it</b> still represents <b>ca.</b> 10 % of the worldwide energy supply. The major part of biomass for energy is still "traditional biomass" used as wood and coal extracted from native forests and thus non-sustainable, used with low efficiency for cooking and home heating, causing pollution problems. This use is largely done in rural areas and it is usually not supported by trading activities. There is now a strong trend to the modernization of biomass use, especially making alcohol from sugar cane thus replacing gasoline, or biodiesel to replace Diesel oil, beyond the production of electricity and vegetable coal using wood from planted forests. As recently as in 2004, sustainable "modern biomass" represented 2 % of worldwide energy consumption. This article discusses the perspectives of the "first" and "second" technology generations for liquid fuel production, as well as biomass gaseification to make electricity or syngas that is in turn used in the Fischer-Tropsch process...|$|R

40|$|Calumenin is a {{multiple}} EF-hand Ca 2 +-binding protein localized in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with C-terminal SR retention signal HDEF. Recently, we showed evidence that calumenin interacts with SERCA 2 in rat cardiac SR (Sahoo, S. K., and Kim, D. H. (2008) Mol. Cells 26, 265 – 269). The {{present study was}} undertaken to further characterize the association of calumenin with SERCA 2 in mouse heart by various gene manipulation approaches. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that calumenin and SERCA 2 were partially co-localized in HL- 1 cells. Knockdown (KD) of calumenin was conducted in HL- 1 cells and 80 % reduction of calumenin did not induce any expressional changes of other Ca 2 +-cycling proteins. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> enhanced <b>Ca</b> 2 + transient amplitude and showed shortened time to reach peak and decreased time to reach 50 % of baseline. Oxalate-supported Ca 2 + uptake showed increased Ca 2 + sensitivity of SERCA 2 in calumenin KD HL- 1 cells. Calumenin and SERCA 2 interaction was significantly lower {{in the presence of}} thapsigargin, vanadate, or ATP, as compared with 1. 3 μm Ca 2 +, suggesting that the interaction is favored in the E 1 state of SERCA 2. A glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assay of calumenin deletion fragments and SERCA 2 luminal domains suggested that regions of 132 – 222 amino acids of calumenin and 853 – 892 amino acids of SERCA 2 -L 4 are the major binding partners. On the basis of our in vitro binding data and available information on three-dimensional structure of Ca 2 +-ATPases, a molecular model was proposed for the interaction between calumenin and SERCA 2. Taken together, the present results suggest that calumenin is a novel regulator of SERCA 2, and its expressional changes are tightly coupled with Ca 2 +-cycling of cardiomyocytes...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) as they replicate in infected individuals reflects {{a balance between the}} pressure on the virus to mutate away from recognition by dominant epitope-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and the structural constraints on the virus' ability to mutate. To gain a further understanding of the strategies employed by these viruses to maintain replication competency {{in the face of the}} intense selection pressure exerted by CTL, we have examined the replication fitness and morphological ramifications of a dominant epitope mutation and associated flanking amino acid substitutions on the capsid protein (CA) of SIV/simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). We show that a residue 2 mutation in the immunodominant p 11 C, C-M epitope (T 47 I) of SIV/SHIV not only decreased CA protein expression and viral replication, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> also blocked <b>CA</b> assembly in vitro and virion core condensation in vivo. However, these defects were restored by the introduction of upstream I 26 V and/or downstream I 71 V substitutions in CA.

40|$|The {{physiological}} disorders of translucent {{flesh and}} gamboge in mangosteen fruits {{are known to}} be related to low calcium (Ca) content and imbalance of Ca, potassium (K) and boron (B). To effectively manipulate the content of these nutrients, an accumulation pattern of each nutrient in mangosteen is needed. In this study, fruit growth and seasonal changes in Ca, K, magnesium (Mg) and B content in mangosteen fruits from 32 mature trees at a commercial orchard in Chantaburi, Eastern Thailand were recorded for 13 weeks, starting one week after the fruits set. Fruit weight and diameter increased throughout this period. A strong relationship between fruit diameter and fruit weight was observed. The concentration of Ca, K, Mg and B in the fruits declined sharply during the first 5 weeks of recording before leveling off. However, the total amount of each nutrients accumulated in the fruits (including Ca) increased throughout the season reaching the maximum value at the end of fruit growth, right before harvest. Phloem appears to facilitate movement of K, Mg and B into fruits. The contribution of phloem in Ca accumulation could not be confirmed in this study, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems that <b>Ca</b> transports into the fruit for a longer period than previously reported. The continuous increase of accumulated Ca until harvest suggests that, in order to raise Ca content effectively, soil or spray application of Ca should not be limited to the early period after the fruit sets but extended to harvest...|$|R
