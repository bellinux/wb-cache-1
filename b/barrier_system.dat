5|$|Scholars today remain {{divided on}} the merits of the {{electronic}} <b>barrier</b> <b>system</b> and the efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered <b>barrier</b> <b>system</b> components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E

500|$|Commencing in 1966, the US had {{attempted}} to establish a <b>barrier</b> <b>system</b> across the DMZ to prevent infiltration by North Vietnamese troops.

This occurred just as the North Vietnamese began {{the first phase of}} their offensive, launching attacks against Marine-held positions across the DMZ. These attacks hindered the advancement of the McNamara Line, and as the fighting around Khe Sanh intensified vital equipment including sensors and other hardware had to be diverted from elsewhere {{to meet the needs of}} the US garrison at Khe Sanh. Construction on the line was ultimately abandoned and resources were later diverted towards implementing a more mobile strategy.|$|E
2500|$|Because these {{barriers}} are relatively inexpensive, {{as opposed to}} concrete step barriers to install and maintain, and are very effective at capturing vehicles, their use is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. [...] By far, the most popular use of the cable <b>barrier</b> <b>system</b> occurs in the medians of divided highways.|$|E
5000|$|Median {{barriers}} can {{be divided}} into three basic categories: rigid <b>barrier</b> <b>systems,</b> semi-rigid <b>barrier</b> <b>systems,</b> and flexible <b>barrier</b> <b>systems.</b> Rigid <b>barrier</b> <b>systems</b> are made up of concrete and are the most common barrier type in use today (e.g. Jersey barrier or concrete step barrier). They are the most costly to install, but have relatively low life-cycle costs, making them economically viable over time. The second barrier type, semi-rigid, is commonly known as guardrail or guiderail barriers. The initial installation of this type can reach as much as $100,000 per mile. [...] These more forgiving barriers are meant to absorb the impact of an accident, and as a result, increase the cost of their life-cycle with each crash and each repair. The third median barrier type is the flexible <b>barrier</b> <b>systems</b> (e.g. cable <b>barriers).</b> Cable barriers are the most forgiving and the least expensive to install, but have high life-cycle costs due to repair needs after crashes. On the other hand, they have been shown to have calculated cost benefits calculating to as much as $420,000 per mile annually. [...] Much cheaper collision reduction methods are to improve road markings, to reduce speeds and to separate traffic with wide central hatching.|$|R

40|$|The task of {{managing}} hydrogen entry into elevated temperature structural materials employed in turbomachinery {{is a critical}} engineering area for propulsion systems employing hydrogen or decomposable hydrocarbons as fuel. Extant structural materials, such as the Inconel series, are embrittled by the ingress of hydrogen in service, leading {{to a loss of}} endurance and general deterioration of load-bearing dependability. Although the development of hydrogen-insensitive material systems is an obvious engineering option, to date insensitive systems cannot meet the time-temperature-loading service extremes encountered. A short-term approach that is both feasible and technologically sound is the development and employment of hydrogen barrier coatings. The present project is concerned with developing, analyzing, and physically testing laminate composite hydrogen <b>barrier</b> <b>systems,</b> employing Inconel 718 as the structural material to be protected. <b>Barrier</b> <b>systems</b> will include all metallic, metallic-to-ceramic, and, eventually, metallic/ceramic composites as the lamellae. Since space propulsion implies repetitive engine firings without earth-based inspection and repair, coating durability will be closely examined, and testing regimes will include repetitive thermal cycling to simulate damage accumulation. The target accomplishments include: generation of actual hydrogen permeation data for metallic, ceramic-metallic, and hybrid metallic/ceramic composition <b>barrier</b> <b>systems,</b> practically none of which is currently extant; definition of physical damage modes imported to <b>barrier</b> <b>systems</b> due to thermal cycling, both transient temperature profiles and steady-state thermal mismatch stress states being examined as sources of damage; and computational models that incorporate general laminate schemes as described above, including manufacturing realities such as porosity, and whatever defects are introduced through service and characterized during the experimental programs...|$|R
