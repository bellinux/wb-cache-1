40|$|A {{route for}} the {{fabrication}} of porous inorganic hollow fibers with high surface-area-to-volume ratio that avoids harmful solvents is presented. The approach {{is based on}} bio-ionic gelation of an aqueous mixture of inorganic particles and sodium alginate during wet spinning. In a subsequent thermal treatment, the <b>bio-organic</b> <b>material</b> is removed and the inorganic particles are sintered. The method is applicable to the fabrication of various inorganic fibers, including metals and ceramics. The route completely avoids the use of organic solvents, such as N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone, and additives associated with the currently used fiber fabrication methods. In addition, it inherently avoids the manifestation of so-called macro voids and allows the facile incorporation of additional metal oxides in the inorganic hollow fibers...|$|E
40|$|International audienceField and {{laboratory}} studies of organic compounds in snow (12 species; concentrations <= 17 mu g L- 1) were conducted and microorganisms in snow and aerosols at urban and Arctic sites were investigated (snow: {{total bacteria count}} <= 40000 colony forming units per millilitre (CFU mL(- 1)), fungi <= 400 CFU mL(- 1); air: bacteria <= 2. 2 x 10 (7) CFU m(- 3), fungi <= 84 CFU m(- 3)). <b>Bio-organic</b> <b>material</b> is transferred between snow and air and influence on snow-air exchange processes is demonstrated. Volatile organic compounds in snow are released into the air upon melting. In vitro photochemistry indicated an increase of <= 60 mu g L- 1 for 1, 3 - and 1, 4 -dimethylbenzenes. Bacillus cereus was identified and observed in snow and air with ice-nucleating being P. syringae absent. As a result snow photobiochemical reactions {{should be considered in}} describing organic matter air-snow exchanges, and the investigation of climate change...|$|E
40|$|The main {{elemental}} constituents (H, C, N, O, and S) of <b>bio-organic</b> <b>material</b> {{have different}} stable isotopes (H- 2, H- 1; C- 13,C- 12; N- 15,N- 14; O- 18,O- 17,O- 16; S- 36, S- 34, S- 33, and S- 32). Isotopic ratios {{can be measured}} precisely and accurately using dedicated analytical techniques such as isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Analysis of these ratios shows potential for assessing the authenticity of {{food of animal origin}}. In this review, IRMS analysis of food of animal origin and variability factors related to stable isotope ratios in animals are described. The study also lists examples of application of stable isotope ratio analysis to meat, dairy products, fish, and shellfish and emphasizes {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the technique. Geographical, climatic, pedological, geological, botanical, and agricultural factors affect the stable isotope ratios (SIR) of bio-elements, and SIR variations are ultimately incorporated into animal tissue through eating, drinking, breathing, and exchange with the environment, being recorded in the resulting foods. SIR analysis was capable of determining geographical origin, animal diet, and the production system (such as organic/conventional or wild/farmed) for pork, beef, lamb, poultry, milk, butter, cheese, fish, and shellfish. In the case of the hard PDO (protected designations of origin) cheeses Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano it is also used in real-life situations to assess the authenticity of grated and shredded cheese on the market...|$|E
40|$|To {{observe the}} pyroelectric {{response}} of <b>bio-organic</b> <b>materials,</b> several innovations {{have been proposed}} and implemented to push the sensitivity limits of a Scanning PyroElectric Microscope (SPEM). These {{include the use of}} noise reducing software, interdigitated comb electrodes instead of parallel plate electrodes and the use of rotating mirrors. Using these suggested techniques, the general performance of a SPEM measurement has been improved and allows the successful study of materials with a naturally weak spontaneous polarization and thus extremely low pyroelectric coefficients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Scanning PyroElectric Microscopy (SPEM) and Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy (SHGM) are two {{versatile}} {{techniques for}} probing the spontaneous polarization distribution in matter. Both require an optical setup, but {{differ in their}} detection mechanism. SPEM uses modulated laserlight that is absorbed by the sample to generate a thermal wave. This thermal wave locally perturbs the system and its electrical polarization, generating a pyroelectric current that {{is proportional to the}} size and direction of the polarization. SHGM, on the other hand, utilizes femtosecond laser pulses to generate frequency doubled light using the hyperpolarizability of the material. Measuring the intensity and location of this frequency doubled light can reveal the polarization distribution. The photothermal and nonlinear optical technique complement each other as they provide information about the polarization distribution on different length- and timescales, respectively changing the macroscopic polarization and hyperpolarizing the individual molecules. This unique combination of SPEM and SHGM to observe macroscopic polarization leads {{to a better understanding of}} ferroelectric phenomena, in both organic and inorganic materials. In this context, pyroelectricity, complemented by hyperpolarizability, is a physicist’s novel approach to <b>bio-organic</b> <b>materials</b> and biological systems. Ferroelectric properties have already been reported for <b>bio-organic</b> <b>materials,</b> such as bones, teeth and tendons, dating back to 1957. Previously, the principal polar axes in several animal, plant and insect samples as well as human dental and hard tissues have been determined. Here, further investigation obtained detailed polarization distributions in Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), fluorapatite biocomposites, human teeth, cat talons, caterpillar silk and coagulating bloodplasma. The current findings suggest that polarity plays a crucial role in nature e. g. during morphogenesis and as a facilitator for other biological functions. It also represents a challenge to our understanding of nature as current results indicate that living organisms utilize polar structures everywhere we look; from our bones, teeth, nails and skin to sensory organs and the neurons in our brains. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, both {{biodegradable}} and bio-based electronics {{have attracted}} increasing interest, {{but are also}} controversially discussed at the same time. Yet, {{it is not clear}} whether they will contribute to science and technology or whether they will disappear without major impact. The present review will address several aspects while showing the potential opportunities of bio-organic electronics. An overview about the complex terminology of this emerging field is given and test methods are presented which are used to evaluate the biodegradable properties. It will be shown that the majority of components of organic electronics can be substituted by biodegradable or bio-based materials. Moreover, application scenarios are presented where <b>bio-organic</b> <b>materials</b> have advantages compared to conventional ones. A variety of publications are highlighted which encompass typical organic devices like organic light emitting diodes, organic solar cells and organic thin film transistors as well as applications in the field of medicine or agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Most {{ballistic}} products use {{synthetic material}} such as Kevlar for reinforcement. As Kevlar is petroleum based, its cost {{is very much}} dependent on world market price. It is envisaged that natural materials to replace Kevlar {{can contribute to the}} drop in cost of ballistic products. Waste <b>bio-organic</b> <b>materials</b> as a filler in matrix materials to be made into hybrid composites have emerged as an alternative. One such material is coconut fiber in the form of chopped woven roving mat {{to be used as a}} filler, sandwiched between Kevlar and woven roving fiber glass. ABS resin from thermoplastic polymer was used as the matrix material. By using hydraulic hot press, the hybrid plastic composite is produced in panels with size 10 x 12 inches and thickness range between 14 to 16 millimeters with controlled weight not more than 1. 4 kilograms. Ballistic tests on the composite are implemented based on NIJ standard- 01. 01. 04 to meet Type one requirement. The high impact panel material properties and fabrication method that is developed is described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bio-organic</b> <b>materials</b> such as bones, {{teeth and}} tendon {{generally}} show nonlinear optical, pyro- and piezoelectric properties, implying a permanent polarization, {{the presence of}} which can be rationalized by describing the growth of the sample {{and the creation of a}} polar axis according to Markovs theory of stochastic processes. Two proven, versatile techniques for probing spontaneous polarization distributions in solids are Scanning PyroElectric Microscopy (SPEM) and Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy (SHGM). We demonstrate the combination of pyroelectric scanning with SHG-microscopy in a single experimental setup leading to complementary pyroelectric and nonlinear optical data, providing us with a more complete image of the polarization in organic materials. Crystals consisting of the known polar and hyperpolarizable material, CNS (4 -chloro- 4 '-nitrostilbene) are used as a reference sample, to verify the functionality of the setup, with both SPEM and SHGM images revealing the same polarization domain information. In contrast, feline and human nails exhibit a pyroelectric response, but a second harmonic response is absent for both keratin containing materials, implying that there may be symmetry-allowed SHG, but with very inefficient second harmonophores. This new approach to polarity detection provides additional information on the polar and hyperpolar nature in a variety of (bio) materials. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} goals in nanoparticle research is to develop successful protocols for the large-scale, simple and possibly low-cost preparation of morphologically pure nanoparticles with enhanced properties. The work presented in this thesis was focused on the synthesis, characterisation and testing of magnetic nanoparticles and their potential applications. There are a number of magnetic nano-materials prepared for specific applications such as metal oxide nanoparticles encapsulated with various porous materials including Fe₃O₄/Fe₂O₃ coated with soft <b>bio-organic</b> <b>materials</b> such as glycol chitosan and bovine serum albumin and hard materials such as silica (SiO₂) and zinc sulphide (ZnS). The preparation of these materials was achieved principally by bottom-up methods with different approaches including micro-emulsion, precipitation, electrostatic and thermolysis processes. The thesis also presents the uses of various analytical techniques for characterising different types of nano-materials including Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transformer Infrared Vibrational Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Ultraviolet Visible- Near Infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) Spectroscopy, Zeta Potentiometric Surface Charge Analysis, Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) and Vibration Sample Magnetometry (VSM) for magnetic analysis and powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for crystallographic pattern analysis. There are many applications of magnetic nanoparticles, including nano-carriers for biological and catalytic reagents. The magnetic nanoparticles can facilitate separation in order to isolate the carriers from solution mixtures as compared to many inefficient and expensive classic methods, which include dialysis membrane, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, precipitation and column separation methods. There are six key chapters in this thesis: the first chapter introduces the up-to-date literature regarding magnetic nano-materials. The uses of magnetic nano-materials in drug binding and for protein separation are discussed {{in the second and third}} chapters. The fourth chapter presents the use of magnetic nanoparticle in conjunction with a photo-catalytic porous overlayer for the photo-catalytic reduction of organic molecules. The fifth chapter describes different analytical techniques used for the characterisation of nanoparticles and the underlying principles and the experimental details are also given. The sixth chapter summarises the results and provides an overview of the work in a wider context of future applications of magnetic nanoparticles. </p...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) {{has been used}} to demonstrate the biological formation of a hollow spherical halloysite-like mineral in freshwater systems. The interaction between clays and microbes was investigated in microbial films from laboratory cultures derived from natural sediments. Optical and electron microscopic observations of cultured microbes revealed that thin clay films covered areas of the bacterial cell wall. X-ray diffraction of the thin films after 2 y of ageing showed a 7. 13 Å d spacing, consistent with a 7 Å halloysite-like phase [Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 ·H 2 O]. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the thin film exhibited the characteristic adsorption bands for O-H (3651 cm - 1), C-H and C-N (2925, 1454 and 1420 cm - 1, respectively), suggesting that the phase was closely associated with adhesive organics. Observation by TEM of the thin films revealed that spherical, hollow, halloysite-like material formed on both coccus- and bacillus-type bacterial cells. Electron diffraction analysis of this material showed 2. 9, 2. 5, 2. 2 and 1. 5 Å d spacings. The present investigation strongly suggests that the thin film wall of the spherical halloysite-like material was associated with bacteria as a <b>bio-organic</b> product. This <b>material,</b> referred to hereafter as bio-halloysite, is further evidence for the microbially-mediated formation of clay minerals. The identity of the bacteria responsible for bio-halloysite formation is unknown, but is tentatively assigned to sulfate-reducing bacteria on the basis of morphology and the presence of reducing conditions in the microcosm {{at the end of the}} experiments.
