Rose's husband, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), was in {{the tail}} section of the plane in the bathroom. He, {{along with the rest}} of the tail section's passengers, is {{believed}} by the survivors to be dead, but Rose is convinced that he is alive and that the tail section of the plane thinks that the middle section is dead.|$|E
5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, and he had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling {{that he might be}} on the verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

25|$|The latter {{incident}} proved counter-productive to the Argentine sovereignty push, as Lord Chalfont had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> {{a public}} {{meeting at the}} time of the plane's arrival. The islanders made it plain to Lord Chalfont that they rejected a Memorandum of Agreement negotiated between Britain and Argentina that August which stated that Britain was prepared to discuss sovereignty provided the islanders' wishes were respected. This spurred the formation of the Falkland Islands Committee by London barrister Bill Hunter-Christie and others. The Emergency Committee, as it became known, proved to be an effective lobbying organisation, constantly undermining Foreign Office initiatives on sovereignty negotiations. In December 1968, the lobbying effort managed to force the British Government to state that the islanders' wishes would be paramount.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007–08 season, Kidd {{became the}} third player {{to get a}} triple-double in three {{straight}} games since 1989. He did so after he logged his 97th career triple-double in a 115–99 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. Kidd was voted by the fans to start in the 2008 All-Star game in New Orleans as a guard along with Dwyane Wade. During that season Kidd had been mentioned in trade rumors, notably to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal fell through when the Lakers {{refused to give up}} their young center Andrew Bynum. On January 28, 2008, Kidd revealed that his agent had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the Nets' front office about a trade. On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the team that originally drafted him.|$|E

25|$|Keyes brings Jackson to Los Angeles, suspecting {{that the}} man aboard the train had not been Dietrichson, but rather had been Phyllis' {{accomplice}} in Dietrichson's murder. After examining photographs of Dietrichson, Jackson is sure {{that the man}} he met was not that old, but at least ten years younger. Now certain that he can prove murder, Keyes is eager to reject the claim and force Phyllis to sue. Neff warns Phyllis not to pursue the insurance claim in court and admits that he has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Lola about her past. Phyllis, however, insists on filing suit to pursue the claim despite the risk to both her and Neff. Lola eventually tells Neff that she has discovered that her boyfriend, the hotheaded Nino Zachetti (Byron Barr), has been seeing Phyllis behind her (and Neff's) back.|$|E

500|$|Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated {{the story}} about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Epstein about the band {{for a long time}} (being the group he {{promoted}} the most in Mersey Beat) and by McCartney saying, “Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat.” Regardless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961. He was initially repelled by the dark, damp club, but he congratulated them on their performance.|$|E

She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she {{recognises}} as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: [...] "Qual'occhio al mondo" [...] ("What eyes in the world").|$|E
500|$|Murrell {{continued}} {{to remain the}} subject of local discussion after his death. Maple believed that the legacy created within these communities {{was a combination of}} both fact and myth, with [...] "Murrell the man" [...] being supplanted by [...] "Murrell the myth", around which a [...] "vast wealth of lore" [...] accrued. Maple noted that many of the attributes associated with witches in British folklore came {{to be associated with the}} cunning man. For instance, he highlighted the existence of local stories that credited Murrell with the ability to fly, and that he was once observed flying over the River Crouch on a broomstick. Another story held that Murrell had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a group of old men in Canvey Island before suddenly vanishing and reappearing in his own village, which was several miles away.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Deja Entendu, Brand New was pegged as an act to watch in Rolling Stones annual [...] "Hot Issue." [...] The band topped punk critics' year-end lists with the [...] "genre-defying" [...] Deja Entendu, and the album was {{described}} as a [...] "landmark album of so-called 'emo-punk'." [...] As a result of both the album's success and the band's notable underground following, Brand New found itself {{in the middle of a}} bidding war from record labels. At the time, Lane disagreed with the usage of the phrase [...] "bidding war", but conceded, [...] "There's a few labels that are definitely interested. We've <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a lot of people for a while and we're narrowing it down." [...] The band eventually signed with DreamWorks Records, which was then taken over by Interscope Records.|$|E

500|$|Epstein saw {{numerous}} posters around Liverpool advertising concerts by the Beatles {{as well as}} in {{the second}} issue of Mersey Beat, which had [...] "Beatles sign Recording Contract!" [...] on the front cover, as the Beatles had recorded the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single with Tony Sheridan in Germany. Some months after its release, Epstein supposedly (as stated in his biography), asked his assistant Alistair Taylor about the single, because a customer, one Raymond Jones, had asked Epstein for the single on 28 October 1961, which made Epstein curious about the group. Harry and McCartney repudiated this story, as Harry had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Epstein about the Beatles for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat), and by McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat." ...|$|E
500|$|Epstein's {{version of}} the story was that {{customer}} Raymond Jones walked into the NEMS shop and asked him for the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single, which made Epstein curious about the group.

Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein's story, as Harry had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Epstein for a long time about the Beatles—the group that he promoted the most in Mersey Beat—with McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were; they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat".

500|$|In 2000, Microsoft {{acquired}} Bungie, {{moving the}} team from Chicago to Washington State.

Before that we worried that we'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn't have a clue." [...] Around the same time, a glitch in versions of Myth II was found to entirely erase a player's hard drive; this led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped, costing Bungie nearly one million dollars. Composer Martin O'Donnell said that this recall created financial uncertainty in the studio, though accepting the offer was not something [...] "Bungie had to do." [...] Jones and Seropian refused to accept Microsoft's offer until the entire studio agreed to the buyout.|$|E
