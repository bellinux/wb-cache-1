Their weigh average is 77. 70 kg with a Capture by Unit Effort (CPUE) of 5. 62 kg. During this warm season, 187 <b>blue</b> <b>marlins</b> (65. 61 %) have their sizes between 105 and 200 cm against only 98 (34. 39 %) which exceeds 200 cm.

The sizes weights and quantities landed of this species were approached according to the marine seasons and fishing areas. These fishermen mostly Ghanaians use canoes 12 to 17 m as craft and drifting gillnets 4800 to 5400 m to catch fish. The choice of fishing area depends on {{the direction of the}} current. When the current flows westward fishing takes place in the east and vice versa. These choices have the advantage that at the return the driving force is developed {{in the direction of the}} current. In either case the net is arranged perpendicularly to the direction of the current to act as a filtering barrier. In the absence of marine current the net is arranged perpendicularly to the north-south axis. The Man-Whitney test applied to maturity states following seasons and fishing areas showed a significant difference P 0. 05. Sector A 2 offshore waters in front of Abidjan Grand Bassam and Jacqueville would be conducive to the capture of mature individuals during warm seas. On the other hand during upwelling fishing should be favorable to sector B offshore waters in front of Grand-Lahou and Fresco where adult marlins are accessible. Capturing M. nigricans on the continental shelf should be discouraged as recruits abound in this area to feed and shelter from large offshore predators...|$|R

Size {{frequencies of}} <b>blue</b> and white <b>marlin</b> (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans,</b> and Tetrapturus albidus, respectively) {{have been collected}} at U.

These include measurements taken by observers on Venezuelan longline vessels since 1987, and on U. S. vessels since 1989. These data are supplemented with dockside samples of Venezuelan longline and artisanal gillnet billfish landings beginning in 1987.

Live release of incidental catch is one means of reducing the fishing mortality of these species without sacrificing the target catch, but the efficacy of such a measure is predicated on the assumption that postrelease survival is relatively high.

During the summer spawning season, blue marlin utilized outer shelf and shelf edge {{waters in the}} northern Gulf of Mexico, and longer duration tracks indicated overwintering habitats in the Bay of Campeche. Egress occurred throughout the year and was difficult to determine because some tracks ended in the Straits of Florida (n = 3) while other tracks recorded movement through it or the Yucatan Channel (n = 4).

Major controversies about stock status have arisen because of issues concerning habitat influences on catch rates, but models to describe how the species is distributed throughout its entire habitat are lacking. A habitat suitability model (HSM) of the size and spatial distribution of <b>blue</b> <b>marlin</b> habitat by month using habitat weighted-volume (H) is presented.

The physical habitat is an amorphous 3 -dimensional space whose boundaries are constantly changing with seasonal and longer-term variations in climate. Fluctuations in habitat volume likely contribute to fluctuations in CPUE that are independent of population abundance and add unrecognized uncertainty to abundance indices used to estimate population benchmarks. The results highlight the need to expand stock assessments to include seasonal and annual climatology.

40|$|The {{combination}} of prevailing northeasterly tradewinds and island topography {{results in the}} formation of vigorous, westward propagating cyclonic eddies in the lee of the Hawaiian Islands on time scales of 50 – 70 days.

Insight into how these eddies may directly influence pelagic fish distribution is provided by examination of recreational fish catch data coinciding with the presence of eddies on the fishing grounds. We highlight the 1995 Hawaii International Billfish Tournament in which a cyclonic eddy dominated the ocean conditions during the weeklong event and the fish catch distribution differed significantly from the average historical tournament catch patterns.
