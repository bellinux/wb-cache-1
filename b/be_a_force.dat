5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that an interstellar grouping of civilizations might {{take the form}} of an empire, which need not necessarily <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> for evil, but may provide for peace and security throughout its jurisdiction. Owing to the distances between the stars, such an empire would not necessarily maintain control solely by military force, but may rather tolerate local cultures and institutions to the extent that these would not pose a threat to the central imperial authority. Such tolerance may, as has happened historically on Earth, extend to allowing nominal self-rule of specific regions by existing institutions, while maintaining that area as a puppet or client state to accomplish the aims of the imperial power. However, particularly advanced powers may use methods, including faster-than-light travel, to make centralized administration more effective.|$|E

25|$|A {{phenomenon}} that is commonly presented as {{evidence for the}} existence of zero-point energy in vacuum is the Casimir effect, proposed in 1948 by Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir, who considered the quantized electromagnetic field between a pair of grounded, neutral metal plates. The vacuum energy contains contributions from all wavelengths, except those excluded by the spacing between plates. As the plates draw together, more wavelengths are excluded and the vacuum energy decreases. The decrease in energy means there must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> doing work on the plates as they move.|$|E

During the playoffs, they advanced to the conference finals, where they lost to the Dallas Stars in a hard-fought series, with Bourque hitting the post in the last minutes of Game Seven which would have tied the game after his team rallied from a 3–0 deficit in the third period to 3–2.|$|E
25|$|This way of {{life was}} quickly embraced by many couples and single {{men and women who}} did not feel called to the stark poverty of the friars and nuns, {{especially}} widows. They zealously practiced the lessons Francis had taught them concerning prayer, humility, peacemaking, self-denial, fidelity to the duties of their state, and above all charity. Like Francis himself, they cared for lepers and outcasts. Even canonical hermits were able to follow this Rule and bring themselves into the orbit of the Franciscan vision. The Order came to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> in the medieval legal system, since one of its tenets forbade the use of arms, and thus the male members of the order could not be drafted into the constant and frequent battles cities and regions waged against one another in that era.|$|E

However, {{it was not to}} be, as the team {{finished}} with a 73–81 record in 1951, and (except for 2nd-place tie in 1964) did not finish higher than third place again until 1975. Their lack of success was partly blamed on Carpenter's unwillingness to integrate his team after winning a pennant with an all-white team. The Phillies were the last National League team to sign a black player, a full 10 years after Jackie Robinson made his debut for the Dodgers. Their competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900.|$|E

The latter began to look on the dispute as a free-speech fight and continued to hold meetings near the water front at a point known as Liberty Hill, a privately owned parcel of land used {{with the permission of}} the owner. Local sympathizers and members of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the IWW leaders in seeking to maintain rights of free speech. They included such prominent Los Angeles and Pasadena figures as Upton Sinclair.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} offseason, Gabriel, {{with millions}} of cleared salary cap space, attempted to lure three of the NBA's most prized free agents: Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, and Tracy McGrady. Duncan opted to remain with the San Antonio Spurs, the Magic acquired Hill, a perennial All-Star, and McGrady. With McGrady and Hill together, the Magic were expected to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> in the East. However, Hill was limited to 4 games because of an ankle injury. McGrady blossomed into a star during the season, {{becoming one of the}} NBA's top scorers. With the addition of Mike Miller from the draft, the Magic compiled a 43–39 record, which included a nine-game winning streak, and once again made the playoffs. McGrady made the All-Star Team and All-NBA 2nd Team. Miller won the Rookie of the Year. In the playoffs, they faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. The Bucks won the series 3–1.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} Kingdom of God, {{organized around}} the Council of Fifty, was meant to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> of peace and order {{in the midst of}} this chaos. According to Mormon teachings, while Jesus himself would be king of this new world government, its structure was in fact to be quasi-republican and multi-denominational; therefore, the early Council of Fifty included both Mormons and non-Mormons. Although the Council played a significant role during the last few months of Joseph Smith's life, particularly in his campaign for President of the United States, the Council's role was mostly symbolic throughout the 19th century within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This was largely because the Council was primarily meant for a time when secular governments had ceased to function. Regular meetings of the Council ended in 1884, after the church publicly abandoned its theocratic aspirations. Some contend that the organization was technically extinguished when member Heber J. Grant died in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to summon}} {{adequate}} forces, Ionov {{turned to the}} VVS KBF, the air force of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet. The plan revolved around a massive air strike, at the bridges in Daugavpils and the airfield, occupied by JG 54 at Duagava. The Soviets had not learned the tactical lessons from the previous air battles and sent their bombers unescorted. 8 BAB, 1MTAP, 57 BAP, and 73 BAP were intercepted en route. The bombs fell short of the target, and the mission failed. A further attack by 36 bombers from 57 BAP and 73 BAP was also intercepted. Soviet sources admit {{to the loss of}} 15 and two damaged, though the Germans claimed 29. Another attack was made in the evening of 30 June. 57 and 73 BAP sent 21 bombers, losing seven destroyed and six damaged. The failure meant Ivonov was placed under arrest. His successor, Timofey Kutsevalov took command of the remnants of the VVS North-Western Front, but it had ceased to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> to be reckoned with. The VVS KBF now assumed responsibility for most air operations.|$|E

[...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented, [...] "While her pubescent lookalike fans cheer approvingly, the star's manipulation of such symbols as a wedding gown, a cross, furs and jewels becomes a lighthearted communal psychodrama. Madonna has brought traditional little girl's games of dress-up and playing with dolls (using oneself as model) into the television age by turning them into a public spectacle." [...] A review in Variety by John Gleeson said that [...] "Madonna's singing was like a soundtrack to a more visceral display of herself, her persona, her nonstop dancing and her surprisingly explicit sexual dare, which included a visual climax—so to speak—to every other song."
