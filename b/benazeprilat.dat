40|$|Interactions between {{angiotensin}} II and adrenoceptor-mediated {{effects on}} peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission were investigated in constant flow blood-perfused canine gracilis muscle in situ, without and with pretreatment by non-competitive alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibition by <b>benazeprilat</b> increased nerve stimulation (2 Hz, 4 min) -evoked noradrenaline (NA) overflow (+ 21 +/- 5 %) with alpha-adrenoceptors intact, but reduced NA overflow (- 18 +/- 6 %) when alpha-adrenoceptors were blocked. Vasoconstrictor responses were slightly reduced by <b>benazeprilat.</b> Subsequent infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II, 20 and 500 ng kg- 1 min- 1 i. v., raising arterial concentrations from 0. 6 +/- 0. 2 pM to 1390 +/- 240 and 25, 110 +/- 3980 pM, respectively) failed to increase NA overflow or to enhance stimulation-evoked vasoconstriction. Adrenaline (0. 4 nmol kg- 1 min- 1 i. v.) {{did not change}} evoked NA overflow before or after <b>benazeprilat,</b> either with or without alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, despite high concentrations (approximately 10 nM) in arterial plasma. Following <b>benazeprilat,</b> propranolol reduced NA overflow (- 24 +/- 3 %) only if the alpha-adrenoceptors were blocked. In conclusion, <b>benazeprilat</b> reduced evoked NA overflow {{in the presence of}} alpha-adrenoceptor blockade to a similar degree as previously shown in the presence of neuronal uptake inhibition in this model. However, contrasting to our previous findings, <b>benazeprilat</b> enhanced NA overflow and reduced the post-junctional response to nerve stimulation in the absence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. This could be related to bradykinin accumulation during ACE-inhibition, in addition to the reduction of Ang II generation. Our data are not compatible with facilitation of NA release by circulating Ang II even at pharmacological dose levels. Although activation of prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors may facilitate evoked NA overflow in this model, circulating adrenaline is ineffective under physiological conditions even after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Also, beta-adrenoceptor-mediated prejunctional effects do not seem to involve Ang II in canine skeletal muscle in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II (Ang II) potentiates {{sympathetic}} neurotransmission by {{presynaptic facilitation}} of norepinephrine release. We investigated whether endogenous Ang II modulates peripheral sympathetic activity in sodium- depleted essential hypertensive patients. We evaluated {{the effect of}} intrabrachial infusion of saralasin, an Ang II antagonist (5 μg/ 100 mL forearm tissue per minute), and <b>benazeprilat,</b> an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (2 μg/ 100 mL forearm tissue per minute), on forearm vasoconstriction (measured by strain-gauge venous plethysmography) induced by the application of lower body negative pressure (- 10 mm Hg for 5 minutes). Both saralasin and <b>benazeprilat</b> (n = 6 for each group) blunted the vasoconstrictor action of lower body negative pressure, suggesting that circulating Ang II modulates peripheral sympathetic activity. In addition, since β-adrenoceptor stimulation can activate the production of vascular Ang II, the effect of saralasin and <b>benazeprilat</b> on lower body negative pressure application was evaluated {{in the presence of}} isoproterenol (0. 09 μg/ 100 mL forearm tissue per minute) and propranolol (10 μg/ 100 mL forearm tissue per minute). In two other groups of hypertensive patients, isoproterenol infusion increased the release of Aug II in the forearm vasculature (arteriovenous values measured by radioimmunoassay). Furthermore, isoproterenol potentiated lower body negative pressure-induced vasoconstriction. This facilitating effect was abolished by either saralasin or <b>benazeprilat</b> (n = 6 for each group). In contrast, in two further groups of patients (n = 6 for each group), {{in the presence of the}} β-blocker propranolol, saralasin and <b>benazeprilat</b> did not alter the vasoconstrictor action of the endogenous sympathetic stimulus. The present data suggest that in sodium-depleted essential hypertensive patients, endogenous Aug II, activated by the stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors, can potentiate peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission...|$|E
40|$|Hyperglycemia upregulates {{intracellular}} angiotensin II {{production in}} cardiac myocytes, effects {{of which are}} blocked more effectively by renin inhibition than angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or ACE inhibitors. Here we determined whether renin inhibition is more effective at preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy than an ARB or ACE inhibitor. Diabetes was induced in adult mice for 10 wks by streptozotocin. Diabetic mice were treated with insulin, aliskiren (renin inhibitor), <b>benazeprilat</b> (ACE inhibitor), or valsartan (ARB) via subcutaneous minipumps. Significant impairment in diastolic and systolic cardiac function was observed in diabetic mice, which was completely prevented by all three RAS inhibitors. Hyperglycemia significantly increased cardiac oxidative stress and circulating inflammatory cytokines, which were blocked by aliskiren and <b>benazeprilat,</b> while valsartan was partially effective. Diabetes increased cardiac (pro) renin receptor (PRR) expression and nuclear translocation of promyelocytic zinc finger protein (PLZF), which was completely prevented by aliskiren and valsartan, and partially by <b>benazeprilat.</b> Renin inhibition provided similar protection of cardiac function as ARBs and ACE inhibitors. Activation of PLZF by PRR represented a novel mechanism in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Differential effects of the three agents on oxidative stress, cytokines, and PRR expression suggested subtle differences in their mechanism of action.

40|$|Diabetes-induced organ {{damage is}} {{significantly}} associated with the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Recently, several studies have demonstrated {{a change in the}} RAS from an extracellular to an intracellular system, in several cell types, in response to high ambient glucose levels. In cardiac myocytes, intracellular angiotensin (ANG) II synthesis and actions are ACE and AT 1 independent, respectively. However, a role of this system in diabetes-induced organ damage is not clear. Methods To determine a role of the intracellular ANG II in diabetic cardiomyopathy, we induced diabetes using streptozotocin in AT 1 a receptor deficient (AT 1 a-KO) mice to exclude any effects of extracellular ANG II. Further, diabetic animals were treated with a renin inhibitor aliskiren, an ACE inhibitor <b>benazeprilat,</b> and an AT 1 receptor blocker valsartan. Results AT 1 a-KO mice developed significant diastolic and systolic dysfunction following 10 wks of diabetes, as determined by echocardiography. All three drugs prevented the development of cardiac dysfunction in these animals, without affecting blood pressure or glucose levels. A significant down regulation of components of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) was observed in diabetic animals, which was largely prevented by <b>benazeprilat</b> and valsartan, while aliskiren normalized kininogen expression. Conclusions These data indicated that the AT 1 a receptor, thus extracellular ANG II, are not required for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The KKS might contribute to the beneficial effects of <b>benazeprilat</b> and valsartan in diabetic cardiomyopathy. A role of intracellular ANG II is suggested by the inhibitory effects of aliskiren, which needs confirmation in future studies. Universidad De Las Fuerzas Armadas[URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{intravenous}} administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor <b>benazeprilat</b> on left ventricular function were examined in 18 patients with ischemic heart disease. Twenty minutes after drug infusion (0. 3 - 10 mg), heart rate (78 +/- 17 to 71 +/- 16 beats/min, p less than 0. 0003), left ventricular systolic pressure (- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0. 0004), and plasma norepinephrine concentration all decreased significantly. The isovolumic indexes of inotropic state also decreased slightly (- 10 % in dP/dtmax, p less than 0. 001), whereas the ejection fraction (39 +/- 16 % to 41 +/- 16 %, p less than 0. 08) and the end-systolic volume (- 6 %, p less than 0. 04) tended to improve, probably because of the afterload reduction (- 13 % in mean systolic wall stress, p less than 0. 05). After <b>benazeprilat</b> administration, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was unchanged at the group level, {{but there was a}} consistent downward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation during rapid filling, and the mean diastolic wall stress decreased from 99 +/- 73 to 69 +/- 42 kdyne/cm 2 (p less than 0. 007). These data indicate that the acute administration of <b>benazeprilat</b> has a dual action on left ventricular pump function, which is that the negative inotropic effect of bradycardia and reduced sympathetic drive are compensated by afterload reduction. The drug also improved left ventricular diastolic distensibility and significantly reduced wall stress during diastole.

Both the ACE inhibitor (<b>benazeprilat,</b> 3 mg/kg/day) and the AT 1 antagonist (DuP 753, 10 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced intimal lesion formation after balloon injury (by 35 % and 49 %, respectively).

40|$|AbstractBackground:In the {{treatment}} of hypertension, combination therapy is important 10 because antihypertensive monotherapy is effective in only 40 % of patients worldwide. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a slow onset and long duration of action. Benazepril hydrochloride is a prodrug hydrolyzed by esterase to the active metabolite <b>benazeprilat,</b> an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In 1995, the US Food and Drug Administration approved {{the use of a}} capsule formulation of combination amlodipine-benazepril for hypertension. Objective:The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the bioavailability and tolerability 10 of the capsule formulation with those of a tablet formulation of combination amlodipine-benazepril in healthy volunteers. Methods:This single-dose, 2 -sequence, 2 -period, open-label, crossover 10 study recruited healthy, adult, male volunteers with normotension. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: a single-dose tablet containing amlodipine 5 mg plus benazepril 10 mg, followed by a single-dose capsule containing the same dose of each drug (AB), or vice versa (BA). The treatment period for each drug consisted of dosing and pharmacokinetic analysis on day 1, followed by pharmacokinetic analysis on days 2 to 7. Treatment periods were separated by a 4 -week washout period. For pharmacokinetic analysis, serial blood samples were obtained before dosing and at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, 108, 132, and 156 hours after dosing. Tolerability was assessed using subject interview and spontaneous reporting. Results:Twelve healthy, male, Taiwanese subjects (mean [SD] age, 23. 510 [1. 7] years) participated in the study. No statistically significant differences inbioavailability were found between the 2 formulations based on the pharmacokinetic measurements of amlodipine and <b>benazeprilat.</b> The rate and extent of absorption of the tablets were found to be comparable to those of the capsules (90 % CI, between 80 % and 125 %). The mean (SD) relative bioavailabilities, as represented by AUC 0 −∞, of amlodipine and <b>benazeprilat</b> for tablets versus capsules were 1. 060 (0. 170) versus 0. 949 (0. 197), respectively. The mean plasma concentration-time profiles of amlodipine and <b>benazeprilat</b> were graphically similar. No adverse effects were observed with either formulation.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether adenosine infusion can induce production of active renin and angiotensin II in human coronary circulation. BACKGROUNDAdenosine can activate angiotensin production in the forearm vessels of essential hypertensive patients. METHODSIn six normotensive subjects and 12 essential hypertensive patients adenosine was infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery (1, 10, 100 and 1, 000 μg/min × 5 min each) while active renin (radioimmunometric assay) and angiotensin II (radioimmunoassay after high performance liquid chromatography purification) were measured in venous (great cardiac vein) and coronary arterial blood samples. In five out of 12 hypertensive patients adenosine infusion and plasma samples were repeated during intracoronary angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor <b>benazeprilat</b> (25 μg/min) administration. Finally, in adjunctive hypertensive patients, the same procedure was applied during intracoronary sodium nitroprusside (n = 4) or acetylcholine (n = 4). RESULTSIn hypertensive patients, but not in control subjects, despite a similar increment in coronary blood flow, a significant (p < 0. 05) transient increase of venous active renin (from 10. 7 ± 1. 4 [95 % confidence interval 9. 4 to 11. 8] to a maximum of 13. 8 ± 2. 1 [12. 2 to 15. 5] with a consequent drop to 10. 9 ± 1. 8 [9. 7 to 12. 1] pg/ml), and angiotensin II (from 14. 6 ± 2. 0 [12. 7 to 16. 5] to a maximum of 20. 4 ± 2. 7 [18. 7 to 22. 2] with a consequent drop to 16. 3 ± 1. 8 [13. 9 to 18. 7] pg/ml) was observed under adenosine infusion, whereas arterial values did not change. Calculated venous–arterial active renin and angiotensin II release showed a strong correlation (r = 0. 78 and r = 0. 71, respectively; p < 0. 001) with circulating active renin. This adenosine-induced venous angiotensin II increase was significantly blunted by <b>benazeprilat.</b> Finally, both sodium nitroprusside and acetylcholine did not affect arterial and venous values of active renin and angiotensin II. CONCLUSIONSThese data indicate that exogenous adenosine stimulates the release of active renin and angiotensin II in the coronary arteries of essential hypertensive patients, and suggest that this phenomenon is probably due to renin release from tissue stores of renally derived renin...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an integrated PK/PD model that adequately captures the disposition kinetics of <b>benazeprilat,</b> {{as well as the}} time-varying changes of systemic renin-angiotensin aldosterone (RAA) biomarkers without, and with ACE inhibition therapy. This mechanistic representation provides a quantitative framework for better understanding the effect of ACE inhibition on the RAAS in dogs, but also in humans. Our data show that benazepril influences the dynamics of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade, resulting in a profound but temporary decrease in angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (ALD), while increasing RA for about 24 hours.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that inhibition of tissue {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) {{is important for the}} pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. Radioligand inhibitor binding methods using 125 I- 351 A and either tissue homogenates or in vitro autoradiography have allowed in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of tissue ACE inhibition by a variety of ACE inhibitors. The rank order of potency against plasma as well as lung, kidney, and cardiac homogenates was quinaprilat = <b>benazeprilat</b> greater than perindoprilat greater than lisinopril greater than enalaprilat greater than fosinoprilat. The highest concentration of ACE in the heart was found in the cardiac valves followed by the right and left atria, then the right and left ventricles. Ex vivo studies showed that after oral administration of quinapril, ACE was inhibited dose-dependently in the lung, kidney, aorta and heart for more than 24 h. Tissue bioavailability of the inhibitor is also an important determinant of tissue ACE inhibition.

40|$|Several inhibitors of {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme were also found to inhibit aminopeptidase P, whereas inhibitors of other mammalian aminopeptidases were ineffective. Aminopeptidase P purified from pig kidney cortex was found to contain one atom of zinc per polypeptide chain, confirming its metalloenzyme nature. The concentrations of converting enzyme inhibitors required to cause 50 % inhibition (I 50) of aminopeptidase P were in the low micromolar range. The most potent converting enzyme inhibitors toward aminopeptidase P were the carboxylalkyl compounds, cilazaprilat, enalaprilat, and ramiprilat (I 50 values of 3 - 12 /iM). The sulfydryl compounds captopril (l 50 110 /iM) and YS 980 (I 50 20 /iM) were slightly less potent at inhibiting aminopeptidase P. In contrast, the carboxylalkyl compounds <b>benazeprilat,</b> lisinopril, and pentoprilat; the sulfydryl compound rentiapril; and the phosphoryl compounds ceranopril and fosinoprilat had no inhibitory effect against aminopeptidase P.

This uptake was temperature sensitive and was significantly reduced by metabolic inhibitors, a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent and an anion-exchange inhibitor, although {{the replacement of}} Na+ with Li+ in the medium {{did not affect the}} uptake. [3 H]Temocaprilat uptake was inhibited by estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide and dibromosulphophthalein, typical substrates for the Na+-independent organic anion transporter, in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas excess estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide did not completely inhibit the uptake.

Plasma converting enzyme activity, drug levels, angiotensin I and angiotensin II, active renin, and aldosterone were measured before and 1 - 4 hours and 14 - 30 hours after drug intake. Baseline in vitro plasma converting enzyme activity was 97 +/- 15 nmol/ml/min (mean +/- SD) when Hip-Gly-Gly was used as substrate, but with carbobenzoxy-Phe-His-Leu (Z-Phe-His-Leu) or angiotensin I as substrate it was only 20 +/- 4 and 1. 7 +/- 0. 3 nmol/ml/min, respectively. Discriminating power at peak converting enzyme inhibition was enhanced with the two latter substrates. In vivo converting enzyme activity was estimated by the plasma angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio, which correlated well with in vitro converting enzyme activity using Z-Phe-His-Leu as substrate (r = 0. 76, n = 252). Angiotensin II levels returned to baseline less than 24 hours after drug administration, whereas in vitro and in vivo converting enzyme activity remained considerably inhibited and active renin together with angiotensin I levels were still elevated.
