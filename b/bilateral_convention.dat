Thus rather than working for equity and extermination of poverty, financial institutions become spokespersons of the financial community. The procedures and rhetoric of financial institutions widen the gap between developed and developing, which resulted from undemocratic paternalism and lack of accountability, transparency.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Taxation)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. With the {{international}} platform for cross border investment {{and economic development}} growing year on year at a steady pace, it has become apparent that bilateral income tax treaties do not always operate effectively in multilateral tax situations. Global transactions involving more than two states are certainly not uncommon {{and it could be}} said that the most fundamental issue in international taxation is double taxation resulting from the taxing rights of different tax jurisdictions that ‘overlap’ with regard to, generally speaking, one taxpayer or one declared income stream. Multilateral tax situations, commonly known as triangular cases, occur where tax incidence on a particular stream of income is triggered in three countries. These situations typically arise where a person who is a tax resident in two respective countries for tax purposes (a dual resident), or a person who is a tax resident in one country and has a permanent establishment in another, is earning revenue of which the source is in a third country. Taxing rights and jurisdictions of the three countries involved could potentially be in conflict with each other and therefore such situations may bring about lawful international triangular taxation or double taxation which will inevitably discourage enterprises from continuing investment and development internationally. Broad multilateral treaties in the income tax arena are not common 1, and most treaties are still of a bilateral nature, i. e. generally addressing tax scenarios where only two specific countries are involved. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (’the OECD’) Model Tax Convention states this: There are no reasons to believe that the conclusion of a multilateral tax convention involving all Member countries could now be considered practicable. The Committee therefore considers that <b>bilateral</b> <b>conventions</b> are still a more appropriate way to ensure the elimination of double taxation at {{the international}} level. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{will always}} be states and {{corporations}} that will want and try to appropriate possessions of others without any intellectual or financial investments. Such a 'theft' is made easier {{by the fact that}} the owners of a certain property either have no awareness of its significance or tend to neglect the threats of a potential theft. For those, who naively believe that they don't possess property which will be 'attacked' by someone, and they don't want to know that it should be protected, and how to protect it, but the moment of sobering will be the moment of destruction. It is often wrongly assumed that intangible assets includes only brands, patents, information and similar. According to modern interpretations the intangible assets includes also the summary of knowledge, skills and experiences of the employees. In the Republic of Serbia also much more attention is paid to physical and technical protection of the material than of the intangible assets. In percentage terms the protection of employees, proprietors and owners as well as protection of business is so small that it is almost nonexistent. By analyzing historical data it has been decided that protection had always been behind the theft methods. It can also be concluded that the protection used to be efficient only for a limited and relatively short period of time. The problems of protection today lies in the fact that, being non-material, intangible assets does not actually need to be physically stolen so that the number of modalities of thefts and appropriation in different ways has considerably increased. Its protection today means adoption of such a massive protective system which, quite often, exceeds the capabilities of the owner. The significance of the intangible assets protection is best confirmed by the fact that is has been regulated in numerous multilateral as well as <b>bilateral</b> <b>conventions</b> and agreements. The law, actually, emerges as the basis, method and limitation of the intangible assets protection. Therefore, apart from being a special method, the law has been incorporated into many other methods of protection.

In order to eliminate international double taxation, Finland and People’s Republic of China have concluded a <b>bilateral</b> tax <b>convention</b> in 1987, and the latest amendment came into effect on January 2011. This study aims to clarify how the new treaty differs from FDI’s perspective with respect to the old treaty and the OECD Model Convention. The purpose of the study is also to research whether the tax treaty with China differs from the ones Finland has concluded with selected other Asian countries and whether the Chinese investments are in disadvantage compared to FDIs from other countries. DATA The key data used in this study consists of Finland’s agreements for the avoidance of double taxation concluded with China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. In addition the different updated versions of the OECD Model Convention and Commentary, which are used as a benchmark tax treaty, will cover an essential part of the research data. RESULTS The new treaty between Finland and China has made changes to the old treaty with regards to passive incomes and extending PE’s definition. The findings of this study suggest that most of the amendments made to the treaty had larger effects on Finnish enterprises than vice versa. Furthermore according to the analysis most of the differences with respect to the OECD Model, extending the source state’s taxing right, are due to PRC’s tax policy. Chinese FDIs are not in particular disadvantage compared to select other Asian countries. On the contrary, tax credit provisions included in the tax treaty and Mainland’s tax law could act as an investment incentive.

These are bi or multilateral acts resulted from the agreement of the states and are governed by the principle „Pacta sunt servanda”, representing the law of the parties which must be executed in good faith. Concretely in Romania, the extradition was regulated as a law institution, in art. 16 - 19 of the Criminal Code and in the art. 630 - 638 of the Procedure Criminal Code, Carol II of 1936, the texts mentioned above just consecrating the principles already known of the international penal law.

However, with the view that criminal law in most EU nations has its own specific and varied markings, and since a supranational criminal law does not exist, there has arisen a dire need for cooperation within this sphere. The globalization of transnational organized crime and its entry within the legal sector of these member countries has been the reason for the development of court cooperation within Europe.

Enforcement of arbitral awards in foreign countries is ensured and guaranteed by multilateral <b>conventions,</b> <b>bilateral</b> treaties and national legislation. The New York Convention 1958 in a certain way limits the scope of legal protection of arbitral awards and leaves the procedure for recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards for consideration of the state court. The author analyses of differentiation of the recognition and enforcement regime of so-called "domestic" and "foreign" solutions of international commercial arbitration in terms of doctrinal approaches and practice of foreign countries. Special attention is given to the analysis of foreign arbitral awards of recognition and enforcement procedures is given to a denial of recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and their reasons. In spite of the explicit grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in New York Convention 1958, some countries try to establish certain exceptions to the rule in the national legislation. Results may be applicable in improvement of international legal regulation. Conclusions. The courts of the countries – participants of the New York Convention 1958 cannot cancel the foreign arbitral award or revise it substantially. The refutation of this award is possible only in the court of the state in whose territory the relevant arbitral award was made, and such court is not formally bound by the rules of the New York Convention 1958, when deciding whether to cancel or modify the award. </p...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral tele- {{operation}} {{is one of}} a major part in robotics as well as in motion control. Most of the researchers have done experiments on bilateral tele-operation but still they haven’t given much attention on vibration suppression of bilateral tele-operation even though it’s important on latest technology. This research is mainly focuses on vibration suppression of bilateral control system. Initially a frequency response analysis is done to the bilateral control system to identify the natural frequency of the system. PD controller parameters, motor inertia, force coefficient and disturbance observer filter coefficient values are varied to identified the parameter effect of the system. By varying the parameter values cutoff frequency can be shifted to the left side. Those analyses depicts that the conventional bilateral control system has the capability to suppress vibrations up to some certain extent. Further suppression can be done by moving the cutoff frequency point to the left side while reducing the frequency bandwidth. This can be done by adding filters to the system. Bilateral control system mainly focuses on force and position responses of master and slave. So that slave environment vibrations can be reflected to the master side in both forms of position and force. System was tested with adding a position filter, force filter and finally the both filters. Vibrations of the system cannot be suppressed by using a position filter. Because its’ differing master and slave force response magnitudes. Above analysis was done by using the available hardware unit. According to the simulation and practical results of modified system with force filters gives good results and the cutoff frequency point is slightly shifted to the left side. But by adding filters to the system main equations of the <b>convention</b> <b>bilateral</b> control system are violated. New concept of virtual impedance controller is introduced to the system as another vibration suppression method. Rigid link in between master and slave is replaced by an impedance controller. This system also behaves as a bilateral control system but the force and position are controlled independently one after another. Through a frequency response analysis natural frequency of the new system is identified. Internal and external vibrations can be suppressed by changing the parameters of the virtual impedance controller along with PD controller parameters. Compared to the frequency responses of the conventional bilateral control system the modified system with virtual impedance controller frequency responses has a lower cutoff frequency value. Then the parameter effect is analyzed for the system with virtual impedance controller. By varying the PD parameters, spring coefficient and damping coefficient values, system cutoff frequency point can be adjusted. So that the unwanted vibrations of a bilateral control system can be suppressed by using the above method. The above analysis was verified with simulation results and practical results...|$|R
40|$|It {{was assumed}} {{in the mid}} 1990 s that 60 % of all global trade took place within a group of enterprises. With {{increased}} globalisation leading {{to an increase in}} mergers and acquisitions this figure is most likely higher. Thus intra-company and intra-group transactions form a major part of business. These transactions, due to the association between the enterprises, may not always reflect the conditions that a market with independent actors would dictate. There are various reasons for this, which include not only tax considerations but also difficulties in establishing conditions that reflect those that inde-pendent companies would apply, in other words conditions in accordance with the arm’s length principle. In cases where these conditions are not in accordance with what the state considers as an arm’s length price, the profits of the enterprise located in that state may be adjusted for taxation purposes under transfer pricing provisions. The complexity of transfer pricing rules and the various methods for establishing an arm’s length price result in different interpretations and increased uncertainty for multinational enterprises that often face different rules for determining a correct transfer price. Therefore, enterprises may often face transfer pricing adjustments of their profits due to the complexity and differences in transfer pricing legislation. Transfer pricing adjustments potentially lead to unresolved double taxation, in fact business reports have indicated that 42 % of the transfer pricing adjustments lead to double taxation. Therefore it is imperative to have legal mechanisms that resolve potential double taxation. The Convention on the Elimination of Double Taxation in Connection with the Adjustment of Profits of Associated Enterprises (Arbitration Convention) was adopted to give the multinational enterprises, facing double taxation due to adjustments of their profits, a remedy that obliged the states to resolve the double taxation. This was the first, and is still the only, EC-wide mechanism that technically guarantees that transfer pricing double taxation is resolved and thus holds a great improvement over other existing mechanisms to resolve double taxation. The Arbitration Convention was originally a proposed EC Directive but was transformed into a intergovernmental convention. This has resulted in that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has no jurisdiction to interpret the Arbitration Convention or its application. Furthermore there is no supranational or international organ that could take action against states that interpret or apply the Conven-tion in an unintended manner. The chosen legal form has also resulted in different interpretations as to what status the Arbitration Convention has compared to <b>bilateral</b> tax <b>conventions,</b> and thus whether it precedes them. This could prove troublesome when future bilateral treaties are concluded or where there already exist tax treaties that have different solutions to transfer pricing related double taxation. The risk of the Convention being interpreted differently is greatly increased by the various undefined terms and lack of precise provisions in the Convention. Therefore, the Convention has been subject to an inconsistent application and interpretation from the date it came into effect in 1995. The Convention was only given a five year life span, after which it was destined to be renewed if the contracting states so expressed, involving the same ratification process as at the initial acceptation of the Convention. However, as this was inefficient, a Prolongation Protocol was signed to amend the Convention with an automatic extension of its life. As it took till 2004 for this Protocol to be ratified and finally enter into force on 1 November 2004 it created one of the main interpretation and application differences {{in the life of the}} Convention. The function of the Convention’s procedures and thus its efficiency in resolving double taxation is impeded by the numerous interpretation differences and lack of precise pro-visions in the Convention. The fact that there is no way to guarantee that the provisions of the Convention are precisely followed, partly since there are uncertainties regarding the precise interpretation but also partly since there is no organ that could enforce a uniform application of the Convention, further impedes the efficiency of the Convention, which is clearly seen in practice. Another question of interpretation and application raised is that, although the Convention was originally intended as a means for resolving transfer pricing related double taxation, there have been arguments that the Convention could apply to double taxation due to provisions concerning thin capitalisation as well. These provisions bring about similar conditions as those the Convention requires for its applicability and, although a different area of law, the connections in the conditions are many and undeniable...|$|R
