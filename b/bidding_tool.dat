5000|$|On 19 August 2006 the New Zealand Listener {{published}} an article, [...] "Bidding War" [...] on one such developer. The developer, Ciaran Riddell, created {{a piece of}} software, AuctionBar, which used a technique known as screen scraping. The software allowed for more detailed searches for goods on sale as well as bids and updates via text-messaging and a tool known as a [...] "sniper", which acted as an automated <b>bidding</b> <b>tool.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Besides making single bids anytime, {{users can}} place a {{so-called}} [...] "Bidbutler", {{which is an}} automatic <b>bidding</b> <b>tool.</b> Users can employ a maximum of 50 Bidbutler bids each time. Once a Bidbutler is active, it will automatically bid in the final 10 seconds of the auction {{in an attempt to}} keep the user as the highest bidder. This means if two or more Bidbutlers are active they will repeatedly bid against each other (before the auction time increment is applied) until the one with the most bids left is the [...] "winner". Bidbutler bids hold no more value than single manually placed bids, so once the bids booked for a Bidbutler are exhausted a single manually placed bid can become the winning bid.|$|E
5000|$|DealDash, {{like other}} auction sites, has been {{described}} as a gamified approach to e-commerce. To participate, registered bidders first buy [...] "bids" [...] priced at $0.60 each, that they may spend bidding on auctions. Standard auctions begin with an opening price of $0.00, with every bid placed increasing the price by $0.01 and removing one paid [...] "bid credit" [...] from the user's balance. Bidders may choose to place single bids, by manually clicking the bid button, or through an automatic <b>bidding</b> <b>tool</b> called the [...] "BidBuddy". An auction clock restarts from a maximum of 10-30 seconds, depending on the auction, every time a bid is placed. If no new bids are placed before the clock runs out, the last and highest bidder is declared the winner of the auction.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea was}} {{developed}} independently in 1963 by David Cliff, {{the first to}} write about it, and Dorothy Hayden Truscott; it grew out of two earlier <b>bidding</b> <b>tools,</b> the Fragment <b>bid</b> and the Void-Showing bid.|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{hydropower}} {{planning and}} bidding under uncertainty {{is a complicated}} task. The problem became more challenging with the liberalized market environment within the last two decades. Apart from this new reform {{taking place in the}} electricity market, the electricity market participants including hydropower producers experienced the second change in the form of intermittent wind power integration into power systems. Thus, previous decision support tools are not capable of fulfilling market participants’ expectations in the new competitive and highly uncertain environment. Intermittent power sources, namely wind power, increase the imbalances in the power system, which in turn increases the need of the regulating power sources. Being a flexible energy source, hydropower can provide regulating power. For this purpose, new hydropower planning and bidding models must be developed, capable of addressing uncertainties and the dynamics existing within market places. In this dissertation, a set of new short-term hydropower planning and bidding models are developed for sequential electricity markets under price uncertainties. Developed stochastic coordinated hydropower planning and <b>bidding</b> <b>tools</b> can be classified into two classes, as models with exogenousand endogenous prices. In the first class, developed coordinated <b>bidding</b> <b>tools</b> address the price uncertainties using scenario trees, which are built based on the distribution function of the unknown variables. Thus, the proposed coordinated <b>bidding</b> and planning <b>tools</b> consider all possible future prices and market outcomes together with the likelihood of these market outcomes. To reflect the continuously clearing nature of intra-day and real-time markets rolling planning is applied. In addition, models apply risk measures as another way to hedge against uncertain prices. In the second class, hydropower stochastic strategic bidding models are developed using stochastic bi-level optimization methodology. Here market prices are calculated internally as dual variables of the load balance constraints in the lower level ED problems. To be able to solve the stochastic bilevel optimization problem, KKT optimality conditions are applied. By this transformation the problem is converted to a single-level stochastic program, which is simplified further using a corresponding discretization technique. QC 20160922 </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems in liberalized electricity markets depends both on uncertain electricity prices and uncertain heat demand. In the future, uncertainty {{is going to}} increase due to the increased intermittent power induced by renewable energy sources. Therefore, the need for improved planning and <b>bidding</b> <b>tools</b> is highly important for CHP producers. This paper applies an optimal bidding model under the uncertainties of day-ahead market prices and the heat demand. The problem is formulated in a stochastic programming framework where future scenarios of the random variables are considered in order to handle the uncertainties. A case study is performed and conclusions are derived about the CHP operation {{and the need for}} heat storage. QC 20141208 </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} into Reverse Auction Bidding (RAB) {{is the first}} of the twenty four studies completed to this time to use an individual with personality type Idealist specifically against other personality types. Amongst all studies, result of one of the previous studies showed that personality type Idealist won over personality type Guardian {{and it was the first}} where this unexpected result was observed. This study attempts to verify the previous finding that an Idealist performs better than a Guardian, as Guardians are the usual winners. RAB is a new form of bidding using internet as the <b>bidding</b> <b>tool.</b> In RAB the buyer and a set of sellers adopt a slightly different role than in Forward Auction. This study used four students from the Department of Construction Science at Texas A&M University as the subjects of the work. Specific details of the game are that each bidder has capacity to bid on three jobs at any time. All bidders initially have a bank amount of $ 40, 000 and can buy additional capacity from the bank to increase the number of allowed simultaneous bids. Each game lasts for twenty minutes, fifteen minutes of game play followed by a five minute break. In each study, each individual participant was given a personality test, Keirsey Temperament Sorter Test. All the participants were identified to be Guardians in this study. There was no individual with personality type Idealist. This is possible because of low proportion of Idealists? in general. The original hypothesis looked to determine the impact of Idealists, but as will all research one must deal with the hand dealt. The study of four Guardians is in itself of interest and tolerably rare event, so the study looked at four Guardians. The implicit hypothesis in this study is that Guardians should all be economically efficient bidders. It has been observed that when Guardians play against other personality type they outperform but when Guardians play against each other the profit drops significantly. This is an interesting problem, why do Guardians perform poorly against other Guardians should be the subject of further research. The next stage is to look to the sub-groups within the Guardian personality type. The bidders with characteristic property ISTJ according to the Test, or also called Inspector, were more competitive than other Guardians. Further work is recommended to understand the behavior difference and bid pattern for sub categories of Guardians...|$|E
40|$|Electricity {{industries}} worldwide {{are undergoing}} {{a period of}} profound upheaval. The conventional vertically integrated mechanism is being replaced by a competitive market environment. Generation companies have incentives to apply novel technologies to lower production costs, for example: Combined Cycle units. Economic dispatch with Combined Cycle units becomes a non-convex optimization problem, which is difficult if not impossible to solve by conventional methods. Several techniques are proposed here: Mixed Integer Linear Programming, a hybrid method, as well as Evolutionary Algorithms. Evolutionary Algorithms share a common mechanism, stochastic searching per generation. The stochastic property makes evolutionary algorithms robust and adaptive enough to solve a non-convex optimization problem. This research implements GA, EP, and PS algorithms for economic dispatch with Combined Cycle units, and makes a comparison with classical Mixed Integer Linear Programming.;The electricity market equilibrium model not only helps Independent System Operator/Regulator analyze market performance and market power, but also provides Market Participants the ability to build optimal bidding strategies based on Microeconomics analysis. Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE) is attractive compared to traditional models. This research identifies a proper SFE model, which {{can be applied to}} a multiple period situation. The equilibrium condition using discrete time optimal control is then developed for fuel resource constraints. Finally, the research discusses the issues of multiple equilibria and mixed strategies, which are caused by the transmission network. Additionally, an advantage of the proposed model for merchant transmission planning is discussed.;A market simulator is a valuable training and evaluation tool to assist sellers, buyers, and regulators to understand market performance and make better decisions. A traditional optimization model {{may not be enough to}} consider the distributed, large-scale, and complex energy market. This research compares the performance and searching paths of different artificial life techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Programming (EP), and Particle Swarm (PS), and look for a proper method to emulate Generation Companies 2 ̆ 7 (GENCOs) bidding strategies.;After deregulation, GENCOs face risk and uncertainty associated with the fast-changing market environment. A profit-based bidding decision support system is critical for GENCOs to keep a competitive position in the new environment. Most past research do not pay special attention to the piecewise staircase characteristic of generator offer curves. This research proposes an optimal bidding strategy based on Parametric Linear Programming. The proposed algorithm is able to handle actual piecewise staircase energy offer curves. The proposed method is then extended to incorporate incomplete information based on Decision Analysis. Finally, the author develops an optimal <b>bidding</b> <b>tool</b> (GenBidding) and applies it to the RTS 96 test system...|$|E

50|$|The AutoForm {{products}} {{are divided into}} various solutions targeted at areas of application along the Sheet Metal Engineering Process Chain. These solutions address Product Design, Planning and <b>Bidding,</b> <b>Tooling,</b> and Production. At {{the core of the}} AutoForm solutions is Finite Element Analysis solver technology applied to sheet metal forming simulation. AutoForm utilizes an Incremental Solver for its solutions for Tooling and Production, while using Inverse One-step solver for Planning and Bidding, and Product Design. The application of the different solvers is to address the differences in available input information for the different phases of the process chain. During product design and planning limited information is available for design analysis; part geometry, material thickness, and mechanical properties. Therefore, the use of an inverse one-step is appropriate and timely method to evaluate the feasibility of the part design. During tooling development and production support tooling geometry is available and therefore incremental simulation should be applied as a manufacturability check.|$|R

40|$|Many {{applications}} of Biologically-Inspired Design (BID) are well-known and research is increasingly focusing on methodologies towards systematic BID. However, currently no ideation tool exists that {{is able to}} leverage the large textual biological resources in a scalable way to propose a selection of biological strategies that are interesting for a specific design problem under focus. This paper first identifies the main bottleneck preventing the realization of such a scalable <b>BID</b> ideation <b>tool</b> by analyzing the state-of-the-art in systematic BID. It is observed that most work focuses on developing detailed models of, both biological and engineering systems, which enable support during knowledge transfer between the two domains. However, the automated instantiation of these models for a large collection of biological strategies currently {{remains an open question}} and domain experts are necessary to complete this time-consuming and expensive task. Therefore, a new approach is proposed that uses a conceptual representation of the biological domain to identify candidate biological strategies as input for the transfer phase. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|To {{maximize}} {{success and}} achieve scale, automated bid management {{systems can be}} deployed. These systems can be used directly by the advertiser, though they are more commonly used by advertising agencies that offer PPC bid management as a service. These tools generally allow for bid management at scale, with thousands or even millions of PPC bids controlled by a highly automated system. The system generally sets each bid based on the goal that has been set for it, such as maximize profit, maximize traffic, get the very targeted customer at break even, and so forth. The system is usually tied into the advertiser's website and fed the results of each click, which then allows it to set bids. The effectiveness of these systems {{is directly related to}} the quality and quantity of the performance data that they have to work with — low-traffic ads can lead to a scarcity of data problem that renders many <b>bid</b> management <b>tools</b> useless at worst, or inefficient at best.|$|R
50|$|Modern wire {{wrapping}} technology was developed after WWII at Bell Laboratories {{as a means}} of making electrical connections in a new relay being designed for use in the Bell Telephone system. A design team headed by Arthur C. Keller developed the “Keller Wrap Gun”, and the entire wrap system was passed over to Western Electric for execution. After a “make or buy” committee at Western Electric decided to have the hand tool manufactured by an outside vendor, Western Electric sent the tool contract out for <b>bids.</b> Keller <b>Tool</b> of Grand Haven, Michigan, a supplier of rotary hand tools to Western Electric, won the contract and made several design changes to make the tool easier to manufacture and to use. Keller began manufacturing the tools in 1953, and subsequently obtained a license from Western Electric allowing sale of the technology on the open market. The tool was marketed under its original name - since the name of the manufacturer was coincidentally the same as the name of the inventor.|$|R

40|$|Deregulating {{electricity}} markets {{around the world}} in the search for efficiency has introduced competition into the electricity marke- ting and generation business.

40|$|An {{important}} goal of China’s {{electric power system}} reform {{is to create a}} double-side day-ahead wholesale electricity market in the future, where the suppliers (represented by GenCOs) and demanders (represented by DisCOs) compete simultaneously with each other in one market. Therefore, modeling and simulating the dynamic bidding process and the equilibrium in the double-side day-ahead electricity market scientifically is not only important to some developed countries, but also to China to provide a <b>bidding</b> decision-making <b>tool</b> to help GenCOs and DisCOs obtain more profits in market competition. Meanwhile, it can also provide an economic analysis tool to help government officials design the proper market mechanisms and policies. The traditional dynamic game model and table-based reinforcement learning algorithm have already been employed in the day-ahead electricity market modeling. However, those models are based on some assumptions, such as taking the probability distribution function of market clearing price (MCP) and each rival’s bidding strategy as common knowledge (in dynamic game market models), and assuming the discrete state and action sets of every agent (in table-based reinforcement learning market models), which are no longer applicable in a realistic situation. In this paper, a modified reinforcement learning method, called gradient descent continuous Actor-Critic (GDCAC) algorithm was employed in the double-side day-ahead electricity market modeling and simulation. This algorithm can not only get rid of the abovementioned unrealistic assumptions, but also cope with the Markov decision-making process with continuous state and action sets just like the real electricity market. Meanwhile, the time complexity of our proposed model is only O(n). The simulation result of employing the proposed model in the double-side day-ahead electricity market shows the superiority of our approach in terms of participant’s profit or social welfare compared with traditional reinforcement learning methods...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{management}} and engineering is generally {{thought of as}} a purely technical part of construction management consisting of bar charts, scheduling, estimates and <b>bidding.</b> While these <b>tools</b> may guide a company to construct a project, the management skills and techniques employed are generally not enough to ensure the success and optimization of a construction project. A successful construction project manager needs three skills that are separate but nonetheless interrelated and interdependent. These skills are 1.) Leadership skills, 2.) General management skills, and: 3.) Construction engineering and technical management skills. While civil engineers are expected to be competent in construction management skills, areas of expertise in project leadership, organizational alignment and general management are lacking. Organizational alignment is the congruence and compatibility of the various activities in a construction project and determines the outcome of success or failure. This looks at the external environment in which the firm operates and the internal capabilities that it can offer. It is important that the needs of the various stakeholders in a project are satisfactorily met to ensure project success. This paper aims to describe the leadership and general management skills that are necessary for the successful completion of projects. The strategic fit that is necessary to ensure project success is described through a strategic alignment methodology. This simple process can be used by construction engineers to ensure that their project takes into account both the external environment and the congruence of internal processes within the organization...|$|R
