6000|$|In {{the days}} of the Expedition, Nkulu had but one ruler, of whom Tuckey says (p. 148), that he found less pomp and noise, but much more civility and {{hospitality}} than from the richer kings he had visited. Now there are three who require their [...] "dashes," [...] and each has his linguister, who must not be passed by without notice. Moreover, as population and luxury have increased on the line of route, <b>bark-cloth</b> has disappeared and even the slaves are dressed in cottons. We waited, patiently hungry, till 4 P.M. because the interpreters had gone on some [...] "fish palaver" [...] to the river. At that hour a procession of some two hundred and fifty men headed by a drum and Chingufu (cymbal-bells) defiled before us, crowding round three umbrellas, trade-articles in the last stage of [...] "seediness." [...] These comforts protected from the sun, which was deep hid behind a purple nimbus, an equal number of great men in absurd red nightcaps or old felt wideawakes, shirts of coloured cotton, and second-hand waistcoats of silk or satin. The only signs of luxury were here and there a well-carved ebony stick, and a gunstock resplendent with brass tacks. All sat down in a semi-circle before us, six or seven deep in front and four or five at the sides: the women and children took their places in the rear, and one of them fondled a prick-eared cur with an attempt at a ribbon round its neck.|$|E

40|$|Background: Paper {{mulberry}} {{has been}} used for thousands of years in Asia and Oceania for making paper and <b>bark-cloth,</b> respectively. Museums around the world hold valuable collections of Polynesian <b>bark-cloth.</b> Genetic analysis of the plant fibers from which the textiles were made may answer a number of questions of interest related to provenance, authenticity or species used in the manufacture of these textiles. Recovery of nucleic acids from paper mulberry <b>bark-cloth</b> has not been reported before. Methodology: We describe a simple method for the extraction of PCR-amplifiable DNA from small samples of contemporary Polynesian <b>bark-cloth</b> (tapa) using two types of nuclear markers. We report the amplification of about 300 bp sequences of the ITS 1 region and of a microsatellite marker. Conclusions: Sufficient DNA was retrieved from all <b>bark-cloth</b> samples to permit successful PCR amplification. This method shows a means of obtaining useful genetic information from modern <b>bark-cloth</b> samples and opens perspectives for the analyses of small fragments derived from ethnographic materials...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{increased}} interest {{in the study of}} the history of African textiles since the last quarter of the past century, less attention has been paid to the study of <b>bark-cloth,</b> a fabric design tradition that predates the technology of weaving. Made by way of stripping, scraping and beating the inner bark of certain plants, most commonly the ficlus species, <b>bark-cloth</b> served various socio-cultural functions among different ethnic communities in Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, and in the Polynesian islands of the Southern Pacific. This study examines the notion of continuity and change in the role and meaning of <b>bark-cloth</b> of the Baganda people of the kingdom of Buganda in southern Uganda, in East Africa, from the late eighteenth-century to the early twenty-first century. Used in various forms, including among others, as a shroud. and during the investiture of the heir to the throne, and to the heads of the independent family units. <b>bark-cloth</b> has continued to serve as a connecting thread between the past and present generations of the Baganda society. However. the study also reveals that the role and meaning of <b>bark-cloth</b> of the Baganda is no longer confined within the cultural boundaries; other factors have come into play since the mid nineteenth-century when the external (non-African) communities first infiltrated the interior of East Africa. It has been argued that the role and meaning of <b>bark-cloth</b> of the Baganda is in a continuous flux contingent on the dynamics of the social. economic. cultural and political structures at a given historical moment in Buganda. Hence. the study analises the extent of Swahili-Arab influence. Western Christianity, colonialism and education, international tourism, intra-regional and regional trade, and local politics to the redefinition of <b>bark-cloth</b> of the Baganda in the past almost two and half centuries. The study makes an important and necessary contribution to scholarship of the history of East African textiles and material culture. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bark-cloth</b> is the {{traditional}} art of the women of Vatulele. Though many Fijian artforms have declined or disappeared, Vatulele's production of <b>bark-cloth</b> has increased steadily for over forty years. Its commercialisation as a tourist souvenir has been widely credited for this, but it is shown here that while this did initially stimulate production, today it accounts for a relatively small proportion of output, most remaining within the indigenous domain. A survey {{of the literature on}} tourism fails to produce credible explanations for why this is occurring, and this thesis seeks answers in the continuing indigenous social role of <b>bark-cloth.</b> First at a theoretical level, and then in relation to Fiji and Vatulele, the social role of art is argued both semiotically and historically to relate to intentionally embedded and inscribed meaning. Today, bark-cloth's greatest importance is as ritual art — as symbolic paraphernalia, vestments, and as an official valuable in the inter-group goods presentations fundamental to Fijian ritual. Ritual is therefore also examined both theoretically and from empirical Vatulele data. It is shown to also be increasing, both in Vatulele and the wider Fijian community, and much of the increased <b>bark-cloth</b> production is to supply this ritual. However, it is argued that the underlying demand relates to the role both art and ritual play in constructing, maintaining, and negotiating changes in social identity. Social identity is defined here in terms of the constantly evolving inter-relationship of the group's history, collective bonds, solidarity, and norms. In small, face-to-face societies, these structures are clearly defined, yet susceptible to rapid change and erosion. The evolution of Vatulelean identity is explored, and the impact of the external forces of colonialism, capitalism, tourism and the communications explosion are analysed. In mobilising their traditional mechanisms such as art and ritual, Fijians are argued to be attempting to maintain steerage of their identity, community solidarity, and social norms in times of increasingly rapid change. It is shown that, in addition to exchanging it ritually, Vatuleleans had long traded their <b>bark-cloth</b> as a commodity. This positioned them well to capitalise on the emergent tourist market, and subsequently the burgeoning indigenous market, resulting in considerable prosperity. But on the case made here, the demand is less a cultural revitalisation than an attempt to mitigate increasing social and cultural stress. That may be a dubious foundation for longterm security...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Museum {{has one of}} the world’s {{largest and}} most {{significant}} Melanesian collections with particular strengths in cultural material from Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. One of the prime goals of the Australian Museum is to develop new ways of unlocking these collections. The aim is to provide increased access and engagement with the creator communities, in order to rejuvenate the traditional arts of creator communities, {{while at the same time}} documenting and preserving the intangible knowledge linked to the cultural material. As part of this initiative the Australian Museum has instigated a program whereby cultural leaders from Pacific Island Communities visit the collections to add their stories and take back relevant information and images. Two examples are described here. The first details visits by Chief Jerry Taki and Ms. Sophie Nemban from the island of Erromango in Vanuatu. The visits focused on the Erromangan men’s and women’s cultural material held at the museum. Several aspects of this long term project including the rejuvenation of traditional <b>bark-cloth</b> as well as the enrichment of intangible heritage information associated with the museum collections are described. The second example relates to the visit by Mr. Lawrence Foana’ota a cultural leader from the Solomon Islands and how this has led to a digital repatriation and community engagement project in the Solomon Islands...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{mulberry}} (Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) L'Hér. ex Vent) is a dioecious tree {{native to}} East Asia and mainland Southeast-Asia, introduced prehistorically to Polynesia {{as a source}} of bark fiber by Austronesian-speaking voyagers. In Oceania, trees are coppiced and harvested for production of <b>bark-cloth,</b> so flowering is generally unknown. A survey of botanical records of paper mulberry revealed a distributional disjunction: the tree is apparently absent in Borneo and the Philippines. A subsequent study of chloroplast haplotypes linked paper mulberry of Remote Oceania directly to a population in southern Taiwan, distinct from known populations in mainland Southeast-Asia. We describe the optimization and use of a DNA marker designed to identify sex in paper mulberry. We used this marker to determine the sex distribution in selected localities across Asia, Near and Remote Oceania. We also characterized all samples using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequence (ITS) in order to relate results to a previous survey of ITS diversity. In Near and Remote Oceania, contemporary paper mulberry plants are all female with the exception of Hawaii, where plants of both sexes are found. In its natural range in Asia, male and female plants are found, as expected. Male plants in Hawaii display an East Asian ITS genotype, consistent with modern introduction, while females in Remote Oceania share a distinctive variant. Most paper mulberry plants now present in the Pacific appear to be descended from female clones introduced prehistorically. In Hawaii, the presence of male and female plants is thought to reflect a dual origin, one a prehistoric female introduction and the other a modern male introduction by Japanese/Chinese immigrants. If only female clones were dispersed from a source-region in Taiwan, this may explain the absence of botanical records and breeding populations in the Philippines and Borneo, and Remote Oceania...|$|E

40|$|It is {{apparent}} that in Buganda, art produced in the studio is detached from its community. This realization undermines the basic tenets of the indigenous systems of knowledge generation, acquisition, and practical usability, which enabled Ganda society to enjoy the benefits accrued from its cultural constellations. Any culture comprises unique and specific sets of beliefs, values, and norms that distinguish it from other cultures, and within these a priori institutions, individuals and groups adroitly realize their own physiological, psychological, and social needs. One of the requirements that humans rely on to cater for their needs, is art, which is fundamental {{at all levels of}} human development. Roger Fry, (cited in, Howells, 2003) notes that people have two kinds of life: “the actual and the imaginative, and the work of art was ‘intimately connected’ with the second” (p. 35). The Baganda in order to satisfy this set of human requirements developed an art form, which was mainly instrumental in satisfying functional needs as well as spiritual concerns. The Baganda, out of dire need to fit into the social and psychological worlds, established strategic systems of bodily practice and oral culture that they used for pedagogy, communication and propagation of knowledge structures across generations. Having survived since the 14 th century when Kato Kintu reportedly first came to Buganda, these strategies could not last long especially when the Ganda people adapted to new ideologies that missionaries, Arab and Indian traders, and explorers brought to Buganda. 1 Roscoe (1921) writes: “…the beautiful <b>bark-cloth</b> dress of the women has also given place to tawdry blouses and skirts introduced by Indian traders. …” (pp. 100 - 101). Further, “Arab traders taught the locals to read Swahili in Arabic characters; “Before this, no Muganda knew any system of transmitting his thoughts to writing or of making any permanent records…” (Roscoe, pp. 100 - 101). Father Lourdel through Mackay persuaded the king to sanction the worship of pictures: “Hence arose the enthusiasm of the Baganda for medals, scapulars, and other images distributed by missionaries” (Lugira, 1970, p. 155 - 157). This enthusiasm arose {{as a result of the}} king’s as “master and center of everything in Buganda” was in favor of the pictures. By so doing, many of the local systems of perpetuating life within communities gradually slid into oblivion, giving way to alien tenets that accelerated local histories. Communities became increasingly detached from their indigenous ways of life and among those values that suffered the alien invasion was art. This study therefore, attempts to rediscover some of the effective tools that the Baganda used to maintain all faculties of their society functionally together. This study proposes Oral Culture as a tool necessary to redefine the links between art and its community. It further proposes Remix as a means of reemphasizing the oral. The overall purpose in this study is to describe the ways in which narrative and remix aesthetics could aid in the constitution of meaning in plastic arts, which would in turn continue indigenous knowledge. I will argue that since narrative is an effective communicative tool, then it would be vital in forging a relevant and understandable visual culture to its community. In support, I will also argue that since Ganda material culture is familiar and locally accessible, then it will be influential in constituting visualization of narrative representations specific and thus adapted to their own locales. Although I do not level any claim against significantly changing something, in my study, people’s perceptions find renewed hope: the frames that once made gates turned out fully pledged and autonomous artworks; the doors mutated into narratives; and cloth became drapery–no longer off cuts. Tradition is dismantled and waist beads worn as necklaces. Questions flare. Ganda artifact is used in new situations but still in its old casing: this attracts attention of the passersby, while stories mutate into tangible ‘things’–for those who never had a chance of ‘seeing’ them. Reflection becomes part of process: Kato Kintu reflects history while Kintu maintains legend; Kaleeba emphasizes tradition while Matyansi Butyampa and Sewandeku focus on reality. Many reflections from various viewpoints that I cannot conclusively recount in this short text, form part of the transformation experienced in artistic research most of the time missed by ‘scientific’ methods. In general, the artistic project breaks with tradition and plies its own route. I received comments of uniqueness and novelty as a result...|$|E
