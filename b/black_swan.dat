5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> as a charge {{in the first quarter}} and <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> crest) and Bunbury (1959, <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation of a <b>black</b> <b>swan,</b> presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.|$|E
5|$|Incidental philatelic {{illustrations}} of the <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> include the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games (held in Perth) stamp issue bearing the Arms of the City of Perth with <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> supporters and charge, a 1963 commemorative of Canberra's founding featuring the city's arms, with <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> supporter, and the 1990 series of rare colonial stamps {{that included a}} reproduction of the colonial 4d Blue Inverted Swan. The <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> appears in stamp issues illustrating the Australian Arms (as one of the charges on the shield) in 1948, 1951, 1975 and 1999; and in a 1981 Queen’s Birthday commemorative illustrating Her Majesty’s personal flag (which is banner of the shield in the Australian Arms).|$|E

5|$|The {{taking of}} <b>black</b> <b>swans</b> to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} another aspect of European mythology: the {{attribution}} of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a <b>black</b> cat. <b>Black</b> <b>swans</b> {{were considered to be}} a witch's familiar and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk.

5|$|The {{transfer}} of postage-stamp production {{from the states}} to the Commonwealth in 1913 has resulted in four issues being produced featuring a <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> design, three commemorating a Western Australian anniversary. In 1929, a stamp designed by Perth architect George Pitt Morrison, featuring a <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> taken {{from one of the}} colonial stamp designs, marked the state's centenary. In 1954, the centenary of the first Western Australian stamp was marked by a commemorative issue in a similar style to the original one-penny <b>Black</b> <b>Swan.</b> In 1979, the state's 150th anniversary was marked with an issue featuring the anniversary logo, a stylised <b>black</b> <b>swan.</b> A 1991 series of waterbirds included a 43-cent stamp showing a pair of black swans nesting with cygnets. This is the only philatelic recognition of the black swan's cultural values in eastern Australia as an emblem of estuarine and riverine environments characteristic of south-eastern Australia.|$|E

5|$|Images of the <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> {{played only}} a minor role in the {{development}} of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> is in a design for a fountain. A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the <b>black</b> <b>swan</b> is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.|$|E

30|$|Anticipating {{the impacts}} of <b>black</b> <b>swans</b> and X-events is {{difficult}} {{because there is no}} historical precedent [36]. The aspect of surprise may be viewed as a relational one: <b>black</b> <b>swans,</b> X-events or wild cards should be assessed as relative to one’s worldview, knowledge and beliefs [2, 46]. <b>Black</b> <b>swans,</b> X-events or wild cards cannot thus be foreseen, but they can be imagined and described {{within the context of the}} observer. One also has to bear in mind that large technological, infrastructural, or economic transitions – like the transition to a neo-carbon economy – imply not only changes in the built landscape but equally deep tectonic shifts in the mental landscape.

30|$|Instead of trends, Futures Research pays {{increasing}} {{attention to}} <b>black</b> <b>swans</b> and wild cards (see above) and weak signals. Weak signals are signs – such as events, {{new technologies and}} novel practices – pointing to possibly emerging issues and phenomena which can either strengthen or wither away as time passes [61, 62]. They are the first symptoms of important discontinuities, warning signs, or new possibilities [63]. This is understandable, as future is about change, and most novel and exciting things emerge from weak signals and <b>black</b> <b>swans.</b> Weak signals are important indicators for upcoming potential change, impending wild cards or <b>black</b> <b>swans.</b> If they are properly identified, {{they can be used}} to discover latent processes, potential discontinuities (see below) and to give hints as to the approach of wild cards or <b>black</b> <b>swans</b> [28, 31, 64]. From this point of view, they are of utmost practical advantage as early warning signals [65].|$|R
