50|$|Carrion’s disease, {{also known}} as <b>Bartonellosis,</b> is a disease caused by the {{blood-borne}} bacteria, Bartonella bacilliformis. The disease is transmitted by the sand fly species Lutzomyia verracarum, as well as lice and fleas, and is found in areas of Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. The lifecycle of the bacteria within Lutzomyia sand flies remain largely unknown, with speculation that the bacteria are spread between sandflies sharing the same breeding grounds and water supplies. The existence of <b>Bartonellosis</b> transmission in areas not inhabited by Lutzomyia verracarum suggests that secondary vectors, and potentially other Lutzomyia species, are important in {{the spread of the}} disease.|$|E

50|$|Bartonella henselae, {{formerly}} Rochalimæa, is a proteobacterium {{that can}} cause bacteremia, endocarditis, bacillary angiomatosis, and peliosis hepatis. It is also the causative agent of cat-scratch disease (<b>bartonellosis)</b> which, as the name suggests, occurs after a cat bite or scratch. The disease is characterized by lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes) and fever.|$|E
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms of}} <b>bartonellosis</b> are pleomorphic and some patients from endemic areas may be asymptomatic. The two classical clinical presentations are the acute phase and the chronic phase, {{corresponding to the}} two different host cell types invaded by the bacterium (red blood cells and endothelial cells). An individual can be affected by either or both phases.|$|E
50|$|The Jarisch-Herxheimer {{reaction}} is classically associated with penicillin treatment of syphilis. Duration in syphilis is normally {{only a few}} hours. The {{reaction is}} also seen in other diseases caused by spirochetes, such as borreliosis (Lyme disease and tick-borne relapsing fever) and leptospirosis, and in Q fever. Similar reactions have also been reported to occur in <b>bartonellosis</b> (including cat scratch disease), brucellosis, typhoid fever, trichinosis, and cerebral trypanosomiasis.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} {{smallpox}} on Tahuantinsuyu (or the Inca empire) {{were even more}} devastating. Beginning in Colombia, smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Within months, the disease had killed the Incan Emperor Huayna Capac, his successor, {{and most of the}} other leaders. Two of his surviving sons warred for power and, after a bloody and costly war, Atahualpa become the new emperor. As Atahualpa was returning to the capital Cuzco, Francisco Pizarro arrived and through a series of deceits captured the young leader and his best general. Within a few years smallpox claimed between 60% and 90% of the Inca population, with other waves of European disease weakening them further. A handful of historians argue that a disease called <b>Bartonellosis</b> might have been responsible for some outbreaks of illness, but this opinion is in the scholarly minority. The effects of <b>Bartonellosis</b> were depicted in the ceramics of the Moche people of ancient Peru.|$|E

40|$|Background: Bartonella henselae (B. henselae) is {{considered}} a rare cause of granulomatous hepatitis. Due to the fastidious growth characteristics of the bacteria, the limited sensitivity of histopathological stains, and the nonspecific histological findings on liver biopsy, the diagnosis of hepatic <b>bartonellosis</b> {{can be difficult to}} establish. Furthermore, the optimal treatment of established hepatic <b>bartonellosis</b> remains controversial. Case presentation: We present a case of hepatic <b>bartonellosis</b> in an immunocompetent woman who presented with right upper quadrant pain and a five cm right hepatic lobe mass on CT scan. The patient underwent a right hepatic lobectomy. Surgical pathology revealed florid necrotizing granulomatous hepatitis, favoring an infectious etiology. Despite extensive histological and serological evaluation a definitive diagnosis was not established initially. Thirteen months after initial presentation, hepatic <b>bartonellosis</b> was diagnosed by PCR studies from surgically excised liver tissue. Interestingly, the hepatic granulomas persisted and Bartonella henselae was isolated from the patient’s enriched blood culture after several courses of antibiotic therapy. Conclusion: The diagnosis of hepatic <b>bartonellosis</b> is exceedingly difficult to establish and requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. Recently developed, PCR-based approaches may be required in select patients to make the diagnosis. The optimal antimicrobial therapy for hepatic <b>bartonellosis</b> has not been established, and close follow-up is needed to ensure successful eradication of the infection...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bartonellosis</b> {{remains a}} major problem in Peru, but many {{contemporary}} aspects of this disease have not been adequately described. We examined the cases of 145 symptomatic patients in Lima, Peru, in whom <b>bartonellosis</b> was diagnosed from 1969 through 1992, including 68 patients in the acute (hematic) phase and 77 patients in the eruptive (verruga) phase. In modern Peru, symptomatic patients who have acute-phase <b>bartonellosis</b> typically present with a febrile illness and systemic symptoms caused by profound anemia; most patients respond successfully to treatment with chloramphenicol. Patients who have eruptive-phase <b>bartonellosis</b> most often present with cutaneous verrugas but may have less specific symptoms, such as fever and arthralgias; diagnosis can be confirmed in such patients by Western immunoblotting, and most patients appear to respond to treatment with rifampin. <b>Bartonellosis,</b> or Carrión’s disease, is a bacterial infection that was recognized in the pre-Columbian era and re-mains endemic in some river valleys of the Andes Moun-tains of Peru, as well as in some regions of Colombia and Ecuador [1, 2].

40|$|Two simple Bartonella bacilliformis {{immunoblot}} {{preparation methods}} were developed. Antigen was prepared by two different methods: sonication of whole organisms or glycine extraction. Both methods were then tested for sensitivity and specificity. Well-defined control sera were utilized {{in the development}} of these diagnostic immunoblots, and possible cross-reactions were thoroughly examined. Sera investigated for cross-reaction with these diagnostic antigens were drawn from patients with brucellosis, chlamydiosis, Q fever, and cat scratch disease, all of whom were from regions where <b>bartonellosis</b> is not endemic. While both immunoblots yielded reasonable sensitivity and high specificity, we recommend the use of the sonicated immunoblot, which has a higher sensitivity when used to detect acute disease and produces fewer cross-reactions. The sonicated immunoblot reported here is 94 % sensitive to chronic <b>bartonellosis</b> and 70 % sensitive to acute <b>bartonellosis.</b> In a healthy group, it is 100 % specific.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of a seven-year-old immunocompetent female patient who {{developed}} systemic symptoms mimicking an autoimmune rather than an infectious disease. The patient presented with rash, biquotidian fever, night sweats, and arthralgias. There was no antecedent history of cat contact. Investigations showed increased inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, hypercalcemia, and raised angiotensin-converting enzyme. Interferon-gamma releasing assay for tuberculosis infection was negative. Abdominal imaging demonstrated multifocal lesions of the liver and spleen (later proved to be granulomata), chest X-ray showed enlarged hilar lymph nodes, and ophthalmology review revealed uveitis. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features pointed towards sarcoidosis. Subsequently, raised titers (IgM 1 : 32, IgG 1 : 256) against Bartonella confirmed the diagnosis of B. henselae infection. She was treated with gentamycin followed by ciprofloxacin; repeat investigations showed complete resolution of findings. The presence of hepatic and splenic lesions in children with <b>bartonellosis</b> is well documented. Our case, however, exhibited certain unusual findings such as the coexistence of acute ocular and systemic involvement in an immunocompetent host. Serological testing is an inexpensive and effective way to diagnose <b>bartonellosis</b> in immunocompetent patients; we suggest that bartonella serology is included in the baseline tests performed on children with prolonged fever {{even in the absence of}} contact with cats in countries where <b>bartonellosis</b> is prevalent...|$|E
