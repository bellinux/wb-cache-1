5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|A single {{disassembled}} de Havilland DH.60 Moth floatplane was {{stored in}} the aircraft hold between the forward superstructure and the mainmast. Its components would be moved from the hold by the aircraft crane to the after deck where it could <b>be</b> <b>assembled.</b> Then the aircraft would be swayed over the side where it could be launched.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} treasures are later copies {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the Eiga Monogatari, the complete content of the works has to <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> from several of these (and other) fragmentary manuscripts or be inferred from other sources. The Kojiki, long neglected by scholars until the 18th century, was not preserved as well as the Nihon Shoki which has been studied from soon after its compilation. While being the oldest text in this list, the extant manuscript dating to the 14th century is the earliest entry.|$|E
5|$|Corbulo reordered his forces, {{withdrawing}} {{the defeated}} and demoralized IV Scythica and XII Fulminata legions to Syria, leaving X Fretensis to guard Cappadocia, and leading his veteran III Gallica and VI Ferrata to Melitene, where the invasion army was to <b>be</b> <b>assembled.</b> To these he also added V Macedonica, which had remained in Pontus throughout {{the previous year}} and not been tainted by the defeat, the newly arrived XV Apollinaris, and large numbers of auxiliaries and contingents of the client kings.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{armoured}} formations <b>were</b> <b>assembled</b> under Army Group Centre in Courland with orders to attack towards Jelgava (Mitau), {{cutting off the}} Soviet spearheads. The XXXX Panzer Corps, with the 7th and 14th Panzer Divisions, the Grossdeutschland Division and the 1st Infantry Division, <b>was</b> <b>assembled</b> at Liepāja / Libau, while the XXXIX Panzer Corps <b>was</b> <b>assembled</b> at Tauroggen.|$|R

5|$|Each Province is a two-sided {{interchangeable}} board, on {{one side}} of which is a Harbinger's province while on the other are the sewers. The Provinces can <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces are changed. Each Province has its own headstone and is in the Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, RSM {{introduced}} an electric {{version of its}} SM3 car known as the SM3 Z.E., imported from Turkey. In October 2013 the car started to <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> at the Busan plant {{and in the same}} year it became the leading electric vehicle by sales in South Korea with a 58% market share. In 2016, RSM also announced its intention to market the Twizy. In May 2016, the company announced a project to develop and produce a 1-tonne electric light commercial vehicle with a 250-kilometre range on a single charge in partnership with local companies.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E

50|$|Maturation is {{submitted}} by the assembly of bacteriophage DNA and capsids into virions. Late proteins are important in assembly. Assembly is complicated but varies in bacteriophage stages, some <b>are</b> <b>assembled</b> in nucleus and some <b>are</b> <b>assembled</b> in cytoplasm, and {{may be seen as}} paracrystalline structures in cell.The tails and heads of the T even bacteriophage <b>are</b> <b>assembled</b> from protein subunits, and the head is packed with DNA and attached to the tail.|$|R
5000|$|Although most of {{the cars}} <b>were</b> <b>assembled</b> at Renault's Île Seguin plant located on {{an island in the}} river {{opposite}} Billancourt, the 4CV <b>was</b> also <b>assembled</b> in seven other countries. In December 1949 it was announced that the car had replaced the company's Juvaquatre at the company's factory in Acton, West London, where right hand drive 4 CVs <b>were</b> <b>assembled</b> using, for the most part, components imported from France. [...] Other countries where 4 CVs <b>were</b> <b>assembled</b> included Australia, Belgium, England, Ireland, Japan (where the Hino-assembled cars gained a reputation for superior quality), Spain and South Africa.|$|R
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of Weston's new colony was profit, rather than the {{religious}} reasons of the Plymouth settlers, and this dictated how the colony would <b>be</b> <b>assembled.</b> Weston believed that families were a detriment to a well-run plantation and so he selected able-bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life. In total, there were several advanced scouts and fifty to sixty other colonists. The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer. The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter.|$|E
5|$|U-15 was {{constructed}} at AG Weser in Bremen for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and then shipped by rail in sections to Pola, where the sections were riveted together. Though {{there is no}} specific mention of {{how long it took}} for U-15s sections to <b>be</b> <b>assembled,</b> a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine UB-3, shipped to Pola from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. U-15 was launched in April.|$|E
5|$|A {{section of}} the track on land owned by Fisons (who {{extracted}} peat from the area) was donated to the British Museum in London. Although this short section can <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> for display purposes, it is currently kept in store, off site, and under controlled conditions. A reconstructed section was displayed at the Peat Moors Centre near Glastonbury. The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 {{as a result of}} budget cuts imposed by Somerset County Council. The main exhibits are extant, but future public access is uncertain. Other samples of the track are held in the Museum of Somerset.|$|E

In 1981 the 504 GL retailed for AUD $11,000.|$|R
50|$|A further 2,319 pistols <b>were</b> <b>assembled</b> from {{existing}} parts {{after the war}} until production was halted at serial number 32854 in 1948. Twenty additional pistols <b>were</b> <b>assembled</b> from foreign-produced parts in 1987 as collector's pieces for the US market. A US dealer supplied commercial frames, slides and barrels {{as well as other}} parts that <b>were</b> <b>assembled</b> at Kongsberg. Previous markings were removed and Kongsberg markings and serials were engraved on the parts before the <b>assembled</b> pistols <b>were</b> returned to the US.|$|R
5|$|After Spare's death, Grant {{began to}} focus more on his own writing career. From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately {{published}} the Carfax Monographs, a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments, each at a limited print run of 100. Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would be reflected in many of Grant's subsequent publications. The Carfax Monographs would eventually <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> together and re-released as Hidden Lore in 1989. In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, Black to Black and Other Poems. During the 1950s and 1960s Spare also authored a number of novels, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can <b>be</b> <b>assembled.</b>|$|E
50|$|Production of North American {{specification}} M5s commenced in November 1986 {{and ended}} in November 1987.

5|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} currency {{conditions and}} conflicting {{pressures on the}} military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, {{a large portion of}} which were to <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> domestically, in October 1978. In 1996, the last of the IAF's Hunters were phased out of service, the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.|$|E
5|$|Gefion {{initially}} {{served with}} the main German fleet and frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht Hohenzollern on trips to other European countries, including a state visit to Russia in 1897. In late 1897, Gefion was reassigned to the East Asia Squadron; she arrived there in May 1898. The ship {{took part in the}} Battle of Taku Forts in June 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion in China. She returned to Germany in 1901 and was modernized, but she did not return to service after the work was finished in 1904. She was to be mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but a crew could not <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> due to shortages of personnel. Instead, she was used as a barracks ship in Danzig from 1916 {{to the end of the}} war. In 1920, she was sold, converted into a freighter, and renamed Adolf Sommerfeld. She served in this capacity for only three years, and was broken up for scrap in Danzig in 1923.|$|E
5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to <b>be</b> <b>assembled</b> in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E
