The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents, the base and the lid. Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones, Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Nas6/gankyrin (names for yeast/mammals).

40|$|The authors offer a {{new design}} {{in support of}} {{efficient}} heat dissipation for light emitting diodes (LEDs). In {{the first part of}} this paper we discuss improvements in LED packaging materials and layer assembly, and then describe the addition of a thin layer of electroplated copper to the LED <b>base</b> <b>assembly</b> to reduce thermal resistance and increase thermal diffusion efficiency. Also described is a three-dimensional finite element simulation that we performed to verify the proposed design (0. 75, 1, and 3 W LED chip temperatures) and a LED heat transfer behavior analysis. The results indicate that the addition of a 9 mm(2) electroplated copper layer to the LED <b>base</b> <b>assembly</b> improved LED thermal dissipation by reducing chip temperature by 5 A degrees C compared to LEDs without the copper layer packaging. In the second part of this paper we describe (a) our heat pipe system/heat sink design for LED illumination, and (b) experiments in which we changed both working fluid mass and rotation angle to determine their effects on heat pipe cooling. Our results indicate that the most efficient heat dissipation occurred when an added heat pipe was arranged horizontally. Good heat dissipation was observed for heat pipes containing 2. 52 g of water (temperature reduced by 50 A degrees C). Larger water volumes failed to dissipate additional heat due to the presence of steam inside the pipe...|$|E

These systems are critical to the biology of many pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria for insects, plants, animals, and humans. Essential components of these systems are multiprotein envelope-associated organelles known as the needle complex {{and a group of}} membrane proteins that compose the so-called export apparatus. Here, we show that components of the export apparatus associate intimately with the needle complex, forming a structure that can be visualized by cryo-electron microscopy. We also show that formation of the needle complex base is initiated at the export apparatus and that, in the absence of export apparatus components, there is a significant reduction in the levels of needle complex <b>base</b> <b>assembly.</b> Our results show a substantial coordination in the assembly of the two central elements of type III secretion machines...|$|E
40|$|Introduction This {{presentation}} introduces {{an experimental}} prototype of a code generation tool for embedded special-purpose processors. The tool is a retargetable assembly-codelevel macro expander capable of program AEow analysis. It {{is intended to}} be used both {{as a part of a}} compiler back-end and as a stand-alone macro assembler. The implemented prototype tries to demonstrate lucidly the power of the AEow analysis mechanism and is not yet meant for coping with real processor architectures. The main advantage ooeered by our macro expander is its strong support for macro hierarchy. The enhanced modularity resulting from hierarchically used macros can make the code more easily readable, maintainable, and reusable. Still, a procedure written in the macro language retains its machine-speciøcity and, consequently, its eOEciency. From the semantical viewpoint, the macro language can be seen as an extension of the <b>base</b> (<b>assembly)</b> language. From the syntactical viewpoint, in contrast...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe central {{protease}} of eukaryotes, the 26 S proteasome, has a 20 S proteolytic core particle (CP) and an attached 19 S regulatory particle (RP). The RP {{is further}} subdivided into lid and base subcomplexes. Little {{is known about}} RP assembly. Here, we show that four conserved assembly factors govern biogenesis of the yeast RP base. Nas 2 forms a complex with the Rpt 4 and Rpt 5 ATPases and enhances 26 S proteasome formation in vivo and in vitro. Other RP subcomplexes contain Hsm 3, which is related to mammalian proteasome subunit S 5 b. Hsm 3 also contributes to <b>base</b> <b>assembly.</b> Larger Hsm 3 -containing complexes include two additional proteins, Nas 6 and Rpn 14, which function as assembly chaperones as well. Specific deletion combinations affecting these four factors cause severe perturbations to RP assembly.

Using particles of a similar size barely affects the average bulk properties of the assembly. On the other extreme, when a huge number of very small particles are included, most of them lie in the voids of the base material, acting as rattlers, leading to an overall weakening effect. In between the limits, for dense systems, an optimum size ratio that maximizes the bulk modulus of the mixture can be found. Conversely, loose systems always get weaker since more and more small particles become rattlers. Finally, we relate the mixture properties with the ‘typical’ pore size in a disordered structure as induced by the combined effect of operating volume fraction and size ratio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the stiffness and strength of steel storage rack <b>base</b> plate <b>assemblies.</b> <b>Base</b> plate <b>assemblies</b> are usually bolted to an upright and to a concrete floor, and {{they are used to}} provide resistance against the flexural buckling of the upright and/or the overall down-aisle buckling of the frame. The semi-rigid stiffness is usually determined by means of a test of two pre-loaded uprights connected to a concrete block in a dual-actuator set-up. Guidance for conducting the test is provided in the European Standard EN 15512. However, several aspects of the test need clarification, notably the test set-up and the transducer arrangement for measuring the rotations of the base plate. This paper provides recommendations for how best to conduct the test, and proposes an alternative test method to that given in the EN 15512 Specification. The paper also identifies the contributions to the deformations of <b>base</b> plate <b>assemblies,</b> including the deformations of the supporting floor, the <b>base</b> plate <b>assembly</b> itself and the upright, and proposes simple expressions for calculating the stiffness associated with each contributing deformation where applicable. Furthermore, the paper proposes a deformation criterion for determining the ultimate design moment for base plate tests which do not attain a peak moment.

40|$|Presented {{here is a}} robot {{friendly}} {{coupling device}} for an orbital replacement unit (ORU). The invention will provide a coupling that is detached and attached remotely by a robot. The design of the coupling must allow for slight misalignments, over-torque protection, and precision placement. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} triangular interface comprising three components. A <b>base</b> plate <b>assembly</b> is located on an attachment surface, such as a satellite. The <b>base</b> plate <b>assembly</b> has a cup member, a slotted member, and a post member. The ORU that the robot attaches to the <b>base</b> plate <b>assembly</b> has an ORU plate assembly with two cone members and a post member which mate to the <b>base</b> plate <b>assembly.</b> As the two plates approach one another, one cone member of the ORU plate assembly has to be placed accurately enough to fall into the cup member of the <b>base</b> plate <b>assembly.</b> The cup member forces alignment until a second cone falls into a slotted member which provides final alignment. A single bolt is used to attach the two plates. Two deflecting plates are attached to the backs of the plates. When pressure is applied {{to the center of the}} deflecting plates, the force is distributed preventing the ORU and base plates from deflecting. This accounts for precision in the placement of the article. The novelty is believed to reside in using deflecting plates in conjunction with kinematic mounts to provide distributed forces to the two members...|$|R

40|$|Robot {{teams are}} {{increasingly}} becoming a popular alternative to single robots {{for a variety}} of difficult robotic tasks, such as planetary exploration or planetary <b>base</b> <b>assembly.</b> A key factor for the success of a robot team is the ability to coordinate the team members in an effective way. Coordination involves the allocation and execution of individual tasks through an efficient (preferably, decentralized) mechanism. It is desirable to enable good decision making while communicating as little information as possible. Recently, there has been significant interest in using auction-based methods for robot coordination. In these methods, the communicated information consists of bids robots place on various tasks, and coordination is achieved by a process similar to winner determination in auctions. Auctionbased methods balance the trade-off between purely centralized methods (full communication) and purely decentralized methods (no communication) in both efficiency and quality. The purpose of this workshop was to draw the leading researchers in this active area of research to discuss and analyze issues related to auction-based robot coordination. This emerging field of research has demonstrated significant progress in its few years of existence, however heretofore there has been no official forum for involved researchers to share experience, establish foundations...|$|E
