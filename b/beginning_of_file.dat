40|$|We {{describe}} how the coherence function, a Fourier frequency-dependent {{measure of the}} linear correlation between time series measured simultaneously in two energy channels, {{can be used in}} conjunction with energy spectra, power spectra, and time delays between energy channels to constrain models of the spectrum and variability of x-ray binaries. Here we present a procedure for estimating the coherence function in the presence of counting noise. We apply this method to the black hole candidates Cyg X [...] 1 and GX 339 [...] 4, and find that the near perfect coherence between low and high energy x-ray photons rules out a wide range of models that postulate: spatially extended fluctuating emission, thermal flares, and overlapping shot-noise.

40|$|We present {{statistically}} robust observational evidence which imposes new {{limits on}} dynamo saturation in young solar-type stars. These are inferred from the increasing amplitude of the V-band optical flux with rotation, {{caused by the}} filling of the disc with surface spots in a non-axisymmetric pattern. Assuming spot coverage acts as a tracer of the total magnetic surface flux {{we find that the}} magnetic activity saturates at a level at least 6 [...] 10 times greater than that inferred from chromospheric and transition line indicators. We suggest that these new limits imply a minimum rotation for saturation of the dynamo and that for high rotation rates starspot coverage acts as an alternative diagnostic for the stellar dynamo to the chromospheric and transition region line emission fluxes. The fact that the dynamo does not appear to saturate at the low rotation rates indicated by chromospheric indicators should assist evolutionary braking models that have to explain the sudden spin-down of young fast rotating G-dwarfs.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on (1) the role of Kač-Moody (KM) algebras in string theory and the {{development}} of techniques for systematically building string theory models based on higher level (K≥ 2) KM algebras and (2) fractional superstrings. In chapter two we review KM algebras and their role in string theory. In the next chapter, we present two results concerning the construction of modular invariant partition functions for conformal field theories built by tensoring together other conformal field theories. First we show how the possible modular invariants for the tensor product theory are constrained if the allowed modular invariants of the individual conformal field theory factors have been classified. We illustrate the use of these constraints for theories of the type SU(2) _K_AxSU(2) _K_B, finding all consistent theories for K_A and K_B odd. Second we show how known diagonal modular invariants can be used to construct inherently asymmetric invariants where the holomorphic and anti- holomorphic theories do not share the same chiral algebra. Explicit examples are given. Next, in chapter four we investigate some issues relating to proposed fractional superstring theories with D_ critical< 10. Using the factorization approach of Gepner and Qiu, we systematically rederive the partition functions of the K= 4, 8, and 16 theories and examine their spacetime supersymmetry. Generalized GSO projection operators for the K= 4 model are found. Uniqueness of the twist field, ϕ^K/ 4 _K/ 4, as source of spacetime fermions, is demonstrated.

40|$|This release {{had large}} {{contributions}} from Eric Larson, Brendan Moloney, Nolan Nichols, Basile Pinsard, Chris Johnson and Nikolaas N. Oosterhof. 	New feature, bugfix release with minor API breakage; 	Minor API breakage: default write of NIfTI / Analyze image data offset value. The data offset {{is the number}} of bytes from the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> to skip before reading the image data. Nibabel behavior changed from keeping the value as read from file, to setting the offset to zero on read, and setting the offset when writing the header. The value of the offset will now be the minimum value necessary {{to make room for the}} header and any extensions when writing the file. You can override the default offset by setting value explicitly to some value other than zero. To read the original data offset as read from the header, use the offset property of the image dataobj attribute; 	Minor API breakage: data scaling in NIfTI / Analyze now set to NaN when reading images. Data scaling refers to the data intercept and slope values in the NIfTI / Analyze header. To read the original data scaling you need to look at the slope and inter properties of the image dataobj attribute. You can set scaling explicitly by setting the slope and intercept values in the header to values other than NaN; 	New API for managing image caching; images have an in_memory property that is true if the image data has been loaded into cache, or is already an array in memory; get_data has new keyword argument caching to specify whether the cache should be filled by get_data; 	Images now have properties dataobj, affine, header. We will slowly phase out the get_affine and get_header image methods; 	The image dataobj can be sliced using an efficient algorithm to avoid reading unnecessary data from disk. This makes it possible to do very efficient reads of single volumes from a time series; 	NIfTI 2 read / write support; 	Read support for MINC 2; 	Much extended read support for PAR / REC, largely due to work from Eric Larson and Gregory R. Lee on new code, advice and code review. Thanks also to Jeff Stevenson and Bennett Landman for helpful discussion; 	parrec 2 nii script outputs images in LAS voxel orientation, which appears to be necessary for compatibility with FSL dtifit / fslview diffusion analysis pipeline; 	Preliminary support for Philips multiframe DICOM images (thanks to Nolan Nichols, Ly Nguyen and Brendan Moloney); 	New function to save Freesurfer annotation files (by Github user ohinds); 	Method to return MGH format vox 2 ras_tkr affine (Eric Larson); 	A new API for reading unscaled data from NIfTI and other images, using img. dataobj. get_unscaled(). Deprecate previous way of doing this, which was to read data with the read_img_data function; 	Fix for bug when replacing NaN values with zero when writing floating point data as integers. If the input floating point data range did not include zero, then NaN would not get written to a value corresponding to zero in the output; 	Improvements and bug fixes to image orientation calculation and DICOM wrappers by Brendan Moloney; 	Bug fixes writing GIfTI files. We were using a base 64 encoding that didn't match the spec, and the wrong field name for the endian code. Thanks to Basile Pinsard and Russ Poldrack for diagnosis and fixes; 	Bug fix in freesurfer. read_annot with orig_ids=False when annot contains vertices with no label (Alexandre Gramfort); 	More tutorials in the documentation, including introductory tutorial on DICOM, and on coordinate systems; 	Lots of code refactoring, including moving to common code-base for Python 2 and Python 3; 	New mechanism to add images for tests via git submodules...|$|E
