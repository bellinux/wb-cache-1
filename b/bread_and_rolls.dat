The aims of this study were: (1) to assess iron intake, its determinants and its most important food sources and; (2) to evaluate the relation of iron intake and status in European adolescents. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Two non-consecutive 24 -h recalls were completed by a computerised tool. The socio-demographic and socio-economic data were collected by a self-reported questionnaire. Weight and height were measured. A distinction was made between haem and non-haem iron. RESULTS: The total iron intake was significantly higher among boys (13. 8 mg/day; n = 1077) than girls (11. 0 mg/day; n = 1253). About 97. 3 % of the boys and 87. 8 % of the girls met the estimated average requirement, and 72. 4 % of the boys and 13. 7 % of the girls met the recommendation for bio-available iron intake. The ratio of haem/non-haem iron intake was lower for girls than boys. Meat (19. 2; 76 %) and <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolls</b> (12. 6; 3. 9 %) contributed most to total and haem iron intake. <b>Bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolls</b> (13. 8 %) and meat (10. 8 %) contributed most to non-haem iron intake. Age, sex and body mass index were associated with iron intake. Only red blood cell concentration was significantly negatively associated with total, haem and non-haem iron intake. CONCLUSION: Girls had lower iron intakes and ratio of haem/non-haem iron intake than boys. The main total iron and haem iron source was meat, while the main non-haem iron source was <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolls.</b> Adolescent girls may be a group at risk for {{iron deficiency}}. Consequently, special attention and strategies are needed in order to improve iron intakes during adolescence...|$|E

40|$|Nivalenol is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} various Fusarium species. The European Commission (EC) asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for a scientific {{opinion on the}} risk to human and animal health related {{to the presence of}} nivalenol in food and feed. A total of 13 164 results for nivalenol in food, feed and unprocessed grains, collected in 2001 - 2011 from 18 European countries, were available for the evaluation. The highest mean concentrations for nivalenol were observed in oats, maize, barley and wheat and products thereof. Grains and grain-based foods, in particular <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolls,</b> grain milling products, pasta, fine bakery wares and breakfast cereals, made the largest contribution to nivalenol exposure for humans. Animal exposure to nivalenol is primarily from consuming cereal grains and cereal by-products. The available information on the toxicokinetics of nivalenol is incomplete. Evidence exists for metabolic de-epoxidation in some species. Based on the data available, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) concluded that the overall weight of evidence is that nivalenol is unlikely to be genotoxic. Toxic effects of nivalenol include immunotoxicity and haematotoxicity. A reduction in white blood cell (WBC) counts in a 90 -day rat study was identified as the critical effect for human risk assessment. Using these data and a benchmark dose analysis the CONTAM Panel established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1. 2 µg/kg b. w. per day. All chronic human dietary exposures to nivalenol estimated, based on the available occurrence data in food, are below the TDI, and are therefore not a health concern. No toxicity data were identified for ruminants, rabbits, fish and companion animals but lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels were identified in pigs and poultry. Based on estimates of exposure the risk of adverse health effects of feed containing nivalenol is low for both these species...|$|E

A proper risk assessment of those substances requires the availability of robust occurrence data; in this respect concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of results obtained with the currently available methods to determine those substances in processed food. This article presents an indirect analytical procedure for the simultaneous determination of 3 -MCPDEs, 2 -MCPDEs and GEs {{in a wide variety of}} food products after extraction by pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) and determination by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC–MS). For the differentiation of MCPDEs and GEs, the latter were first converted to monobromopropanediol esters (MBPDEs) in acid aqueous solution of sodium bromide. MCPDEs and MBPDEs were then hydrolysed under acidic conditions followed by derivatisation of the released free (non-esterified) form in ethyl acetate with phenyl boronic acid (PBA). Quantification of the analytes was carried out using the isotopic labelled analogues of both MCPDEs and GEs. Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) were in the range of 7 – 17 mgkg− 1 and 13 – 31 mgkg− 1 respectively, while the working range of the method was between LOQ and 1850 mgkg− 1 expressed on fat basis.

40|$|Background: Recent {{detailed}} {{analyses of}} data on dietary sources of energy and nutrients in US children are lacking. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify food sources of energy and 28 nutrients for children in the United States. Methods: Analyses of food sources were conducted using a single 24 -h recall collected from children 2 to 18 years old (n = 7332) in the 2003 – 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sources of nutrients contained in foods were determined using nutrient composition databases. Food grouping included ingredients from disaggregated mixtures. Mean energy and nutrient intakes from the total diet and from each food group were adjusted for the sample design using appropriate weights. Percentages of the total dietary intake that food sources contributed were tabulated by rank order. Results: The two top ranked food/food group sources of energy and nutrients were: energy — milk (7 % of energy) and cake/cookies/quick bread/pastry/pie (7 %); protein — milk (13. 2 %) and poultry (12. 8 %); total carbohydrate — soft drinks/soda (10. 5 %) and yeast bread/rolls (9. 1 %); total sugars — soft drinks/soda (19. 2 %) and yeast breads and rolls (12. 7 %); added sugars — soft drinks/soda (29. 7 %) and candy/sugar/sugary foods (18. 6 %); dietary fiber — fruit (10. 4 %) and yeast bread/rolls (10. 3 %); total fat — cheese (9. 3 %) and crackers/popcorn/pretzels/chips (8. 4 %); saturated fatty acids — cheese (16. 3 %) and milk (13. 3 %); cholesterol — eggs (24. 2 %) and poultry (13. 2 %); vitamin D — milk (60. 4 %) and milk drinks (8. 3 %); calcium — milk (33. 2 %) and cheese (19. 4 %); potassium — milk (18. 8 %) and fruit juice (8. 0 %); and sodium — salt (18. 5 %) and yeast <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolls</b> (8. 4 %). Conclusions: Results suggest that many foods/food groupings consumed by children were energy dense, nutrient poor.

40|$|Following {{a request}} by the European Commission, the Panel of Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety of sodium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 481, SSL) and calcium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 482, CSL) when used as food additives. SSL and CSL are used as emulsifiers and stabilizers. An Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 20 mg/kg bw/day for SSL and CSL (either singly or in combination) was established in 1974 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) endorsed this ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day in 1978. The biological fate of CSL is comparable in rodent and non-rodent species. The acute oral toxicity in rats is low. Subacute and subchronic oral toxicity studies with SSL and CSL in rats and dogs revealed a NOAEL of 5 % in the diet. Neither SSL and CSL nor their breakdown products stearic and lactic acid raise concern for genotoxicity. The NOAEL in a one-year oral toxicity study with SSL in rats was 2214 mg/kg bw/day for males and 2641 mg/kg bw/day for females. No data on reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity were available. However, no reproductive or carcinogenic effects are expected since the products of hydrolysis, stearic and lactic acid are constituents of natural food and part of endogenous metabolism in mammals. The Panel concluded that based on the NOAEL of 2200 mg/kg bw/day derived from the one-year toxicity study in rats and an uncertainty factor of 100, an ADI of 22 mg/kg bw/day for sodium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 481) and calcium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 482) either singly or in combination can be established. The estimated exposure to SSL and CSL occurs mainly via the consumption of flavoured fermented milk products including heat treated products, <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolls</b> and fine bakery wares and is below the ADI of 22 mg/kg bw/day for all the adult population including the elderly, but exceeds the ADI for other groups of the population at mean level and for all groups of the population at high level...|$|E
