5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E

5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is no evidence of any kind of property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of Sulla, but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E
5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State {{to bring up the}} weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> professing that particular religion. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to Overseas citizens of India.|$|E

25|$|Traumatic {{events are}} more subjective. What is {{traumatic}} {{is dependent on}} what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them. An example would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones.|$|E
25|$|Discrete choice models {{theoretically}} or empirically model choices made {{by people}} among a finite set of alternatives. The models {{have been used to}} examine, e.g., the choice of which car to buy, where to go to college, which mode of transport (car, bus, rail) to take to work among numerous other applications. Discrete choice models are also used to examine choices by organizations, such as firms or government agencies. In the discussion below, the decision-making unit is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> though the concepts are applicable more generally. Daniel McFadden won the Nobel prize in 2000 for his pioneering work in developing the theoretical basis for discrete choice.|$|E

25|$|The idea of freely debating {{rights to}} {{political}} representation took form during the Putney Debates of 1647. Beginning {{in the late}} 17th century, philosophers {{began to think of}} rights not as privileges to be granted by the government or the law, but as a fundamental part {{of what it means to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> John Locke (1632â€“1704), one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers, argued that property - which to him included life, liberty and possessions - was an unalienable human right, that is, one which cannot be taken away. He articulated that every person is created equal and free but, in return for the advantages of living in an organised society, a person may need to give up some of this freedom.|$|E

25|$|Aggression {{can have}} {{adaptive}} benefits or negative effects. Aggressive behavior {{is an individual}} or collective social interaction that is a hostile behavior {{with the intention of}} inflicting damage or harm. Two broad categories of aggression are commonly distinguished. One includes affective (emotional) and hostile, reactive, or retaliatory aggression that is a response to provocation, and the other includes instrumental, goal-oriented or predatory, in which aggression is used as a mean to achieve a goal. An example of hostile aggression would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who punches someone who insulted him or her. An instrumental form of aggression would be armed robbery. Research on violence from a range of disciplines lend some support to a distinction between affective and predatory aggression. However, some researchers question the usefulness of a hostile versus instrumental distinction in humans, despite its ubiquity in research, because most real-life cases involve mixed motives and interacting causes.|$|E
25|$|As of 24 February 2011, for {{the purpose}} of Parliamentary elections, Singapore was divided into 27 electoral {{divisions}} (also known as constituencies). The names and boundaries of the divisions are specified by the Prime Minister by notification in the Government Gazette. Twelve of these divisions are Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and 15 are Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). GRCs were introduced in 1991 {{for the purpose}} of ensuring representation of the Malay, Indian and other minority communities in Parliament. In a GRC, all the candidates must either be members of the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and {{at least one of the}} candidates must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. The President, at Cabinet's direction, declares the electoral divisions that are to be GRCs; the number of candidates (not less than three but not more than six) to stand for Parliament in each GRC; and whether the minority candidates in each GRC are to be from the Malay, Indian, or other minority communities. At all times there must be at least eight divisions that are not GRCs, and the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less than a quarter of the total number of MPs to be returned at a general election.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s onwards {{there had}} been no central body to {{co-ordinate}} the Inter-Colonial Tournaments and matches, select composite West Indian XIs for tours and against touring sides and to organise the West Indian tours of England, Canada and the United States. Such organisation as there was, was done by an informal coalition of the major clubs in the region. West Indian cricketers however had felt the need for the establishment of such an organisation although geography and culture were to make such a task difficult. However, with the help of one influential Marylebone Cricket Club member, R. H. Mallet (the manager of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours and future manager of the 1930â€“31 West Indian tour to Australia), representatives of the various territories finally got together and ultimately formed the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The preliminary meeting was in Bridgetown, Barbados, from which the informal West Indies Cricket Conference was founded in 1926. The West Indies Cricket Conference held its first official meeting on 22 January 1927 at the Bridgetown Club in Barbados attended by Mallett and representatives from the Windward Islands, Trinidad & Tobago, Barbados and Demerara (British Guiana). Delegates from Jamaica and the Leeward Islands were invited by unfortunately were unable to attend. At this January meeting the delegates present decided to form the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (WICBC) which would be composed of a president, a secretary and two delegates each from Barbados, Demerara, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago and one delegate each from the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. The WICBC's first meeting was held on 17 and 18 June 1927 in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad with Harold Austin (the former captain of the 1906 and 1923 West Indian tours of England) serving as the first president. The Board as constituted was enlarged in 1982 when the Leeward and Windward Islands were given the same representation as the other full Members. The President was appointed by the Board at an Ordinary General Meeting and had to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> resident in the West Indies who had shown a keen and active interest in West Indies cricket. His term of office was for two years (and eligible for re-election) or until his successor was appointed. Board members were also thenceforce to be appointed by their Cricket Associations although in British Guiana the Georgetown Cricket Club held this responsibility until 1943, and in Trinidad the Queens Park Oval Club until 1981 when their respective Cricket Associations were given recognition. There was a provision for Associate Members who would be entitled to attend Meetings but not to move resolutions or vote. Bermuda and Belize had been the only members in this category prior to their cessation as Associate Members. According to Ram Hiralal, former President of the Suriname Cricket Association, up until 2002 when Suriname applied for and gained affiliate membership of the ICC, it was also an associate member of the West Indies Cricket Board.|$|E
