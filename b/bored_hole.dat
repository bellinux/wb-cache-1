50|$|The false {{codling moth}} {{presents}} {{a problem to}} the citrus industry. All stages of fruit development of citrus are susceptible to a false codling moth infestation. Eggs are laid {{on the surface of}} the fruit. After emerging from the egg the larvae burrow into the rind. In citruses such as the orange the skin around the point of penetration develops a brown discoloration. The <b>bored</b> <b>hole</b> itself will also show signs of stress, excreting a brown substance. Once the fruit has been penetrated it is no longer a marketable item, and once compromised, the incidence of disease and mold increases. The open cavity is a point of entry for other pests and pathogens. Often fruits afflicted early in development prematurely drop. A USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) figure estimates crop yield losses as high as 20 percent in some cases. The establishment of a false codling moth population results in increased pesticide usage.|$|E

5000|$|The Vermont and Canada Railroad, {{completed}} between Essex Junction, VT and Rouses Point, NY and {{headquartered in}} St. Albans, Vermont, undertook {{construction of the}} tunnel {{in order to provide}} a better connection to the Lake Champlain lakefront from its main route, which passed through Essex Junction. The Vermont & Canada and the Vermont Central (headquartered in Northfield, VT) merged sometime prior to 1853. The original alignment passed through what is now downtown Burlington, and the depot was located two blocks south of the current City Hall. [...] The 8-mile section, part of the original Vermont Central mainline between Windsor, VT and Burlington, VT was completed in 1848. It required three wooden bridges over the Winooski River. These were replaced with steel truss bridges at a later date. At the site of the tunnel, the unusual formation of the ridge—accreted sand rather than underlying ledge—posed an enormous challenge to Daniel Chipman Linsley, engineer (1827-1889), and D.J. Morrison, construction chief, who both worked for the railroad. Reportedly Daniel Chipman Linsley's hair turned white prematurely, possibly resulting from the stress of the project. Linsley and Morrison had a wooden arch built that matched the intended shape of the tunnel, then advanced the wooden arch close behind the digging to support the ceiling of the newly <b>bored</b> <b>hole.</b> The concrete fill was laid in above the wooden arch, and the bricklaying crews finished the lining once the wooden arch rate of some 3 feet per day.

This effect is associated with deterioration of conditions of contact interaction between the DS and the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> wall, enlargement of friction forces, impossibility of transferring the required axial force to the bit, and the DS lockup situation.
