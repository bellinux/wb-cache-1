40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for designing and dimensioning <b>biconical</b> <b>horn</b> antennas in such {{way that the}} level of received power does not depend strongly on the separation distance between a centralized base station and a remote radio terminal within an indoor pico-cell. Results of cell-coverage measurements at 58 GHz are presented using these antennas within eight different indoor environments. The measurement results show that, using <b>biconical</b> <b>horn</b> antennas, an overall uniform coverage can be achieved for both line-of-sight and obstructed line-of-sight topologie...|$|E
