500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Elgar was in poor health.

There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the match against Surrey, the only Test match of the Australian's tour was played, also at the Oval. In his {{obituary}} in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, {{it was suggested that}} {{were it not for the}} accusations of throwing against Crossland, he would have been selected for the match. Cricket agreed, submitting that due to Fred Morley's absence from the England team due to injury, Crossland was the obvious choice to replace him, as he was the best fast bowler in the country. Despite this, they said that his non-selection showed that his action was not deemed fair by the selection panel. The Morning Post went a step further, and claimed that as Crossland had demonstrated he was England's best fast bowler, he should be selected to play in the Test match if his action was deemed fair, but that if it was not considered fair, he should not be allowed to continue to play for Lancashire either. An article written for The Argus, an Australian daily newspaper, by an unnamed member of the Australian side in 1882 reported that Crossland bowled; [...] "with a delivery so like a throw that I feel sure it would not be allowed in Australia; <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> all know, throwing in England is just as common as bowling – more's the pity", and it was speculated that the Australian team would have protested had Crossland been chosen for the Test match.|$|E
500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E
