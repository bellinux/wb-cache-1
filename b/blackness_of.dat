5|$|A. f. styani {{has been}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E
5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E

Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg's army.|$|E

500|$|Anne's masques were {{responsible}} for almost all the courtly female performance {{in the first two}} decades of the seventeenth century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women's performance. Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses of 1604, she played Pallas Athena, wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in The Masque of <b>Blackness</b> <b>of</b> 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as [...] "blackamores". Letter writer Dudley Carleton reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, he kissed her hand [...] "though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips". Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones.|$|E

In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> the background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|E

[...] Richard Crouse of Metro cited Scar's [...] "Long live the King" [...] as the character's [...] "Most evil line." [...] Additionally, [...] "Be Prepared" [...] is often revered {{as one of the greatest}} Disney villain songs. Official Disney Blogs wrote that the song, with its [...] "hyena backup singers, and the best bone-rattling percussion of all the villains' songs," [...] Scar proves himself [...] "an expert crooner of villainous plots." [...] Aside from Disney and animation, Scar is often revered as one of the greatest movie villains of all-time. Digital Spy featured the character who, according to author Simon Reynolds, [...] "underlined the sheer <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> his heart by ruthlessly killing Simba's father," [...] among the [...] "25 greatest movie villains".

Now {{covered by the}} Rhodesian ground troops and Frantans dropped by Percival Provosts, the South Africans made several unsuccessful attempts to pull back from {{the banks of the}} gully throughout the afternoon which led to two injuries and the death of Constable du Toit. The SAP men were eventually able to withdraw under cover of darkness, while Rhodesian and South African injured were uplifted by helicopter in an action described by Southey as [...] "sheer brilliance". [...] "Norman Walsh and Peter Nicholls [...] faced great difficulty because of steep mountainsides and the <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> the night in conditions of thick haze," [...] writes Peter Petter-Bowyer, then an RRAF flight lieutenant. [...] "Visual contact with [...] ground [...] impossible until dangerously low and close." [...] Flying at such low altitude, each pilot was blinded by the reflection of his own landing light when he looked towards the ground. Walsh noticed that he could clearly see the ground beneath the other helicopter's light, and so instructed Nicholls to turn off his landing light and allow him to illuminate the landing site for him. [...] "This worked like a charm," [...] says Petter-Bowyer. Guided by Walsh's landing light, Nicholls safely landed and collected some of the casualties, then did the same for Walsh as he picked up the rest. Flares were dropped during the night to help the ground troops search for guerrilla movement but none was seen.|$|E

2500|$|In Kindred, Butler also {{represents}} individual slaves as {{people rather than}} non-humans, giving each {{his or her own}} story. Robert Crossley argues that Butler treats the <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> her characters as [...] "a matter of course" [...] to resist the tendency of white writers to incorporate African-Americans into their narratives just to illustrate a problem or to divorce themselves from charges of racism. Thus, in Kindred the slave community is depicted as a [...] "rich human society": the proud yet victimized freewoman-turned-slave Alice; Sam the field slave, who hopes Dana will teach his brother; the traitorous sewing woman Liza, who frustrates Dana's escape; the bright and resourceful Nigel, Rufus's childhood friend who learns to read from a stolen primer; most importantly, Sarah the cook, who Butler transforms from an image of the submissive, happy [...] "mammie" [...] of white fiction to a deeply angry yet caring woman subdued only by the threat of losing her last child, the mute Carrie.|$|E

This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously.

2500|$|American author Ralph Ellison wrote {{a tribute}} to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel Invisible Man. According to Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad, the {{character}} of the narrator [...] "resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick". Ellison acknowledges his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana, and evocates a church service: [...] "Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black...'" [...] In this scene Ellison [...] "reprises a moment in the second chapter of Moby-Dick", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford {{looking for a place to}} spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: [...] "It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there." [...] According to Rampersad, it was Melville who [...] "empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition" [...] by his example of [...] "representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text".|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{the practices}} of signifying create a signalling that one is entering a communicative collective space rather than functioning as an individual. Tweets become part of Black Twitter by responding to the calls in the tag. Hashtags embody a performance <b>of</b> <b>blackness</b> through a transmission of racial knowledge into wordplay. Sarah Florini in particular focuses on how an active self-identification <b>of</b> <b>blackness</b> rejects notions <b>of</b> a post-racial society by disrupting the narratives of a color-blind society. This rejection of a post-racial society gets tied into the collective practices of performance by turning narratives such as the Republican National Conventions declaration of Rosa Parks ending racism into a moment of critique and ridicule {{under the guise of}} a game. Moments where performance <b>of</b> <b>blackness</b> meet social critique allow for the spaces of activism to be created.
