5|$|John Newcomer led the {{development}} team, which included Bill Pfutzenreuter, Jan Hendricks, Python Anghelo, Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik.

Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracy's death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home. He agreed, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.|$|E

5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor about having a female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> add {{more to the story}} as it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she struggled with the plot, she enjoyed drawing the characters in the end. In the final chapter, the author revealed she had planned to pair Keidai with Mii since the beginning.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} above all by mediaeval Gothic art, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> improve on its structural solutions. Neo-gothic {{was one of}} the most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc. Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.|$|E

5|$|Gannon became {{manager of}} Stockport County, {{now in the}} National League North, {{for the third time}} in his career on 18 January 2016. Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in the table with a {{sequence}} of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the run up to Easter. County finished eighth in the 2016–17 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that he was pleased with his defence, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> overhaul the attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season.|$|E
5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and {{pointing out that}} the coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana or anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E

5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E
5|$|Ouw Peh Tjoa was {{directed}} and produced by The Teng Chun for his company, Cino Motion Pictures. Since releasing Sam Pek Eng Tay in 1931, {{based on the}} legend of the Butterfly Lovers, The Teng Chun had released a series of films based on Chinese legends and folktales, including Pat Bie To (Eight Beautiful Women; 1932) and Pat Kiam Hiap (Eight Swordsmen; 1933). These stories were selected because the peranakan Chinese in the Indies were unable to understand Mandarin and Cantonese imports from China, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see films based on Chinese mythology. Overall, The Teng Chun's films emphasised the martial art silat and were generally profitable, allowing him to dominate the industry.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, investors {{including}} William Henry Crocker bought adjoining parcels {{of land in}} Oakland {{for the purpose of}} erecting a movie palace to rival the nearby Fox Orpheum, intending that Miller and Pflueger build it. One of the largest studio and theater chains in the country, Paramount Publix, showed great interest, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> use their own East Coast architect instead. Pflueger went to New York and convinced Paramount Publix to use his firm by demonstrating that past projects of his had stayed within budget, a concern of increasing importance in the cautious financial climate of early 1930.|$|E

5|$|The President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, {{discussed}} {{the matter of}} command arrangements in the Pacific in Washington, D.C., on 9 March. Roosevelt proposed {{that the world would}} be divided into British and American areas of responsibility, with the United States having responsibility for the Pacific, where there would be an American supreme commander responsible to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Churchill responded favourably to the proposal, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand were then consulted. They endorsed the idea of an American supreme commander, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have some input into matters of strategy.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei {{began as}} a trilogy of science fantasy books written by Japanese author Aya Nishitani. Published by Tokuma Shoten, the novels were a major success in Japan. The novels were first adapted into an {{original}} video animation (OVA), which retold {{the events of the}} first novel. Following the completion of the OVA in 1987, Tokuma Shoten decided to expand the series into video games. The license to develop a game based on Nishitani's work was simultaneously acquired by two companies; Atlus and Telenet Japan. The two companies were willing to work on the same project, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> differentiate their products. As the Famicom was noted for action-based titles and PCs for traditional role-playing games, the two companies decided to respectively play against platform expectations. Two different game projects were created with Tokuma Shoten's supervision under the Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei title; Atlus created a traditional role-playing game which was published by Namco, while Atlus and Telenet collaborated on an action role-playing game which would be published by Telenet. The two versions were developed concurrently, although the version by Telenet was the first to be completed.|$|E
5|$|In February 1931, de Hauteclocque {{went back}} to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he {{reported}} to Général de brigade Henri Giraud on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a goum. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August. The Commander in Chief in Morocco, Général de division Antoine Huré, felt that de Hauteclocque {{should not have been}} there, and held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and de Hauteclocque was given early admission to the course for promotion to capitaine. He placed fourth in the class, and was promoted on 25 December 1934. Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. Most had to wait until 1936. He was also made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.|$|E

5|$|Johansson {{played the}} cyborg, supersoldier Motoko Kusanagi in Rupert Sanders's 2017 film {{adaptation}} of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. The film received mixed reviews: it was praised for its visual style, acting, and cinematography but was controversial for whitewashing the cast, particularly Johansson's character. Responding to the criticism, {{she said she would}} never play a person of another race, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> use this rare opportunity to star in a franchise with a female protagonist. The film grossed $169.8million worldwide against a production budget of $110million. In March 2017, Johansson hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth time, making her the 17th person, and the fourth woman (after Candice Bergen, Drew Barrymore, and former cast member Tina Fey) to enter the NBC sketch comedy series' prestigious Five-Timers Club. In the black comedy film Rough Night (2017), Johansson played Jess Thayer, one of the five friends—alongside Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zoë Kravitz—whose bachelorette party goes wrong after a male stripper dies. Despite mixed critical reception for the film, it had moderate box office returns.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 1945 Andersen {{killed two}} German {{prisoners of war}} with his Thompson submachine gun. Andersen had broken into German barracks in Vadheim in Sogn during a {{drinking}} binge, killing the German soldiers Herbert Neumann and Hermann Beckmann. He later claimed to have acted in rage over his wife's death. The Norwegian court system started working on Andersen's case, eventually reaching judge advocate Ivar Follestad. Andersen was defended by Reidar Skau, who was made Supreme Court Justice in 1945. Follestad deemed it necessary to prosecute Andersen, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pardon him after the verdict. After spending {{more than a year}} in the civilian and military court systems Andersen's murder case reached the top levels of the Royal Norwegian Navy, and on 5 August 1946 it was decided to take the case to the Gulating Military Court of Appeal. Three months later Follestad made a decision of non-indictment, despite there being evidence to convict Andersen. In January 1947 the general jurisdiction chief, Thore Horve, also declared for a decision of non-indictment. Follestad and Horve were supported in this by Minister of Defence Jens Christian Hauge, and the decision was made final by royal resolution on 25 April 1947. This led to protests from, amongst others, leading Norwegian psychiatrist Johan Scharffenberg.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
