5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves.

A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> cooked with rice and seasoned with pork.

5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine.

Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E

25|$|Rice is {{a staple}} in the diet of {{residents}} near the coast and millet {{a staple in}} the interior. Fruits and vegetables are commonly eaten along with cereal grains.

25|$|The first {{domestication}} probably {{occurred in}} West Africa, but the black-eyed pea is widely grown {{in many countries}} in Asia; it was introduced into the Southern United States {{as early as the}} 17th century in Virginia. Most of the black-eyed pea cultivation in the region, however, took firmer hold in Florida and the Carolinas during the 18th century, reaching Virginia in full force following the American Revolution. The crop would also eventually prove popular in Texas. Throughout the South, the black-eyed pea is still a widely used ingredient in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States. The planting of crops of <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> was promoted by George Washington Carver because, as a legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. <b>Black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> contain calcium (41mg) folate (356 mcg), protein (13.22 g), fiber (11.1 g) and vitamin A (26 IU), among other nutrients, all for less than 200 Calories, in a 171-g, one-cup serving.|$|E

40|$|Backgound: The glycemic index (GI) is {{a notion}} that defences the {{glycaemic}} potency of foods. Foods with low GI will be digested and turned into glucose gradually and slowly. As a result blood glucose peak will not be so high and its fluctuation relatively in short time. Although cassava is {{a good source of}} carbohydrate, it has a high GI and low protein. Its GI factor needs to be reduced by any efforts to make it a healthy alternative food in spite of rice. Objective: To analize the effect of adding coconut and <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> to the GI factor of cassava. Method: The study used experimental observation design. There were three groups of treatment with 9 persons in each goup. After fasting for 10 hours, blood glucose were tested and 50 g of true glucose were given. Blood glucose of the subjects were tested again after 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes giving true glucose. Next on the seventh day, they were given boiled cassava, cassava with coconut (sawut) and cassava with <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> (gintul). After which their blood glucose were also tested. Results: GI factor of steam cassava, shredded cassava and shredded cassava with <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> (gintul) was 100, 40; 70, 90; and 61, 88; respectively. There was a significant difference of GI level between three products (p= 0, 031). Conclusion: Food processing by adding coconut and <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> has effect in reducing the GI level of cassava...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{as to the}} origin of this custom. Two popular {{explanations}} for the South’s association with peas and good luck dates back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman’s march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves lucky to be left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> evolved into a representation of good luck. In another Southern tradition, <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> was a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Years Day. Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations.|$|E
25|$|Other common foods, such as {{fried chicken}} and fish, {{macaroni}} and cheese, cornbread, and hoppin' john (<b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> and rice) are prepared simply. When the African-American population was considerably more rural than it generally is today, rabbit, opossum, squirrel, and waterfowl were important additions to the diet. Many of these food traditions are especially predominant {{in many parts of}} the rural South.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil's northeastern {{state of}} Bahia, {{especially}} {{in the city of}} Salvador, <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> are used in a traditional street food of Nigerian origin called akara.
