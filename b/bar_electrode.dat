The sensor array is formed by two sets of 16 parallel band electrodes that are arranged perpendicular {{to each other on}} the wafer surface. At each intersection, the crossing bars are separated by a ca. 65 nm high nanocavity, which is stabilized by the surrounding passivation layer. During operation, perpendicular <b>bar</b> <b>electrodes</b> are biased to potentials above and below the redox potential of species under investigation, thus, enabling repeated subsequent reactions at the two electrodes. By this means, a redox cycling current is formed across the gap that can be measured externally.

40|$|ABSTRACT Dielectrophoretic (DEP) {{forces have}} been used {{extensively}} to manipulate, separate, and localize biological cells and bioparticles via high-gradient electric fields. However, minimization of DEP exposure time is desirable, because of possible untoward effects on cell behavior. Toward this goal, this article investigates the geometric and material determinants of particle patterning kinetics and efficiency. In particular, {{the time required to}} achieve a steady-state pattern is theoretically modeled and experimentally validated for a planar, interdigitated <b>bar</b> <b>electrode</b> array energized in a standing-wave configuration. This measure of patterning efficiency is calculated from an improved Fourier series solution of DEP force, in which realistic boundary conditions and a finite chamber height are imposed to reflect typical microfluidic applications. The chamber height, electrode spacing, and fluid viscosity and conductivity are parameters that profoundly affect patterning efficiency, and optimization can reduce electric field exposure by orders of magnitude. Modeling strategies are generalizable to arbitrary electrode design as well as to conditions where DEP force may not act alone to cause particle motion. This improved understanding of DEP patterning kinetics provides a framework for new advances in the development of DEP-based biological devices and assays with minimal perturbation of cell behavior...|$|E

The addition of gold nanoparticles (0. 5 wt %) did not change the switching behavior of thicker film structures; however, devices incorporating the nanoparticles showed more reproducible characteristics. In most cases, a ""forming"" process, in which a large positive voltage {{was applied to the}} top Al electrode, was required before the NDR and conductivity switching were observed. Three different electrical conductivity mechanisms have been identified: Poole-Frenkel conductivity in unformed structures, linear current versus voltage characteristics for the ON state in formed devices, and superlinear current versus voltage behavior for the OFF state in formed devices. Models based on metallic filaments or on the injection and storage of charge do not explain all our experimental observations satisfactorily. Instead, an explanation based on the formation of nanocrystalline regions within the thin film is suggested.

40|$|Graphene has {{generated}} {{great interest in}} the scientific community since its discovery because of the unique chiral nature of its carrier dynamics. In monolayer graphene, the relativistic Dirac spectrum for the carriers results in an unconventional integer quantum Hall effect, with a peculiar Landau Level at zero energy. In bilayer graphene, the Dirac-like quadratic energy spectrum leads to an equally interesting, novel integer quantum Hall effect, with a eight-fold degenerate zero energy Landau level. In this thesis, we present transport studies at high magnetic field on both monolayer and bilayer graphene, with a particular emphasis on the quantum Hall (QH) effect at the charge neutrality point, where both systems exhibit broken symmetry of the degenerate Landau level at zero energy. We also present data on quantum Hall edge transport across the interface of a graphene monolayer and bilayer junction, where peculiar edge state transport is observed. We investigate the quantum Hall effect near the charge neutrality point in bilayer graphene, under high magnetic fields of up to 35 T using electronic transport measurements. In the high field regime, we observe a complete lifting of the eight-fold degeneracy of the zero-energy Landau level, with new quantum Hall states corresponding to filling factors ν= 0, 1, 2 and 3. Measurements of the activation energy gap in tilted magnetic fields suggest that the Landau level splitting at the newly formed ν= 1, 2 and 3 filling factors does not exhibit low-energy spin flip excitation. These measurements are consistent with the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet. In addition, we observed insulating behavior in the two terminal resistance of the ν= 0 state at high fields. For monolayer graphene, we report on magneto-resistance measurements at the broken-symmetry of the zero-energy Landau level, using both a conventional two-terminal measurement of suspended graphene devices, which is sensitive to bulk and edge conductance, and a Corbino measurement on high mobility on-substrate devices, which is sensitive to the bulk conductance only. At ν= 0, we observe a vanishing conductance with increasing magnetic fields in both cases. By examining the resistance changes of this insulating state with varying perpendicular and in-plane fields, we probe the spin-active components of the excitations in total fields of up to 45 Tesla. Our results strongly suggest that the ν= 0 quantum Hall state in single layer graphene is not spin polarized, while a spin-polarized state with spin-flip excitations forms at ν= 1. For monolayer and bilayer graphene junction system, we first present a surface potential study across the monolayer/bilayer interface. Then we present experimental investigations of the edge state transition across the interface in the quantum Hall regime. Both monolayer graphene (MG) and bilayer graphene (BG) develop their own Landau levels under high magnetic field. While transport measurements show their distinct quantum Hall effects in the separate parts of the monolayer and bilayer respectively, the transport measurement across the interface exhibits unusual transverse transport behavior. The transverse resistance across the MG/BG interface is asymmetric for opposite sides of the Hall bar, and its polarity can be changed by reversing the magnetic field direction. When the quantum Hall plateaus of MG and BG overlap, quantized resistance appears only {{on one side of the}} Hall <b>bar</b> <b>electrode</b> pairs that sit across the junction. These experimental observations can be ascribed to QH edge state transport across the MG/BG interface. We also present sample fabrication details, particularly the efforts to eliminate mobility-limiting factors, including cleaning polymer residue from the electron beam lithography process via thermal annealing and removing/changing the substrate by suspending multi-probe graphene devices...|$|E

Today s equipment designs must conform to domestic and international standards, however these standards do not specifically address the vibration exposure in the head and upper quarter. Further it is not well known how the control configuration within a vehicle (e. g. steering wheel versus arm controls) influences muscle voluntary and reflex activity levels. Greater muscle activity may lead to greater muscle fatigue - which in turn may be associated with greater risk of injury. 2 Thus, muscle contractions needed to maintain static postures as well as those resulting reflexively should be considered during an analysis of seating position. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the influence of arm position on head and neck muscle function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative muscle activities of 5 neck, shoulder, and upper arm muscles during riding simulations of large construction equipment, using three different arm control options. Methods Five typical heavy equipment ride files were played back through a man-rated Servo Test 6 -degree of freedom (dof) vibration system. Each ride was repeated using 3 seat and control configurations (steering wheel (SW), floor mounted arm-rest controls (FM), seat mounted arm-rest controls (SM)). Two trials were performed for each ride and seat control combination (each trial: 60 sec of 6 -dof and 60 sec of vertical vibration). Five channels of surface electromyography (EMG) of the right-side cervical erector spinae muscles (neck extensors), sternocleidomastoid (neck flexor), upper trapezius (shoulder elevator), biceps brachii (elbow flexor) and triceps brachii (elbow extensor) muscles were collected throughout each ride (~ 2 min) using pre-amplified (10 x), 1 cm silver <b>bar</b> <b>electrodes,</b> with 1 cm fixed inter-electrode distances (Delsys, Inc).

After shaving, abrasion and cleaning with the alcohol, we placed the pre-amplified bipolar differential electrodes (Ag/AgCl, input impedance: 1 MΩ, <b>electrode</b> <b>bar</b> size: 1 [*]×[*] 10  mm each, DE- 2.1, DELSYS, USA) on the surface of each muscle with an inter-electrode distance of 10  mm (CMRR: 92  dB, Gain: 1000, Band-pass filter: 20 – 450  Hz, Bagnoli 8 EMG System, DELSYS, Boston, MA, USA). The reference electrode was placed over the left lateral malleolus (11  mm diameter, Blue sensor, N- 00 -S, Ambu, Denmark). The analog data of EMG signals, torques and joint angles were converted into the digital data using a 16 -bit analog-to-digital converter (Power-lab/ 16 SP, ADInstrument, Australia). The sampling frequency was set at 4  kHz.|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{with which}} the fibre direction of the multifidus muscle can be predicted in females is comparable to that for males, and is well {{within the limits of}} accuracy obtainable in the placement of surface electrodes in relation to a reference line drawn on the skin, i. e. +/- 5 degrees. In females, the observed deviation of the iliocostalis fibres from the corresponding reference line may, however, add some degree of error to the proper orientation of <b>electrode</b> <b>bars</b> perpendicular to muscle fibres. It may thus be concluded that the surface recording of EMG power spectrum parameters of the iliocostalis in women cannot be carried out as accurately as for the multifidus muscle. Nevertheless, the resulting recording error associated with a possible orientation deviation of, for example, 13 degrees is rather small (3 %) and may be acceptable for clinical research purposes...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} normative amplitude {{values for}} relative difference {{measurements of the}} middle latency response (MLR) in normal-hearing pediatrics and to determine if these measurements provided a significant reduction of within-group variability when compared to raw, absolute amplitude measures. A relative amplitude difference is defined in the present paper as the difference in Na-Pa amplitude between two electrodes (e. g. vertical bar Na-Pa at C 3 minus Na-Pa at C 4 vertical <b>bar,</b> or <b>electrode</b> effects) or between two ears (e. g. vertical bar Na-Pa on left ear stimulation minus Na-Pa on right ear stimulation vertical bar, or ear effects). In contrast, an absolute amplitude {{is defined as a}} single Na-Pa measurement made at one electrode for stimulation of one ear (e. g. Na-Pa measured at C 3 on left ear stimulation). Design: Cross-sectional study. Study sample: 155 pediatrics with normal peripheral and central hearing, and no history of psychological, neurological, or learning disability issues. Results: Within-group variability was significantly smaller for relative differences when compared to absolute amplitude measures. Electrode effects showed significantly less variability than ear effects. Normative values for ear and electrode effects were reported. Conclusions: Relative differences may provide better utility in the clinical diagnosis of central auditory pathology in pediatrics when compared to absolute amplitude measures because these difference measures show significantly lower variability when examined across subjects.

40|$|We present local {{electrical}} {{characterization of}} epitaxial graphene grown on both Si- and C-faces of 4 H-SiC using Electrostatic Force Microscopy and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy in ambient conditions and at elevated temperatures. These techniques provide a straightforward identification of graphene domains with various thicknesses on the substrate where topographical determination is hindered by adsorbates and SiC terraces. We also use Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy which allows quantitative surface potential measurements with high spatial resolution. Using these techniques, we study {{evolution of a}} layer of atmospheric water {{as a function of}} temperature, which is accompanied by a significant change of the absolute surface potential difference. We show that the nanoscale wettability of the material is strongly dependent on the number of graphene layers, where hydrophobicity increases with graphene thickness. We also use micron-sized graphene Hall <b>bars</b> with gold <b>electrodes</b> to calibrate work function of the electrically conductive probe and precisely and quantitatively define the work functions for single- and double-layer graphene...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEDM is {{a useful}} method for {{machining}} hard materials. Particularly, ED-milling using a simple <b>bar</b> or pipe <b>electrode</b> is an attractive method to machine 3 D cavities. However, {{it is difficult to}} suppress the electrode wear completely. On the other hand, in cases of WEDM and WEDG it is usually not necessary to consider the electrode wear. We can even use such materials like brass wire that wear easily. We developed a new method combining the advantages of ED-milling and WEDM/WEDG. It is named WED-milling (wire electrical discharge milling). In this method a wire guide with a hemisphere tip is used. The wire slides along the groove prepared {{on the surface of the}} tip. The wire guide is reciprocated in rotary state and moved along the designed path for generating the 3 D shape. By this method, 3 D machining similar to the mechanical milling with a ball end mill is realized. This method is free from the problems such as tool wear or the built-up edge in mechanical milling. In this paper, several machining properties of WED-milling are introduced...|$|R
40|$|A {{sample of}} 25 golfers, 12 {{professionals}} and 13 amateurs, ages 23 to 63 years, were measured for transverse plane pelvic rotation using light electrodes positioned bilaterally on the iliac crests. Transverse plane pelvic rotation {{was present in}} all of the golfers measured. All subjects were measured from a shoulder width stance, two inches wider and two inches narrower than shoulder width in a standing, erect posture and a golf set-up posture without a club. Transverse plane pelvic rotation in the 25 subjects ranged from 1 inch to 4 inches as recorded by stance correction with an average of 2. 25 inches of rotation at a shoulder width stance. A dowel pole <b>bar</b> with light <b>electrodes</b> fixed to the bar was attached to the transverse pelvic plane 3 inches below the iliac crest for the purpose of validation of a measurement instrument in the field. The pelvic rotation was temporarily corrected through a simple three minute exercise program. Nineteen of the 25 subjects were seen in follow-up in the field where the dowel bar was used and they had each returned to their measured baseline pelvic rotation. Again, their measured pelvic rotation was corrected via a simple three minute exercise program. The authors discuss the use of the exercise program for both golf coaching and research, and also present the validation of a simple instrument {{that could be used in}} the field to measure transverse pelvic plane rotation...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here on the}} {{synthesis}} of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) covalently modified with ferrocene groups (FcPVC) and the electrochemical behavior of the resulting polymeric membranes in view of designing all solid state voltammetric ion sensors. The Huisgen cycloaddition (”click chemistry”) {{was found to be}} a simple and efficient method for ferrocene attachment. A degree of PVC modification with ferrocene groups between 1. 9 and 6. 1 mol % was achieved. The chemical modification of the PVC backbone does not significantly affect the ion-selective properties (selectivity, mobility, and solvent casting ability) of potentiometric sensing membranes applying this polymer. Importantly, the presence of such ferrocene groups may eliminate the need for an additional redox-active layer between the membrane and the inner electric contact in all solid state sensor designs. Electrochemical doping of this system was studied in a symmetrical sandwich configuration: glassy carbon <b>electrode</b> vertical <b>bar</b> FcPVC vertical <b>bar</b> glassy carbon <b>electrode.</b> Prior electrochemical doping from aqueous solution, resulting in a partial oxidation of the ferrocene groups, was confirmed to be necessary for the sandwich configuration to pass current effectively. The results suggest that only similar to 2. 3 mol % of the ferrocene groups are electrochemically accessible, likely due to surface confined electrochemical behavior in the polymer. Indeed, cyclic voltammetry of aqueous hexacyanoferrate (III) remains featureless at cathodic potentials (down to - 0. 5 V). This indicates that the modified membrane is not responsive to redox-active species in the sample solution, making it possible to apply this polymer as a traditional, single membrane. Yet, the redox capacity of the elect-ode modified with this type of membrane was more than 520 mu C considering a 20 mm(2) active electrode area, which appears to be sufficient for numerous practical ion voltammetric applications. The electrode was observed to operate reproducibly, with 1 % standard deviation, when applying pulsed amperometric techniques...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{electrochemical}} {{system has}} been developed which integrates hydrogen production, storage and compression in only one device, at relatively low cost and high efficiency. The development of efficient and reliable energy storage systems based on hydrogen technology represents a challenge to seasonal storage based on renewable hydrogen. State of the art renewable energy generation systems include separate units such as electrolyser, hydrogen storage vessel and a fuel cell system for the conversion of H 2 back into electricity, when required. In this work, a compact unit integrating production and storage is proposed. The developed prototype comprises a six electrode cell assembly using an AB 5 type metal hydride and Ni plates as counterelectrodes, in a 35 wt% KOH solution. During charging, hydrogen is absorbed in the metal hydride and corresponding oxygen is conveyed out of the system. Conversely, {{in the case of}} discharging hydrogen stored in the metal hydride is released to an external H 2 storage. In the present prototype, released hydrogen was delivered into the hydrogen storage up to a pressure of 15 <b>Bar.</b> Metal hydride <b>electrodes</b> with chemical composition LaNi 4. 3 Co 0. 4 Al 0. 3 were prepared by high frequency vacuum melting followed by high temperature annealing at 1000 O C during 8 hours. X-Ray phase analysis showed typical hexagonal structure and no traces of other intermetallic compounds belonging to the La-Ni phase diagram. Thermodynamic study has been performed in a Sieverts type of apparatus produced by Labtech. Int. During cycling, charging was run at 40 A at cell voltages of 1. 7 V for two hours which corresponds to C/ 2 charging time. Hydrogen was released by applying a constant current of 40 A for two hours until cell voltage rise from 0. 5 to 1. 7 V, {{at the end of the}} processes. The process was studied in-situ using a gas chromatograph from Agilent. It is anticipated that the device will be integrated as a combined hydrogen generator and storage unit in a stand alone system associated to a 1 kW fuel cell...|$|R
