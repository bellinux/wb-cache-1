40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Washington State UniversityAs {{part of the}} USDA Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project, 899 two-row {{spring barley}} lines were genotyped at 3072 SNP markers and phenotyped for four food quality traits: kernel hardness, {{polyphenol}} oxidase (PPO) activity, total phenolics, and amylose content. Analysis of the existing consensus map for this marker set revealed significant distortion in the fine structure of the Hardness locus on chromosome 5 H. To create a revised barley consensus map with improved fine structure, new algorithms for the simplification and linearization of consensus graphs were developed and implemented in the R package DAGGER. DAGGER uses quadratic programming to generate a consensus map with minimum error relative to the linkage maps while remaining ordinally consistent with them. The root-mean-squared error between the barley linkage maps and the DAGGER map was 0. 82 cM per marker interval compared to 2. 28 cM for the existing consensus map. Association mapping of the <b>barley</b> food <b>quality</b> traits identified significant features corresponding to the PPO locus on chromosome 2 H and the Wax locus on 7 H, {{but the majority of}} the genetic variation was unaccounted for. While the polygenic nature of the food quality traits makes traditional marker-assisted selection difficult, genomic selection is well suited for this complexity because all markers are included in the prediction model. A key method for the genomic prediction of breeding values is ridge regression (RR), which is equivalent to BLUP when the genetic covariance between lines is proportional to their similarity in genotype space. This additive model can be broadened to include epistatic effects by using other kernels, such as the Gaussian, which represent inner products in a complex feature space. To facilitate the use of RR and non-additive kernels in plant breeding, a new software package for R called rrBLUP was developed. When applied to the <b>barley</b> food <b>quality</b> traits, the cross-validation accuracy between phenotype and predicted breeding value ranged from 0. 31 for total phenolics to 0. 56 for kernel hardness.

Differences in the sequence of the gene in different varieties or differences in the level of expression of the gene may be used to explain differences in processing or end use quality characteristics. For example, quantitative analysis of the levels of expression of genes at different stages during seed development in wheat or germination in barley can be used to define the genetic basis of differences in wheat and <b>barley</b> <b>quality.</b> Rice quality traits such as fragrance and gelatinization temperature (cooking temperature) can be explained by DNA sequence differences in specific genes.

40|$|The {{activities}} of barley and malt proteinases have been measured using haemoglobin and the highly degradable barley protein fraction (HDBPF) in malting and feed barley varieties. In conjunction, the barley and malt total protein and its components: hordein, glutelin, soluble proteins and {{free amino nitrogen}} (FAN) as well as Kolbach index were investigated. The comparative analysis of results revealed that the general grain modification index of Kolbach (KI), which was higher in malting varieties, was much more strongly associated with the levels of hordein degraded during malting than any other parameter investigated. The KI levels were also correlated {{with the increase in}} the levels of FAN, but not with the increase in the levels of soluble protein or changes in the glutelin component. The changes in total proteinase activity were low and cannot account for the increase in KI or the degraded hordein. The levels of total proteinase activity in both feed and malting barley varieties were similar. The results suggest that estimation of the levels of degraded hordein, during malting, is a sensitive indicator of the total proteolytic action of proteinases as well as the degradability of the reserve proteins. Therefore, we recommend measuring the amounts of hordein degraded during malting for the assessment of the impacts of grain protein and proteinases on malting <b>barley</b> <b>quality</b> of different varieties, in addition to KI and FAN. ...|$|E

For my internship, I worked as a Barley Scientist Intern for MillerCoors and Golden Malting in Golden, Colorado. During this internship I gained a fundamental understanding of malting barley production with a significant emphasis on grain quality. Barley produced for malting must fulfill strict industry quality standards before it is accepted by the head maltsters. These quality standards include: a high germination rate, low moisture content, protein content within an acceptable range and the grain must be free from disease and insect damage. Malting <b>barley</b> <b>quality</b> attributes are directly correlated with {{the conditions in which}} the barley was produced. ^ This paper provides a brief history of barley domestication and describes why barley became the grain of choice for malting and the subsequent making of beer. The three main steps of malting (steeping, germination, and kilning) are outlined to emphasize the role quality plays in the malting process. A description of farming practices that contribute to these quality attributes is presented, along with recommendations that may enhance crop production. This document has a special emphasis on the management of the Russian Wheat Aphid (Diurpahis noxia Mordvilko) as well as the fungal diseases Fusarium Head Blight (Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) and Ergot (Claviceps purpurea (Fr.)

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} the evolution relationship of the members of the B-hordein gene family in hull-less barley by analysis of their structure and to explore their utility in grain quality improvement. Six copies of the B-hordein gene (Hn 1 -Hn 3, Hn 7 -Hn 9) were cloned from six hull-less barley cultivars collected from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and molecularly characterized. Comparison of their predicted polypeptide sequences with the published data suggested that they all share the same basic protein structures. In addition, we found that the C-terminal end sequences of all B-hordeins shared a similar feature. In the six clones and the other three published genes (Hn 4, Hn 5, and Hn 6) from hull-less barley, Hn 2 and Hn 7 contained the identical C-terminal end sequence DIMPVDFWH. Hn 3, Hn 4, Hn 5, Hn 8 and Hn 9 also shared the common sequence DIMPPDFWH, which was similar to that of a B-hordein reported previously. Both Hn 1 and Hn 6 exhibited differences in their C-terminal end sequences, and they clustered into different subgroups. The B-hordeins with identical C-terminal end sequences were clustered into the same subgroup, so we believe that B-hordein -ene subfamilies possibly can be classified on the basis of the conserved C-terminal end sequences of predicted polypeptide. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that there is a relatively weak identity between our predicted B-hordeins and those reported from H. chilense and H. brevisubulatum.

To assess the effect of candidate fumigants on <b>barley</b> <b>quality,</b> malting and brewing trials were conducted with malting barley (Schooner), 9. 4 % moisture content, fumigated with carbonyl sulphide (COS), ethyl formate (EF) and carbon disulphide (CS 2) at concentrations of 20, 90 and 36 mg/L respectively for 7 days at 20 °C in riveted steel silos containing 33 t of barley. The appropriate industry body, the Malting and Brewing Industry Barley Technical Committee (MBIBTC) set the quality parameters to be evaluated and allocated work to the appropriate quality laboratories. Germination of fumigated barley was not affected by the fumigants. Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in outloading barley samples were 0. 085 ± 0. 0052, 0. 4 ± 0. 1 and 2. 22 ± 0. 07 mg/kg respectively, which were below the experimental permits of maximum residue levels (MRL). Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in malt, wort and beer were indistinguishable from those in unfumigated (or non-fumigated) barley. Ethyl formate and CS 2 affected wort in increasing the apparent attenuation limit (AAL) and CS 2 affected barley colour. Sulphur volatiles in the trial beer made from EF and CS 2 (unlike COS) fumigated barley decreased significantly.

40|$|Due to its {{importance}} as a cereal crop worldwide, high {{interest in the}} determination of factors influencing <b>barley</b> grain <b>quality</b> exists. This study focusses on the elucidation of protein networks affecting early grain developmental processes. NanoLC-based separation coupled to label-free MS detection was applied to gain insights into biochemical processes during five different grain developmental phases (pre-storage until storage phase, 3 days to 16 days after flowering). Multivariate statistics revealed two distinct developmental patterns during the analysed grain developmental phases: proteins showed either highest abundance in the middle phase of development – in the transition phase – or at later developmental stages – within the storage phase. Verification of developmental patterns observed by proteomic analysis was done by applying hypothesis-driven approaches, namely Western Blot analysis and enzyme assays. High general metabolic activity of the grain with regard to protein synthesis, cell cycle regulation, defence against oxidative stress, and energy production via photosynthesis was observed in the transition phase. Proteins upregulated in the storage phase are related towards storage protein accumulation, and interestingly to the defence of storage reserves against pathogens.

40|$|Malting {{quality is}} {{composed}} of numerous interacting traits with a high complexity concerning their biochemical and genetic basis. Malt extract is key indicator of barley malting quality {{and it is a}} mega-trait since it is influenced by a number of independent component traits. Understanding genetic and non-genetic factors that effects grain quality and grain yield is crucial in developing new cultivars, seed and mercantile production. Path analysis is one of the reliable statistical techniques which allow separation of the direct effect of each component trait on malt quality from the indirect effects caused by the interdependence component trait. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate spring two-row <b>barley</b> <b>quality</b> as mega-trait depending on the component traits in the conditions of the Pannonian environments. Regression analysis with extract (EXT) as dependant and other traits (yield-YIL, test weight-TW, grain weight-GW, grading-GRA, grain protein concentration-GPC, viscosity-VIS, Kolbach index-KOL, Hartong number-HAR) as independent traits was performed out. Simple coefficient of correlations were calculated between independent traits and EXT in all pair combination and then used as inputs for path coefficient analysis. The quadratic curve fitted the best relationship between EXT and the independent traits. EXT was in positive (P< 0. 01) relationship with GW, GRA, KOL, and HAR with simple correlation coefficient of 0. 47, 0. 42, 0. 39 and 0. 50, respectively and in negative (P< 0. 01) relationship with GPC and VIS with simple correlation coefficient of - 0. 72 and - 0. 51, respectively.

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the number, genome location and effects of QTLs determining malting quality and agronomic traits in the two North American <b>barley</b> <b>quality</b> standards. Using a doubled haploid population of 140 lines from the cross of Harrington x Morex, agronomic phenotype and malting quality data sets from nine and eight environments, respectively, and a 107 -marker linkage map, QTL analyses were performed using simple interval mapping and simplified composite interval mapping procedures. Thirty five QTLs were associated either across environments or in individual environments, with five grain and agronomic traits (yield, kernel plumpness, test weight, heading date and plant height). Thirteen QTLs were associated with five malting quality traits (grain protein percentage, soluble/total protein ratio, α-amylase activity, diastatic power and malt extract percentage). QTLs for multiple traits were coincident. The loci controlling inflorescence type [vrsl on chromosome 2 (2 H) and int-c on chromosome 4 (4 H) ] were coincident with QTLs affecting all traits except heading date and malt extract percentage. The largest effect QTLs -for yield, kernel plumpness test weight, plant height grain protein percentage, S/T ratio, and diastatic power- were coincident with the vrsl locus. QTL analyses were conducted separately for each sub-population (six-rowed and two-rowed). Ten new QTLs were detected in the sub-populations. There were significant interactions between the vrsl and int-c loci for plant height, grain protein percentage, and SIT protein ratio. Positive transgressive segregants were found for all agronomic traits. They were more prevalent in the six-rowed sub-population, indicating that more favorable alleles were fixed in the two-rowed parent. Results suggest that this mating of two parents representing different germplasm groups caused a disruption in the balance of traits involved in malting quality, which resulted in no progeny carrying all favorable alleles and therefore surpassing the quality of either parent.

The eight spring two-row barley varieties were studied during a seven growing seasons (1998 - 2004) on the location Novi Sad (45 ° 20 'N, 15 ° 51 'E, 86 m asl). The growing season predominantly affected variation of the all studied grain and malt quality attributes of spring barley where its percentage of variance was 35. 2 %, 20. 2 %, 32. 5 %, 25. 4 %, 30. 9 %, 31. 2 %, and 38. 5 % for grain weight (GW), grading (GRA), grain protein content (GPC), viscosity (VIS), Kolbach index (KOL), Hartong number (HAR) and extract content (EXT), respectively.

The genetic component of variance ranged from 11. 1 % for GRA to 35. 0 % for EXT. The heritability was the lowest for GRA- 0. 54 and the highest for EXT- 0. 91. Across growing seasons GW ranged from 39. 6 to 46. 1 g, GRA from 76. 7 to 91. 1 %, GPC from 12. 1 to 13. 5 g 100 - 1 g dm, VIS from 1. 44 till 1. 61 m.

50|$|In 1923, {{the land}} was {{acquired}} by the Crown and {{was used by the}} State Wheat Board for the storage of wheat until 1930, when the newly formed Barley Board, established to deal with surplus crops, reopened the malthouse which was leased to Queensland Brewery Co who agreed to malt all <b>barley</b> of malting <b>quality</b> delivered by the Barley Board. During World War II, malting operations ceased and the site was occupied by the defence forces. In 1959 the complex was purchased by the Northern Australian Brewers Ltd, who had leased the complex from 1951. A $1 million modernisation and expansion program was commenced in 1968. This included the erection of new buildings to house automatic malting technology. About this time the 1897 malthouse and part of the 1899 building were demolished.|$|R
40|$|Barley is {{the second}} largest grain crop {{produced}} in Australia and has two primary end uses. The first use is the premium market for malt and beer production. The second use is animal consumption. The quality of barley for the range of end uses {{is influenced by the}} cultivar itself as well as the growing environment. A detailed understanding of these factors at the genetic and biochemical levels was required to enable breeding program to select for quality improvement. A number of grain and end product quality traits were assessed for genetic and environmental affects as well as their interaction. Grain size has an important impact on quality and large plump grain is desirable for malt and feed quality. The results from the research conducted in this study clearly show that grain size was affected by cultivar and environmental conditions. Using screenings (3 ̆c 2. 2 mm) and retention (3 ̆e 2. 5 mm) data provided information on how cultivars performed under a range of environmental conditions, which included irrigated (water unlimited) to terminal moisture stress (no in crop rain). The results showed a strong genetic component in the variation in grain size and {{it would be possible to}} select for increased grain size but also stable grain size when considering cultivars grown under adverse environmental conditions. The husk content in barley impacts on malt and feed quality. The results in this studied showed there were significant genetic effects as well as environments effects on the level of husk. In addition, it was identified that the genetic regions controlled husk expression were associated with two other quality traits, namely, resistance to kernel discolouration and resistance to pre-harvest sprouting (dormancy). These regions on chromosome 4 H and 6 H are also associated with previously identified dormancy genes. Hardness is a trait not usually considered when assessing <b>barley</b> <b>quality</b> but the results from this study showed there are differences in the level of barley hardness, as measured by three methods, as well as differences in the hardness gene sequence. The three hardness methods used showed that barley hardness could be measured independently of the method used, but also that there were significant genetic and environmental effects on hardness. However, the results from sequencing for allelic variation in the hardness genes showed that while there was polymorphism, and hance the transcribed protein had little effect on variation in quality. The cultivars used were malting and feed cultivars and a set of iv breeding lines targeted at malt quality. It may be possible to identify diverse haplotypes from the use of wild relatives or landraces. This study also investigated the variation in barley for cattle feed quality. Feed quality was determined using an in-sacco dry matter digestibility (ISDMD) assay in fistulated cows as well as three other laboratory assays, namely acid detergent fibre, starch and particle size. These four traits are then used to calculate Net Energy (NE) and Average Daily Gain (ADG). The results show that there were genetic and environmental effects on feed quality. The key trait was the ISDMD assay and there were significant differences between the cultivars tested. The data suggested feed quality was a measurable and definable attribute that could be used in breeding selection. The final aspect of this study compared the feed data obtained with routine malt quality traits, of friability and hot water extract. There were strong genetic and environmental effects. The malting cultivars generally had the highest level of ADG and NE. The results also showed that there were negative correlations between extract and husk, ISDMD and ADG. Positive correlations were shown between friability and hardness, extract and test weight, and there was only a slight correlation between average daily gain and extract. An important aspect of this study was the calculation of the genetic component for each trait. This was carried using spatial analysis of mixed models. It was necessary to use this approach so a true estimation of the genetic component could be calculated which would then allow for the calculation of heritability. In plant breeding, the cultivar is not a fixed effect but rather a random variable, hence it was not possible to use normal analysis of variation (ANOVA) models. Rather models were written with cultivars, like environment and field position, as random effects which will allow the effect of each random variable to be accounted for in the analysis. Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs) are calculated and presented for all traits. For all the traits measured in this study, heritability values were calculated to ascertain the level of success in improving these traits through breeding. The range in heritability for grain size was 40 to 90...|$|E
40|$|High malting <b>quality</b> of <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{relies on}} many traits, such as β-amylase and limit {{dextrinase}} activities and β-glucan and protein fraction contents. In this study, interval mapping was utilized to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting these malting quality parameters using a doubled haploid (DH) population from a cross of CM 72 (six-rowed) by Gairdner (two-rowed) barley cultivars. A total of nine QTLs for eight traits were mapped to chromosomes 3 H, 4 H, 5 H, and 7 H. Five {{of the nine}} QTLs mapped to chromosome 3 H, indicating a possible role of loci on chromosome 3 H on malting quality. The phenotypic variation accounted by individual QTL ranged from 8. 08 % to 30. 25 %. The loci of QTLs for β-glucan and limit dextrinase were identified on chromosomes 4 H and 5 H, respectively. QTL for hordeins was coincident with the region of silica eluate (SE) protein on 3 HS, while QTLs for albumins, globulins, and total protein exhibited overlapping. One locus on chromosome 3 H {{was found to be}} related to β-amylase, and two loci on chromosomes 5 H and 7 H were found to be associated with glutelins. The identification of these novel QTLs controlling malting quality may be useful for marker-assisted selection in improving <b>barley</b> malting <b>quality...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the {{development}} of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars for malting purposes, it is usually not possible to select for malt quality characteristics in early generations {{because of the high}} cost associated with micromalting large numbers of grain samples and assessing quality traits on the resulting malt samples and because of the sensitivity of quantitative malt quality traits to environmental variation. Thus, <b>barley</b> malting <b>quality</b> may be a good candidate for marker-assisted selection. Here, the objective was to use marker-based selection to manipulate a malt quality characteristic, -amylase activity, in a barley breeding population. Marker-based selection was applied among F₂:₃ lines from the cross ‘Morex’/‘Labelle’, targeting Morex alleles in a region of chromosome 7 (5 H) that had previously been found to affect -amylase activity in the cross ‘Steptoe’/Morex. The target region was represented by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers. Selected lines were grown in field plots in two years. Agronomic and grain quality data were measured. Grain samples were micromalted and assessed for malt quality traits. Selection for the Morex allele at two PCR markers on chromosome 7 (5 H) was effective in increasing -amylase activity. It was concluded that marker-based selection for a quantitative trait locus could be effective even when applied in a population other than the mapping population.

40|$|In recent decades, {{research}} in barley {{has led to}} improvements in several biochemical and chemical characteristics (e. g. protein, starch, β glucans) associated with malt composition and end product quality (e. g. beer).

40|$|Abstract: The {{variation}} between {{wild barley}} lines (Hordeum murinum, Hordeum bulbosum and Hordeum vulgare spontaneum) orig-inated from Turkey were investigated comparatively {{at the molecular}} level with the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Leaf DNAs extracted from different barley lines were amplified with randomly chosen primers in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Rates of polymorphisms between the 23 lines were determined in pairwise comparisons. The lowest value of poly-morphism was determined to be 0. 3 % between wild barley lines numbered 50327 and 50354, and between 48101 and 50365 while the highest polymorphism value was determined to be 60 % between wild barley lines numbered 40659 and 49047. The results can be used in the selection of commercially important traits (such as resistance against disease, drought etc.) present in wild barley lines. Thus, development of high <b>quality</b> <b>barley</b> cultivars will be possible. Arpada Genetik Varyasyonun RAPD Analiz...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{influence of}} agronomic factors on {{the profitability of}} growing spring malting barley. Results were processed from the field experiment on the Experimental Field Station in Žabčice. Spring barley is grown after the previous crop grain maize and sugar beet. There were used different tillage systems - ploughing, loosening and direct sowing. The effects of these factors were evaluated on grain yield, protein content and other quality parameters. In 2015, the most proven previous crop was corn when spring <b>barley</b> achieved malting <b>quality.</b> Spring <b>barley</b> grown after sugar beet had high grain yield, but low protein content. For barley grown after corn the best tillage system was loosening. For barley grown after sugar beet it was ploughing. It was favourable weather for growing malting barley in the reporting year. For that reason it was achieved high yields for all variants and there was low effect of fungicides...|$|R
