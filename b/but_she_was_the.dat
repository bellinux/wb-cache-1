25|$|Julian Bashir {{was able}} to save the Dax {{symbiont}}, which {{was sent back to}} the Trill homeworld to be rejoined with a new host aboard the USS Destiny. When the symbiont's health worsened, the Dax symbiont was implanted into a new host named Ezri Dax, who was the assistant ship's counselor. She had not been trained to be a host, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only available unjoined Trill aboard. Ezri had difficulty making the transition and sought out Ben Sisko on Earth. She helped him on his mission and then returned to DS9 with him. She accepted his request to stay on as station counselor.|$|E
25|$|By 1770, {{her home}} on Hill Street {{had become the}} premiere salon in London. Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, David Garrick, and Horace Walpole {{were all in the}} circle. For writers, being {{introduced}} there meant patronage, and Montagu patronized a number of authors, including Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, Frances Burney, Anna Barbauld, Sarah Fielding, Hester Chapone, James Beattie, and Anna Williams. Samuel Johnson's hostess, Hester Thrale, was also an occasional visitor to Hill Street. Among her persistent admirers was the physician Messenger Monsey. Among the blue stockings, Elizabeth Montagu was not the dominant personality, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> woman of greatest means, and it was her house, purse, and power that made the society possible. As a literary critic, she was a fan of Samuel Richardson, both Fieldings (Henry Fielding and Sarah Fielding), and Fanny Burney, and she was pleased to discover that Laurence Sterne was a distant relation. She was related to Laurence Sterne through the Botham family. Sterne entrusted her with the disposition of his papers upon his departure for France. He was in ill health and the prospect of his dying abroad was real. She was a supporter of Bishop Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.|$|E

500|$|Once Jellicoe's ships had rendezvoused {{with the}} 2nd BS, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, {{on the morning}} of 31 May, he {{organised}} {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd BS were on his left (east), the 4th BS was in the centre and the 1st BS on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 4th and 1st Battle Squadrons in the center and rear of the line of battle, respectively, which meant that the sisters were at the rear of the Grand Fleet once it finished deploying. Both ships fired at the crippled light cruiser [...] with unknown results. They also engaged and hit the battlecruisers [...] and [...] multiple times, although only inflicting light damage. In return, Seydlitz hit Colossus twice, with only minor effect, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only battleship in the main body of the Grand Fleet to be hit by gunfire during the battle. They also fired at German destroyers, but failed to make any hits. Neither of the sisters fired more than 98 rounds from their main guns during the battle.|$|E

[...] "She {{sounds like}} a particularly sensitive growl trumpeter", according to Nat Hentoff. He describes her wordless vocals as, [...] "really another instrument...sometimes...evocative growls". The creativity must be shared between Ellington and Hall as he knew the style of performance he wanted, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one {{who was able to}} produce the sound. In 1932, Ellington repeated the experiment in one of his versions of [...] "The Mooche", with Baby Cox singing scat after a muted similar trombone solo by Tricky Sam Nanton.|$|E

2500|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequencing}} of actin {{was completed by}} M. Elzinga and co-workers in 1973. The crystal structure of G-actin was solved in 1990 by Kabsch and colleagues. [...] In the same year, a model for F-actin was proposed by Holmes and colleagues following experiments using co-crystallization with different proteins. The procedure of co-crystallization with different proteins was used repeatedly during the following years, until in 2001 the isolated protein was crystallized along with ADP. However, {{there is still no}} high-resolution X-ray structure of F-actin. The crystallization of F-actin was possible due to the use of a rhodamine conjugate that impedes polymerization by blocking the amino acid cys-374. Christine Oriol-Audit died in the same year that actin was first crystallized <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> researcher that in 1977 first crystallized actin in the absence of Actin Binding Proteins (ABPs). However, the resulting crystals were too small for the available technology of the time.|$|E
