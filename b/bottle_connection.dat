5000|$|There is also [...] "an {{upstream}} connected {{frangible disc}} safety relief device" [...] {{located on the}} valve assembly which {{is also known as}} the [...] "tri-dimensional burst disk". This burst disk protects the user against a situation where the pressure in the bottle would increase with exposure to heat during a fire. It prevents unwanted failures somewhere else in the bottle. It is set to release at 7200 psi, or 400 °F. It is [...] "tri-dimensional" [...] in that, if it is activated, it would disperse the air from the bottle in three directions so as not to throw the user off his or her balance. The high pressure male coupling, included in high pressure <b>bottle</b> <b>connections,</b> is set to met the Compressed Gas Association Standards #346 and #347.Also included in the assembly are the dual-sided pressure gauge (which reads the cylinder pressure directly from the cylinder), elastomeric bumper (a protective, rubber like stop), and hangar plate (for positive locking attachment of the assembly to the backframe).|$|R
