Started from the late 19th century, the shoeshine services sprung up in Hong Kong. From the post-war period to the colonial period, the earliest gangs of shoe shiners were proclaimed as “Chat Hi Siu Gwai Dui”(Shoe Shine Busters 擦鞋小鬼隊). A band of seven elderly men clustered in Theatre Lane just across Lan Kwai Fong, cleaning shoes of office executives.

60|$|But it is {{not merely}} by the effort to {{maintain}} too much elegance that the sense of home liberty is banished from a house. It is sometimes expelled in another way, with all painstaking and conscientious strictness, by the worthiest and best of human beings, the blessed followers of Saint Martha. Have we not known them, the deaf, worthy creatures, up before daylight, causing most scrupulous lustrations of every pane of glass and inch of paint in our parlors, in consequence whereof every shutter and blind must be kept closed for days to come, lest the flies should speck the freshly washed windows and wainscoting? Dear shade of Aunt Mehitabel, forgive our boldness! Have we not been driven for days, in our youth, to read our newspaper in the front veranda, in the kitchen, out in the barn,--anywhere, in fact, where sunshine could be found,--because {{there was not a}} room in the house that was not cleaned, shut up, and darkened? Have we not shivered with cold, all the glowering, gloomy month of May, because, the august front parlor having undergone the spring cleaning, the andirons were snugly tied up in the tissue-paper, and an elegant frill of the same material was trembling before the mouth of the once glowing fireplace? Even so, dear soul, full of loving-kindness and hospitality as thou wast, yet ever making our house seem like a tomb! And with what patience wouldst thou sit sewing by a crack in the shutters an inch wide, rejoicing in thy immaculate paint and clear glass! But was there ever a thing of thy spotless and unsullied belongings which a boy might use? How I trembled to touch thy scoured tins, that hung in appalling brightness! with what awe I asked for a basket to pick strawberries! and where in the house could I find a place to eat a piece of gingerbread? How like a ruffian, a Tartar, a pirate, I always felt when I entered thy domains! and how, from day to day, I wondered at the immeasurable depths of depravity which were always leading me to upset something, or break or tear or derange something, in thy exquisitely kept premises! Somehow the impression was burned with overpowering force into my mind that houses and furniture, scrubbed floors, white curtains, <b>bright</b> <b>tins</b> and brasses, were the great, awful, permanent facts of existence; and that men and women, and particularly children, were the meddlesome intruders upon this divine order, every trace of whose intermeddling must be scrubbed out and obliterated in the quickest way possible. It seemed evident to me that houses would be far more perfect if nobody lived in them at all, but that, as men had really and absurdly taken to living in them, they must live as little as possible. My only idea of a house was a place full of traps and pitfalls for boys, a deadly temptation to sins which beset one every moment; and when I read about a sailor's free life on the ocean, I felt an untold longing to go forth and be free in like manner.|$|R

40|$|Surprisingly, {{after almost}} 60 years of {{research}} into the causes of tin whisker formation, very little experimental evidence exists to verify {{some of the basic}} mechanisms believed to be involved in whisker growth.

40|$|For decades, tin-lead {{has been}} used as the primary surface finish for {{compliant}} pins and plated through holes (PTH) of printed circuit board (PCB) in press-fit connections. Therefore, most test results on press-fit performance are focused on the tin-lead finishes for the connections. Due to the discontinuation of the use of lead in electric and electronic components, the trend of using lead-free manufacturing for PCB’s and connectors is being vigorously pursued by the industry. The present study is intended to evaluate press-fit connections using various lead-free finishes on compliant pins and PTH’s and then compare to tin-lead finish. The lead-free finishes for the compliant pins are plated with matte and <b>bright</b> pure <b>tin,</b> and the lead-free finishes for the PTH’s are electroplated Au, OSP, and immersion tin, Au, and Ag finishes. In the design of experiments (DOE) of the current study, single pin tests were used to obtain the DOE outputs of insertion and retention forces for eye-of-the-needle (EON) compliant pins in PTH’s. For all three EON finishes (two pure tin and one tin-lead), the DOE results show that finished PTH size is the most important factor to determine the insertion force. The insertion force is a strong inverted linear function of finished PTH size (i. e., a larger force is required for a smaller finished PTH size). The impact from pin installation/repair cycle is the second factor behind the finished PTH size. The finishes of EON and PTH are only minor factors for the insertion force. In contrast to the insertion force, the retention force is rather flat regarding the finished PTH size. The DOE results also indicate the EON finish is ranked as the number one factor to affec...|$|R
60|$|The room {{in which}} Lawrence slept that night was to him a very odd one. It was a long apartment, {{at one end of}} which was a clean, {{comfortable}} bed, a couple of chairs, and a table on which was a basin and pitcher.

And these were the routine steps, too, that would be taken {{as a matter of course}} by the merest beginner. A few inquiries amongst the ticket collectors and the porters of the two small railway stations would give additional details as to the appearance of the two men; the inspection of the collected tickets would show at once where they came from that morning. It was elementary, and could not have been neglected. Accordingly the Chief Inspector answered that all this had been done directly the old woman had come forward with her deposition. And he mentioned the name of a station. “That’s where they came from, sir,” he went on. “The porter who took the tickets at Maze Hill remembers two chaps answering to the description passing the barrier. They seemed to him two respectable working men of a superior sort—sign painters or house decorators.

She might be fifty-five or sixty; but hers was one of those faces that time seems to touch only to brighten and adorn. The snowy lisse crape cap, made after the strait Quaker pattern,--the plain white muslin handkerchief, lying in placid folds across her bosom,--the drab shawl and dress,--showed at once the community to which she belonged. Her face was round and rosy, with a healthful downy softness, suggestive of a ripe peach. Her hair, partially silvered by age, was parted smoothly back from a high placid forehead, on which time had written no inscription, except peace on earth, good will to men, and beneath shone a large pair of clear, honest, loving brown eyes; you only needed to look straight into them, to feel that you saw to the bottom of a heart as good and true as ever throbbed in woman's bosom. So much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls, why don't somebody wake up to the beauty of old women? If any want to get up an inspiration under this head, we refer them to our good friend Rachel Halliday, just as she sits there in her little rocking-chair.

But old Simeon Halliday often declared it was as good as any music to him, and the children all avowed that they wouldn't miss of hearing mother's chair for anything in the world. For why? for twenty years or more, nothing but loving words, and gentle moralities, and motherly loving kindness, had come from that chair;--head-aches and heart-aches innumerable had been cured there,--difficulties spiritual and temporal solved there,--all by one good, loving woman, God bless her! ...|$|E

For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel, designed to overlap each other. Panels were nailed into wood furring strips which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood. Today, nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed, into plywood without the need for the original 1 x 2 in furring strips. There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywall/popcorn/plaster ceilings, without the need for extensive plywood installation. Tin panels today are made in 24 x 24 in and 24 x 48 in sizes for easier handling and one-person installation.

40|$|With {{the global}} {{transition}} to lead-free electronics, the electronic component market has seen {{an increase in}} the selection of pure tin and tin-rich alloys as lead-free component finishes. The adoption of tin-rich finishes has enhanced a reliability issue associated with the formation of electrically conductive whiskers, emanating from tin finished surface.

However, {{due to a lack of}} the factors accelerating whisker growth, prediction of whisker formation is extremely difficult. Therefore, the effective mitigation strategies are necessary, particularly for high-reliability applications, which require a long product operational life. The objective of this study is to investigate a method for characterizing whisker growth, which can further enable measuring the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. To achieve this objective, a set of experiments was conducted using matte and <b>bright</b> <b>tin</b> platings on copper, Alloy- 42, and brass metal coupons. The plated coupons were subjected to high temperature exposures, including annealing (at 150 ºC/one hour). Whisker growth on tin-plated samples was characterized using environmental scanning electron microscopy, in terms of the maximum whisker length, length distribution, and whisker density, at different time periods up to 24 months. The experimental results have shown different behaviors of whisker growth (length and density) between bright and matte tin, depending on the materials and exposure conditions. It was experimentally demonstrated that <b>bright</b> <b>tin</b> over brass could be considered a worst-case scenario for assessing the risks associated with tin whiskers. This work has further revealed that the current industry practice of testing for 3000 hours for monitoring the propensity of tin whiskers is insufficient to cover a saturation of whisker density and capture the temporal nature of whiskers. In order to overcome such insufficiencies, the use of time-based distribution data for whisker length and whisker density was proposed as an alternative method for characterizing whisker growth. With the application of this proposed method, the effect of annealing (150 ºC/one hour) and its effect under the presence of electrical current were investigated for retarding whisker formation and growth on tin-plating...|$|E

Similarly, no obvious relationship was noted between the oxygen and water vapor permeability of the coatings and their ability to suppress whisker and OSE formation. Unusual formations of zinc (“zinc rings”) were noted on the surface of the tin plating around some of the OSE’s. Backgroun...|$|E
