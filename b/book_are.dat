5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that <b>book</b> <b>are</b> recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that <b>book</b> <b>are</b> substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Between 1907 and 1911, Caragiale studied Romanian {{heraldry}} and, to this goal, read Octav-George Lecca's Familii boierești române ("Romanian Boyar Families"). Many of {{the comments}} added by him to his copy of the <b>book</b> <b>are</b> polemic, sarcastic, or mysterious, while the sketches he made on the margin include portrayals of boyars being put to death in various ways, as well as caricatures (such as a blazon displaying a donkey's head, which he mockingly assigned to Octav-George Lecca himself). Several of the heraldic objects he created were destined for his own use. In June 1928, he raised a green over yellow ensign he created for the Caragiale family at his property in Fundulea. He also hoisted other symbols, including the flag of Hungary, which, he claimed, underlined his foreign origin.|$|E

Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in an antique grammar <b>book,</b> <b>are</b> exploited to comic effect.|$|E

In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape.

5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the <b>book,</b> <b>are</b> surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|Woodblock printing: The {{earliest}} {{specimen of}} woodblock printing is a single-sheet dharani sutra in Sanskrit that was printed on hemp paper between 650 and 670 AD; it was unearthed in 1974 from a Tang tomb near Xi'an. A Korean miniature dharani Buddhist sutra discovered in 1966, bearing extinct Chinese writing characters used {{only during the}} reign of China's only self-ruling empress, Wu Zetian (r.690–705), is dated no earlier than 704 and preserved in a Silla Korean temple stupa built in 751. The first printed periodical, the Kaiyuan Za Bao was made available in AD 713. However, the earliest known book printed at regular size is the Diamond Sutra made during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), a 5.18m (17ft) long scroll which bears the date 868 AD. Joseph Needham and Tsien Tsuen-hsuin write that the cutting and printing techniques used for the delicate calligraphy of the Diamond Sutra <b>book</b> <b>are</b> much more advanced and refined than the miniature dharani sutra printed earlier.|$|E
5|$|During Leofric's bishopric, his cathedral {{library was}} the fourth largest in England, and was an {{important}} scriptorium. He gave an important manuscript of Old English poetry, the Exeter Book, to the cathedral library in 1072. Contained in the Exeter <b>Book</b> <b>are</b> a number of poems showing of all the principal types of poems composed in Old English. This manuscript {{is one of four}} main sources for modern knowledge of Anglo-Saxon poetry. Along with the Exeter Book, he also gave a number of other manuscripts and books to the cathedral upon his death. Three versions of the donation list drawn up by Leofric survive, {{which is one of the}} earliest surviving cathedral library catalogues. The list consists of 31 books used to conduct cathedral services, 24 other ecclesiastical works, and 11 works that were secular. This last group included philosophical works as well as poetry. The number of manuscripts that he owned and bequeathed to his cathedral was quite large for his time. Besides the Exeter Book and the Leofric Missal, Leofric's own copy of the Rule of Chrodegang also survives, although it is no longer at Exeter. Now it is at Cambridge University, where it is Corpus Christi College MS 191. Another surviving manuscript from Leofric's collection is a Gospel book written in Latin now in the Bodleian Library, which was probably acquired by Leofric while he was on the continent, as the manuscript was originally written for a Breton monastery. In all, about 20 of the manuscripts gifted by Leofric can be identified and are still extant, and only two remain at Exeter– including the Exeter Book.|$|E
