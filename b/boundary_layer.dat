5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> while the Blasius <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> occurs. A surface can have multiple types of <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b> This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> away through a porous surface (see <b>Boundary</b> <b>layer</b> suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

5|$|Situated {{behind the}} leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> ahead of it.

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E

The results indicate that <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> in such wind tunnels should not be substantially different from ideal gas <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> at standard conditions. At a pressure of 9. 0 atm, two separate effects produce deviations of real gas values from ideal gas values which are {{in the opposite direction}} from deviations at 1. 0 atm and are of the same insignificant order of magnitude.

5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous flow velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> governed by the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> equations, below.|$|E

The model considers mass and momentum transfer coupled between <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> and an inviscid core region. Dimensionless equations of motion are solved using integral methods and a space-marching technique. As the fluid moves radially inward, entraining <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> develop which can either meet or become non-entraining. Pressure and wall shear stress distributions, as well as velocity profiles predicted by the model, are compared to numerical simulations using the software OpenFOAM. Hydrodynamic structure of the <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> is governed by a Reynolds number, Re, a Rossby number, Ro, and the dimensionless radial velocity component at {{the periphery of the}} cavity, U-o.

5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E
