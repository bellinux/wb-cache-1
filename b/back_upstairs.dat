500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go <b>back</b> <b>upstairs</b> and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity... My hair was my glory. It was the only thing that I could change about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{silencer}} {{was not on}} the gun {{when the}} police found the bodies. It was found by one of Bamber's cousins, three days after the murders, in the ground-floor office gun cupboard. Whether it was on the gun during the murders became a pivotal issue. The prosecution maintained that the silencer had indeed been on the gun, and that this meant Sheila could not have shot herself. Forensic tests indicated that her arms were not long enough to turn the gun on herself with the silencer attached. If she had shot the others with the silencer, then realized the gun was too long for her to shoot herself, the silencer would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard before going <b>back</b> <b>upstairs</b> to shoot herself. If Sheila was not the killer, it meant Bamber had lied about the telephone call from his father saying Sheila had [...] "gone berserk" [...] with the gun. That put Bamber himself in the frame.|$|E

50|$|The {{partially}} {{open air}} theatre {{was built by}} Snell and Gordon, the company of well-known Darwin builder Harold Snell, in the 1920s. The theatre's design was innovative at the time, in particular the roof structure, which Snell had studied in England. Only the rear rows at the <b>back</b> and <b>upstairs</b> dress circle was covered by a roof. The stage was on wheels to be moved for boxing matches and the floor was concrete in anticipation of future roller-skating events and social dances. It could seat 860 people.|$|R
500|$|The {{office workers}} {{are forced to}} use the stairs while the {{elevator}} is being serviced, a situation everyone deems [...] "Stairmageddon". A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot take no for an answer, so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark {{to figure out how to}} get him <b>back</b> <b>upstairs.</b>|$|E

That afternoon, she was not so well, and next day <b>back</b> again <b>upstairs.</b> Nothing seemed definitely wrong, only a sort of desperate lassitude; as if the knowledge that to go back was within her power, only needing her decision, had been too much for her. And since no one knew her inward feelings, all were puzzled except Winton. The nursing of her child was promptly stopped.|$|R
2500|$|On March 21, 2005, Weise killed {{nine people}} before killing {{himself in a}} murder–suicide. With a [...]22 caliber pistol that he had {{acquired}} {{up to a year}} before the shooting, Weise first killed his grandfather, 58 year old Daryl Lussier Sr. while he was asleep in bed and his grandfather's girlfriend, 32 year old Michelle Sigana while she was coming <b>back</b> <b>upstairs</b> from the basement with laundry. [...] He then took his grandfather's police issued firearms and drove his grandfather's police cruiser to the school. At the school, Weise shot and killed unarmed security guard Derrick Brun, 28, before going inside the school. Once inside, Weise fired randomly down a hallway and in a classroom, killing teacher Neva Wynkoop-Rogers, 62, and students Dewayne Lewis, 15; Chase Lussier, 15; Chanelle Rosebear, 15; Thurlene Stillday, 15, and Alicia White, 14. After engaging in a brief shootout with police and being injured in the hip and leg, Weise then retreated to another classroom and committed suicide using a shotgun.|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{we thought}} at first, sir. But when the scandal broke out, nobody {{believed}} they were strangers. I remember how it happened as well {{as if it was}} yesterday. Catherick came into our garden one night, and woke us by throwing up a handful of gravel from the walk at our window. I heard him beg my husband, for the Lord's sake, to come down and speak to him. They were a long time together talking in the porch. When my husband came <b>back</b> <b>upstairs</b> he was all of a tremble. He sat {{down on the side of}} the bed and he says to me, 'Lizzie! I always told you that woman was a bad one--I always said she would end ill, and I'm afraid in my own mind that the end has come already. Catherick has found a lot of lace handkerchiefs, and two fine rings, and a new gold watch and chain, hid away in his wife's drawer--things that nobody but a born lady ought ever to have--and his wife won't say how she came by them.' 'Does he think she stole them?' says I. 'No,' says he, 'stealing would be bad enough. But it's worse than that, she's had no chance of stealing such things as those, and she's not a woman to take them if she had. They're gifts, Lizzie--there's her own initials engraved inside the watch--and Catherick has seen her talking privately, and carrying on as no married woman should, with that gentleman in mourning, Sir Percival Glyde. Don't you say anything about it--I've quieted Catherick for to-night. I've told him to keep his tongue to himself, and his eyes and his ears open, and to wait a day or two, till he can be quite certain.' 'I believe you are both of you wrong,' says I. 'It's not in nature, comfortable and respectable as she is here, that Mrs. Catherick should take up with a chance stranger like Sir Percival Glyde.' 'Ay, but is he a stranger to her?' says my husband. 'You forget how Catherick's wife came to marry him. She went to him of her own accord, after saying No over and over again when he asked her. There have been wicked women before her time, Lizzie, who have used honest men who loved them as a means of saving their characters, and I'm sorely afraid this Mrs. Catherick is as wicked as the worst of them. We shall see,' says my husband, 'we shall soon see.' And only two days afterwards we did see." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the house}} of fiction, {{theological}} narratives reside in a special room (<b>upstairs,</b> <b>back)</b> decorated in Gothic realism where metafiction may sleep with fantasy, because God, as Ludwig Feuerbach proposed in Das Wesen des Christentums (1841), is always and only a concept, though regrettably turned by most humans into hard logic-defying fact. From these premises theological fictions rise. At this level of abstraction, one that posits a participative Deity, fantasy often partakes of madness. Either it's me that's mad, Greenan's characters say, or it's the world.|$|R
6000|$|The best view of Victoria Park is {{from the}} front window of St. Dominic's Parsonage, from which not a single chimney is visible. The parsonage is a semi-detached villa with a front garden and a porch. Visitors go up the flight of steps to the porch: tradespeople {{and members of the}} family go down by a door under the steps to the basement, with a breakfast room, used for all meals, in front, and the kitchen at the <b>back.</b> <b>Upstairs,</b> on the level of the hall door, is the drawing-room, with its large plate glass window looking on the park. In this room, the only sitting-room that can be spared from the {{children}} and the family meals, the parson, the Reverend James Mavor Morell does his work. He is sitting in a strong round backed revolving chair at the right hand end of a long table, which stands across the window, so that he can cheer himself with the view of the park at his elbow. At {{the opposite end of the}} table, adjoining it, is a little table; only half the width of the other, with a typewriter on it. His typist is sitting at this machine, with her back to the window. The large table is littered with pamphlets, journals, letters, nests of drawers, an office diary, postage scales and the like. A spare chair for visitors having business with the parson is in the middle, turned to his end. Within reach of his hand is a stationery case, and a cabinet photograph in a frame. Behind him the right hand wall, recessed above the fireplace, is fitted with bookshelves, on which an adept eye can measure the parson's divinity and casuistry by a complete set of Browning's poems and Maurice's Theological Essays, and guess at his politics from a yellow backed Progress and Poverty, Fabian Essays, a Dream of John Ball, Marx's Capital, and half a dozen other literary landmarks in Socialism. Opposite him on the left, near the typewriter, is the door. Further down the room, opposite the fireplace, a bookcase stands on a cellaret, with a sofa near it. There is a generous fire burning; and the hearth, with a comfortable armchair and a japanned flower painted coal scuttle at one side, a miniature chair for a boy or girl on the other, a nicely varnished wooden mantelpiece, with neatly moulded shelves, tiny bits of mirror let into the panels, and a travelling clock in a leather case (the inevitable wedding present), and on the wall above a large autotype of the chief figure in Titian's Virgin of the Assumption, is very inviting. Altogether the room is the room of a good housekeeper, vanquished, as far as the table is concerned, by an untidy man, but elsewhere mistress of the situation. The furniture, in its ornamental aspect, betrays the style of the advertised [...] "drawing-room suite" [...] of the pushing suburban furniture dealer; but there is nothing useless or pretentious in the room. The paper and panelling are dark, throwing the big cheery window and the park outside into strong relief.|$|E

The clubs were known for the amateur nature of their performances, often including, or even focusing on local ‘floor singers’, of members who would step up to sing one or two songs. They also had ‘residents’, usually talented local performers who would perform regular short sets of songs. In the late 1960s and early 1970s especially in the West country there was quite a revival of local folk clubs with regular weekly gatherings in places like Taunton, Halberton, Ottery St Mary, Exeter, Barnstaple, Truro, Padstow where a new group of local performers such as Cyril Tawney performed regularly along with local singers performing [...] "Come all Ye" [...] nights ...|$|R
50|$|The Corner Store and Office, {{also known}} as the Frogmore Emporium, Macdonald, Wilkins, and Company Store and Mark D. Batchelder Office, is a {{historic}} general store, residence and, eventually, office building located on Saint Helena Island near Frogmore, Beaufort County, South Carolina. Primarily built as a house, it was built about 1877, and is a two-story, wood frame building with a gable roof. It features a two-story wraparound porch. The adjacent one-story house was built about 1905. The store sold provisions to the islanders, most of whom were African American, and became one of the major centers of commercial and social activity on St. Helena. The home and businesses in the building were owned by Cameron Thomas and his relatives for most of the 20th century. The family lived in the <b>back</b> and <b>upstairs</b> portion of the house, while the front included a general store and liquor store, with the small house added on used as a residence for relatives. The store also had the only gas pump on the island for many years.|$|R

Others believed that the Rebbe should be buried on the grounds of the yeshiva and his body transferred to a grave on the Mount of Olives after the war was over.
