5|$|In the end, Tătărescu became {{involved}} in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict, and, while beginning talks with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), tried to build foreign connections to support Romania's cause following the inevitable defeat; he thus corresponded with Edvard Beneš, leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile in England. Beneš, who had already <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> matters involving Romania with Richard Franasovici and Grigore Gafencu, and had agreed to support the Romanian cause, informed the Allied governments of Tătărescu's designs.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, {{and he realized that}} the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> the merger, but Humphrey's idea was to keep the Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|Toby had <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> {{the details}} of the Scranton Strangler case with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for some time.

Toby accordingly goes to the local prison to talk to the person convicted of being the notorious local murderer and tell him he believes he is innocent. Offscreen, the convict begins strangling Toby for his part in the conviction. However, Toby does have his spirits lifted after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery.|$|E
5|$|For the 2008–09 season, Team Bath {{played at}} the highest level they {{achieved}} in their history. Competing in the Conference South, the club were two promotions away from The Football League. Early in the season Bath were competing for a play-off berth, but failed to maintain their form, eventually finishing 11th in the table with 16 wins. Towards the end of the season, the Football Conference notified Team Bath that as they were not a limited company they would be ineligible for further promotions, and would no longer be allowed to compete in the FA Cup; the club opted to resign from the Conference {{at the end of the}} season rather than restructure. Team Bath had at the time <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> the possibility of a merger with Bath City, with the aim of getting the merged team into the Football League.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the bombing}} of the Presidential Palace, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng and his field commanders had <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> the {{possibility}} of deploying units of the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF), to attack high-value South Vietnamese targets in support of North Vietnamese ground troops. Use of the Soviet MiG-17 fighter was considered, North Vietnamese pilots already had significant combat experience with the type. However, moving MiGs from their bases in North Vietnam was problematic; South Vietnamese defenses were falling much faster than anticipated, there was simply little time in which to deploy the MiGs in support of North Vietnamese units encircling Saigon. As the North Vietnamese had captured a large number of U.S.-made aircraft from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force at Pleiku and Da Nang Air Bases, it was decided to use captured aircraft instead.|$|E

On the other side, Wilson Cary Nicholas was simply worried that Congress would not submit the amendment in time for the states to ratify it before the 1804 election.

25|$|Most surveys {{indicate}} that while blacks tend to vote Democratic in elections, members of traditionally African-American churches {{are generally more}} socially conservative than white Protestants as a whole. Same-sex marriage and other LGBT issues {{have been among the}} leading causes for activism in some black churches, though a majority of black Protestants remain opposed to this stance. Nevertheless, some denominations have <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> this issue. For example, the African Methodist Episcopal Church prohibits its ministers from officiating same-sex weddings, but it does not have a clear policy on ordination.|$|E
