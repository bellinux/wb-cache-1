The population structure of the collection of Xaj isolates, confirms the presence of different genetic groups identified by rep-PCR (using Italian collection are currently being analysed by MLSA (multi locus sequence analysis), using 7 primers for 7 different housekeeping genes, with the purpose to better characterise the Italian isolates for phylotyping. The study of copper resistance on a wide collection of over 150 Xaj strains frequently showed high resistance (up to 500 ppm Cu++) : two strains have been further studied confirming the presence of chromosomal genes copA and copB involved in the general copABCD copper resistance structure, as described for Pseudomonas syringae.

40|$|The phyllosphere {{is known}} for hosting a great {{diversity}} of fungi, yeasts and bacteria. These microorganisms {{interact with each other}} and with the host plant in the form of symbiosis, mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, competition or simply neutralism. Pseudomonas syringae is a ubiquitous epiphytic bacterium commonly found in these microbial communities. The phylogeny complex of P. syringae comprises 13 phylogroups, containing strains that are well-known pathogens and strains that apparently have limited capacity as pathogens. Emblematic among the pathogens are P. syringae pv. syringae (Pss) and P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) belonging respectively to phylogroups 2 and 1. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>blights</b> <b>of</b> fruit trees caused by P. syringae lead to significant economic losses worldwide.

A solution of the basic copper wettable powder sulfate was sprayed at 10 -day intervals in two processing plots, using two application protocols: seven rounds of application immediately after leaf development and three or four applications at the initial onset of the disease. Due to the low disease incidence {{for the duration of}} the study, symptoms were only observed on leaves, not on spikes or fruits. The disease incidence in plots that were treated at the initial stage of the disease was significantly lower than in untreated plots. This protective effect improved as the number of applications was increased. After overwintering of these vines, X. ampelinus was detected in the axillary buds of untreated vines, but it was seldom detected in vines treated at the initial onset of the disease. Thus, the copper agent controlled the extent of infection during the year of treatment and reduced the quantity of bacteria surviving overwintering.
