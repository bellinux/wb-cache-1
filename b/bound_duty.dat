5000|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} of Christianity (Congregationalist, Continental Reformed, Presbyterian denominations) have also {{addressed the issue}} {{of the relationship between the}} Church and state. In its 1870 General Assembly, the Presbyterian Church in the United States stated: [...] We should regard the successful attempt to expel all religious instruction and influence from our public schools as an evil of the first magnitude. Nor do we see how this can be done without inflicting a deadly wound upon the intellectual and moral life of the nation…We look upon the state as an ordinance of God, and not a mere creature of the popular will; and, under its high responsibility to the Supreme Ruler of the world, we hold it to be both its right and <b>bound</b> <b>duty</b> to educate its children in those elementary principles of knowledge and virtue which are essential to its own security and well-being. The union of church and state is indeed against our American theory and constitutions of government; but the most intimate union of the state with the saving and conservative forces of Christianity is one of the oldest customs of the country, and has always ranked a vital article of our political faith.|$|E
40|$|Based on WTO’s Consolidated Tariff Schedules (CTS) {{database}} and on national sources, we propose a systematic assessment of ad valorem-equivalent <b>bound</b> <b>duties</b> at the detailed product level, {{for almost all}} WTO members. In doing this in a way fully consistent with the assessment of applied protection provided in the MAcMap-HS 6 database (Bouët et al., 2004), we build a unique tool allowing the full structure of protection –bound, MFN applied, preferential applied duties- to be accurately assessed. We use this database to provide with a worldwide assessment of the binding overhang, i. e. the gap between bound and applied MFN tariffs. We also assess the likely applied-protection impact of an agreement in the Doha Round, based on the Harbinson Proposal for agricultural products, and on the Girard Proposal for non-agricultural products. In all cases, we show the difference between bound and applied protection to be key in understanding both the structure of protection worldwide, and the possible impact of liberalisation scenario cutting <b>bound</b> <b>duties,</b> as uses {{to be the case}} in multilateral liberalisations...|$|R
