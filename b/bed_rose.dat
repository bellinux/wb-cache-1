Madame du Chatelet and Voltaire, who had {{announced}} themselves as for to-day, and whom nobody {{had heard of}} otherwise, made their appearance yesternight, near midnight; like two Spectres, with an odor of embalmment about them, as if just out of their tombs.

6000|$|May 28.--As I sat by {{the bedside}} of a sick Michigan soldier in {{hospital}} to-day, a convalescent from the adjoining <b>bed</b> <b>rose</b> and came to me, and presently we began talking. He was a middleaged man, belonged to the 2d Virginia regiment, but lived in Racine, Ohio, and had a family there. He spoke of President Lincoln, and said: [...] "The war is over, and many are lost. And now we have lost the best, the fairest, the truest man in America. Take him altogether, {{he was the best}} man this country ever produced. It was quite a while I thought very different; but some time before the murder, that's the way I have seen it." [...] There was deep earnestness in the soldier. (I found upon further talk he had known Mr. Lincoln personally, and quite closely, years before.) He was a veteran; was now in the fifth year of his service; was a cavalry man, and had been in a good deal of hard fighting.|$|E
60|$|My seat, {{to which}} Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot {{had left me}} riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the <b>bed</b> <b>rose</b> before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken {{reflections}} varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty {{of the bed and}} room. I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I {{got up and went to}} see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the looking- glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.|$|E

50|$|In March 1944, {{the former}} SS depot was {{converted}} to a new subcamp, named Gusen II, which served as an improvised concentration camp {{until the end of}} the war. Gusen II contained about 12,000 to 17,000 inmates, who were deprived of even the most basic facilities. In December 1944, another part of Gusen was opened in nearby Lungitz. Here, parts of a factory infrastructure were converted into the third subcamp of Gusen - Gusen III. The rise in the number of subcamps could not catch up with the rising number of inmates, which led to overcrowding of the huts in all of the subcamps of Mauthausen-Gusen.

5000|$|Carey was {{suspected}} {{of participating in}} most of the major actions of Fred Burke's crew in the 1920s. Bob was specifically charged by Detroit Police with murdering two freelance hoods, James Ellis and Leroy Snyder, on March 16, 1927 after he caught them cheating at poker. Along with Gus Winkler, Fred Goetz, Ray Nugent, and Charlie Fitzgerald, Carey took part in the American Express armored car robbery on April 16, 1928 in Toledo, Ohio. The gangsters made off with $200,000 and killed Toledo police officer George Zientara. While never publicly named as a suspect, the Chicago Police Department sought Carey for participating in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. FBI informant Byron Bolton would later claim that Carey did indeed take part, along with Fred Burke, Gus Winkler, Fred Goetz, and others.

40|$|The {{sequence}} of twelve woodblock maps presented {{here from the}} mid-nineteenth-century gazetteer {{for the department of}} Dengchuan in southwest China shows the Miju river and the irrigation system that lay at the heart of its farming economy. The incorporation into the cartography of much of the administrative detail related to the compulsory mobilization of labour for the annual clearance of mud makes it unusual among Chinese maps depicting water control in this period. The clarity with which it shows the recent formation of a long, spit-like delta of deposited sediment protruding into the Erhai, the large mountain lake into which the river empties, also assists the dating and analysis of the environmental crisis that occasioned it. During the late seventeenth century, and much of the eighteenth, the pressure of population caused the opening for cultivation of the unstable mountain soils on the slopes of the catchment just upstream of the section depicted by the maps. The result was a massive increase in the river???s load of sediment. The dykes of its downstream <b>bed</b> <b>rose</b> to a level above the surrounding farmland. The increased need for maintenance led to the restructuring of parts of the system of government, and the lives of the local people, so as to handle the new problems. We have found that the accuracy of the maps was adequate for planning and executing middle-sized water control projects at the technical level of that time...|$|E
