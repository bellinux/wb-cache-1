40|$|We propose two new axioms {{of demand}} {{responsiveness}} for additive cost sharing with variable demands. Group Monotonicity requires {{that if a}} group of agents increase their demands, {{not all of them}} pay less. Solidarity says that if agent i demands more, j should not pay more if k pays less. Both axioms are compatible in the partial responsibility theory postulating Strong Ranking, i. e., the ranking of cost shares should never contradict that of demands. The combination of Strong Ranking, Solidarity and Monotonicity characterizes the quasi-proportional methods, under which cost shares are proportional to 'rescaled' demands. The alternative full responsibility theory is based on Separability, ruling out cross-subsidization when costs are additively separable. Neither the Aumann-Shapley nor the Shapley-Shubik method is group monotonic. On the otherhand, convex combinations of "nearby" fixed-path methods are group-monotonic: the subsidy-free <b>serial</b> <b>method</b> is the main example.

40|$|We review recent {{results from}} the axiomatic theory of cost sharing. A method of sharing divides {{the total cost of}} a service between users based on the profile of their {{consumption}} and the cost function. In general, the total cost depends on asymmetrically individual consumption. We discuss two radically different normative interpretations of these asymmetries. According to the theory of full responsibility, each user is responsible for the cost resulting unquestionably its own supply and the cost shares must then reflect asymmetries of the cost function. According to the theory of partial responsibility, only the differences in the level of consumption may justify different cost share. We formulate the requirements of fairness and strategic stability through axioms of invariance and monotony. We examine the logical consistency of these axioms in the two theories above. In the approach of full responsibility, they allow us to characterize the three methods most often discussed in the literature: the Shapley and Shubik, the Aumann and Shapley and the classic <b>serial</b> <b>method.</b> In the context of partial responsibility, they lead to natural methods of proportional representation, and a variant of the <b>serial</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R
