Sitting opposite her father in the travelling-carriage, and recalling the old Marshalsea room, her present existence was a dream. All that she saw was new and wonderful, but it was not real; it seemed to her as if those visions of mountains and picturesque countries might melt away at any moment, and the carriage, turning some abrupt corner, <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a jolt at the old Marshalsea gate.|$|E

6000|$|... [6] Singular as {{was this}} occurrence, and painful {{as it must}} have proved to {{the parties to the}} execution, {{it is one of the}} {{simplest}} consequences of natural causes. All animal matter swells in water previously to turning corrupt. A body that has became of twice its natural size, in this manner, as a matter of course, displaces twice the usual quantity of water; the weight of the mass remaining the same. Most human frames floating, in their natural state, so long as the lungs are inflated with air, it follows that one in this condition would <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> it as much weight in iron, as made the difference between its own gravity and that of the water it displaced. The upright attitude of Caraccioli was owing to the shot attached to the feet; of which, it is also probable, one or two had become loosened.|$|E

I could almost fancy it was thirty years back, and I was a little gell at home, looking at Judith as she sat at her work, after she'd done the house up; only {{it was a little}} cottage, Father's was, and not a big {{rambling}} house as gets dirty i' one corner as fast as you clean it in another--but for all that, I could fancy you was your Aunt Judith, only her hair was a deal darker than yours, and she was stouter and broader i' the shoulders. Judith and me allays hung together, though she had such queer ways, but your mother and her never could agree. Ah, your mother little thought as she'd have a daughter just cut out after the very pattern o' Judith, and leave her an orphan, too, for Judith to take care on, and <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a spoon when SHE was in the graveyard at Stoniton. I allays said that o' Judith, as she'd bear a pound weight any day to save anybody else carrying a ounce. And she was just the same from the first o' my remembering her; it made no difference in her, as I could see, when she took to the Methodists, only she talked a bit different and wore a different sort o' cap; but she'd never in her life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{needed an}} hour to compose myself, after this interview. In the privacy of my own room, I wept like a child over {{the wreck of the}} being I had left so {{beautiful}} and perfect, though even then the canker of doubt had begun to take root. I had yet her explanations to hear, and resolved to command myself so far as to receive them in a manner not to increase the pain Grace must feel in making them. As soon as sufficiently calm, I sat down to write letters. One was to Marble. I desired him to let the second-mate see the ship discharged, and to come up to me by the return of the sloop. I wished to see him in person, as I did not think I could be able {{to go out in the}} vessel on her next voyage, and I intended him to sail in her as master. It was necessary we should consult together personally. I did not conceal the reason of this determination, though I said nothing of the cause of my sister's state. Marble had a list of physicians given him, and he was to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him the one he could obtain, commencing with the first named, and following in the order given. I had earned ten thousand dollars, nett, by the labours of the past year, and I determined every dollar of it should be devoted to obtaining the best advice the country then afforded. I had sent for such men as Hosack, Post, Bayley, M'Knight, Moore, &c.; and even thought of endeavouring to procure Rush from Philadelphia, but was deterred from making the attempt by the distance, and the pressing nature of the emergency. In 1803, Philadelphia was about three days' journey from Clawbonny, even allowing for a favourable time on the river; with a moderately unfavourable, five or six; whereas the distance can now be passed, including the chances of meeting the departures and arrivals of the different lines, in from twelve to fifteen hours. Such is one of the prodigious effects of an improved civilization; and in all that relates to motion, and which falls short of luxury, or great personal comfort, this country takes a high place in the scale of nations. That it is as much in arrears in other great essentials, however, particularly in what relates to tavern comforts, no man who is familiar with the better civilization of Europe, can deny. It is a singular fact, that we have gone backward in this last particular, within the present century, and all owing to the increasingly gregarious habits of the population. But to return to my painful theme, from which, even at this distance of time, I am only too ready to escape.|$|E

Modern China is under the process of sifting from agriculture society to industrialized society, experiencing a fast economic growth and urbanization, facing big amount of environment and energy problems. Large amount of migration swam from rural area to urban area, which <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> huge construction work. Low-efficiency of energy use and short life-cycle causes big amounts of waste on energy and materials in China. Developing sustainable building is an emergency and essential issue. There are lots of problems in Chinese sustainable development. The research is try to find out some of the most important factors in Chinese building construction sectors in order to explore new and better methods for a more sustainable development. As a limitation, the research is focused on technical aspects. The research is discussing the problems on three aspects: Regulation standard, Stimulate support system and transfer of technology. Each of the part is discussed the question of ―what is it means to sustainable building?‖ and ―how to improve it?‖ To get the answer, several different approaches are used to analyze the problems. A comparison of Design standard of Energy Efficiency and Denmark housing regulation in order to find the inadequacies of Chinese current regulation, an exploration of Chinese rating system of green building certification tries to find how to make an improvement for green building assessment. and two cases study is help to understand a proper approach of technical transferring. 073613614...|$|E
