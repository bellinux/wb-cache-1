Numerous species of Pratylenchus {{are known to be}} associated with crops, grasses, and weeds in Egyptian soils. Consequently, it is quite possible to plant strawberries in such soils reported by Ibrahim et al.

In Egypt, information is scanty on the exact strawberry yield loss caused by a definite nematode species. Yet, in addition to their role as pathogens, some species of Pratylenchus can also predispose plants to invasion by some genera of soil fungi including Cylindrocarpon, Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia, and Verticillium (Warner 2018). For example, lesion nematodes, principally P. penetrans, are implicated in the <b>black</b> root <b>rot</b> disease complex of strawberry in Connecticut, USA.
