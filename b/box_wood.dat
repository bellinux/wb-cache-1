500|$|During {{a severe}} storm in February 1913, [...] of rain fell in an hour, setting the streams, creeks and roads awash and {{damaging}} the nursery. In October {{of the same}} year, another storm destroyed buildings and plantings. Due {{to the extent of}} the destruction, and the lack of funds for full repairs, the nursery never fully recovered. Frederick Newman left the nursery in 1925 to run a smaller one in Tea Tree Gully, next to North East Road; control of the original nursery passed to Harry Newman. With the death of Charles' wife Mary Ann in 1932, the property was sold and subsequently used as a dairy. It changed ownership again in 1935, then used for sheep grazing. The new owner removed everything of value from the property; slate paving and benches were sold, buildings were stripped to walls and foundations, pine trees lining the entrance road were turned to <b>box</b> <b>wood</b> and some outbuildings were knocked down. Most remaining plants and fruit trees from the property's nursery days were destroyed by bushfires during Ash Wednesday in 1983. The ruins of Newman’s Nursery consist largely of foundations and walls and are listed on the State Heritage Register.|$|E

Preferred hosts for the cherry leafhopper are; <b>box</b> <b>wood,</b> lilac, myrtle, privet, pyracantha, sweet cherry, and viburnum. Of these preferred hosts only sweet cherry can become infected with the disease itself. Occasional hosts are; almond, apple and crabapple, apricot, bitter cherry, ceanothus, chokecherry, hawthorn, peach, pear, Japanese plum, and prune.

5000|$|Blackwell {{was born}} in Syracuse, South Carolina, one of sixteen {{children}} of Payton and Elizabeth Blackwell. He was part Cherokee. He grew up {{and spent most of}} his life in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was given the nickname [...] "Scrapper" [...] by his grandmother, because of his fiery nature. His father played the fiddle, but Blackwell was a self-taught guitarist, building his first guitar out of a cigar <b>box,</b> <b>wood</b> and wire. He also learned to play the piano, occasionally performing professionally. By his teens, Blackwell was a part-time musician, traveling as far as Chicago. He was known for being withdrawn and hard to work with, but he established a rapport with the pianist Leroy Carr, whom he met in Indianapolis in the mid-1920s, and they had a productive working relationship. Carr convinced Blackwell to record with him for Vocalion Records in 1928; the result was [...] "How Long, How Long Blues", the biggest blues hit of that year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Box trees growing on the hill is disputed: Several sources from the late 18th century suggest that the first Box Trees on the Hill were planted by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel {{during the reign of}} Charles I. [...] Older medieval {{documents}} however make reference to local individuals with surnames including Atteboxe, de la Boxe and Buxeto, suggesting that Box was already common in the local area by the 13th century, and it has also been observed that Thomas Howard never owned the Box Hill estate. The diarist John Evelyn records a visit to the hill in August 1655 to view [...] "those natural bowers, cabinets and shady walks in the box copses." [...] The close grain of the <b>Box</b> <b>wood</b> made it highly prized for its timber for carving and there are numerous accounts of the sale of trees from the hill throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
50|$|Boxwell Court is {{a country}} house near Leighterton in Gloucestershire. In its grounds {{there is a small}} church, and the house is thought to be the site of a former monastery, which was then given to the Huntley family {{following}} Henry the Eighth's dissolution of the monasteries. The House has continually been in the Huntley family since that time, it is believed that the family have lived on the site for 600 years. The estate is approximately 1000 acre which although large in today's terms, is small compared {{to the size of the}} Huntley's former Gloucestershire estates which included Woodchester and Frocester. The estate is known for its <b>Box</b> <b>wood</b> which used to provide a very large income to the Huntleys. The house has been frequented by royalty, Prince Rupert stayed in the house on several occasions; and his spurs and the bed in which he slept remain in the house. Charles II when fleeing from the Battle of Worcester stayed on the estate and, in gratitude to the family gave them his ring which remains in the family's possession.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a certain}} {{relationship}} with the glass harmonica and the clavic cylinder. The glass harmonica produces the sound by friction from touching the rotating bells with wet fingers.With the terpodion, operating the keyboard pushes a wooden or metal arm against a rotating coated cylinder of wood or other material, producing sounds by friction. For the lower notes the arms are mainly made of wood and for the higher notes they are made of metal. The arms are adjustable so the pitch of each note can be adjusted within the tuning process. The terpodion rarely requires tuning.The rotating cylinder is made from <b>box</b> <b>wood</b> (Buxus sempervirens), but the patent states {{it could be any}} material. The most important aspect of the cylinder is the coating. The exact mixture {{can be seen in the}} patent writing. (2 parts ethanol, 1 part mastic, 1 part sandarac, 1/16 part campher). The vibrating parts are pushed by the key mechanic toward the rotating cylinder so a sort of hammer that is covered by soft rough leather, which is coated with same mixture as the cylinder.The volume of the sound is dependent on the amount of pressure applied to the keys. The lower register requires more pressure for the same amount of volume as the higher register.|$|E
40|$|Since 2013, the Les Corts {{district}} has developed the policy {{to use some}} enclosing walls between buildings or building fences as a temporary support for the realization of murals. Its subject Catalan literature. Every year we choose a number of writers on which the mural shall deal. In the first two editions, {{the idea of using}} an expectant wall either for demolition or for new building actions, was met while guaranteeing temporary murals. The expressive language used was graffiti. POLIS Research Centre was commissioned to carry out the actions of Literary Mural planned for 2015. The proposed wall is located at Avenida de Chile; it is permanent and is the closing wall that delimits the Polo Club with the Avenue. Unlike previous proposals, this wall is enormous, approximately 400 meters long by an average of 4 meters high. At the top, the wall includes a <b>box</b> <b>wood</b> wall that interferes with its visuals. Its surface is in disrepair and logistics for action is complicated when the wall is attached to the the tram route what would force work exclusively at night. A first analysis of the wall, its location and context, clearly show that no intervention should be based on the language of street art, and required a project aiming to permanence, and that could become a work of public art. We assess, too, that an Urban Design international and interdisciplinary, was not suitable to perform a graffiti preformance, because of skills and abilities, could raise an artistic solution complementing the urban design of the area. The Association of Residents of the area when knowing the idea of the District reported a total rejection of this intervention, especially if carried out in the style of those made in previous years. So the project was paralyzed, but the Research Centre and Coordination of the Master in Urban Design, understood {{that it was a good}} team project exercise to develop in the framework of the course in Public Art Theory...|$|E
