5|$|By {{the end of}} 1968, the {{prospective}} purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft. Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments {{had been made to}} the programme; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles that much of the manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5, which created doubt as to whether the MRCA would <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> from Belgium's operational perspective.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile.</b> They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E

5|$|In May 1932, Kalep {{traveled}} from France to New York on the steamship SS Paris {{with the intention}} of flying back to Europe across the Atlantic Ocean; at the time, no woman had made a solo transatlantic flight. She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight from Canada to Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided that it would not <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to make her own attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and {{became a member of the}} Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 other female aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams from Los Angeles to Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E
25|$|A second prototype, {{designated}} DH.3A, {{was built}} with more powerful (160hp/119kW) Beardmore engines, and the War Office placed a production order for 50. This order was cancelled, however, before any could be completed, because strategic bombing was not thought to <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile,</b> and twin-engined bombers were {{claimed to be}} impracticable. The two prototypes were scrapped in 1917.|$|E

25|$|Given that {{children}} must have many documented sore throats for tonsillectomy to <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> there is surprisingly little published evidence {{about how many}} children who have their tonsils removed actually meet these criteria. One small study in the UK demonstrated that most children who had their tonsils removed did not meet these criteria, meaning that most children operated on did not really benefit from the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or rail {{switches}} (US) are power-operated, it can <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to signal each line in both directions, {{so that the}} double line becomes a pair of single lines. This allows trains to use one track where the other track is out of service due to track maintenance work, or a train failure, or for a fast train to overtake a slow train.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{linguists}} {{agree that}} the study of written language can <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> and valuable. For research that relies on corpus linguistics and computational linguistics, written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically transcribed and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of computer-mediated communication as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.|$|E

25|$|Because urine {{has so many}} {{commercial}} applications (making medications, making fertilizers, and so on), its systematic {{collection and}} sale can <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> in some commercial contexts. In urine diversion systems, toilets divert the urine away from the sewerage route that it would otherwise take; instead, it flows into containers for pickup. Such businesses exist in some places where extensive sewerage systems do not. They are rare in places where nitrogenous wastes can instead be collected at sewage treatment or wastewater treatment plants.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Commission on Decimal Coinage (1918–20), {{chaired by}} Lord Emmott, {{reported}} in 1920 {{that the only}} feasible scheme was to divide the pound into 1000 mills (the pound and mill system, first proposed in 1824) but {{that this would be}} too inconvenient. A minority of four members disagreed, saying that the disruption would <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile.</b> A further three members recommended that the pound should be replaced by the Royal, consisting of 100 halfpennies (i.e. there would be 4.8 Royals to the former pound).|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{economists and}} {{consumer}} advocates generally consider insurance to <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> for low-probability, catastrophic losses, {{but not for}} high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high deductibles and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from moral hazard.|$|E

25|$|Comparing {{the market}} cost of {{recyclable}} material {{with the cost}} of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile</b> despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.|$|E

500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence.

[...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would <b>be</b> <b>worthwhile.</b> The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E
