Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E

40|$|Land-use changes {{until the}} {{beginning}} of the 20 th century made the terrestrial biosphere a net source of atmospheric carbon. Later, <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> surpassed land use changes as the major anthropogenic source of carbon. The terrestrial biosphere is at present suggested to be a carbon sink, but the distribution of excess anthropogenic carbon to the ocean and biosphere sinks is highly uncertain. Our modeling suggest that land-use changes can be tracked quite well by the carbon isotopes until mid- 20 th century, whereas <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> dominates the present-day observed changes in the isotope signature. The modeling indicates that the global carbon isotope fractionation has not changed significantly during the last 150 years. Furthermore, increased uptake of carbon by the ocean and increasing temperatures does not yet appear to have resulted in increasing the global gross ocean-to-atmosphere carbon fluxes. This may however change in the future when the excess carbon will emerge in the ocean upwelling zones, possibly reducing the net-uptake of carbon compared to the present-day ocean...|$|R

40|$|The City of Saskatoon is {{challenged}} with {{large quantities of}} wood wastes such as demolition wastes, construction wastes, and elm tree trims. It has also been recently found {{that some of the}} elm trees in Saskatoon might have been infected with the Dutch elm disease, hence, this would lead to the cutting down of trees. The cutting of the affected elm trees will definitely increase the quantities of wood wastes in Saskatoon. The City of Saskatoon might therefore develop the initiative to develop more landfills, as all wood wastes are usually deposited into the landfills. Landfills are usually not environmental friendly, hence, no one wants a landfill in his backyard. Furthermore, the concerns about climate change is also a pressing issue around the world as individual countries most especially the industrialised countries are looking for means to reduce their carbon foot prints. The two issues discussed above have therefore developed the initiatives for renewable energy sources {{as an alternative to the}} <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> to produce energy. One of the common alternatives to <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> is the biomass fuel specifically the woody biomass fuel (wood chips).

40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the biggest {{challenges}} facing the world. The largest contributor to climate change is the greenhouse gas CO 2, which is released through anthropogenic activities such as <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> and agricultural waste. To find solutions to mitigate climate change, research has been proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or off-setting emissions through carbon (C) sequestration in soil − the largest C pool of terrestrial ecosystems. In this context, long-term C storage through biochar application to agricultural soils has been becoming a priority area of research in the last two decades...|$|R
25|$|Ammonia is used {{to scrub}} SO2 from the <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> and the {{resulting}} product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer.

25|$|On 12 November 2015, NASA {{scientists}} {{reported that}} human-made carbon dioxide (CO2) {{continues to increase}} above levels not seen in {{hundreds of thousands of}} years: currently, about half of the carbon dioxide released from the <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans.|$|E
25|$|Aside from purely human-produced {{synthetic}} halocarbons, most {{greenhouse gases}} have {{both natural and}} human-caused sources. During the pre-industrial Holocene, concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant, because the large natural sources and sinks roughly balance.

40|$|Burning <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> is {{the main}} reason behind manmade climate change. By burning the carbon content, carbon dioxide is {{produced}} and quickly spreads in the global atmosphere. This increases the greenhouse effect, thereby changing the earth’s energy balance. Concern over the negative consequences of climate change has led to a vast array of policy measures aimed at reducing the use <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel.</b> This chapter examines some aspects of these policies. It discusses the arguments for taxes and quantity restrictions on CO 2 -emitting activities, and especially on the <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel,</b> as well as policies to subsidise substitutes for these activities, particularly the use and development of technologies producing non-fossil based “green energy”. ...|$|R

25|$|Transport {{systems have}} {{significant}} {{impacts on the}} environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing {{at a faster rate}} than any other energy using sector. Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{economic}} ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, who argue that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental benefits. They state that even if global warming is caused solely by the <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.|$|E
25|$|The <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> is a {{major source}} of {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, especially for power, cement, steel, textile, fertilizer and many other industries which rely on fossil fuels (coal, electricity derived from coal, natural gas and oil). The major greenhouse gases emitted by these industries are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), etc., all of which increase the atmosphere's ability to trap infrared energy and thus affect the climate.|$|E
30|$|Activated {{slag cement}} (ASC) is an {{attractive}} alternative to Portland cement. Activated slag cement {{is a mixture of}} pozzolana and activator. The activation of slag is normally achieved by mixing it with either compounds of alkalis or alkaline earth materials.

These new cementing materials are characterized by their nearly equal mechanical strengths, and also they don’t require high energy in their manufacturing process. Depending on the nature of raw materials to be activated and type of activators used, different reactions developed, which have different physical and mechanical properties and microstructures.|$|R

25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is present}} in small amounts in the atmosphere, chiefly {{as a product of}} volcanic activity but also from natural and man-made fires (such as forest and bushfires, burning of crop residues, and sugarcane fire-cleaning). The <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> also contributes to carbon monoxide production. Carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the Earth's mantle. Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is extremely difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{over the}} {{depletion}} of the earth's finite reserves of oil, and the effect this would have on a society dependent on it, is a concept known as peak oil.

40|$|Abstract — Global {{warming is}} the recent {{challenge}} to world. Governments of various {{countries in the}} world, at this time, are concentrating on the methods of reducing it. Both developed and developing countries are using <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> in large quantity to meet their energy demands. The <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> produces CO 2. Man-made emission of CO 2 in atmosphere is highly responsible for global warming. In this paper, it is proved mathematically that how can global warming be reduced by using renewable energy resources (especially, by Wind Energy Conversion Systems & solar PV cells).
