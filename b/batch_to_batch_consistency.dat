40|$|Background: An {{increase}} in the awareness about {{the advantages of the}} traditional system of medicines has led to the commercialization of the formulations used for the treatments. Manufacture of these medicines to meet this increasing demand has resulted in a decline in their quality, primarily {{due to a lack of}} adequate regulations pertaining to this sector of medicine. Hence, it is necessary to come up with a systematic approach to develop well-designed methodologies for the standardization of polyherbal formulations which are used in traditional systems of medicine. Materials and Methods: Qurs-e-Hummaz formulations were prepared by a qualified “Hakim” (Unani medical practitioner) of Faculty of Unani Medicine, Hamdard University, as per the formula and instruction given in National Formulary of Unani Medicine. Results: Various quality control parameters such as organoleptic evaluations (color, odor, taste, and consistency), physicochemical evaluations (loss on drying, disintegration time, moisture content, total ash, acid insoluble ash, water soluble ash, pH of 1 and 10 % solution, extractive values, water soluble matter, alcohol-soluble matter, and total phenolic content) and thin layer chromatography fingerprint profiling have been carried out in triplicate. The evaluation of contaminants such as heavy metals, aflatoxins, pesticide residues, and microbial contamination has also been carried out in the formulation.

40|$|Background: In vivo In vitro {{correlation}} (IVIVC) {{development and}} its validation {{is an extremely}} important phase of dosage form (new as well as generic) optimization. It is a liaison (preferentially linear) between a suitable pharmacokinetic parameter (peak plasma drug conc. i. e. Cmax, time for peak plasma drug conc. i. e. tmax and Area under the Curve i. e. AUC) and in vitro characteristics. Need: During optimization modifications in formulation composition, manufacturing method, required equipments or even in batch size. If these changes are made, in vivo bioavailability study in healthy human volunteers {{may be required to}} prove bioavailability of newly developed dosage form with the earlier one. These facts halt the marketing of new formulation with added cost. Thus, it would be enviable to develop in vitro test that corresponds to bioavailability data. Applications: Thus the main purpose of development of IVIVC is to replace in vivo bioavailability and to support bio waivers. As IVIVC comprises linkage between suitable in vivo pharmacokinetic parameter to in vitro characteristic pertaining to dissolution; it {{can also be used to}} set up dissolution specifications and / or validation of methods of dissolution studies. It also assists as means of quality control for certain SUPAC (Scale Up and Post Approval Changes). Moreover there must be some in vitro means to assure <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch</b> <b>consistency</b> during large scale manufacturing. After successful establishment of IVIVC; dissolution method used in such establishment is used as routine quality control test as a measure of physiological performance of drug product...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 Nanotechnology {{has given}} {{scientists}} new tools {{for the development}} of advanced materials for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in particular have been extensively investigated as novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents due to a combination of favorable superparamagnetic properties, biodegradability, and surface properties that allow modification for improved in vivo kinetics and multifunctionality. SPIONs favorable characteristics have further led to their investigation as promising theranostic agents, which combine imaging and therapeutic capabilities in a single nanovector. The combination of imaging and therapy could allow for real-time monitoring of drug delivery and the tailoring of treatment for individual patients with the promise of improved clinical outcomes for patients suffering from cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM). This dissertation is intended to address limitation of conventional clinical cancer treatment including current cancer targeting limitations and poor pharmacokinetic of hydrophobic chemotherapeutics that lead to unacceptable side effects. First, SPIONs were coated with cross-linked, redox-responsive copolymers composed of chitosan and polyethylene glycol (PEG), functionalized with cancer targeting agent chlorotoxin (CTX), and modified with O 6 -benzylguanine (BG), an O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) inhibitor to improve temozolomide based treatments of GBMs. It was found that CED of the BG loaded SPION were more tolerable than free drug and increased survival 3 -fold over untreated animals in an intracranial GBM mouse model. Next, analogs of BG were evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy and modified to allow for polymerization on the SPION surface via hydrazone linkages to facilitate improved drug loading and controlled drug release. Finally, a new synthesis and functionalization strategy for theranostic agents is presented that demonstrated streamlined production, allowed for great control over the display of functional moieties on the SPION surface, increased <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch</b> <b>consistency,</b> and provided improved magnetic properties...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sialoadhesin (Sn) -expressing monocytes/macrophages {{have been}} {{associated}} with several diseases like inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as viral infections, and they also appear {{to play a role in}} the initiation of an adaptive immune response. This makes Sn-expressing cells not only attractive targets for cell-directed therapies, but also an appealing target for vaccination. Furthermore, since Sn was shown to be an endocytic receptor, the conjugation of effector molecules to an Sn-specific ligand should allow intracellular delivery of these conjugates. Previously, we developed functional Sn-specific immunoconjugates that were generated via chemical coupling. Although successful, the system requires significant optimization for each immunoconjugate to be made. To generate a more flexible and controlled system, we developed a recombinant antibody vector allowing the creation of genetic antibody fusion constructs. This paper reports on the characterization of the recombinant antibody and the evaluation of its use for Sn-directed targeting. Results: The variable domains of the porcine Sn-specific monoclonal antibody 41 D 3 were sequenced and cloned in frame with a mouse IgG 1 backbone. Transfection of HEK 293 T cells with the resulting plasmid led to the secretion of fully assembled IgG into the culture medium. This recombinant antibody rec 41 D 3 was shown to specifically bind to porcine Sn with a comparable affinity as the native monoclonal antibody. In addition, rec 41 D 3 also induced Sn endocytosis in primary macrophages and resided for prolonged times in early/late endosomes. To allow the generation of antibody fusion constructs, a multiple cloning site was introduced at the C-terminus of the heavy chain. Two fusion constructs were generated, one containing a V 5 peptide tag and one containing an eGFP molecule. Both constructs were shown to be efficiently produced in HEK 293 T cells and easily purified using standard protein G chromatography. In addition, both V 5 and eGFP were shown to be co-internalized together with rec 41 D 3 into Sn-expressing primary macrophages. Conclusions: A recombinant antibody allowing targeted delivery of peptides and proteins to Sn-expressing macrophages was developed. Production and purification of antibody fusion constructs was possible without major optimization and with <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch</b> <b>consistency,</b> confirming the development of a versatile antibody vector to evaluate Sn-directed targeting strategies in a porcine animal model...|$|E
