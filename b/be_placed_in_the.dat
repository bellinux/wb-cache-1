5|$|A segment with Raven {{took place}} where he demanded to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main event for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Larry Zbyszko disagreed, {{resulting}} in Raven attacking him before security pulled Raven off. Rhino then came out and stated that he deserved the title shot more than Raven.|$|E
5|$|Although both {{hydrogen}} and helium are in the s-block, neither of them behaves similarly to other s-block elements. Their behaviour is {{so different from the}} other s-block elements that there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table.|$|E
5|$|The Brhadaranyaka and the Chandogya {{are the two}} {{earliest}} Upanishads. They are edited texts, some {{of whose}} sources are much older than others. The two texts are pre-Buddhist; they may <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 7th to 6th centuries BCE, {{give or take a}} century or so.|$|E
30|$|According to K-means algorithm, the {{locations}} 15, 14, 12, 10, 7, 5, 1 and 19 <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first cluster, locations 2, 11, 16, 18 and 20 <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second cluster, locations 8, 3 and 13 <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third cluster, and locations 9, 6, 4 and 17 <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth cluster.|$|R

50|$|Ostrich faecal {{associated}} ssDNA {{virus has}} <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Gemytondvirus. Rabbit faecal associated ssDNA virus has <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Gemykroznavirus.|$|R
5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
50|$|The eight known species <b>in</b> {{this family}} <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> four genera. Hemipristis <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{subfamily}} Hemipristinae, while Chaenogaleus, Hemigaleus, and Paragaleus <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subfamily Hemigaleinae.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> APG III {{classification}} system, it <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly {{the family}} Ruscaceae). It has also <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former family Convallariaceae.|$|R
25|$|Mulrunji <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-cell lockup {{which was}} the back section of the Palm Island Police Station. Fellow Palm Islander Patrick Bramwell <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{adjoining}} cell.|$|R
5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once {{the time in the}} penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|After the Virginia Tech {{massacre}} on April 16, 2007, Vick and the United Way donated $10,000 {{to assist}} families affected. The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy {{and a special}} fund at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said {{the money would be}} used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{collectible}} {{items that are}} flown on shuttle missions, such as mission patches, flags, and other personal items for the crew, were an official Harlem Globetrotters basketball and a basketball that Edwin Hubble used in 1909 when he played for the University of Chicago. After being returned to Earth, the Harlem Globetrotters basketball would <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would {{be returned to the}} University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reprint of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius from the library of his alma mater, MIT.|$|E
50|$|Under the Cronquist system, most of <b>the</b> above {{families}} <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rosales. <b>The</b> Oxalidaceae <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Geraniales, and the Elaeocarpaceae {{split between}} the Malvales and Polygalales, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter case being treated as the Tremandraceae.|$|R
50|$|Shortly before flight, the {{jellyfish}} {{samples were}} loaded into {{a total of}} 10 Nizemi cuvettes containing ASW and <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Type I containers. For the behavior study, a group of normal ephyrae {{and a group of}} ephyrae without statoliths <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Biorack 22 Â°C incubator. The third group of ephyrae <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Biorack 1-G centrifuge. Two groups of polyps were used for the development study. One group <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incubator and <b>the</b> other <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1-G centrifuge. A similar set of equipment was maintained at the KSC ground-control facility.|$|R
30|$|However, {{we need to}} use two controllers. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> d axe to {{keep the}} {{reactive}} power at zero, <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> q axe to obtain the optimal torque.|$|R
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors {{can be used in}} either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae {{because of the}} presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should actually <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesize that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth, and {{as recently as the}} 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant has}} 8 synonyms. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> APG III {{classification}} system, <b>the</b> genus Dracaena <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae).) It has also <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Agavaceae (now the subfamily Agavoideae) and the Dracaenaceae. Like many lilioid monocots, it <b>was</b> formerly <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Liliaceae (lily family).|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} at 935 Shawnee Road in Kansas City, Kansas. The {{architect}} is unknown but may have been Asa Beebe Cross. The home's design {{is an example of}} Italianate architecture. It <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kansas City, Kansas Historic Landmarks on January 29, 1987. It <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Register of Historic Kansas Places on July 1, 1977.

50|$|Before the 1998-99 season, the NHL realigned its {{divisions}} once more. However, the Capitals and Penguins remained interdivisional opponents, as <b>the</b> Penguins <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new Atlantic Division and <b>the</b> Capitals <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new Southeast Division.|$|R
5|$|In the late-1930s it {{was decided}} to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although busts of the admirals, initially intended to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost Â£50,000. The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa's Confederation Park and Regina's Wascana Centre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffreyâ who was Duke of Brittanyâ King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to settle for a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian Ebers Papyrus from 1550BCE and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850BCE have {{within them}} {{some of the}} {{earliest}} documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vagina to block sperm. It is believed that in Ancient Greece silphium was used as birth control which, due to its effectiveness and thus desirability, was harvested into extinction.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2009 book, the Gundelieae were {{sunk into}} the Cichorieae. The new tribe Platycarpheae was recognized, {{as well as the}} tribes Eremothamneae and Moquinieae. Heterolepis <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arctotideae, at least provisoinally. Distephanus <b>was</b> not <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moquinieae or the Vernonieae, but is closely related to them. Trichospira <b>was</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vernonieae, but its {{inclusion}} there is in doubt.|$|R
5|$|The {{classification}} of the Amylostereaceae {{is not completely}} resolved. The next closest relatives might be â depending on the research â either Echinodontium tinctorium and most other species of the genus Echinodontium, or Artomyces pyxidatus. Most of the previous DNA analysis results suggest a narrow relation to Echinodontium, but several results of studies partially contradict this conclusion. Only the classification to the Russulales is regarded as correct. Some authors have suggested that Amylostereum should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Echinodontiaceae.|$|E
5|$|The planned mosque {{will not}} be in the Ottoman {{architecture}} style. It will have a concrete and glass dome, and two 55 meter high minarets. The mosque will have the bazaar and entrance on the ground floor, lecture halls in the basement, the prayer area on the upper floor and include a Muslim library. A well is intended to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center to connect the two levels and to create a pleasant atmosphere. The mosque consists of flat-like wall screens which form a dome in the center.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Gedangan {{remained}} {{a center of}} Catholic activity in Semarang. The Jesuit provincial superior continued to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gedangan presbytery until 1949, when he {{was moved to the}} church in Karangpanas, then again from 1954 to 1962 (when he was sent to Karangpanas again). The central offices of the Kanisius Foundation remained on the church grounds until a new office was opened in 1970. Further construction has continued as well: an office building, named Bintang Laut, was completed on 6 August 1988, and renovations to the church building took place in the early 1990s. The church continues to hold regular services, including five on Sundays.|$|E
50|$|Normally two {{identical}} dye {{samples are}} created.
