50|$|A {{series of}} straps, usually three, {{are used to}} fasten the foot to the snowshoe. Some styles of binding use a cup for the toe. It is {{important}} that a user be able to manipulate these straps easily, as removing or securing the foot often must be done outdoors in cold weather with bare hands, exposing {{him or her to}} the possibility of frostbite. When putting on snowshoes, left is distinguished from right by which way the loose ends of the <b>binding</b> <b>straps</b> point: always outward, to avoid stepping on them repeatedly.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the elevation of its tube, the factor that determined the mortar's range {{was the size of}} the powder charge that was loaded into its breech, following the shell. The desired range for the mortar was specified in terms of zones. The smallest zone (shortest range) was Zone 1, and the largest (longest range) was Zone 9. With the so-called [...] "aliquot charge" [...] (shown in the photo at right), up to 9 equal-sized, disk-shaped bags of powder (each about 2 in thick and containing 6.3 lb of powder) could be attached to a 10th (or [...] "base") bag, by means of cloth <b>binding</b> <b>straps</b> that were sewn to the base bag. Often the base bag was painted red, indicating that the powder assembly was to be loaded into the breech [...] "red end last," [...] so that it bumped up against the closing breech block (or faced the gunner). The red base bag also contained a small charge of black powder as an igniter. When the breech was closed, a detonator was inserted through the breech block and contacted the igniter, ready to set off the full powder charge.|$|E

5000|$|Vaage {{suggests}} that the Kiandra Snow Shoe Club was established around 1870, but reports that the date and circumstances are indefinite. According to Skiing Magazine, the first downhill races occurred in 1861 and the club was founded in 1870. Between the years 1861 and 1863, the Australian club members constructed and used a short, broad ski, which was designed specifically for skiing downhill and called the [...] "Kiandra kick-in" [...] (referring to kicking one's boot into the <b>binding</b> <b>strap).</b> According to Andresen, Jens Olsen from Tjølling, Norway, gave up gold digging and instead set up a ski manufacturing workshop, the first such factory in Australia. Andresen {{suggests that}} Jens Olsen {{was one of the}} founders of the Kiandra Snow Shoe Club. There were championships held for cross-country skiing and ski jumping, starting in 1878.|$|R
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies and}} re-sequencing projects are revealing {{an increasing number}} of disease-associated SNPs, a large fraction of which are non-coding. Although they could have relevance for disease susceptibility and progression, the lack of information about regulatory regions impedes the assessment of their functionality. Here we present a web server, ChroMoS (Chromatin Modified SNPs), which combines genetic and epigenetic data with the goal of facilitating SNPs' classification, prioritization and prediction of their functional consequences. ChroMoS uses a large database of SNPs and chromatin states, but allows a user to provide his/her own genetic information. Based on the SNP classification and interactive prioritization, a user can compute the functional impact of multiple SNPs using two prediction tools, one for differential analysis of transcription factor <b>binding</b> (<b>sTRAP)</b> and another for SNPs with potential impact on binding of miRNAs (MicroSNiPer) ...|$|R
5000|$|A crampon is a {{traction}} {{device that}} {{is attached to}} footwear to improve mobility on snow and ice during ice climbing. Not only are crampons used during ice climbing, {{but they are also}} used for secure travel on snow and ice, such as crossing glaciers, snowfields and icefields, ascending snow slopes, and scaling ice-covered rock. There are three main attachment systems for footwear: step-in, hybrid, and <b>strap</b> <b>bindings.</b> The first two require boots with welts, as a tension lever attaches the crampon to the heel. The last type (<b>strap</b> <b>bindings)</b> are more versatile and can adapt to virtually any boot or shoe, but often do not fit as precisely as the other two types.|$|R

50|$|Narasimha is {{depicted}} {{seated on the}} coils of Shesha. Shesha is shown here in a form with seven heads, the heads arching over Narasimha to form a canopy. The statue has been restored sometime after 1984, which is evident from John Gollings’ photograph of the statue taken in around 1984. The granite <b>strap</b> <b>binding</b> between his knees is a recent addition to stabilise it.|$|R
50|$|Modern skiing {{developed}} as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The {{introduction of the}} cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. The <b>binding</b> looped a <b>strap</b> {{around the back of}} the boot to hold it forward into a metal cup at the toe. Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch to become common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose.|$|R
25|$|With modern <b>strap</b> <b>bindings,</b> {{the rider}} wears a boot {{which has a}} thick but {{flexible}} sole, and padded uppers. The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped {{across the top of}} the toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|R
50|$|Burton {{built the}} world's first {{snowboard}} factory. It {{is the largest}} snowboard brand in the world. The first snowboard was a BB1 snowboard, which is a narrow board with single <b>strap</b> <b>bindings</b> and a rope and handle attached to the nose. Burton products are marketed worldwide in over 4,348 stores; 1,536 of those stores {{are located in the}} United States. In 2003 Burton allowed several online companies to sell Burton products over the internet. For years Burton had only been available through stores locally, but Burton felt that an online presence would allow buyers to have an alternative instead of turning to another brand.|$|R

40|$|Glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) can {{regulate}} a {{broad range}} of cellular processes in a variety of cell types and tissues through its ability to phosphorylate its substrates in a cell- and time-specific manner. Although it is known that Axin and presenilin help to recruit β-catenin/Smad 3 and tau protein to GSK 3 β, respectively, {{it is not clear how}} many of the other GSK 3 β substrates are recruited to it. Here, we have established the binding of GSK 3 β with a novel scaffold protein, STRAP, through its WD 40 domains. In a new finding, we have observed that STRAP, GSK 3 β and Axin form a ternary complex together. We show for the first time that intracellular fragment of Notch 3 (ICN 3) binds with GSK 3 β through the ankyrin repeat domain. This <b>binding</b> between <b>STRAP</b> and GSK 3 β is reduced by small-molecule inhibitors of GSK 3 β. Further studies revealed that STRAP also binds ICN 3 through the ankyrin repeat region, and this binding is enhanced in a proteasomal inhibition-dependent manner. In vivo ubiquitination studies indicate that STRAP reduces ubiquitination of ICN 3, suggesting a role of STRAP in stabilizing ICN 3. This is supported by the fact that STRAP and Notch 3 are co-upregulated and co-localized in 59 % of non-small cell lung cancers, as observed in an immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. These results provide a potential mechanism by which STRAP regulates GSK 3 β function and Notch 3 stabilization and further support the oncogenic functions of STRAP...|$|R
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged <b>binding</b> peg or <b>strap</b> with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|R
40|$|Because snowboarders {{are known}} to injure their ankles more often than alpine skiers, it has been {{postulated}} that stiffer snowboard boots would provide better protection to the ankle ligaments than current soft boots do. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the kinematics of the feet and lower legs of five snowboarders riding down a course of 10 gates on a ski hill using an electromagnetic motion tracking system. Results were obtained with each snowboarder wearing soft boots and stiffer step-in boots. The measurements were expressed in anatomically relevant rotations of the ankle joint complex. Two models were developed to predict ligament strains from rotations of the ankle joint complex: (1) a statistical model using published ligament strain measured on cadaver specimens at various combinations of ankle rotations as an interpolation and extrapolation table to predict strains in two ankle ligaments at the rotations measured during the snowboarding trials; (2) a personalized 2 -degrees-of-freedom kinematic model of the ankle joint complex, based on the Denavit-Hartenberg formulation of serial-link manipulators, to predict strains in flue ankle ligaments from the relative position of the shank and foot. The experimental {{results showed that the}} left and right ankles are asymmetrically rotated, mostly in dorsiflexion, eversion and external rotation. Compared to step-in boots and bindings, soft boots and <b>strap</b> <b>bindings</b> allowed more rotation of the ankle joint complex and more strain in the anterior talofibular ligament, according to the statistical model. The kinematic model was not sensitive enough to detect differences in ligament strains between the 2 types of equipment. A functional determination of the axes of rotation of the talocrural and subtalar joints could further improve the predictions of this model. This is the first known study to document experimentally the kinematics of snowboarding. It generally confirms the expectation that softer boats allow significantly wider ranges of ankle rotation and ligament strain...|$|R
