30|$|With the {{development}} of nanotechnology, nanomaterials are now widely produced and applied in biomedical and <b>biologic</b> <b>engineering</b> [1 – 4]. Due to their unique characteristics, nanomaterials and nanotechnologies are changing many basic scientific concepts in {{a great variety of}} fields, and are receiving intensively increasing interest in the relative research and industrial applications.|$|E
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of nanoscience and nanotechnology, magnetic nanostructured materials have attracted significant interest {{because of their}} interesting optical, electrical, and catalytic properties, as well as response and manipulability under magnetic fields [1 – 3]. As {{a result of these}} characteristics, their potential applications have been proposed in several fields such as optoelectronics, magnetics, catalysis, <b>biologic</b> <b>engineering,</b> information storage, and photovoltaic technology [4 – 6]. In particular, extensive research has been focused on magnetic metallic nanoparticles such as nickel (Ni), cobalt, and iron which represent a group of promising nanomaterials to ascertain their usefulness in several areas such as high density magnetic recording media, chemical and photochemical catalysis, ferrofluids, and medical diagnostics because of their special structures and distinctive magnetic and physical properties [7 – 9].|$|E
40|$|Rehabilitation {{engineers}} apply engineering {{principles to}} improve function or to solve {{challenges faced by}} persons with disabilities. It is critical to integrate the knowledge of biologics into the process of rehabilitation engineering to advance the field and maximize potential benefits to patients. Some applications in particular demonstrate {{the value of a}} symbiotic relationship between <b>biologics</b> and rehabilitation <b>engineering.</b> In this review we illustrate how researchers working with neural interfaces and integrated prosthetics, assistive technology, and biologics data collection are currently integrating these 2 fields. We also discuss the potential for further integration of <b>biologics</b> and rehabilitation <b>engineering</b> to deliver the best technologies and treatments to patients. Engineers and clinicians must work together to develop technologies that meet clinical needs and are accessible to the intended patient population.

40|$|Shoulder {{pathology}} is {{a growing}} concern for the aging population, athletes, and laborers. Shoulder osteoarthritis and rotator cuff disease represent the two most common disorders of the shoulder leading to pain, disability, and degeneration. While research in cartilage regeneration has not yet been translated clinically, the field of shoulder arthroplasty has advanced to the point that joint replacement is an excellent and viable option for a number of pathologic conditions in the shoulder. Rotator cuff disease has been a significant focus of research activity in recent years, as clinicians face the challenge of poor tendon healing and irreversible changes associated with rotator cuff arthropathy. Future treatment modalities involving <b>biologics</b> and tissue <b>engineering</b> hold further promise to improve outcomes for patients suffering from shoulder pathologies...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{demonstrate}} promise for musculoskeletal regenerative medicine. An alternate {{approach to the}} direct delivery of stem cells is to exploit the concept of in situ tissue <b>engineering.</b> <b>Biologics</b> such as bone marrow aspirate concentrate and platelet rich plasma (PRP) enhance recovery from musculoskeletal injuries. These biologics contain growth factors which could act as chemoattractants for stem cells. In this project, we observed the migratory capacity of stem cells in response to biologics using of a microfluidics device. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the optimal biologic for recruitment of stem cells. Our hypothesis was that PRP would result in the greatest migration of MSC's because of the milieu and concentration of growth factors contained in PRP. We found that all biologics tested resulted in an increase in migration of stem cells compared to the control. This demonstrates that biologics can be used as chemotactic agents to recruit MSCs to a site of injury. This information will reduce the need and therefore the risks and costs associated with direct stem cell delivery. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|In tissue {{engineering}} of cartilage, polymeric scaffolds are {{implanted in the}} damaged tissue and subjected to repeated compression loading cycles. The possibility of failure due to mechanical fatigue has not been properly addressed in these scaffolds. Nevertheless, the macroporous scaffold is susceptible to failure after repeated loading-unloading cycles. This is related to inherent discontinuities in the material due to the micropore structure of the macro-pore walls that act as stress concentration points. In this work, chondrogenic precursor cells have been seeded in Poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with fibrin and some were submitted to free swelling culture and others to cyclic loading in a bioreactor. After cell culture, all the samples were analyzed for fatigue behavior under repeated loading-unloading cycles. Moreover, some components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were identified. No differences were observed between samples undergoing free swelling or bioreactor loading conditions, neither respect to matrix components nor to mechanical performance to fatigue. The ECM did not achieve the desired preponderance of collagen type II over collagen type I which is considered the main characteristic of hyaline cartilage ECM. However, prediction in PCL with ECM constructs was possible up to 600 cycles, an enhanced performance when compared to previous works. PCL after cell culture presents an improved fatigue resistance, {{despite the fact that}} the measured elastic modulus at the first cycle was similar to PCL with poly(vinyl alcohol) samples. This finding suggests that fatigue analysis in {{tissue engineering}} constructs can provide additional information missed with traditional mechanical measurements.

40|$|In 1967, {{the problem}} of {{occupational}} lead exposure came to public attention in Korea. Since then, regular {{progress has been made}} in lowering workplace lead exposures, instituting new workplace controls, and implementing health examinations of ex-posed workers. Past serious lead poisoning episodes made it possible to introduce biological monitoring programs on a volun-tary basis in high-lead-exposure facilities in Korea. Industry-specific occupational health services for lead workers in Korea during the last 22 years can be categorized into three phases. During the first phase (1988 - 1993), efforts were directed at increasing awareness among workers about the hazards of lead exposure, biological monitoring of blood zinc protoporphyrin began, and a respiratory protection program was introduced. During the second phase (1994 - 1997), a computerized health management sys-tem for lead workers was developed, blood-lead measurement was added to <b>biologic</b> monitoring, and <b>engineering</b> controls were introduced in the workplace to lower air-lead levels to comply with air-lead regulations. Finally, during the third phase (1998 -pres-ent), a new biomarker, bone-lead measurement by X-ray fluorescence, was introduced. Bone-lead measurement proved to be useful for assessing body burden and to demonstrate past lead exposure in retired workers. Occupational health service practice for lead workers, including the industry-specific group occupational health system, has brought considerable success in the pre-vention of lead poisoning and in reducing the lead burden in Korean lead workers during the last several decades. The successful achievement of prevention of lead poisoning in Korea was a result of the combined efforts of lead workers, employers, relevan...|$|R
