500|$|Following {{their last}} record, the highly {{successful}} Odyssey Number Five, the band {{agreed that they}} wanted to continue in their musical careers, but wanted to have more fun with it. They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is really important to us, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make it more fun".|$|E
500|$|This {{story had}} no {{traces of the}} Circle 7 version of the film, since the filmmakers did not read its script: [...] "Not out of spite, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to start fresh, and not be {{influenced}} by what they'd done," [...] said Unkrich. [...] "We didn't look {{at any of the}} work they'd done. We really didn't want to know anything about it." [...] In February 2007, Lasseter announced Toy Story 2s co-director, Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of himself (Lasseter had directed the first two films and was busy directing Cars 2), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter. 2010 was also announced as the tentative release date.|$|E
500|$|Despite Maheshinte Prathikaaram title, Pothan {{intended}} {{it to be}} a comedy: [...] "I enjoy humour with a poignant touch. This was a narrative that had {{the potential to be a}} thriller <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> that element of realism to shine through". He and Pushkaran worked on the screenplay for nearly three years. With a few assistant directors, they honed it for about three months in Prakash City, a mountain village near Kattappana in Idukki (where the film is set). The screenplay was based on their observations of the village near the kavala (junction), which generated a detailed backstory for each of the film's characters. Pothan took note of the mannerisms of the shopkeepers in the kavala whom he considered a [...] "witness to many of the incidents that unfold in the village, real and reel".|$|E

500|$|Recording {{took place}} at Henson Recording Studios, Conway Recording Studios and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France. Having worked with keyboardist and {{arranger}} Chris Caswell on Tron: Legacy, the duo enlisted him and connected with engineers and other session players for their next album. Daft Punk recalled that they wished to avoid the more compressed sounds of drum machines in favor of [...] "airy open" [...] drum sets of the 1970s and 80s, which the duo consider the most appealing era. Bangalter clarified that [...] "it's not that we can't make crazy futuristic sounding stuff, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to play with the}} past". The duo noted that the session players were enthusiastic to reunite {{in the context of the}} new album and the perceived prestige of the studio locations.|$|E
500|$|Some {{characters}} who previously appeared in War for Cybertron feature updated appearances and transformation schemes, or moving parts that animate regardless of player action, similar to breathing. The character Optimus Prime was redesigned for a [...] "more warrior-type feel", with more bulk {{added to his}} body mass. The weaponry in Fall of Cybertron was also modified and enhanced; the designers of the game put out a call {{to everyone in the}} studio for new weapon ideas. Matt Tieger of High Moon explained that in addition to new designs, each weapon could be upgraded, continuing, [...] "We really made a conscious choice to make every upgrade a significant improvement, so one upgrade might increase your firing speed by 75%. We could have made the system so {{that there were a lot}} of upgrades that each improved your guns a little bit, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make each upgrade feel like this giant thing. That way when players buy it they’re really going to feel the difference." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to make sure that}} when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E

500|$|The {{other members}} of Blaster Masters {{development}} team created the system of alternating between the 2D platforming and top-down modes. During the game's planning, the team {{came up with the}} idea that SOPHIA would eventually be able to go anywhere in the game, including navigating on the ceilings and walls. The team created the top-down portions to allow Jason to shoot in all directions and to enable them to [...] "express large bosses that really had an impact". They did not want to design the gameplay in a linear progression; instead they drew inspiration from and were influenced by Nintendo's Metroid to create a game that allowed players to freely move between levels. According to Iwata: [...] "We wanted the player to experience the feeling of excitement that comes from discovering something after endeavoring through a difficult search, which is why we composed a map that allowed the player to move freely between different areas. We really put a great deal of thought into that element of the game design and, I mean this in the best possible way, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> the player to have to struggle." ...|$|E
500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers made {{extensive}} use of macro photography. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, [...] "It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> a realistic realization, not Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with its oversized set pieces." [...] Rebecca Baehler served {{as the director of}} macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter. Carpenter said vibration became [...] "a tremendous problem" [...] when moving the camera during the macro photography because [...] "one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!" [...] The solution required the filmmakers to search for a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial [...] "tabletop" [...] photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial capture set up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, [...] "One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all set to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [...] Paul's performance." [...] Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing [...] "facial expressions that would later be composited on a CG Ant-Man." ...|$|E
500|$|Munroe {{stated in}} terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but {{eventually}} it just came back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart. When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could do really well, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!" [...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book. Karai was one of Munroe's favoriite characters from the comics and he [...] "was the one who really pushed for Karai" [...] to appear in the film. TMNT co-creator Peter Laird stated it takes place in its own universe separate from the previous films. However, director Munroe says the film exists in the same continuity as the other films, which was supported by the memento wall {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
500|$|After much research, Nolan's {{brother and}} co-writer, Jonathan, {{suggested}} the Joker's first two appearances, {{published in the}} first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences. Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker, with the Joker resembling Mabuse's characteristics. Christopher Nolan referred to Lang's film as [...] "essential research for anyone attempting to write a supervillain". Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co-creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal. Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, [...] "the Joker we meet in The Dark Knight is fully formed... To me, the Joker is an absolute. There are no shades of gray to him– maybe shades of purple. He's unbelievably dark. He bursts in just as he did in the comics." [...] Nolan reiterated to IGN, [...] "We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film," [...] because [...] "the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute. It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important element, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker." [...] Nolan suggested [...] influenced a section of the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances. Nolan also cited Heat as [...] "sort of an inspiration" [...] for his aim [...] "to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city": [...] "If you want to take on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of weight and breadth and depth in there. So you wind up dealing with the political figures, the media figures. That's part of the whole fabric of how a city is bound together." ...|$|E

5000|$|These new {{measures}} have been criticised by the DPA (formerly Disabled Persons Assembly) a spokesperson told the New Zealand Herald [...] "Disabled people have been telling Social Welfare for years that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to work, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> the appropriate kind of work".|$|R
6000|$|... "They're domestic," [...] he said, [...] "and fond {{of their}} children, and {{pleasant}} neighbors. I don't deny that they've got {{a tremendous sense of}} duty, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> {{that in these}} days." ...|$|R
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
2500|$|Led Zeppelin III {{was not one}} of {{the best}} sellers in the {{catalogue}} because the audience turned round and said 'What {{are we supposed to do}} with this?'—'Where is our 'Whole Lotta Love Part 2'?

2500|$|Speaking of {{the video}} to MTV, Reynolds said [...] "We read through a ton of scripts from really talented directors, and we came across one that stood out to us in particular, because it put into visuals the general theme of the song, {{which is kind of}} an {{empowering}} song about an awakening, but it did {{it in a way that}} was very different". [...] "A lot of people probably see a post-apocalyptic world when they hear 'Radioactive', understandably, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to deliver something that was maybe a little different from that ... a lot different from that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure we can, by {{the aid of}} {{the hooks}} and ropes, and the horses. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be careful how it's done. There is no sense in {{breaking}} the machine still more." ...|$|R

2500|$|By 1994 Cheney and Owen {{were writing}} their own {{material}} {{and decided to}} change the band's name to The Living End – {{a reference to the}} film, Rock Around the Clock (1956). According to Cheney [...] "It's an old '50s term, meaning 'far out', 'the greatest' ... We were still into the whole '50s thing, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> a neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance.|$|E
2500|$|The Dust Brothers had a {{bunch of}} music {{together}}, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they'd planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – [...] "Shake Your Rump," [...] for example. They'd put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when we said we wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> all of that stuff on there. I think half of the tracks were written when we got there, and the other half we wrote together." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Marvel Entertainment {{was bought}} by the Walt Disney Company and Marvel Studios became its [...] "own entity", without other {{companies}} working with them as distribution companies, the studio commissioned a new logo for their films and television series starting with Thor: The Dark World, the first film to feature solely the Marvel logo. Feige explained that [...] "We didn’t want to re-invent the wheel , <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, [...] like all great studio logos, you need a fanfare, and we’d never had that before." [...] Therefore, Marvel commissioned Brian Tyler, who had just scored Iron Man 3 and The Dark World for them, to compose a new [...] "spectacular" [...] fanfare to accompany the logo.|$|E
