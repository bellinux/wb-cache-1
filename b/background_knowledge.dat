40|$|Web-based {{distance}} learning {{is becoming increasingly}} prevalent as the Internet permeates {{every aspect of our}} culture, and many educational content management systems are now in use on the web. However, learners’ experiences of these systems are almost invariably static, with information being delivered regardless of their <b>background</b> or <b>knowledge.</b> Due to variation between learners’, it is suggested that these web-based distancelearning systems would benefit from the capability of adapting their content to meet individual needs. To effectively implement this adaptation of educational material, we require a user model that supplies the system with information about the learners using the system, such as their <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>knowledge,</b> interests and learning styles. This paper focuses on presenting a user model that combines the advantages of two techniques (overlay and stereotyping) in a way that provides the system with the ability to deliver information that is fully informed by the requirements of individual users...|$|R

The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the Müller-Lyer illusion are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.|$|E

500|$|Christie {{was born}} into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Ashfield, Torquay, Devon. She met her future husband just before the First World War; after he was sent to the Western Front, she worked with the Voluntary Aid Detachment, and in the chemist dispensary, giving her a working <b>background</b> <b>knowledge</b> of {{medicines}} and poisons. Christie's writing career began during the war after she was challenged by her sister to write a detective story; she produced The Mysterious Affair at Styles, which was turned down by two publishers before it was eventually published in 1920. Following the limited success of the novel, she continued to write and steadily built up a fan base for what Contemporary Authors calls [...] "her unfailingly clever plots". She went on to write over a hundred works, including further novels, short stories and plays. Additionally she wrote two volumes of poetry, two autobiographical books and six romantic works under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. One of Christie's plays, The Mousetrap, opened in West End theatre in 1952 and, as at September 2015, was still running; in 2009 the London run exceeded 25,000 performances. In September 2015 a public vote identified And Then There Were None—originally published in 1939 under the name Ten Little Niggers—as the public's favourite Christie novel; the book was the writer's favourite, and the one she found most difficult to write.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Evaluation of the {{training}} is a principle for successful education. This study evaluated {{the effect of the}} theoretical course of community oral health on knowledge, attitude and self-reported practice of preventive dentistry in dental students at Tehran University of Medical Sciences and assessed the students' satisfaction from the course. Materials and Methods: The intervention group comprised the forth-year students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Dental School and the controls were the forth year students of Shahid Beheshti Medical University. The questionnaire included questions on <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>knowledge,</b> attitude and practice of students towards preventive dentistry, and students' satisfaction from the course. The intervention was 17 weekly sessions (hours) of the community oral health course. The sum of scores for questions on <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>knowledge,</b> attitude and practice were calculated and changes were analyzed by General Linear Model. Results: The mean baseline knowledge score in the intervention group was 16. 9 (SD= 4. 0) and for the control group 16. 3 (SD= 3. 5). Corresponding figures were 23. 7 (SD= 3. 4) and 17 (SD= 3. 3) after intervention. General linear model showed the intervention to be successful in increasing the students' knowledge scores on preventive dentistry (P< 0. 0001). Most students (92 %) were satisfied with learning several new items during the course. Conclusion: The students' knowledge was successfully increased by passing the theoretical course of community oral health delivered by teacher-centered method of lecture. Student-centered methods may help in changing the students' attitude and practice of preventive dentistry...|$|R

500|$|The later folklorists Caroline Oates and Juliette Wood have {{suggested}} that Murray was {{best known for her}} witch-cult theory, with biographer Margaret S. Drower expressing the view that it was her work on this subject which [...] "perhaps more than any other, made her known to the general public". It has been claimed that Murray's was the [...] "first feminist study of the witch trials", as well as being the first to have actually [...] "empowered the witches" [...] by giving the (largely female) accused both free will and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators. The theory was faulty, in part because all of her academic training was in Egyptology, with no <b>background</b> <b>knowledge</b> in European history, but also because she exhibited a [...] "tendency to generalize wildly on the basis of very slender evidence". Oates and Wood, however, noted that Murray's interpretations of the evidence fitted within wider perspectives on the past that existed at the time, stating that [...] "Murray was far from isolated in her method of reading ancient ritual origins into later myths". In particular, her approach was influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, who had argued for the existence of a pervasive dying-and-resurrecting god myth, and she was also influenced by the interpretative approaches of E. O. James, Karl Pearson, Herbert Fleure, and Harold Peake.|$|E

The configurations of <b>background</b> <b>knowledge</b> that he considers are those that are provided by a sample proposition, namely a proposition that is a conjunction of atomic propositions, each of which ascribes a single predicate to a single individual, with no two atomic propositions involving the same individual.
