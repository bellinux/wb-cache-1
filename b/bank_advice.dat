SMEs can alleviate the severity of their financial problems significantly by using bank support more fully, through developing long-term relationships with banks as primary network partners. The article further recognises the value of advice from banks as a substitute for entrepreneurial human capital, especially when bankers use private information to determine the nature and level of financial and non-financial assistance that they are prepared to supply to their clients...|$|E

In low-income countries, direct payments made by patients to providers are {{the main source of}} revenue, raising concerns about access to care for the poor. The Bank did not take an ideological stance in its work in revenue collection for health; rather it worked within the different country contexts. <b>Bank</b> <b>advice</b> focused on increasing the health budget in low-income countries. In middle-income countries, the Bank recommended managing the level of public spending and subsidizing insurance enrollment. Some timely advice on a greater role for alcohol and tobacco taxes has been given but this is very limited. The Bank gave limited attention to user payments through lending operations. In few countries did it help institutionalize monitoring and evaluation to examine the effect of health financing. There have been some notable successes. Bank support has helped raise domestic revenues for health and subsidize contributions to risk pools for low-income groups. Support to reduce user payments lacked the necessary fiscal and equity analysis, and evidence is missing that it has improved service use and financial protection. Bank support was more successful with strong government commitment at both the economy-wid...|$|E

40|$|An {{advisor to}} a firm {{targeted}} in a merger or acquisition that simultaneously {{is involved in}} financing the bidding {{part of the deal}} is referred to as a dual role advisor. Being a dual role advisor can create conflicts of interest through the possible perception that the investment <b>bank's</b> <b>advice</b> to the seller throughout a bidding process is tainted by a desire {{on the part of the}} advisor to obtain additional fees from financing the successful bidder. I find support for this fear in a study of 1, 023 public US mergers and acquisitions over the period 1993 to 2008. Conflicts of interests are manifested through that deals which involve a dual role advisor are, compared to deals with no dual role advisors, (a) performed at lower premium, (b) are more likely to be subject to a lawsuit, (c) feature lower merger advisor fees and (d) are commensurate with higher announcement returns for bidders...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} dual role advisors in acquisitions on shareholder value creation for both the acquirer and target. Dual role advisors are advisors that provide both advisory services to either the acquirer or target and are involved in underwriting or syndicating securities issued to finance the deal. Previous studies find that being a dual role advisor can create {{a conflict of interest}} in which the investment <b>bank’s</b> <b>advice</b> to either the acquirer or target is impacted by the bank’s desire to obtain financing fees from financing the transaction. Our study contributes to the existing literature by studying the effect of both acquirer and target advisors in dual roles on shareholder value creation and by analyzing how the amount of proceeds of the deal-related security issue(s) impacts this relationship. Using a sample of 263 acquisitions involving U. S. non-financial firms in the period between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2014, this study provides only partial support for the fear that dual role advisors provide biased advice in order to secure themselves of obtaining lucrative financing fees. More specifically, it is shown that deals with an acquirer advisor in a dual role are completed at significantly higher premiums. However, this study does not find that this association increase...|$|R

40|$|The Chinese {{demographic}} transition involves, {{within a few}} decades, a critical problem of sustainability of pension system. The current system {{is more or less}} a PAYGO system. The current reform, based on the World <b>Bank</b> <b>advices</b> {{of the end of the}} 90 ’s, seems to be not ambitious enough. The problem of the pension burden of the state owned enterprises is urgent and immediate. The longer-term problem arises from the rapid aging of the population. Without a courageous but painful reform, the Chinese pension system will not be able to give a decent life to the elderly. This fact is shown by the CGE model we built for China. Even in the case of the World Bank’s “three pillars”, the pension system is not sustainable without a minimum increase of 50 % in the contribution rate, and a cut of 30 % of the wage replacement rate. Whatever the situation, the state budget constraint is one of the main issues of the reform. The recent accession of China to the WTO involves a severe cut in the tariffs rates. That will worsen the problem of the budget deficit. The aim of this paper is to estimate the burden of the WTO accession for the government budget, and to compare this to the burden of the pension reform. The estimations are done with a dynamic CGE model of China (over 20 years). We’ll see that the budget problem due to the WTO accession is a short-term problem, almost negligible compared to the budget and long term problem of pension reform. ...|$|R

30|$|But alas - {{they are}} coming late: While {{there will be a}} market for such an {{augmented}} advice-giving, quite of lot of the originally interested clients is moving on to new models of getting advice. Rather than relying on a professional banking advisor they rely on a social network. Already in 2008, clients reported that they typically ask their friends (and read in newspapers) before they go to a bank (Nussbaumer et al. 2009). In many cases <b>banking</b> <b>advice</b> giving served the purpose of closing the decision process by reducing remaining insecurities and recommending appropriate products. In many senses this reflected an appropriate interpretation of banking advisors as sales agents. While banks have recently struggled and (partially) succeeded in establishing true and fair advice, they are threatened to be made redundant in {{what is happening in the}} decision phases before the clients enter the bank: Clients cannot only rely on their personal social network but on special networks set up for exchanging investment-relevant financial information. Such social trading networks are either based on exchanging information (e.g. xSocial.eu?) or on sharing information on investment decision, i.e. sharing buying or selling securities (e.g. ayondo). Special support is giving for the roles such as a follower, i.e. a person who observes and maybe copies other members’ investment decisions. It will be of special research interest to see what other roles and network structures evolve and to what extent the knowledge on general social networking can be applied to investment decision. While the social trading networks where originally intended for heavy traders, we see those platform becoming attractive for more conventional investors. Still, these social trading networks are for clients, who have a genuine interest in investments.|$|R

He suggests that information technology systems pose new technical problems for market supervisors and can affect the rights and obligations of market participants. He provides policy principles that take these factors into account, to guide the planning, evaluation, and supervision of trading and clearance and settlement systems that include an information technology component. He explains how the processes and functions of a securities market can be performed in a variety of ways, using both manual and information technology approaches. Highly sophisticated information technology systems are not always necessary or desirable, but the well-planned use of information technology can improve a security market's efficiency, fairness, and stability. Clarity of objectives, good planning, and a clear grasp of operational implications are important in effectively evaluating proposals for developingsecurities markets with an information technology component.

50|$|AOP {{attempts}} {{to solve this}} problem by allowing the programmer to express cross-cutting concerns in stand-alone modules called aspects. Aspects can contain advice (code joined to specified points in the program) and inter-type declarations (structural members added to other classes). For example, a security module can include advice that performs a security check before accessing a bank account. The pointcut defines the times (join points) when one can access a bank account, and the code in the advice body defines how the security check is implemented. That way, both the check and the places can be maintained in one place. Further, a good pointcut can anticipate later program changes, so if another developer creates a new method to access the <b>bank</b> account, the <b>advice</b> will apply to the new method when it executes.|$|R

This has caused financial institutions to reduce their branch business hours and to merge smaller branches into larger ones. Conversely, they converted some into mini-branches with only ATMs for cash withdrawal and depositing; computer terminals for online banking and cheque depositing machines. Some mini-branches may have one or no human staff with only telephone support.|$|R

40|$|With {{three-quarters of}} its {{population}} living in cities, Latin America and the Caribbean is now essentially an urban region. Greater urbanization is usually associated {{with a number of}} benefits, such as higher income, greater access to services, and a lower poverty incidence, and Latin America is no exception: the urban poverty incidence (28 percent) is half the rural rate, and extreme poverty (12 percent) is a third of the rate in rural areas. Despite this relatively low poverty incidence, the absolute number of poor people is high: 60 percent of the poor (113 million people) and half the extreme poor (46 million people) in the region live in urban areas (table 1. 1). Demographic trends suggest that the urbanization of poverty will continue: if poverty rates remain unchanged, by 2015 two-thirds of the poor in Latin America and the Caribbean will be living in cities. This trend is in line with Ravallion’s finding (2000) that the poor urbanize faster than the population as a whole in developing countries.
