5|$|The New Zealand mud snail , once {{endemic to}} New Zealand, has spread widely {{and has become}} naturalised and an {{invasive}} species in many areas including Australia, Tasmania, Asia (Japan, in the Garmat Ali River in Iraq since 2008), Europe (since 1859 in England), and North America (U.S. and Canada: Thunder Bay in Ontario since 2001, British Columbia since July 2007), most likely inadvertently during human activity. It can reach concentrations greater than 500,000 per m², endangering the food chain by outcompeting native snails and water insects for food, leading to sharp declines in native populations. There is evidence North American fishes are unable to digest the tiny <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> shells of the mud snail, and that their presence may result in poor growth outcomes for rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in L.A. <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> to imagine elsewhere back then.|$|E

25|$|Baryons (protons and neutrons) make up {{ordinary}} {{stars and}} planets. However, baryonic matter also encompasses less common black holes, neutron stars, faint old white dwarfs and brown dwarfs, collectively known as massive compact halo objects (MACHOs). This ordinary, <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> to see, matter could explain dark matter.|$|E

25|$|HMS Recruit was an 18-gun Cruizer class brig-sloop of the Royal Navy, {{launched}} in 1806 at Sandwich, Kent. She {{is best known}} for an act of pique by Cmdr. Warwick Lake, who marooned a seaman, and for an inconclusive <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> fought ship action under Cmdr. Charles John Napier against the French corvette Diligente. She captured a number of American vessels as prizes during the War of 1812 before being laid up in 1815 and sold for breaking up in 1822.|$|E
25|$|During the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858, Ralston brought {{another group}} of prospectors back {{to the site of}} his first discovery. The placer gold in the area soon played out, <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> rock {{deposits}} of gold were found in the mountains to the west. Some of the miners abandoned their search for gold and returned to farm the rich bottom land along Ralston Creek and Clear Creek. They found an eager market for their crops among other gold seekers. The Territory of Colorado was formed on February 28, 1861, and the farms in the valley expanded to feed the growing population of the region.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{difference}} between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca tar sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.|$|E

[...] Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "most surprising about Madonna's impeccably choreographed, frequently fantastic show was her willingness to show fans the flip side.

500|$|Having {{established}} himself as the premier defensive backcourt player, Bowen's effective, <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> nosed style of play came under discussion. In particular, rival guards Vince Carter and Steve Francis accused him of encroaching into their landing space during their jumpshot. Inside Hoops columnist M.J. Darnell commented: [...] "They're whining because Bruce Bowen has frustrated, upset, hurt or angered them in some way.... He just plays tough, physical defense, does not play with any intent to injure, but isn't afraid to get in someone's grill". Bowen's defensive style failed to help this Spurs squad repeat in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, as the team was eventually defeated 4–2 by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semi-Finals.|$|E

500|$|The BBC {{described}} Whyte's {{music as}} [...] "a little difficult to handle" [...] {{but that the}} album [...] "shows {{just the right amount}} of restraint to prevent total disarray. Even if the album weren't half as much fun as it is, that feat would be worthy of celebration in itself." [...] Exclaim! noted that [...] "songs like [...] "Hover Traps," [...] "Death Mountain" [...] and [...] "All Nite" [...] are, at their core, extremely primitive. But it's in the way that Rustie builds, deconstructs and sequences his songs that allows Glass Swords to work its way into your psyche" [...] and that [...] "after a couple of listens, one may come to the conclusion that Rustie might just be a one-trick-pony.

500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us." [...] Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won but said the victory was not special: [...] "It's just one more. I had a few before this, I'm very happy to win. It's important for the fans, for the club and especially for the players." [...] Striker Eiður Guðjohnsen said Chelsea's victory was down to their hard work ethic: [...] "It was a very intense and even game {{and it was hard}} to break them down, <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> work pays off in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{controls}} were well received. Manny LaMancha of GamePro {{concluded that the}} {{controls were}} easy to pick up, <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> to master. Official Xbox Magazine praised the game's [...] "solid control" [...] and [...] "innovative boost system". Michael Laffery of GameZone said that the interface was [...] "simple to use" [...] and that the game requires no learning curve. Tony Guidi of TeamXbox noted that the [...] "simplistic" [...] controls allowed the game to be played by anyone and that due to the different boosting and sliding techniques, [...] "mastering the control will separate the great racers from the newbs." [...] Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that while the powerslide system [...] "can give you a serious advantage in the race ... is also very difficult to pull off, requiring flawless timing." [...] Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report said that the karts [...] "control pretty nicely, but {{can be hard to}} handle consistently at top speed," [...] and added that power sliding was [...] "easy to do".|$|E

500|$|On August 26, 2014, Opeth {{released}} its eleventh studio album, titled Pale Communion. Åkerfeldt {{began working on}} new material {{as far back as}} August 2012. In January 2014 he stated, [...] "We've been looking at [...] Rockfield Studios in Wales where Queen recorded [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", but we haven't made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There's a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past." [...] Despite fearing that the band's new musical direction would split Opeth's fanbase, when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than Heritage, Åkerfeldt said, [...] "Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs." [...] Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include string instrumentation, something that he became interested in doing when working on Storm Corrosion. The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating Heritage which resulted in closer relationships between them.|$|E
500|$|On July 5, 2006, Robert Sorich, formally, {{director}} of the Mayor's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and, informally, Daley's patronage chief, and Timothy McCarthy, Sorich's aide, were each convicted on two counts of mail fraud connected to rigging blue-collar city jobs and promotions. Sorich's best friend, former Streets and Sanitation official Patrick Slattery was convicted of one count of mail fraud. A former Streets and Sanitation managing deputy commissioner {{was found guilty of}} lying to federal agents about political hiring. Sorich, McCarthy and Slattery lived in the Bridgeport neighborhood in 11th Ward, the Daley family's home neighborhood and ward. [...] "I've never known them to be anything <b>but</b> <b>hard</b> working, and I feel for them at this difficult time," [...] Daley said. [...] "It is fair criticism to say I should have exercised greater oversight to ensure that every worker the city hired, regardless of who recommended them, was qualified and that proper procedures were always followed," [...] Daley admitted a few days later. Weeks later, David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant whose clients included Daley, defended patronage in an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
