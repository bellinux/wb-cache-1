40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} physicomechanical {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> containing high volume of fly ash (FA) as partial replacement of cement in presence of copolymer latexes. Portland cement (PC) was partially replaced with 0, 10, 20, 30 50, and 60 % FA. Copolymer latexes were used based on 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate (2 -HEA) and 2 -hydroxymethylacrylate (2 -HEMA). Testing included workability, setting time, absorption, chemically combined water content, compressive strength, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The addition <b>of</b> FA to <b>mortar</b> as replacement <b>of</b> PC affected the physicomechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>mortar.</b> As the content of FA in the concrete increased, the setting times (initial and final) were elongated. The results obtained at 28 days of curing indicate that the maximum properties <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> occur at around 30 % FA. Beyond 30 % FA the properties <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> reduce and at 60 % FA the properties <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> are lower than those <b>of</b> the reference <b>mortar</b> without FA. However, the addition of polymer latexes into mortar containing FA improved most of the physicomechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> at all curing times. Compressive strength, combined water, and workability <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> containing FA premixed with latexes are higher than those <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> containing FA without latexes...|$|R

40|$|Fine {{recycled}} concrete aggregates (FRCA) {{also called}} recycled sand, having particle sizes smaller than 5 mm, are essentially composed <b>of</b> <b>mortar</b> and hardened cement paste. Therefore they induce a large water demand {{which makes them}} hard to recycle into mortar and concrete. In this paper, the properties <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> containing FRCA have been studied, including fresh properties, mechanical properties and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) microstructure. The influence of saturation state of FRCA (dried or saturated) on the properties <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> <b>of</b> identical compositions has first been studied. The {{results showed that the}} slump <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> containing dried FRCA is always larger than that <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> containing saturated FRCA. Indeed, in the case of dried FRCA, the theoretical amount of absorbed water is added at the beginning of mixing leading to a temporary increase of the initial efficient W/C ratio and volume of paste, leading to a better workability before its absorption into FRCA. On the contrary, the absorbed water in saturated FRCA is not readily available and thus cannot contribute to increase the initial efficient W/C ratio. Moreover, the compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> containing dried FRCA is always larger than that <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> made with saturated FRCA, which is attributed to a thinner interfacial transition zone improving its mechanical properties. The influence of the fraction of recycled sand and of the granular class of recycled sand on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> has then been studied with saturated FRCA. The compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> decreases quasi linearly as the replacement percentage of recycled sand increases. Moreover, it is shown that the finer fraction of recycled sand (0 / 0. 63 mm) has the worse effect on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>mortars.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{available}} commercial chemical admixtures namely ASTM Types A, C, D, E, F and AEAs on the electrical conductivity <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> was investigated using modified electrical technique. Interpretation of the electrical conductivity (reciprocal <b>of</b> resistivity) <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> was combined with results from calculating Na + and K + ion {{concentrations in the}} pore solution <b>of</b> <b>mortars,</b> measuring non-evaporable water content, gravimetric water porosity as well as conductivity of chemical admixtures. The water to cement ratios used were 0. 485 and 0. 35 with a sand to cement ratio fixed to 2. 75. The dosage of chemical admixtures varied from low, medium and high {{in accordance with the}} indication by manufacturers. The results showed that the different types of chemical admixtures exhibited different effects on the electrical conductivity <b>of</b> <b>mortars.</b> In the high water to cement ratio condition, the conductivity values <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> with added Types A, D and F chemical admixtures were raised due to alteration of the pore solution chemistry, severe set retardation and increase in porosity. The high conductivity <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> with Type C chemical admixtures was due to the introduction of a large amount of strong electrolyte Ca(NO 2) 2 to the pore solution which overwhelmed its accelerating hydration rate. On the contrary, the high degree <b>of</b> hydration <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> with added Type E chemical admixtures offset their high alkali concentration in the pore solution. In the low water to cement ratio condition, the presence of types A, D, E and F chemical admixtures decreased the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> which was attributed to deflocculation, improving the microstructure and reducing porosity. Appropriate addition of AEAs reduced the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>mortars</b> in low and high water to cement ratios owing to the entrained micro-air bubbles in mortars separating the paths of conductivit...|$|R
