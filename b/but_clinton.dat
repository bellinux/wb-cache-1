5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E
25|$|Clinton had {{originally}} been in the lead, until Perot reentered, tightening the race significantly. Nearing election day, polls suggested that the race was a dead-heat, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> pulled out on top, defeating Bush in a 43% to 38% popular vote margin. Perot won 19% of the popular vote, {{one of the highest}} totals for a third party candidate in U.S. history, drawing equally from both major candidates, according to exit polls. Bush received 168 electoral votes to Clinton's 370.|$|E
25|$|Setting up {{a secure}} desktop {{computer}} {{in her office}} was suggested, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> was unfamiliar with their use and opted {{for the convenience of}} her BlackBerry, not the State Department, government protocol of a secured desktop computer. Efforts to find a secure solution were abandoned by Clinton, and she was warned by State Department security personnel about the vulnerability of an unsecured BlackBerry to hacking. She affirmed her knowledge of the danger, and was reportedly told that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security had obtained intelligence about her vulnerability while she was on a trip to Asia, but continued to use her BlackBerry outside her office.|$|E

25|$|Born {{the second}} son of Francis Clinton, 6th Earl of Lincoln and Susan Clinton (née Penninston), Clinton joined the Royal Navy in 1708 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Clinton enjoyed the {{patronage}} of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, {{who was his}} sister-in-law's brother, and, having been promoted to captain on 16 June 1716, he was given command of the fifth-rate HMS Speedwell. He transferred to the command of the fourth-rate HMS Monck in 1720 and served in the Baltic Sea under Admiral Sir John Norris: the ship was lost during the return journey to England <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> was acquitted at the subsequent court-martial. He was given command of the fourth-rate HMS Nottingham in 1721 and sailed to the Baltic Sea to carry out patrols before returning home again in 1722.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton {{finished}} a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During {{the campaign for}} the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls. Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly {{in the polls and}} coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him [...] "The Comeback Kid" [...] for earning a firm second-place finish.|$|E
500|$|September 1780 {{brought a}} new shock to Washington. [...] British Major John André had been arrested outside New York, and papers he carried exposed a {{conspiracy}} between the British and General Benedict Arnold. [...] Washington respected Arnold for his military skills, and had, after Arnold's severe injuries in the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777, given him the military command of Philadelphia. [...] During his administration there, Arnold had made many political enemies, and in 1779 he began secret negotiations with General Clinton (mediated in part by André) that culminated in a plot to surrender West Point, a command Arnold requested and Washington gave him in July 1780. [...] Arnold was alerted to André's arrest and fled to the British lines shortly before Washington's arrival at West Point for a meeting. [...] In negotiations with Clinton, Washington offered to exchange André for Arnold, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> refused. [...] André was hanged as a spy, and Arnold became a brigadier general in the British Army. [...] Washington organized an attempt to kidnap Arnold from New York City; it was frustrated when Arnold was sent on a raiding expedition to Virginia.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{likelihood}} of Bernie Sanders supporters voting for Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton. Building from a unique time-series dataset of the three candidates' Twitter followers, which we make public here, we first study the proportion of Sanders followers who simultaneously follow Trump (<b>but</b> not <b>Clinton)</b> and how this evolves over time. Then we train a convolutional neural network to classify the gender of Sanders followers, and study whether {{men are more likely}} to jump ship for Trump than women. Our study shows that between March and May an increasing proportion of Sanders followers are following Trump (<b>but</b> not <b>Clinton).</b> The proportion of Sanders followers who follow <b>Clinton</b> <b>but</b> not Trump has actually decreased. Equally important, our study suggests that the jumping ship behavior will be affected by gender and that men are more likely to switch to Trump than women.

2500|$|Callis was an elector from Virginia in Washington's {{unanimous}} {{election to}} a second term in 1793. [...] Until 1800, each elector had two votes. [...] Callis voted {{with all the other}} electors unanimously using one vote for Washington. [...] His second vote went for Republican George Clinton of New York as did the other electors from Virginia. [...] Washington won president with 132 votes, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> came in third with 50 votes behind Federalist John Adams (77 votes), who became vice president. George Clinton later became Governor of New York (1777) and ultimately become VP (1805–1812) under both Jefferson and Madison.|$|E
2500|$|Although Brown {{continued}} to campaign {{in a number}} of states, he won no further primaries. Although overwhelmingly outspent, Brown won upset victories in seven states and his [...] "votes won to the money raised ratio" [...] was by far the best of any candidate in the race. He still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win {{in his home state of}} California would deprive Clinton of sufficient support to win the Democratic nomination, possibly bringing about a brokered convention. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in this final primary by a margin of 48% to 41%. Although Brown did not win the nomination, he was able to boast of one accomplishment: at the following month's Democratic National Convention, he received the votes of 596 delegates on the first ballot, more than any other candidate <b>but</b> <b>Clinton.</b> He spoke at the convention, and to the national viewing audience, yet without endorsing Clinton, through the device of seconding his own nomination. There was animosity between the Brown and Clinton campaigns, and Brown was the first political figure to criticize Bill Clinton over what became the Whitewater controversy.|$|E
5000|$|Tryon {{had long}} {{advocated}} engaging in attacks on civilian targets, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> turned down Tryon's proposals. In July 1779, Tryon commanded {{a series of}} raids on the Connecticut coast, attacking New Haven, Fairfield, and Norwalk, burning and plundering most of Fairfield and Norwalk. Tryon's raids were intended to draw American forces away from the defence of the Hudson valley. In spite of pressure from Governor Jonathan Trumbull, George Washington did not move his troops. Americans condemned him for making war on [...] "women and children", and the British commander Clinton was also indignant about Tryon disobeying his orders. Tryon found approval of his conduct from Lord George Germain, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> refused to give Tryon any further significant commands.|$|E

50|$|Since 1995, led by Republicans in Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate {{have moved}} {{several times to}} pass {{measures}} banning the procedure. Congress passed two such measures by wide margins during Bill Clinton's presidency, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> vetoed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 {{on the grounds that}} they did not include health exceptions.

5000|$|Liberal lawyers wanted Harvard Law {{professor}} and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{and his aides}} next considered several candidates as [...] "outside-the-box" [...] choices.

Carter of Yale and Michael Sandel of Harvard would have fit the bill, <b>but</b> <b>Clinton</b> then hit upon what he considered to be a [...] "sexy" [...] idea: the nomination of his wife, Hillary Clinton. However, there was a huge problem associated with such a selection. George Stephanopoulos, a Clinton aide at the time, has written that the idea was dropped because the president's [...] "choice had to be ratified by the Senate, where Republicans hadn't forgotten the rejection of Robert Bork, and Democrats were reeling from their recent encounters with Zoe Baird, Kimba Wood, and Lani Guinier. Sexy was good, but safe was better. We simply couldn't afford another failed nomination." [...] Stephanopoulos quotes Clinton himself saying, [...] "We don't need another gang-that-couldn't-shoot-straight story." ...|$|E
