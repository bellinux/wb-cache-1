5|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940.

5|$|As the Super League war <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1990s, the Roosters {{recruited}} high-profile coach Phil Gould {{and star}} five-eighth Brad Fittler, {{both from the}} Penrith Panthers. This helped to quickly send the Roosters back to {{the upper end of}} the ladder. Fittler's presence proved invaluable; during his reign, the Roosters competed in four grand finals in five years. In 2002, the club captured its 12th premiership — the first in 27 years — defeating minor premiers the New Zealand Warriors 30–8 in the 2002 NRL grand final.|$|E
5|$|Images of Sophiatown were {{initially}} <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> literature by {{a generation of}} South African writers: Can Themba, Bloke Modisane, Es'kia Mphahlele, Arthur Maimane, Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Casey Motsisi and Lewis Nkosi who all lived in Sophiatown at various stages during the 1950s. They all shared certain elements of a common experience: education at St Peter's School and Fort Hare University, living in Sophiatown, working for Drum magazine, exile, banning under the Suppression of Communism Act and for many the writing of an autobiography.|$|E

5|$|The castle motte was <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> several stages, {{originally}} being {{lower in}} height than today, before being built {{up during the}} medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway steps up to the top of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{probability}} of a juvenile surviving its first year is 34%, with 69% of adults surviving {{from one year to}} the next. Mortality in young males is greater than that of young females and the typical lifespan is four years. This species {{is now one of the}} most common birds of prey in Europe, although the population crashed after the Second World War. Organochlorine insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the bird population, and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and incapacitate others; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells which broke during incubation. However, its population recovered after the chemicals were banned, and it is now relatively common, classified as being of Least Concern by BirdLife International.|$|E
5|$|The {{street was}} built on fields {{surrounding}} Clarendon House on Piccadilly, which were developed by Sir Thomas Bond. It was <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the 1720s, {{and by the end}} of the 18th century was a popular place for the upper-class residents of Mayfair to socialise. Prestigious and expensive shops were established along the street, but it declined as a centre of social activity in the 19th century, although it held its reputation as a fashionable place for retail, and is home to the auction houses Sotheby's and Bonhams (formerly Phillips) and the department stores Fenwick and Tiffany's. It is one of the most expensive and sought after strips of real estate in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Windows on {{the east}} façade are {{rectangular}} with eight windows at ground floor and five at first floor, all with gothic frames. On the south façade, the ground floor windows are taller with a number being two- and three-lighted and stone framed. A chamfered two-storey bay is located slightly {{to the right of}} centre. Windows on the first floor are simpler and less tall. The 1819 works also included the demolition and replacement of the north and west ranges and substantial rebuilding of the south range. The north range is <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> red and grey brick from the stone walls of the demolished range. The west range is surmounted by a 17th-century clock turret relocated from the south range when that was rebuilt. The bell is dated 1647.|$|E
5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{large degree}} of {{variation}} in the size and exact shape of the castles built in England and Wales after the invasion. One popular form of castle was the motte and bailey, in which earth would be piled up into a mound (called a motte) to support a wooden tower, and a wider enclosed area built alongside it (called a bailey); Stafford Castle is a typical example of a post-invasion motte castle. Another widespread design was the ringwork in which earth would be <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a circular or oval shape and topped with a wooden rampart; Folkestone Castle {{is a good example}} of a Norman ringwork, in this case built on top of a hill although most post-invasion castles were usually sited on lower ground. Around 80% of Norman castles in this period followed the motte-and-bailey pattern, but ringworks were particularly popular in certain areas, such as south-west England and south Wales. One theory put forward to explain this variation is that ringworks were easier to build in these shallow-soil areas than the larger mottes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, No.1 SFTS came {{under the control of}} Southern Area Command, {{headquartered}} in Melbourne. The school's complement of 52 aircraft included Wapitis, Cadets, Avro Ansons, Hawker Demons, and a deHavilland Tiger Moth. Group Captain John McCauley served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander Roy King, who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October. As of July, No.1 SFTS was operating more than 100 aircraft, including Gipsy Moths, deHavilland DH.89 Dragon Rapides, Douglas C-47 Dakotas, CAC Wirraways and Airspeed Oxfords, the last two being the mainstays. In August 1941, control of all training units in Victoria passed from Southern Area Command to the newly formed No.1 Training Group. By September, the school had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, including 300 cadets. It was organised into Intermediate Training Squadron, Advanced Training Squadron, Maintenance Wing, Armament School, and Signal School. Wing Commander Charles Read held command of No.1 SFTS from October 1943 until its disbandment on 15September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated. Among these were Nicky Barr, who became one of Australia's leading fighter aces in North Africa, and Bill Newton, awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe. Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the UK early in 1944 prior to the invasion of Normandy, but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30June numbered 3,000 Australians.|$|E
5|$|No.1 EFTS {{relocated}} to Tamworth, New South Wales, during 17–28May 1944, reportedly {{to allow for}} the expansion of civil aviation at Parafield. Training units in New South Wales came under the control of No.2 (Training) Group. On 10September, a student was killed when his Tiger Moth crashed south of Tamworth aerodrome. All flying training at No.1 EFTS came to an end on 15September, by which time a total of 1,991 students had passed through the school. Pilots still undergoing instruction were posted to No.8 Elementary Flying School at Narrendera, New South Wales, and No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla, Victoria. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe.

No.1 EFTS was officially disbanded on 12December 1944. Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Tamworth was formed the same day, utilising some of No.1 EFTS's staff. It was one of many CMUs that the RAAF raised for the storage and upkeep of surplus aircraft prior to their disposal after the war. CMU Tamworth was disbanded on 5July 1947.|$|E
