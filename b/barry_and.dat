5|$|In June 1942, {{seven months}} after the United States had entered World War II, Pan Royal made two roundtrips in transatlantic convoys between Boston and the United Kingdom via Halifax. While in the UK during her second visit, the ship had called at Belfast Lough, <b>Barry,</b> <b>and</b> Milford Haven before {{returning}} to New York in October. In mid November, Pan Royal sailed from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Casablanca, and returned in mid-January 1943.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the time}} of the Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland the major townships in the area were those now known as Timoleague, Lislee, Barryroe and Dunworly. Among the Norman settlers were the De <b>Barrys</b> <b>and</b> the Hodnetts; the former built a castle at Timoleague, and the latter settled in Lislee. The <b>Barrys</b> flourished <b>and</b> gave their name to Barryroe, Rathbarry, etc., whereas the Hodnetts “degenerated into mere Irish”, one branch changing their name to MacSeafraidh (son of Geoffrey), subsequently anglicised to MacSherry or McSharry. Although <b>Barrys</b> <b>and</b> Hodnetts still live in the district, there are no MacSherrys.|$|R

When an enraged and jealous Barry, as Flash, makes an attempt on Eddie, Oliver tries to stop <b>Barry,</b> <b>and</b> the two engage in a fight. Oliver manages to wrangle Barry long enough for Harrison Wells and Joe to use colored strobe light to reset Barry's emotional state. Afterward, <b>Barry</b> <b>and</b> Oliver capture Bivolo and place him in the prison at S.T.A.R. Labs. Due to the incident, Eddie gets the grounds to form a police task force to arrest the Flash. Barry confirms Oliver's belief that the former has a lot to learn. Oliver advises him to stay away from Iris West, with whom Barry is in love, because men with secret identities never get the girl. Oliver asks Team Flash to keep his alter ego a secret. A new metahuman able to manipulate fire appears in Central City.|$|E

2500|$|Barry Trotter is {{a series}} of Harry Potter parodies written by Michael Gerber and {{published}} in the UK in a small hardback format uniform to the new edition of Bored of the Rings. The series to date comprises <b>Barry</b> Trotter <b>and</b> the Shameless Parody (<b>Barry</b> Trotter <b>and</b> the Unauthorized Parody in the United States), <b>Barry</b> Trotter <b>and</b> the Unnecessary Sequel <b>and</b> <b>Barry</b> Trotter <b>and</b> the Dead Horse (<b>Barry</b> Trotter <b>and</b> the Happy Horse in the United States). The narrative features the adventures of [...] "Barry Trotter", [...] "Lon Measly", and [...] "Ermine Cringer" [...] who attend the [...] "Hogwash School for Wizardry and Witchcrap". It features a strong postmodern narrative, as the book concerns their attempts to prevent the making of a movie, but the entire story is revealed to have been a movie itself, which in turn is shown to be a novel being written by Barry Trotter.|$|R

5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T. <b>Barry,</b> <b>and</b> Jesse Bledsoe. However, Holley's New England Unitarian beliefs were too liberal for the tastes of many in Kentucky. Many called Holley an infidel and charged {{that he was a}} drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E
5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, <b>Barry,</b> <b>and</b> the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on the island. Flat Holm was re-armed with four 4.5-inch guns and associated searchlights for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two 40mm Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) Mk II radar station was also placed in {{the centre of the}} island. The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, <b>Barry,</b> <b>and</b> Flat Holm. These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had no military use since. Flat Holm's helipad still remains, however, at the centre of the island.|$|E

5|$|Carrick has {{represented}} England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 {{and has since}} gained 34 caps but is yet to score an international goal. Carrick has often been overlooked during his England career, with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes, Gareth <b>Barry</b> <b>and</b> (for a brief time) Scott Parker preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012–13 season, when Carrick {{established himself as a}} regular.

5|$|In June 1838 <b>Barry</b> <b>and</b> colleagues {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} Britain to locate a supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing Magnesian Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London {{it proved to be}} problematic, with the first signs of deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called <b>Barry</b> <b>and</b> the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

Felicity learns of Oliver's paternity and feels betrayed because Oliver is still willing to keep secrets from her, so she ends their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Several storms made {{landfall}} {{or directly}} affected land. Hurricanes Dean and Felix made landfall at Category5 intensity, causing severe damage {{in parts of}} Mexico and Central America, respectively. Both storm names, as well as Noel, {{the name of a}} hurricane that affected the Caribbean, were retired from the naming list of Atlantic hurricanes. The United States was affected by five cyclones, although the storms were generally weak; three tropical depressions and only two tropical storms, <b>Barry</b> <b>and</b> Gabrielle, and one hurricane, Humberto, made landfall in the country. Elsewhere, three storms directly affected Canada, although none severely. The combined storms killed at least 423people and caused about $3billion (2007USD, $ USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} {{is the third}} theatre on the site following destructive fires in 1808 and 1857. The façade, foyer and auditorium were designed by Edward <b>Barry,</b> <b>and</b> date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive £178 million reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium is a Grade 1 listed building. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, previously {{a part of the}} old Covent Garden Market, created a large new public gathering place. In 1779 the pavement outside the playhouse was the scene of the murder of Martha Ray, mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, by her admirer the Rev. James Hackman.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{impact was}} minimal; {{although}} 15tropical cyclones developed, most were weak or remained at sea. Tropical Storm Andrea killed four people after making landfall in Florida and {{moving up the}} East Coast of the United States. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal moved through the Leeward Islands, causing one fatality, but minimal damage overall. Tropical storms Dorian and Erin and Hurricane Humberto brought only squally weather to the Cape Verde Islands. Mexico, where Hurricane Ingrid, Tropical Depression Eight, and tropical storms <b>Barry</b> <b>and</b> Fernand all made landfall, was the hardest hit; Ingrid alone caused at least 32deaths and $1.5billion (2013USD) in damage. In early October, Karen brought showers and gusty winds to the central Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1960s the piers at Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon, Portishead and Minehead {{were served}} by the paddle steamers of P and A Campbell who ran regular {{services}} to <b>Barry</b> <b>and</b> Cardiff as well as Ilfracombe and Lundy Island. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea was used for commercial goods, {{one of the reasons}} for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was to provide a link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea is the shortest pier in the UK. In the 1970s the Royal Portbury Dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the Port of Bristol.|$|E
