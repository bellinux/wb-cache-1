5000|$|The apex is a {{triangular}} extruded profile that mates against the bead. The apex provides a cushion between the rigid bead and the flexible inner liner and <b>body</b> <b>ply</b> assembly. Alternatively called [...] "filler" [...] (as in the diagram above).|$|E
50|$|The <b>body</b> <b>ply</b> is a {{calendered}} sheet consisting of one layer of rubber, one layer of reinforcing fabric, {{and a second}} layer of rubber. The earliest textile used was cotton; later materials include rayon, nylon, polyester, and Kevlar. Passenger tires typically {{have one or two}} body plies. Body plies give the tire structure strength. Truck tires, off-road tires, and aircraft tires have progressively more plies. The fabric cords are highly flexible but relatively inelastic.|$|E
5000|$|Radial tire {{construction}} utilizes <b>body</b> <b>ply</b> cords {{extending from the}} beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and {{in the context of}} off-roading, decreased [...] "self-cleaning" [...] ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|Building is {{the process}} of {{assembling}} all the components onto a tire building drum. Tire-building machines (TBM) can be manually operated or fully automatic. Typical TBM operations include the first-stage operation, where inner liner, <b>body</b> <b>plies,</b> and sidewalls are wrapped around the drum, the beads are placed, and the assembly turned up over the bead. In the second stage operation, the carcass of the tire is inflated, then the belt package and tread are applied.|$|R
50|$|The {{calender}} {{is a set}} {{of multiple}} large-diameter rolls that squeeze rubber compound into a thin sheet, usually of the order of 2 metres wide. Fabric calenders produce an upper and lower rubber sheet with a layer of fabric in between. Steel calenders do so with steel cords. Calenders are used to produce <b>body</b> <b>plies</b> and belts. A creel room is a facility that houses hundreds of fabric or wire spools that are fed into the calender. Calenders utilize downstream equipment for shearing and splicing calendered components.|$|R
50|$|All {{components}} require splicing. Inner liner and <b>body</b> <b>plies</b> are spliced with a square-ended overlap. Tread and sidewall {{are joined}} with a skived splice, where the joining ends are bevel-cut. Belts are spliced {{end to end}} with no overlap. Splices that are too heavy or non-symmetrical will generate defects in force variation, balance, or bulge parameters. Splices that are too light or open can lead to visual defects {{and in some cases}} tire failure. The final product of the TBM process is called a green tire, where green refers to the uncured state.|$|R
50|$|Bias tire (or cross ply) {{construction}} utilizes <b>body</b> <b>ply</b> cords {{that extend}} diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles {{in the range}} of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased rolling resistance and less control and traction at higher speeds. This outdated technology is still made in limited quantities to supply collector vehicles. It is possible to fit older cars with modern tires if historical authenticity is not paramount.|$|E
50|$|Tires {{are complex}} {{composite}} structures made {{of many different}} components that are assembled on a drum and cured in a mold. As a result, there are many conditions that result in RFV. These include variations in: tread extrusion thickness and symmetry, tread splice, <b>body</b> <b>ply</b> splices, inner liner splice, bead symmetry, turn-up symmetry, building drum alignment, transfer ring alignment, curing press bead seating, shaping bladder alignment and control, mold runout, and mold alignment. All of these factors can lead to variations in the material distribution and thickness that are modelled as spring length. The various tire components also are made from different materials, each of which exhibit variation in their elastic properties. These variations are influenced by rubber viscoelastic properties, mixing dispersion and uniformity, and cure heat history, among other things.|$|E
50|$|After so {{many changes}} in the prior year, it is no {{surprise}} that there were few changes for 1970. Most US makes including Chrysler adopted bias belted tires. They were a short-lived hybrid that combined familiar soft riding bias <b>body</b> <b>plies</b> with tread stabilizing belts used in European style radial tires. One well known brand name at the time was Goodyearâ€™s Polyglas. All 1970 Chryslers featured standard bias belted tires, with Town & Country wagons wearing size J78-15. J identified the second largest size available in load capacity, 78 indicated a cross-section height-to-width, or aspect ratio of 78%, and 15 being the nominal rim diameter in inches, as before.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} formed by Roger Blockley {{who had worked for}} the Triumph Car Company. The car was built on the chassis of a Triumph Herald using an angle iron {{framework}} which supported aluminium over marine <b>ply</b> <b>body</b> tub panels, aluminuim bonnet, engine bay sides and 'fuel tank', with fibreglass wings and doors. The radiator grille was frequently sourced from an MG Magnette ZA/ZB. From 1975 a version was made to fit the Triumph Spitfire chassis and running gear, but only 2 of this variant were ever produced.|$|R
