40|$|The {{roles of}} Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) Technology in {{fuelwood}} supply and offsetting CO 2 {{emissions in the}} Tanzania and most African countries remain poorly understood. This study was carried in Rungwe District, Mbeya region in Tanzania, to determine trends, extent and drivers of adoption of SRC; identify various sources of household energy and assess the contribution of SRC to the total household fuelwood needs, and trees and shrub species used as sources of fuelwood. Data were collected using reconnaissance, field and social surveys and was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results revealed that, 97. 5 % of local community adopted the SRC technology since 1960 s. Eucalyptus spp. are mostly planted in woodlots and field boundaries while Persea americana and Leucaena leucocephala are intercropped in farmlands. The survey indicated that out of 176 tons of fuelwood used annually, 73 % comes from SRC technology, 25 % from non-SRC technology, and only 2 % is purchased to supplement household fuelwood shortage. Local communities depend heavily on biomass energy from woodlots and farmlands where tree species like Eucalyptus spp. {{plays a key role}} in meeting the energy demand. This study demonstrates that SRC technologies like woodlots, <b>boundary</b> <b>planting,</b> and intercropping in farmland hold high promise to meet the household energy demand. If promoted and backed with strong policies and supportive land tenure, these technologies may reduce the harvesting pressure on native forests for energy demand and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation...|$|E

Data were collected through community meeting, individual interviews and direct field observation. The common agroforestry systems in the region are scatter trees on farm land, followed by wind breaks and <b>boundary</b> <b>planting.</b> The important trees in the study area are Acacia senegal 83 %, followed by Fadherbia albida 46 %, Ziziphus spina- christia 43 % and Balanites aegyptiaca 41 %. The most important field crops that cultivated in agroforestry system are groundnuts, millet, sorghum, sesame and roselle. The environmental benefits of trees in farm which was identified by the respondents include protection of farm against wind erosion, improvement of the soil properties, improvement of the micro-climate and providing a source for income which was indicated by the majority of respondents. Across all sites 93 % of respondents showed that gum Arabic have a significant contribution to their family income. The study recommended that a multi-purpose tree species such as Acacia senegal should be maintained for amelioration of soils fertility and increase crop productivity in the fragile ecosystems such as that of the study sites.

This study was conducted in order to examine the contribution of agroforestry products to total annual household incomes and poverty reduction in semi-arid areas of Misungwi district, Mwanza Tanzania. Research methodologies used included literature review, questionnaire surveys, discussion with key informants and personal observation. A sample of 127 households engaged in agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices was selected randomly from six villages for questionnaire survey. Data analysis involved preliminary PRA information analysis with the community right in the field, content analysis and SPSS computer program. Three well-being levels of households namely; rich, medium and poor were identified. Agroforestry participants were richer than non participants with extra income of Tshs 954 611 (760 US$) per year. The agroforestry technologies practiced in the area included woodlot (37. 7 %), <b>boundary</b> <b>planting</b> (4. 0 %), Ngitili (15. 2 %) and indigenous live fence (20. 8 %). Agroforestry products and benefits, mainly generated from woodlots included poles (80. 0 %), fuelwood (86. 0), timber (92. 0 %) and thatch grasses (32. 7 %). In comparison wood products from agroforestry practices contributed only 5. 5 % to total annual household incomes to agroforestry households while agriculture practices contributed about 51 % to both agroforestry and non-agroforestry participants. In the regression model, wood products was not statistically significant at p< 0. 05 but positively correlated to total annual household incomes while agriculture and livestock keeping were statistically significant at p< 0. 01. This study concludes that agroforestry practices in the district do not contribute much to the total annual household income because it is constrained by small amount of trees established and poor selling price. It is recommended that more extension services and support be provided to agroforestry participants and other ii farmers in the district to accelerate national poverty reduction and meeting Millenium Development Goals.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Eltemada, Boli and Umghoghai villages at Babanosa area in El-salam locality, South Kordofan State during 2012 and 2013. The objectives were to (1) identify and assess the most important agroforestry systems, (2) to investigate the main factors that affecting the sustainability of the systems, (3) to determine the important field crops that cultivated with trees and (4) to evaluate the effect of the agroforestry systems on the yield of the traditional field crops. For accomplishment of these study 80 questioners was designed and distributed in the selected villages. After the data collection data was analyzed by using descriptive statistic. The results showed that the most important agroforestry systems in the study area are parkland cropping system (58 %), <b>boundary</b> <b>planting</b> (26 %), wind-breaks (13 %) and alley cropping (3 %). The most important forest trees in the study area are Acacia senegal (32 %), Ziziphus spina- christia (28 %), Balanites aegeyptiaca (26 %), Sclerocary birrea and Guera senegalensis (3 %). The main field crops in the study area are groundnut (44 %), sorghum (35 %) and roselle (21 %). The results showed that yield of groundnut and sorghum is higher under agroforestry systems compared with the mono-cropping system. The results showed that the majority of respondents (70 %) prefer to cultivate field crops in agroforestry system, while (30 %) prefer to cultivate the field crops in a mono-cropping system. The cultivation methods used in the study area include shifting cultivation (52 %), mono-cropping (36 %) and intercropping (12 %). The majority of respondents (94 %) showed that trees improve soil fertility in their farm land. The benefits from trees in farm land include improvement of soil properties (36 %), protecting the farm land from wind erosion (28 %), improvement of micro-climate (24 %) and source of income which was indicated by (12 %) of the respondents. The study recommended that modern agroforestry system such as improved fallow system and alley cropping should be introduced in the study area and multi-purpose trees such as Acacia senegal, Fedherbia albida and Sclerocarya birrea that improve soil fertility and diversify farmers income should be maintained.

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} timber, {{fuelwood}} and other forest products has outstripped production {{in many areas}} of the semi-arid tropics, leading to deforestation and land degradation resulting from erosion and nutrient depletion. Agroforestry offers the potential to provide forest products, improve productivity and reduce soil erosion and environmental degradation. However, as previous reports have shown that competition between trees and crops for water in semi-arid areas adversely affects crop yields, attention has turned towards studies of the existing practice of <b>boundary</b> <b>planting,</b> where low tree planting densities and the associated benefits of land demarcation and soil stabilisation increase the viability of incorporating trees into crop land. The aim is to select and manage tree species in ways that limit their negative effect on crop yields and improve the overall value of the system. The present study was carried out at Machakos (1 ° 33 ' S, 37 ° 14 ' E, altitude 1660 m) in the Kenyan highlands, where the bi-modal annual rainfall of c. 740 mm is divided approximately equally between two rainy seasons (short rains, October-February, long rains, March July). The experiment was set up in April 1993 to examine the influence of tree/crop interactions on system productivity. Each 18 x 18 m plot, except for the sole crop plots, contained a central row of trees planted at 1 m spacing. Four overstorey agroforestry treatments were examined between March 1996 and March 1998; these included two indigenous species, Croton megalocarpus and Melia volkensii, and two exotic species from Central America, Senna spectabilis and Gliricidia sepium. Beans (Phaseolusulgaris) and maize (Zea mays) were grown during the short and long rains respectively. M. volkensii and S. Spectabilis exhibited similar leafing phenology patterns, losing almost all leaf cover during the long dry season (July-October) and flushing before the ensuing rains. During the short dry season, S. spectabilis lost few leaves, whilst M. volkensii lost some leaves before flushing prior to the onset of the long rains. M. volkensii lost a large proportion of its leaf cover during the 1997 / 98 short rains due to the unusually high soil moisture content. C. megalocarpus although predominantly evergreen, lost a large proportion of its leaves during dry periods, whereas leaf area increased rapidly under wetter conditions. G. sepium had one annual period of low leaf cover during the long dry season and did not regain full leaf cover until mid-way through the short rains. The three-dimensional model of canopy photosynthesis and transpiration, MAESTRA, was parameterised for C. megalocarpus and M. volkensii using existing models to describe the response of photosynthesis to light and temperature and stomatal responses to light and vapour pressure deficit. The photosynthesis model fitted the experimental data well, but stomatal conductance in C. megalocarpus, although showing responses to light and vapour pressure deficit, was not closely correlated with ambient environmental conditions. M. volkensii had higher leaf area than C. megalocarpus for most of the 18 month simulation period, comprising three rainy and three dry seasons; modelled assimilation for this period was 49 % greater in M. volkensii, while canopy water use efficiency and transpiration were respectively 35 and 11 % higher. These differences accounted for the more rapid growth rate and greater competition with adjacent crops associated with M. w 1 kenrii relative to C. megalocarpus. Above-ground woody biomass production was greatest in M. volkensii, followed by S. spectabilis, C. megalocarpus and G. sepium; production during the fourth and fifth years after planting ranged between 2. 8 and 4. 9 t ha-¹ yr¹. Crop production in the agroforestry treatments was always lower than in sole crops due to below-ground competition for water and, in seasons with higher water availability, shading by the trees. Of the agroforestry systems examined, seed production for beans was highest under M. volkensii and G. sepium, followed by C. megalocarpus and S. spectabilis. Grain production in maize was greatest under C. megalocarpus, followed by G. sepium, S. spectabils and M. volkensii. Mean annual aboveground biomass production including maize grain and stover, bean seed, woody biomass and tree leaves in the M. volkensii treatment exceeded that for the sole crop plots, even though rainfall during 1996 and 1997 was only 61 and 95 % of the long term average. Although the biomass production of leaves was not estimated for S. spectabilis and G. sepium, the results obtained suggested that biomass production was greater than that obtained under sole crop cropping. The inverse correlation between tree and crop yield suggests that the value of the tree products must exceed the associated crop losses if benefits are to be obtained from agroforestry. M. volkensii is valued in areas of Kenya where markets for its products exist and therefore shows great promise for extension in semi-arid areas; where necessary, pruning may be used to reduce competition with crops and increase the length of clear bole. C. megalocarpus is widely used as a shade tree in East Africa and seems well suited for this purpose as its impact on adjacent crops was least of all the tree species examined. S. spectabilis, although having straight unbranched stems, exhibited a level of competition with adjacent crops that would necessitate a high value for its timber products to warrant its adoption. The least suitable tree species of those examined was G. sepium, whose poor form and susceptibility to attack by fungal pathogens and insects severely undermined its potential value for use in agroforestry systems...|$|E

40|$|Different {{ethnic groups}} have evolved {{distinctive}} cultural models which guide {{their interactions with}} the environment, including their agroecosystems. Although {{it is probable that}} variations in the structures of homegardens among separate ethnic groups reflect differences in the cultural models of the farmers, empirical support for this assumption is limited. In this paper the modal horizontal structural patterns of the homegardens of 8 ethnic groups in Northeast Thailand and Vietnam are described. Six of these groups (5 speaking Tai languages and 1 speaking Vietnamese) live in close proximity to each other in separate villages in Northeast Thailand, and 2 of the groups (one Tai-speaking and one Vietnamese-speaking) live in different parts of Vietnam. Detailed information on the horizontal structure of homegardens was collected from samples of households belonging to each group. Although each ethnic group has a somewhat distinctive modal structure, the groups cluster into 2 different types. The Tai speaking Cao Lan, Kalaeng, Lao, Nyaw, and Yoy make up Type I while both of the Vietnamese groups, along with the Tai speaking Phu Thai, belong to Type II. Type I gardens have predominantly organic shapes, indeterminate <b>boundaries,</b> polycentric <b>planting</b> patterns, and multi-species composition within planting areas. Type II homegardens have geometric shapes, sharp <b>boundaries,</b> lineal <b>planting</b> patterns, and mono-species composition of planting areas. That the homegardens of most of the Tai ethnic groups share a relatively similar horizontal structural pattern that {{is quite different from the}} pattern shared by both of the Vietnamese groups suggests that the spatial layout of homegardens is strongly influenced by their different cultural models...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Eucalyptus globulus <b>planted</b> along field <b>boundaries</b> {{has come}} to {{dominate}} the central highland landscape of Ethiopia. Although evidence is scanty, there is a perception that this practice adversely affects crop productivity. An on-farm trial was conducted on Pellic Vertisol at Ginchi to determine the production potential of eucalypt boundaries and their effect on the productivity of adjacent crops of tef (Eragrostis tef) and wheat (Triticum sp.). The experiment comprised three stand ages, four field aspects and six distances from the tree-crop interface, using a split-split plot design with three replicates. Wood production rates ranged between 168 kg ha- 1 y- 1 (four years old) and 2901 kg ha- 1 y- 1 (twelve years). Thus eucalypt <b>boundaries</b> <b>planted</b> on a hectare of land would satisfy 50 to 75 % of the annual biomass energy requirement of a rural household of five persons. Significant depression of tef and wheat yields occurred over the first 12 m from the tree line: the reduction was 20 to 73 % for tef and 20 to 51 % for wheat, equivalent to yield losses of 4. 4 to 26 % and 4. 5 to 10 % per hectare respectively. Nevertheless, in financial terms, the tree component adequately compensated for crop yield reduction and even generated additional income. Therefore, eucalypt boundaries have great potential to satisfy the rising demand for wood, without requiring {{a major change in}} land use on the highland Vertisols. The greater availability of wood will reduce the demand for dung and crop residues for fuel, and thus may contribute to improved soil management on croplands while relieving the increasing pressure on indigenous forest and woodlands...|$|R

In the field of the. ne chemical and pharmaceutical industry, preparative supercritical fluid chromatography (Prep-SFC) and preparative high performance liquid chromatography (Prep-HPLC) are widely used chiral separation techniques. Prep-SFC is often named as a green alternative for Prep-HPLC without having a thorough assessment of the greenness. However, if metrics are used for process selection with respect to green chemistry, they mainly show three shortcomings: (1) a narrow system boundary approach is used; (2) energy requirements are barely taken into account and (3) if energy requirements are considered, there is a differentiation in mass and energy inputs. Taking into account these shortcomings, Prep-HPLC and Prep-SFC are now compared and evaluated for their integral resource consumption. The evaluation is performed on a specific enantiomeric separation using exergetic life cycle analysis within enlarging system boundaries alpha, beta and gamma. Within the a system boundary (process level), Prep-HPLC requires 26. 3 % more resources quantified in exergy than the Prep-SFC separation due to its inherent higher use of organic solvents. Within the b system <b>boundary</b> (<b>plant</b> level), Prep-HPLC requires 29. 1 % more resources quantified in exergy than Prep-SFC. However, the Cumulative Exergy Extracted from the Natural Environment (CEENE) to deliver all mass and energy flows to the a and b system boundary via the overall industrial metabolism shows that Prep-SFC requires 34. 3 % more resources than Prep-HPLC. The poor score of Prep-SFC in the g system boundary is attributed to the high CEENE value related to the production of liquid carbon dioxide and the use of electricity for heating and cooling. It can be concluded that for this case, the most sustainable process as for the integral resource consumption is Prep-HPLC, unlike the general perception that Prep-SFC outperforms Prep-HPLC...|$|R
5000|$|MDEA is less {{reactive}} towards CO2, but has an {{equilibrium loading}} capacity approaching 1 mole CO2 per mole amine. It also requires less energy to regenerate. To combine {{the advantages of}} MDEA and the smaller amines, MDEA is usually mixed with a catalytic promoter such as piperazine, PZ, or a fast reacting amine such as MEA to retain reactivity, but lower regeneration costs. Activated MDEA or aMDEA uses piperazine as a catalyst {{to increase the speed}} of the reaction with CO2. It has been commercially successful. Many tests have been conducted on the performance of MDEA/MEA or MDEA/Piperazine mixtures compared to single amines. CO2 production rates were higher than MEA for the same heat duty and total molar concentration when experiments were performed in the University of Regina pilot plant, which is a modeled after a natural gas plant. There were also insignificant trace amounts of degradation products detected. [...] However, when the same control variables and tests were conducted at the <b>Boundary</b> Dam <b>plant,</b> the CO2 production rate for the mixed solvent was lower than MEA. [...] This was a result of the reduction in the capacity of the solvent to absorb CO2 after degradation. Because the <b>Boundary</b> Dam <b>plant</b> is a coal-fired power plant, it operates under harsher environments and produces an impure flue gas containing, fly ash, SO2, and NO2 that are fed into carbon capture. Even with flue gas pretreatment, there is still enough to produce degradation products such as straight chain amines and sulfur compounds, which accumulate so it is no longer possible to regenerate MEA and MDEA.

Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|R
