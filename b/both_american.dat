5|$|Born in Clayton, New Mexico, to {{a working-class}} family, Anderson was left {{visually}} impaired during childhood. His family regularly moved around within the United States during his early years, with Anderson claiming that encounters with Mexican, Hawaiian, and Haitian migrants led to him gaining an early {{understanding of these}} various cultures' magical practices. The family eventually settled in Oregon, and Anderson later claimed that {{it was here that}} he was initiated into a tradition of witchcraft by an African woman. He later claimed that, in 1932, he joined a magico-religious group known as the Harpy Coven which was based in Ashland and which dissolved in the 1940s. According to his description, the group was devoted to a god and goddess, Setan and Lilith, and were influenced by <b>both</b> <b>American</b> folk magic and Huna.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, <b>both</b> <b>American</b> transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in <b>both</b> <b>American</b> submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E
5|$|Journalists have {{described}} the episode as a satire on <b>both</b> <b>American</b> politics and environmentalism.

The episode was positively received by television critics for its satire on American politics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.8, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E

Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00 on 12 May, U.S. commanders on {{the ground}} in Khâm Đức were {{notified}} of Westmoreland's decision to evacuate all military personnel, <b>both</b> <b>American</b> and Vietnamese, as well as their civilian dependents. However, most army units {{on the ground}} were left uninformed about the decision, and it led to chaos later when evacuation was underway. During the predawn hours of 12 May, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division continued to increase their pressure on the main compound of the Special Forces Camp. The North Vietnamese made final preparations for the main assault by capturing one mountain outpost at a time, which were manned by U.S. soldiers of the Americal Division, who had placed machine-guns around the main camp as advanced defensive positions. At 04:23, U.S. soldiers reported that outpost number 1 had been overrun, and fighter-bombers were scrambled in an attempt to save it. About 30 minutes later, the defenders of outpost number 7 reported that their position had been surrounded. They attempted to hold their position by calling on an AC-47 gunship to fire directly into their position, in order to stop the attack, but soon afterwards outpost 7 succumbed to the North Vietnamese and the defenders retreated back to Khâm Đức.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1945, the American force {{determined}} that two battalions of the Japanese 211th Regiment were at Hill 40, about four miles (6km) {{north of the}} Allied perimeter. The attack on this position began on 3 January 1945 when the 136th Infantry Regiment's 1st and 2nd battalions advanced from the south-west and encountered strong resistance. The regiment used a large quantity of ammunition in this attack, and aerial resupply was needed to replenish its supplies. <b>Both</b> <b>American</b> battalions resumed their attack {{the next day with}} the support of a highly effective artillery bombardment, and reached the main Japanese position in the afternoon. During this period the 3rd Battalion of the 136th Regiment advanced on Hill 40 from the north, and destroyed the 211th Regiment's 3rd Battalion in a series of battles. This Japanese battalion had been stationed on the coast to receive supplies from Halmahera and mounted several unsuccessful attacks on the American battalion's beachhead after it landed in December.|$|E

5|$|NWOBHM bands {{had been}} touring {{steadily}} in the United States, {{but had not}} yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. Def Leppard remedied that, releasing Pyromania {{at the beginning of}} 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where Pyromania peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of Pyromania induced <b>both</b> <b>American</b> and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.|$|E
