5|$|A {{number of}} {{possible}} origins for Planet Nine have <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> including its ejection from the neighborhood of the current giant planets, capture from another star, and in situ formation.|$|E
5|$|The Central Volcanic Zone is thinly {{inhabited}} {{and most}} volcanoes are not under reconnaissance, but Irruputuncu is watched by the Chilean SERNAGEOMIN geologic service. The possibility of geothermal energy production from the volcano has <b>been</b> <b>examined.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultigen}} nomenclature {{has been discussed}} by William T. Stearn and Brandenberg, Hetterscheid and Berg. It has also <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> from a botanical perspective and from {{the origin of the}} Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 until 2004.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{collocation}} {{method for}} solving the occluded radiosity equation <b>is</b> <b>examined,</b> theoretically and empirically. Theoretical results <b>are</b> <b>examined,</b> including questions of superconvergence of the collocation solution. The use of “discontinuity meshing ” <b>is</b> <b>examined</b> for both piecewise constant and piecewise linear collocation. Also, numerical {{integration of the}} collocation integrals <b>is</b> <b>examined,</b> and a near-analytic evaluation method is given...|$|R
30|$|The {{results are}} divided into three primary sections. In the first section, results from the diaries <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> in detail.

5|$|The sea slug Aplysia californica {{was chosen}} by Nobel Prize-winning {{neurophysiologist}} Eric Kandel {{as a model for}} studying the cellular basis of learning and memory, because of the simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system, and it has <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> in hundreds of experiments.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> in this manner. No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) of the foot, which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E
5|$|Basically, the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the Iliad itself has also <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.|$|E

5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has <b>been</b> <b>examined.</b> When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are one of}} the few animals {{where the}} {{molecular}} basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has <b>been</b> <b>examined.</b> However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{smaller than}} Earth's Moon, Europa is {{primarily}} made of silicate rock {{and has a}} water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> by a succession of space probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{spent several}} months {{deployed}} to Albania {{after the end}} of the First Balkan War in 1913 to protect Italian interests there. Giuseppe Garibaldi was sunk by an Austro-Hungarian submarine in the Adriatic Sea shortly after Italy declared war on the Central Powers in 1915 with the loss of 53 crewmen. Her wreck was discovered in 2008 and has <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> by underwater archaeologists in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} major {{pathways}} {{in the brain}} connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia. These are known as the motor, oculo-motor, associative, limbic and orbitofrontal circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit. All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease, since these circuits {{are involved in a}} wide variety of functions, including movement, attention and learning. Scientifically, the motor circuit has <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> the most intensively.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have <b>been</b> <b>examined.</b>|$|E
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> and {{described}} by Montfaucon and Wettstein. Scholz collated Matthew 1-8; Mark 1-4; John 4-8. It <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> {{and described}} by Paulin Martin. C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1885.|$|R

5|$|Both Wessex's sudden rise {{to power}} in the late 820s, and the {{subsequent}} failure to retain this dominant position, have <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> by historians looking for underlying causes. One plausible explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is plausible that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems {{to be part of}} southern English politics {{during the first half of}} the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age. Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In this work, Eakins took {{advantage}} of {{an exception to the}} generally prudish Victorian attitude to nudity: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when nudity was on display. The Swimming Hole develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of buttocks and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> in his The Gross Clinic (1875) and William Rush (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers (Taking the Count, Salutat, and Between Rounds) and wrestlers (Wrestlers).|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the great white shark's mating habits. It is {{possible}} that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have <b>been</b> <b>examined.</b> Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer. The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.|$|E
5|$|Morchella sextelata is morphologically {{indistinguishable from}} several other morel {{species in the}} M.elata clade, {{including}} M.septimelata, M.brunnea, M.angusticeps, and M.septentrionalis. M.septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M.brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M.angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M.septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44°N northward) in eastern North America. M.septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from M.sextelata. Although there are subtle differences {{in the structure of}} the sterile ridges between the species, the authors were not confident that enough specimens had <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> to establish that these differences were consistent.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had <b>been</b> <b>examined</b> and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
