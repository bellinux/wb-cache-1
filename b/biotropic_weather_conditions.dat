30|$|However, {{vehicle speed}} {{decreased}} due to bad <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> (rain and snow) and the decrease was substantially higher on roads without lighting than on roads with lighting. Our results therefore suggests that when road lighting is present, drivers respond less strongly to worsened <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> especially during darkness. This indicates that road lighting may indeed induce higher vehicle speed, but mainly in special circumstances such as “bad” <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> The presence of road lighting may therefore influence driving behavior so that drivers do not adapt adequately or {{as well to}} the prevailing <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> as they might if road lighting were not present. Although the correlation reported between the presence of road lighting and fewer accidents (e.g., Jackett and Frith 2013) {{would suggest that the}} higher visibility in general may compensate for the higher vehicle speed also in worsened <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> especially rain, has been shown to significantly affect the number of fatalities, serious injuries and light injuries.

40|$|As {{construction}} work {{is affected by}} weather events such as snow, cold temperature, humidity, and rainfall, conditions. Thus, to calculate acceptable delay duration, a reasonable method, suitable for practitioners, for predicting schedule delays caused by <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> is necessary. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for calculating construction schedule delays where <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> are taken into consideration. This methodology combines weather information, the expected delay to particular types of construction {{as a result of}} altered <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> and scheduling data, to determine the project duration and make it possible to reduce delays with the help of changes in commencement time of the project or modified scheduling. The objectives of the paper are twofold. The first objective is to provide a prediction of the potential delay as a result of <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> The second objective is to help planners to make decisions making regarding the optimum construction approach to meet the project schedule given expected <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> ...|$|R
