5|$|Several small clashes were fought between Allied and Japanese forces during February. The Fijian {{force at}} Ibu was {{reinforced}} to a strength of about 400 personnel on 3February, but was withdrawn to the perimeter {{in the middle}} of the month after a larger body of Japanese troops surrounded the outpost and began to attack the US Army units which were protecting its supply lines. All of the Fijian troops, along with 200 civilians who had chosen to evacuate with the battalion, reached the coast on 19February. Other American patrols and positions to the north and north-east of the perimeter were also attacked, and the Allies concluded that the Japanese force was being concentrated in this area. Papers taken from the bodies of Japanese soldiers killed in this fighting also allowed the Allies to build up an accurate appreciation of the Japanese plan of attack as well as the order of battle of the forces involved. Intelligence information detailing the Japanese plans was then distributed to American soldiers holding the perimeter through various means, including notices posted on unit <b>bulletin</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of papers on verifiable {{electronic}} voting that {{have appeared in the}} literature in recent years have relied heavily on the availability of an append-only web <b>bulletin</b> <b>board.</b> Despite this widespread requirement, however, the notion of an append-only web <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> remains somewhat vague, and no method of constructing such a <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> has been proposed.

An nfo or FILE ID.DIZ is often made to promote who created the release.

Another increasingly popular method of distributing Warez is via one-click hosting websites.

However, this method is not efficient for a large group which {{has a number of}} terminals. When a terminal changes its membership, the key managerial center needs a large amount of computation to structure the public bulletin, and the terminal cannot efficiently compute its node keys from the large pubic <b>bulletin</b> <b>board.</b> In this paper, we propose an improved scheme to structure a public <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> efficiently by the key management center of CDS.
