5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{questions}} an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|Grant Ellis {{is taken}} to Susanne Modeski by Scully so she can confront him about why he gave the drug to the government. She is furious as {{she could have been}} killed had she not checked Langly the night before. Ellis admits that he only betrayed her <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{threatened}} his own life. Timmy arrives, guns down Grant Ellis, and takes Susanne to the Lone Gunmen's suite.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development cost for the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> then had a policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large production run, which left the total order at 170.|$|E
50|$|Members of the Nixon {{administration}} {{would come to}} view the events as damaging, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> response led to mass arrests and were perceived as violating citizens' civil rights.|$|R
25|$|On September 30, 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> Accountability Office {{released}} a report concluding that the payments to Williams were illegal {{on the part of}} the Department of Education <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> role in <b>the</b> public relations effort was not disclosed.|$|R
25|$|During the Lewisham North and Warwick and Leamington by-elections held in February and March 1957, Labour {{instructed}} its activists not to emphasise {{their opposition}} to Suez <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> action had considerable support.|$|R
5|$|The main {{hospital}} in Ashford is William Harvey Hospital, in nearby Willesborough. It {{is named after}} William Harvey, the doctor who discovered the blood circulatory system. The hospital was built <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> decided the old hospital would be too small for demand as Ashford grew, and looked for a 30-acre site that could have a hospital built on a budget of £7–8million. Work started on building the {{hospital in}} 1973 and it was commissioned in 1977, opening in 1979.|$|E
5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people. They protested a variety of issues such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Vulović as {{the world}} record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in 1990 after taking part in anti-government protests, but avoided arrest <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{was concerned about the}} negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia, advocating Serbia's entry into the European Union. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she continued to struggle with survivor's guilt. Having divorced, she lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Bahraini {{citizens}} and activists have protested {{outside of the}} embassy for various reasons, including anti-Iraq War demonstrations, {{the presence of the}} U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, and to protest Israeli actions in <b>the</b> Middle East. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> of Israel and Bahrain do not have formal diplomatic relations, the U.S. is seen by some as a proxy for <b>the</b> Israeli <b>government.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Finland, Iraq, Mexico, and Nicaragua had a nonsocialist cooperant {{status with}} Comecon. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> of these {{countries}} were not empowered to conclude agreements {{in the name of}} private companies, <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> did not take part in Comecon operations. They were represented in Comecon by commissions made up of members of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and <b>the</b> business community. The commissions were empowered to sign various [...] "framework" [...] agreements with Comecon's Joint Commission on Cooperation.|$|R
25|$|Sikhs are {{typically}} registered as Hindus <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian <b>government</b> does not recognise Sikhism as a religion.|$|R
5|$|In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was {{appointed}} president, becoming Argentina's fifth president in two weeks. Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing {{recovery of the}} economy, having stabilised prices and the exchange rate in a moment when Argentina was at risk of hyperinflation. Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy growing by over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was achieved {{in part because of}} a commodity price boom, and also <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> managed to keep the value of the currency low, boosting industrial exports.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The company {{continued}} to leave Rosebery Avenue for summer tours to British cities and towns. The Arts Council (successor to CEMA) was {{sensitive to the}} charge that since 1945, far fewer opera performances had been given in the provinces. The small Carl Rosa Opera Company toured constantly, but the Covent Garden company visited only those few cities with theatres big enough to accommodate it. In the mid-1950s, renewed calls appeared for a reorganisation of Britain's opera companies. There were proposals for a new home for Sadler's Wells on the South Bank of the Thames near the Royal Festival Hall, which fell through <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> was unwilling to fund the building.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, {{demand for}} a Scottish Parliament grew, in part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of the United Kingdom was {{controlled}} by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
5|$|When {{registration}} commenced on October 16, 1940, no {{structure was}} in place to handle thousands of anticipated conscientious objectors. Church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into the program, and the churches were advised to create a plan. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> wanted to deal with one body, not individual religious denominations, the National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government. The historic peace churches outlined a plan that included running and maintaining CPS camps under church control. However, President Roosevelt opposed any plan not involving military control over the draftees. To save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program, the churches offered to fund the camps. Aides convinced Roosevelt that putting the COs to work in out-of-the-way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of World War I. Selective Service and the peace churches agreed to a six-month trial of church supported and funded camps for conscientious objectors and thus Civilian Public Service was born.|$|E
50|$|The I.W.W.'s actual culpability of wheatfield {{fires and}} sawmill wreckings had become {{unimportant}} <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> greater offenses.|$|R
5|$|Piłsudski and <b>the</b> first Polish <b>government</b> were distrusted in <b>the</b> West <b>because</b> Piłsudski had {{cooperated with}} the Central Powers in 1914–17 and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were {{primarily}} socialist. It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer Ignacy Paderewski became prime minister and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.|$|R

25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> did {{not begin}} its review of the Mandurah Line {{masterplan}} until after construction had begun, the tunnel under the Roe Highway had already been constructed.

25|$|Before the U.S. Supreme Court, the {{prosecutor}} argued that <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> possession of <b>the</b> documents was the fruit {{only of the}} simple physical act of Hubbell's production of those documents, Hubbell's immunity should not prevent {{the prosecutor}} from making derivative use of the documents, even though Hubbell's production of those documents {{was the result of}} Hubbell's compliance with the court order granting him immunity.|$|R
25|$|Some aid {{agencies}} {{have reported that}} the toll may be higher than the official figures <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> does not track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center. In 2011, reports suggested over 6,700 people had been killed during the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} budget {{authority}} and outlays for a fiscal year usually differ <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> can incur obligations for future years. This means that budget authority {{from a previous}} fiscal year can, in many cases, be used for expenditure of funds in future fiscal years; for example, a multi-year contract.|$|E
25|$|This unrest culminated on October 1, 1974, when 12,500 direct {{government}} employees {{walked off the}} job for two days <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had arbitrarily imposed a pay increase six days before bargaining was due to commence. They won their point again, and the government agreed to negotiate in good faith.|$|E
