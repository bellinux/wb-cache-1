50|$|Like {{many other}} countries, Russia's economy {{suffered}} during the Great Recession. Following the Crimean Crisis, several countries (including most of NATO) imposed sanctions on Russia, hurting the Russian economy by cutting off access to capital. At the same time, the global {{price of oil}} declined. The combination of Western sanctions and the falling crude price in 2014 and thereafter, which was widely seen in Russia as a US-Saudi plot against it, resulted in the ongoing 2014-15 Russian financial crisis. As {{a way to get}} around Western sanctions, Russia and China signed a 150 billion yuan central <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> swap <b>line</b> agreement to get around American sanctions. and agreed to a US$400 billion deal which would supply natural gas to China over the next 30 years.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis of 2008, the currency swap transaction structure {{was used by the}} United States Federal Reserve System to establish central <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> swaps.

The aim of central <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> swaps is [...] "to provide liquidity in U.S. dollars to overseas markets." [...] While central <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> swaps and currency swaps are structurally the same, currency swaps are commercial transactions driven by comparative advantage, while central <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> swaps are emergency loans of US Dollars to overseas markets, and it is currently unknown whether or not they will be beneficial for the Dollar or the US in the long-term.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> is {{a crucial}} {{determinant}} {{of the severity of}} banking crises. We consider the effect of fire sales and foreign entry during crises on banks' ex-ante choice of liquid asset holdings. In a setting with limited pledgeability of risky cash flows and differential expertise between banks and outsiders in employing banking assets, the market for assets clears only at fire-sale prices following the onset of a crisis - and outsiders may enter the market if prices fall sufficiently low. While fire sales make it attractive for banks to hold liquid assets, foreign entry reduces this incentive. We show that in this setting, <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> is counter-cyclical whereas bank capital measured as bank profits is pro-cyclical.

30|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of NPLs on <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> {{creation}} to know whether a moral hazard problem exists in Chinese banks or not.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of monetary policy {{depends largely on}} how it affects bank behavior. Recent events have cast doubt on how well monetary policy works in this respect, particularly during financial crises. In addition, issues have been raised {{about the role of}} banks in creating asset bubbles that burst and lead to crises. In this paper, we address these issues by focusing on <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> creation, which is a comprehensive measure of bank output that accounts for all on- and off-balance sheet activities. Specifically we formulate and test hypotheses that address the following questions: (1) How does monetary policy affect total <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> creation and its two main components, on- and off-balance sheet liquidity creation, during normal times? (2) Does monetary policy affect <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> creation differently during financial crises versus normal times? (3) Is high aggregate <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity</b> creation an indicator of an impending financial crisis? We identify five financial crises and use data on virtually all U. S. banks between 1984 :Q 1 and 2008 :Q 4. Our main findings are as follows. First, during normal times, monetary policy tightening is associated with a reduction in liquidity creation by small banks, with much of the impact driven by a reduction in on-balance sheet liquidity creation. Monetary policy does not significantly affect liquidity creation by large and medium banks, which create roughly 90 % of aggregate <b>bank</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Second, during financial crises, the effect of monetary policy on liquidity creation is weaker than during normal times fo...|$|R
