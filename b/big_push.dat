Some tournaments are conducted as torneo ciberneticos, a large multi-man tag team elimination match, others are normal single elimination tournament.|$|E
25|$|The Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra may be {{constructed}} from the Platonic solids {{by a process}} called stellation. Most stellations are not regular. The study of stellations of the Platonic solids was given a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> by H. S. M. Coxeter and others in 1938, with the now famous paper The 59 icosahedra.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy was}} given an initial thrust with the then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao visiting China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore and India {{becoming}} an important dialogue partner with ASEAN in 1992. Since {{the beginning of this}} century, India has given a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> to this policy by becoming a summit level partner of ASEAN (2002) and getting involved in some regional initiatives such as the BIMSTEC and the Ganga–Mekong Cooperation and now becoming a member of the East Asia Summit (EAS) in December 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theme song}} for the American Adventure is [...] "Golden Dream". The music was written by Robert Moline and the lyrics were written by show {{producer}} Randy Bright. The song gets its <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> {{at the end of}} the attraction, during the Montage sequence of famous Americans. The melody has been heard in Epcot's entrance plaza since opening day.|$|R

50|$|The {{debate over}} {{the best way to}} {{approach}} the teaching of design history to practice-based students is often heated, but it is notable that the <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> to adopt a 'realistic' approach (i.e. non-hero-based, analysing the production and consumption of design that would otherwise be viewed as ephemeral) comes from teachers delivering these programmes, while critics are predominantly those who teach 'pure' design history courses.|$|R
25|$|Samu and Fatu next {{appeared}} in Texas, working for Fritz Von Erich’s World Class Championship Wrestling. Storywise, Buddy Roberts brought them in to fight his fights against the Von Erich family and former Fabulous Freebirds partner Michael Hayes. The SST {{was given a}} <b>big</b> <b>push</b> right away; presented as an unstoppable force, they beat hometown heroes Kerry and Kevin Von Erich for the WCWA World Tag Team Championship on August 12, 1988. They remained undefeated in WCCW until they dropped the belts to Hayes and his new partner, Steve Cox, on September 12. They recaptured the title four days later. Hayes and Cox beat them for the title again on October 15, and, two days later, lost it back again.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was the German Formula 3 Championship in 1989, where Frentzen competed against many future stars {{including}} Michael Schumacher and Karl Wendlinger. At the time, there was a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> by Bernie Ecclestone to have a German driver in the Formula One World Championship, so the ONS (the German National Motorsports committee) decided to support both Frentzen and Schumacher. The ONS put up the reward of a Formula One test to the driver who first would take a victory in a Formula 3 race. This ultimately ended up being Schumacher, in a controversial race at Zeltweg, Austria in which Frentzen claimed Schumacher had forced him off the track. However, Schumacher {{did not get the}} Formula One test drive anyway; Karl Wendlinger won the German Formula 3 Championship and Frentzen became joint runner-up with Schumacher (the two finishing on identical points totals).|$|E
25|$|After {{four years}} abroad, Watson {{and his wife}} {{returned}} to Canada, and he began wrestling at Maple Leaf Wrestling in Toronto under 27-year-old promoter Frank Tunney. Watson made his Gardens debut in the opening match of the October 3, 1940. Newspaper reports in November said Watson was frustrated with not getting a main event match in his first six appearances at the Gardens. He appeared in one Gardens main event in February 1941 but his <b>big</b> <b>push</b> came two months later. According to storyline, Watson {{filed a lawsuit against}} Tunney for breach of contract, claiming that he had been signed to wrestle a main event against Masked Wolf. When Tunney held an open tournament to determine the number one contender for the world title on May 1, 1941, Watson entered; filing a copy of his entry form with the Ontario Athletics Commission so that Tunney would be unable to claim he did not enter, and then won four matches in one night to win the tournament.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2000, Adams {{received}} the <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> of his WCW career when he was put into a tag team with Bryan Clark called KroniK. The team debuted at Spring Stampede as Vince Russo's mercenaries in the [...] New Blood stable, helping Shane Douglas and Buff Bagwell to beat Ric Flair and Lex Luger to win the World Tag Team Championship by delivering a High Times to Luger.|$|R
5000|$|Annually, a {{slate of}} adventurers were named National Geographic Adventure Adventurer of the Year", {{in a variety}} of categories. For example, the December 2008/January 2009 issue named [...] "Fourteen people who dreamed <b>big,</b> <b>pushed</b> their limits, and made our year". One, Pemba Gyalje Sherpa, was named for [...] "extreme heroism under trying extreme circumstances" [...] for {{repeatedly}} risking his life to successfully rescue several mountaineers stranded on the mountain, during the 2008 K2 disaster.|$|R
5000|$|One {{negative}} review {{came from}} Pauline Kael, who called it [...] "trite", but said: [...] "You {{can see the}} <b>big</b> <b>pushes</b> for powerful effects, yet it isn't negligible. It wrenches audiences, making them fear that they, too, could become like this man. And when events strip off his armor, he doesn't discover a new, warm humanity, he discovers sharper suffering—just what his armor had protected him from. Most of the intensity comes from Steiger's performance." ...|$|R
500|$|Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, whose {{orders are}} {{alleged to have}} {{resulted}} in {{hundreds of thousands of}} British deaths at Passchendaele and the Somme, is continually referenced. Blackadder himself describes Haig's attempts at an advance as no more than [...] "another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin". In [...] "Goodbyeee", a scene parodies Haig's professional abilities by depicting the Field Marshal playing with toy soldiers, which he sweeps nonchalantly from trench to trench and then into a rubbish bin, while listening to Blackadder's plea {{to get out of the}} <b>big</b> <b>push</b> on the telephone.|$|E
500|$|The men {{are called}} to the trench {{to prepare for the}} <b>big</b> <b>push.</b> There is a moment of hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, {{but for the first time}} in any series, does not call it a [...] "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign {{insanity}} because [...] "who would have noticed another madman round here?" [...] The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.|$|E
500|$|Every {{couple of}} weeks, Lasseter {{and his team}} would put {{together}} their latest set of storyboards or footage to show Disney. In early screen tests, Pixar impressed Disney with the technical innovation but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each presentation by Pixar, Katzenberg would tear much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg's <b>big</b> <b>push</b> was to add more edginess to the two main characters. Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and asked for adult references {{to be added to}} the film. After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm. Tom Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk. Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993, an event they later dubbed [...] "The Black Friday Incident." [...] The results were disastrous, and Schneider, who was never particularly enamored of Katzenberg's idea of having outsiders make animation for Disney, declared it a mess and ordered that production be stopped immediately. Katzenberg asked colleague Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad. Schumacher replied bluntly: [...] "Because it's not their movie anymore, it's completely not the movie that John set out to make." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day, the Americans held their 2 mi stretch of landing beaches, but little else. Their <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> in the south moved 1 mi inland, but the 1st Marines to the north made very little {{progress}} because of the extremely thick resistance. The Marines had suffered 200 dead and 900 wounded. Rupertus, still unaware of his enemy's change of tactics, believed the Japanese would quickly crumble since their perimeter had been broken.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the Lionel {{electric}} train {{was inducted into}} the National Toy Hall of Fame, along with the Easy Bake Oven. It was the first time an electric toy had ever been inducted. That same year, Lionel made a <b>bigger</b> <b>push</b> to sell its train sets outside of hobby shops, selling them in stores such as FAO Schwarz, Macy's, and Target. By November 2006, the company had turned a US$760,000 profit on sales of US$55 million.|$|R
5000|$|Too Cool {{received}} arguably their <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> {{when they}} became embroiled in the feud against the McMahon-Helmsley Regime, mainly wrestling against D-Generation X members, [...] "The Road Dogg" [...] Jesse James, Mr. Ass, and X-Pac and the Radicalz. Their success would peak {{later in the year}} when Scotty and Sexay defeated Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Championship on an episode of Raw is War on May 29, 2000, while Rikishi would defeat Chris Benoit for the Intercontinental Championship on June 20.|$|R
500|$|George's {{incarnation}} as Lieutenant The Honourable George Colthurst St. Barleigh MC, in Blackadder Goes Forth, is a frontline officer [...] strongly reminiscent in both {{manner and}} personality of Bertie Wooster (as whom Laurie would later {{go on to}} appear). General Melchett (played by Stephen Fry, also later of Jeeves & Wooster), intimates to Captain Darling that he and George's [...] "Great Uncle Bertie" [...] used to [...] "break wind" [...] for their college. George joined the army {{on the first day}} of World War I, along with nine other students at Cambridge University. The ten men named themselves the Trinity College tiddlywinks, or the [...] "Trinity Tiddlers". It is revealed later, in the fourth series' finale, that George is the only surviving member of the group. Although he lacks any kind of skill, competence, or authority as an officer, his upper-class status and educational background meant he went straight into the commissioned ranks upon enlisting. George is shown to have a special friendship with General Melchett (Fry), an old family friend with whom he shares his public school [...] "tally-ho" [...] attitude towards the war. Melchett even offers George a way out of the trenches for the [...] "final push", which he refuses, much to Blackadder's incredulity. Although George is shown to have benefited from his background of privilege he still remains a generally kind and hopeful individual, and shortly before the <b>big</b> <b>push</b> at the end of the final episode George finally expresses some genuine fear and sadness that he may indeed die.|$|E
2500|$|Newark {{stated that}} there is a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> in Correctional Services to get more {{offenders}} out of penitentiaries and onto the street in what is called [...] "The Reintegration Project." [...] Although this policy is cheaper than keeping convicts imprisoned, Newark's office contends convicts are being shoved out the door to meet a release quota. Newark stated that he had obtained documents to prove this, including memos, minutes, and confidential Corrections correspondence, and an internal memorandum talk about setting a [...] "goal of a 50/50 split of offenders between institutions and the community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loaded was a {{commercial}} effort aimed at radio play, another {{step away from}} the Warhol-influenced experimental days of their earlier albums. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album [...] "loaded with hits". Singer/bassist Doug Yule said, [...] "On Loaded there was a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like {{this is sort of a}} Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song." ...|$|E
50|$|Greyskull laid fairly dormant {{the years}} {{following}} their <b>big</b> Asia <b>push,</b> and concentrated on writing songs for a new album and played some spot shows around Texas.|$|R
50|$|Brown drew {{inspiration}} from Robert Crumb and Harvey Pekar's autobiographical stories, {{but he says the}} <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> he had at the time was from Seth, his friend and fellow Vortex Comics cartoonist; Joe Matt, whose one-page autobiographical cartoons Brown and Seth discovered in 1989, and who eventually moved to Toronto and became friends with the two; and Julie Doucet, whose comics were not explicitly autobiographical, but starred the cartoonist herself and contained autobiographical elements. All four cartoonists would shortly join Drawn and Quarterly and become associated with one another to the public.|$|R
5000|$|Bob was {{a native}} of Ennis, Texas, and {{credited}} his hometown with providing him the opportunity to prepare for his career. In high school he accompanied every singer in town, played in the high school band and was part-time organist in the Presbyterian Church. He credited band director Thomas Granger as the mentor who gave the <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> to send him on his way. While a junior in high school he assisted Mr. Granger in writing and arranging the school Alma Mater [...] "Maroon and White" [...] that has lasted since 1937.|$|R
2500|$|Stig Anderson {{still thought}} Gärdestad [...] had some {{international}} potential, {{and he and}} his brother Kenneth travelled to Hollywood in late 1977 to record Gärdestad's first English-language album Blue Virgin Isles. The west coast rock orientated album featured contributions from American and English musicians including Jeff Porcaro, Steve Porcaro, Jim Keltner, David Hungate, Jay Graydon, Dr. John and John Mayall, many of whom were Gärdestad's personal idols. Blue Virgin Isles was released worldwide in late 1978 on Epic Records, and produced the singles [...] "Take Me Back To Hollywood", an English version of [...] "Chapeau-Clacque", and [...] "Love, You're Making All The Fools". Despite the expensive production and the <b>big</b> <b>push</b> to launch Gärdestad—including promotional appearances alongside ABBA—his Swedish success did not translate internationally. In Sweden the album peaked at No. 29 and spent one week on the chart. Thirty years after its original release, Blue Virgin Isles remains Gärdestad 's only studio album that has not been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music Group.|$|E
2500|$|Keirn and Lane {{were first}} brought {{together}} in early 1982. Jerry Lawler and Jerry Jarrett {{decided to give}} the two ”Pretty boys” a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> right off the bat, shooting a couple of music videos starring Lane and Keirn set to ZZ Top’s [...] "Sharp Dressed Man" [...] and Billy Squier’s [...] "Everybody Wants You" [...] while wearing top hats, sequin tuxedos and the like. This {{was one of the}} first times where music videos were used to get a wrestler ”over” (popular) in pro wrestling, a practice more common today. The CWA bookers also persuaded local hero The [...] "Fabulous" [...] Jackie Fargo to lend his endorsement to The Fabulous Ones (earning them the nickname ”Fargo’s Fabulous Ones”), which gave the team instant credibility in the South. The original plan for the Fabulous Ones was for them to dispatch the New York Dolls, then turn heel on Lawler and Dundee and be managed by Jim Cornette, but because of the overwhelming popularity of Lane and Keirn those plans were quickly changed.|$|E
2500|$|Richey {{recalled}} {{that he met}} in Columbia with former Governor John McKeithen, who had been instrumental in Winters's election as national committeewoman. Richey found that the two were [...] "apparently ... on the outs ... {{at the time of}} our election. At one meeting ... he suggested that I make a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> with black voters by informing them that 'Mary Lou Winters was a member of not one, but two Lily-white country clubs.' That exact line appeared in campaign letters from me to black voters in the waning days of the election." [...] Richey ran first in the primary and defeated Mrs. Winters in the second balloting, 58-42 percent. Prior to the Senate election, Winters, a graduate of Louisiana State University, had been the chief lobbyist for the Louisiana State Medical Society, in which capacity she worked pro bono in 1975 to obtain passage of legislation to protect the medical profession against questionable lawsuits. Winters served for thirty-two years on the Democratic National Committee and attended all of the presidential nominating conventions during her tenure. In 1996, Winters was an elector for President Bill Clinton, who carried Louisiana in both of his elections. She was later the vice chairman of her state party.|$|E
5000|$|His <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> {{started in}} the summer of 1994 when he became [...] "Dave Sullivan" [...] the {{dyslexic}} brother of Kevin Sullivan who regularly mispronounced his own forename as [...] "Evad". He was being picked on by The Nasty Boys and brought Kevin in to help him against them. He was injured by them, so Kevin Sullivan brought in Cactus Jack to help them out. After Kevin and Jack took care of The Nasty Boys, they split up, and Jack left. Hulk Hogan made his WCW debut that summer, and Sullivan became his biggest fan. Kevin hated Hogan, and problems started brewing.|$|R

50|$|However, {{many users}} stated {{that this is}} the <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> factor to inflate, as the sellers now demand higher prices before selling an item (in order {{to make up for the}} loss of in-game money through tax system). Also, some users state that the {{inflation}} will eventually stop without the interference of the game developer. They claim that as more players achieve high levels, they would be able to hunt more monsters and deliver more equipment. Like the real world, the economy of online games are based on supply and demand. When more items are released into the market, it pushes the supply up, resulting in cheaper goods.|$|R
2500|$|Samu and Fatu next {{appeared}} in Texas, working for Fritz Von Erich’s World Class Championship Wrestling promotion. The storyline was that Buddy Roberts brought {{the team in}} to fight his fights against the Von Erich Family and former Fabulous Freebirds partner Michael Hayes. The SST was given a <b>big</b> <b>push</b> right away; presented as an unstoppable force the team was even allowed to beat hometown heroes Kerry and Kevin Von Erich for the WCCW Tag-Team Titles on August 12, 1988. The Samoans remained undefeated in WCCW until they came up against Roberts’ former partner Michael Hayes and Hayes new partner, “Do It To It" [...] Steve Cox on September 12. The duo was not without the gold for long as they recaptured the title only four days later. Hayes and Cox beat the Samoan Swat Team for the title once again on October 15, 1988 but this time they only held the gold for two days before they lost it to the SST. On September 12, 1988 The Samoan Swat Team become double champions as they beat [...] "Hollywood" [...] John Tatum and Jimmy Jack Funk for the WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship. The Samoan Swat Team made their Pay Per View debut at AWA Superclash III, the first (and only) PPV that the American Wrestling Association ever presented. The Samoans successfully defended their WCCW Tag-Team titles against Michael Hayes and Steve Cox. In the beginning of 1989 the Samoans left WCCW, forcing both tag-team titles to be vacated due to the sudden departure.|$|E

5000|$|Broward's <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> as {{governor}} was for drainage of the Everglades, then considered useless swamp, as {{people did not}} understand its ecology or relation to water table and habitat. Early in his term, Broward was attacked often and by many different people for his drainage program and for the land tax he instituted to pay for it. One newspaper noted that, [...] "The treasury will be drained before the Everglades." [...] As drainage progressed, Broward began taking his fiercest opponents for [...] "ocular displays" [...] in the Glades, showing them the work {{that had been done}} and how it was progressing. John Beard, one of Broward's most effective opponents, was eventually convinced by one of these trips that the land was fertile and that drainage was working.|$|R
5|$|The script {{received}} constant {{input from}} the producers and from Shatner and Nimoy. The discussions led to repeated rewrites, {{right up to the}} day the pages were to be shot. At one point, scenes were being rewritten so often it became necessary to note on script pages the hour of the revision. Though changes were constant, the <b>biggest</b> <b>push</b> for alteration revolved around the ending. Much of the rewriting {{had to do with the}} relationships of Kirk and Spock, Decker and Ilia, and the Enterprise and Vger. A final draft of the third act was approved in late September 1978, but had it not been for a Penthouse interview where NASA director Robert Jastrow said that mechanical forms of life were likely, the ending may not have been approved at all.|$|R
50|$|For {{the second}} {{film in the}} franchise, DreamWorks Interactive {{released}} five games for the most popular systems at the time.
