5000|$|The {{nineteenth century}} ferronnière was worn {{from the late}} 1820s to the early 1840s, when it was {{considered}} to enhance a high forehead, and by the 1850s, it {{had fallen out of}} fashion. One contemporary source from 1831 describes the ferronnière as [...] "a small plait of hair, adorned in the centre of the forehead by a large brilliant, from which depends another brilliant of the pear shape." [...] It has been described {{as one of the most}} widely worn examples of historicism in early Victorian fashion, worn as a tribute to the Renaissance alongside beaded belts called cordèlieres inspired by medieval clothing and hairstyles named after historic women such as Agnès Sorel and Blanche of Castille. The ferronnière could be worn for either day or evening. Alternative terms for similar ornaments were the <b>bandelette</b> and the tour de tête.|$|E
50|$|Born in Paris on 17 August 1828 {{he became}} a doctor of {{medicine}} in 1857 and conducted extensive research on the anatomy, pathology and functions of the central nervous system. In 1865 he published a treatise entitled Studies on the Structure, Functions and Diseases of the Cerebro-spinal System, this book {{was accompanied by a}} hand-drawn three-dimensional atlas of the brain. It was within this book that Luys provided the first description of the structure that is today called the subthalamic nucleus. Luys termed this nucleus the <b>bandelette</b> accessoire des olives supérieures (accessory band of the superior olives) and concluded that it was a centre for the dispersion of cerebellar influence upon the striatum. Luys also traced the projection from the subthalamic nucleus to the globus pallidus and the projection to the subthalamic nucleus from the cerebral cortex. Today these pathways and structures are thought to be central to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, the subthalamic nucleus being one of the major targets for deep brain stimulation.|$|E
