40|$|BACKGROUND: Dietary {{prevention}} {{strategies are}} increasingly recognized {{as essential to}} combat the current epidemic of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the potential prebiotic effects of indigestible carbohydrates in Swedish <b>brown</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris var. nanus) in relation to cardiometabolic risk markers and appetite regulating hormones. METHODS: <b>Brown</b> <b>beans,</b> or white wheat bread (WWB, reference product) were provided as evening meals to 16 healthy young adults in a randomised crossover design. Glucose, insulin, appetite regulatory hormones, GLP- 1, GLP- 2, appetite sensations, and markers of inflammation were measured at a following standardised breakfast, that is at 11 to 14 h post the evening meals. Additionally, colonic fermentation activity was estimated from measurement of plasma short chain fatty acids (SCFA, including also branched chain fatty acids) and breath hydrogen (H 2) excretion. RESULTS: An evening meal of <b>brown</b> <b>beans,</b> in comparison with WWB, lowered blood glucose (- 15 %, p< 0. 01) - and insulin (- 16 %, p< 0. 05) responses, increased satiety hormones (PYY 51 %, p< 0. 001), suppressed hunger hormones (ghrelin - 14 %, p< 0. 05), and hunger sensations (- 15 %, p =  0. 05), increased GLP- 2 concentrations (8. 4 %, p< 0. 05) and suppressed inflammatory markers (IL- 6 - 35 %, and IL- 18 - 8. 3 %, p< 0. 05) at a subsequent standardised breakfast. Breath H 2 (141 %, p< 0. 01), propionate (16 %, p< 0. 05), and isobutyrate (18 %, P< 0. 001) were significantly increased after <b>brown</b> <b>beans</b> compared to after WWB, indicating a higher colonic fermentative activity after <b>brown</b> <b>beans.</b> CONCLUSIONS: An evening meal with <b>brown</b> <b>beans</b> beneficially affected important measures of cardiometabolic risk and appetite regulatory hormones, within a time frame of 11 - 14 h, in comparison to a WWB evening meal. Concentrations of plasma SCFA and H 2 were increased, indicating involvement of colonic fermentation.

A qualitative {{study was conducted}} in Central Mexico to determine work and day-care arrangements supporting and limiting maternal {{capacity to}} care for young children, and to identify classification systems, value attributes, and patterns of introduction of home and processed complementary foods driving food choices in Mexican working mothers and alternate caregivers. A random sample of 14 manufacturing businesses with at least 25 % of working women was chosen from the census of the Cuernavaca City industrial zone, Mexico (n= 157). A purposeful sample of 44 blue-collar working mothers, 20 day-caregivers, 22 grandmothers, and 14 business representatives was selected. In-depth interviews, free-listings, pile sort and food attributes exercises, and participant observation were conducted. Interviews' topics of inquiry included work and daycare policies, family-friendly arrangements, and nutrition education. Data were analyzed by using content analysis, multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical clustering. Thirty-one key complementary foods were selected from a domain of 112 foods given to children less than one year of age in the region. From hierarchical clustering, mothers and alternate caregivers identified nine and ten classes of key foods, respectively. From multidimensional scaling, mothers and caregivers used food groups as a primary classification system. Relevant' dimensions from multidimensional scaling for mothers were food introduction stages and food processing, and for alternate caregivers were healthiness, food processing, and meal relevance. Child health and nutrition, particularly vitamin content, were salient attributes. The notion of early introduction of complementary foods was shared by mothers and alternate caregivers; they reported providing fruits and vegetables to infants. Foods with positive attributes were apple, banana, carrots, squash, chayote, <b>brown</b> <b>bean</b> broth (no solids), pasta, and chicken flesh. Foods with negative attributes were pork, potato chips, and soda, among other processed products. Red meats were described as cold-type, heavy, and hard, not suitable for young children, but right for toddlers.

40|$|Coffee {{consumers}} {{request a}} good quality of green coffee {{to get a}} good coffee cup taste. Defective beans e. g. black bean, <b>brown</b> <b>bean</b> and broken bean are associated to low coffee quality which give negative effects to final taste. To meet the standard export requirement, coffee beans have to be graded before being traded. Until now, grading process is generally carried out manually. The method gives better product, so the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, improving the manual sorting by providing machine for grading of green coffee is good alternative to reduce the grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table conveyor type grading machine in order to improve the performance of the manual grading productivity and consistent quality and to reduce the grading cost. The conveyor belt has a dimension of 5700 mm of length, 610 mm of width and 6 mm of thickness. The rotating of belt conveyor powered by an electro motor 3 HP, 3 phase and 1420 rpm. The result showed that the optimum capacity of grading machine was 390 kg/hour reached when the speed 16 rpm and 3 kg/m 2 of green beans on belt conveyor with productivity 1870 kg/man-day compared to the productivity full manually process 743 kg/man-day. Percentage of product in outlet 1 was 4. 2 % as broken beans, 0. 26 % as brown beans, 0. 68 % as one hole in beans and 0. 61 % as more than one hole in beans. Percentage of product in outlet 2 was 39. 54 % as broken beans, 4. 23 % as brown beans 7. 19 % as black beans, 4. 47 % as one hole in beans and 4. 43 % as more than one hole in beans.

40|$|Purpose The {{expected}} {{increase in}} demand for food raises concerns about the expansion of agricultural land worldwide. To avoid expansion, {{we need to focus}} on increasing land productivity, reducing waste, and shifting human diets. Studies exploring diet shifts so far have ignored competition for land between humans and animals. Our objective was to study the relation between land use, the share of animal protein in the human diet, population size, and land availability and quality. Methods We used linear programming to determine minimum land required to feed a population a diet with 0 – 80 % of the protein derived from terrestrial domestic animals. Populations ranged from 15 million to the maximum number of people that could be supported by the system. The agricultural system in the Netherlands was used as illustration, assuming no import and export of feed and food. Daily energy and protein requirements of humans were fulfilled by a diet potentially consisting of grain (wheat), root and tuber crops (potato, sugar beet), oil crops (rapeseed), legumes (<b>brown</b> <b>bean),</b> and animal protein from ruminants (milk and meat) and monogastrics (pork). Results and discussion Land is used most efficiently if people would derive 12 % of dietary protein from animals (% PA), especially milk. The role of animals in such a diet is to convert co-products from crop production and the human food industry into protein-rich milk and meat. Below 12 % PA, human-inedible products were wasted (i. e., not used for food production), whereas above 12 % PA, additional crops had to be cultivated to feed livestock. Large populations (40 million or more) could be sustained only if animal protein was consumed. This results from the fact that at high population sizes, land unsuitable for crop production was necessary to meet dietary requirements of the population, and contributed to food production by providing animal protein without competing for land with crops. Conclusions A land use optimization model including crop and animal production enables identification of the optimal % PA in the diet. Land use per capita was lowest at 12 % PA. At this level, animals optimally consume co-products from food production. Larger populations, furthermore, can be sustained only with diets relatively high in % PA, as land unsuitable for crop production is needed to fulfil their food demand. The optimal % PA in the human diet depended on population size and the relative share of land unsuitable for crop production...|$|E

The total phenolic {{content of the}} red, brown and black were {{higher than that of}} white beans both in the hull and in the whole seed extracts. Total phenolic contents of red and brown hulls were 2. 3 times higher than those of whole seeds while that of the hulls of black beans were 7 times higher than black bean whole extract. Total antioxidant capacity of the extracts was evaluated using Trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity (TEAC) assay, β-carotene-linoleate and bulk stripped corn oil model systems. Extracts were used at 50 and 100 ppm phenolics as catechin equivalents. Scavenging efficacies of the whole bean extracts for reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated using hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and 2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA-supercoiled strand scission and prevention of human low density lipoprotein (hLDL) oxidation by the extracts were evaluated. TEAC values of red whole bean extract (RWE), brown whole bean extract (BWE) and black whole bean extract (LWE) were 8. 84, 7. 46 and 4. 64 while those of red bean hull extract (RHE), <b>brown</b> <b>bean</b> hull extract (BHE) and black bean hull extract (LHE) were 46. 68 42. 90, and 40. 74, respectively. TEAC assay revealed that the antioxidant capacity of red, brown, and black bean hulls were in the same order of magnitude with little variation. Retention of β-carotene in a β-carotene-linoleate model system in the presence of RWE, BWE and LWE after 2 h of the assay was 46, 45, and 28 % at 50 ppm and 52, 51, and 33 % at 100 ppm, respectively, as compared to 2 % in the control devoid of any extract. In a bulk corn oil model system, the order of efficacies of the extracts and reference antioxidants as measured by the formation of conjugated dienes (CD) was catechin > BHA > RWE = BWE = LWE > α-tocopherol. Inhibition of formation of hexanal in corn oil after 7 days was catechin > RWE = BWE = BHA > LWE > α-tocopherol. The efficacy of RWE, BWE and LWE at 100 ppm in scavenging hydrogen peroxide was 76, 73 and 65 %, respectively. The corresponding values for superoxide radical scavenging were 54, 53 and 60 %. Red, brown and black whole and hull seed extracts showed total scavenging of DPPH radical when used at 100 ppm. The Fe²+ chelation capacities of RWE, BWE and LWE were 58, 56 and 39 % at 50 ppm and 72, 69, and 60 % at 100 ppm, respectively. Red, brown and black whole seed extracts exhibited total inhibition of hLDL oxidation when used at 25 and 50 ppm. Red, brown and black whole seed extracts exerted total protection against peroxyl-induced DNA scission at 50 and 100 ppm levels while they did not show any protection towards hydroxyl radical induced-DNA scission. HPLC analyses revealed the presence of cyanidin in LHE while RHE and BHE contained both cyanidin and delphinidin. White bean hull extracts did not contain any of the two anthocyanidins.
