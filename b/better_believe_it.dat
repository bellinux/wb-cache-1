She was making a beginning--she was practising herself in her nursery duties, and, to her surprise, finding them quite charming; and little Kitty so delighted with all she did for her, that all the hitherto unsounded depths of the motherly heart were stirred up, and she could not think why she had never found out her true happiness. She looked so bright and so beautiful, that even Lord Ormersfield remarked it, pitying her for trials which he thought she little realized; but Louis augured <b>better,</b> <b>believing</b> that <b>it</b> was not ignorance but resolution which gave animation and brilliancy to her dark eye and cheerfulness to her smile.|$|R
