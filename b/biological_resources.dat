40|$|The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) {{establishes}} a new legal {{framework for the}} management of <b>biological</b> <b>resource</b> use, for example in fisheries. The signatory states to the CBD have agreed upon several major principles which become legally binding following ratification of the Convention by the national legislature. In terms of resource management, two of these principles are especially remarkable: 1. a concept of sustainability which includes distributional considerations; 2. an ‘ecosystem approach’ that calls for the integration of aspects of community ecology into management schemes. Unfortunately, current approaches to the management of <b>biological</b> <b>resource</b> use fall somewhat short of satisfying these two principles. I try to rectify this, developing a method of analysis that integrates neoclassical resource economics, property rights theory and community ecology into one theoretical concept which can be applied to such distinctive problems as overexploitation, negative impact on ecosystems by resource use, and conflicts among resource users. This method of analysis will make it possible to determine whether a specified <b>biological</b> <b>resource</b> use system and its accompanying management structures meet the requirements set out by the CBD...|$|R
2500|$|The {{impact of}} Aborigines on native species populations is {{considered}} to be less significant than that of the European settlers, [...] whose impact on the landscape has been on a relatively large scale. Since European settlement, direct exploitation of native fauna, habitat destruction and the introduction of exotic predators and competitive herbivores has led to the extinction of some 27 mammal, 23 bird and 4 frog species. Much of Australia's fauna is protected by legislation. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 was created to meet Australia's obligations as a signatory to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. This act protects all native fauna and provides for the identification and protection of threatened species. In each state and territory, there is statutory listing of threatened species. At present, 380 animal species are classified as either endangered or threatened under the EPBC Act, and other species are protected under state and territory legislation. More broadly, a complete cataloguing of all the species within Australia has been undertaken, a key step in the conservation of Australian fauna and biodiversity. In 1973, the federal government established the Australian <b>Biological</b> <b>Resources</b> Study (ABRS), which coordinates research in the taxonomy, identification, classification and distribution of flora and fauna. The ABRS maintains free online databases cataloguing much of the described Australian flora and fauna. Impacts such as the illegal setting of traps in rivers affect animals such as the Australian platypus, along with lack of awareness each year an average of 2–5 Australians lose their lives to what is presumed a safe creature. The key is understanding of Australia's diverse wildlife and fauna; what seems safe is often deadly.|$|E
