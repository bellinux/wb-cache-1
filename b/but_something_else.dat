25|$|The use of {{the word}} {{alloantigen}} actually masks the fact that HLA are infrequently autoantigens in the donor, and therefore their function is not as antigens, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> But the naming of these antigens is not borne out of function but the need to match organ donors with recipients.|$|E

25|$|Chase {{reports from}} orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase {{to abandon their}} rented ship for the Corsarius; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the Corsarius won’t be fully charged for about a day. Their problem is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic {{maneuver}} from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable Corsarius magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. It demands their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire Corsarius’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, Corsarius is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.|$|E

500|$|The {{requirement}} for better matching {{to the end}} impedances {{is one of the}} main motivations for using composite filters.

6000|$|Tony’s face relaxed, and he laughed. “That’s devilishly complimentary— but I’m coming. I’ve {{never been}} in a fight, and the {{sensation}} will be a pleasant novelty, <b>but</b> there’s <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> You see, it may happen that one of us gets hurt.” ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the second}} change ("chasing away my nightly sleep") {{does not affect}} the meaning, {{dropping}} [...] "of them" [...] in the third line may actually mean that the singer is not troubled by a girl's name, <b>but</b> by <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R

60|$|As to Gambril, he {{was fairly}} choked. He coughed pitifully, the broken cough {{of a sick}} man; and I beheld him as one sees a fish in an {{aquarium}} {{by the light of}} an electric bulb, an elusive, phosphorescent shape. Only he did not glide away. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> happened. Both binnaclelamps went out. I suppose the water forced itself into them, though I wouldn't have thought that possible, for they fitted into the cowl perfectly.|$|E

5000|$|The prefix pseudo- (from Greek ψευδής, pseudes, [...] "lying, false") {{is used to}} mark {{something}} that superficially appears to be (or behaves like) one thing, <b>but</b> is <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Subject to context, pseudo may connote coincidence, imitation, intentional deception, or a combination thereof.|$|R

60|$|Having {{remained}} upon {{deck with}} the doctor some time after the rest had gone below, I was just {{on the point of}} following him down, when I saw the Mowree rise, draw a bucket of water, and holding it high above his head, pour its contents right over him. This he repeated several times. There was nothing very peculiar in the act, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> about him struck me. However, I thought no more of it, but descended the scuttle.|$|E
6000|$|It wasn't till {{afterwards}} that, {{going back}} to it, he was to read into this speech a kind of heroic ring, a note of character that belittled his own incapacity for action. Yet he saw indeed even {{at the time the}} greatness of knowing so well what one wanted. At the time too, moreover, he next reflected that he after all knew what he did. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> on his lips was uppermost. [...] "What I don't make out then is how you can even bear it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> {{happened}} also. While {{that second}} visit {{was being made}} at Carbury there came to the hall a young man of whom Roger Carbury had said much to his cousins,--one Paul Montague, of whom some short account shall be given in this chapter. The squire,--Roger Carbury was always called the squire about his own place,--had anticipated no evil when he so timed this second visit of his cousins to his house that they must of necessity meet Paul Montague there. But great harm had come of it. Paul Montague had fallen into love with his cousin's guest, and there had sprung up much unhappiness.|$|E

60|$|Dinner {{was very}} late at the Squirrel Inn that day, and Mrs. Petter gave her guests a scolding. But {{this did not}} in the least disturb the mind of Mr. Tippengray, who was well used to being scolded for coming late to his meals. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> {{disturbed}} him, and for nearly an hour after dinner he wandered about the lawn and around the house. He wanted very much to see Miss Mayberry again, and to tell her the things {{he did not have a}} chance to tell her on the road, and he also very much wished to prevent that rascally Lanigan Beam from getting ahead of him, and continuing his broken-off interview with the lady.|$|E
60|$|Some one {{knocked on}} her door. The Mexican woman called anxiously. Carley awoke {{to the fact}} that her {{presence}} was not solitary on the physical earth, even if her soul seemed stricken to eternal loneliness. Even in the desert there was a world to consider. Vanity that had bled to death, pride that had been crushed, availed her not here. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> came to her support. The lesson of the West had been to endure, not to shirk--to face an issue, not to hide. Carley got up, bathed, dressed, brushed and arranged her dishevelled hair. The face she saw in the mirror excited her amaze and pity. Then she went out in answer to the call for dinner. But she could not eat. The ordinary functions of life appeared to be deadened.|$|E
60|$|She saw {{the dark}} yews {{and the golden}} crocuses, then she looked gratefully. He had not seemed to belong to her among all these others; he was {{different}} then--not her Paul, who understood the slightest quiver of her innermost soul, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> speaking another language than hers. How it hurt her, and deadened her very perceptions. Only when he came right back to her, leaving his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she feel alive again. And now {{he asked her to}} look at this garden, wanting the contact with her again. Impatient of the set in the field, she turned to the quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses. A feeling of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her. It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden.|$|E

5000|$|After befriending the {{neighbor}} living {{a few doors}} down, he falls into an affair that sends them both down a dark path. <b>But</b> there's <b>something</b> <b>else</b> odd about {{the atmosphere in the}} run-down building.

6000|$|... "I do please, {{and think}} you have told him that often enough. If a man won't learn a thing in twenty lessons, he is not worth the trouble of teaching. So tell him he's a step-husband no more, <b>but</b> try <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> I hope he makes Chloe a good father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now for {{the meaning}} of [...] "little children." [...] There are those who {{will tell you that}} those words mean merely [...] "weak believers," [...] "babes in grace," [...] and so on. They mean that, no doubt; but they mean much more. They mean, first of all, be sure, what they say. St. John would not have said [...] "little children," [...] if he had not meant little children. Surely God's apostle did not throw about his words at random, so as to leave them open to mistakes, and want some one to step in and tell us that they do not mean their plain, {{common-sense}} meaning, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Holy Scripture is too wisely written, and too awful a matter, to be trifled with in that way, and cut and squared to suit our own fancies, and explained away, till its blessed promises are made to mean anything or nothing.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> {{is needed}} to made a hero. Some other {{influence}} must help him through the harder trials and more severe ordeals which may befall him. It is sentiment which makes {{the difference in the}} end. Those who doubt should stroll to the camp fire one night and listen to the soldiers' songs. Every one clings to something that he thinks is high and noble, or that raises him above {{the rest of the world}} in the hour of need. Perhaps he remembers that he is sprung from an ancient stock, and of a race that has always known how to die; or more probably it is something smaller and more intimate; the regiment, whatever it is called--"The Gordons," [...] "The Buffs," [...] "The Queen's,"--and so nursing the name--only the unofficial name of an infantry battalion after all--he accomplishes great things and maintains the honour and the Empire of the British people.|$|E

Some believe he was took in, and some believe he w{{as one of the}} takers-in; but however that may be, they can't prove nothing against him. This morning he went up of his own accord afore the Lord Mayor or some of them City big-wigs, and complained that he'd been swindled, and that these two persons had gone off and cheated him, and that he had just found out that Montague's name wasn't even Montague, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> And they do say that he looked like Death, owing to his losses.
