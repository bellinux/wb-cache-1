5|$|Hardware {{benchmarking}} {{conducted using}} Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and {{mentioned at the}} unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 {{times higher than the}} iPhone 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> iPhone 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> iPhone 4S. Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4S.|$|E

5|$|A pair of {{experimental}} atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology {{has set a}} record for stability.

It however managed to perform <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> year's other commercial failures 1: Nenokkadine and Rabhasa.

NBC also won the hour for the 18–49audience, nearly doubling its numbers with those viewers over The Firm. Awake debuted slightly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous drama occupying the slot in fall 2011, Prime Suspect, which premiered with 6.05million total viewers and a 1.8/5-percent share in the 18–49demographic.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Glen Morgan felt {{doing an}} episode on vampires was a mistake, {{and said that}} they were also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, saying that the script was a lot <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors had problems with the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E

5|$|In 1988–89, the Flames {{continued}} to improve. They captured their second consecutive presidents' Trophy with a franchise record 117 points, finishing 26 points <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> second-place Kings in the Smythe Division. Fletcher {{continued to}} tinker with the roster, acquiring Doug Gilmour {{as part of a}} six player deal at the trade deadline. In the playoffs, the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Vancouver Canucks. They relied on several saves by goaltender Mike Vernon, including a famous glove save off a Stan Smyl breakaway in overtime. The save remains a defining moment in Flames history.|$|E

Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint.
