5|$|Commentators {{have felt}} the game {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in <b>bad</b> <b>taste,</b> with one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a <b>bad</b> <b>taste.</b> Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|Miles, {{who just}} wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities, and {{initially}} nauseated {{at the idea}} of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death {{at the hands of the}} Green Goblin, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider-Man, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting. During his first foray into costumed superheroics, he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider-Man costume is in <b>bad</b> <b>taste,</b> but also by Spider-Woman, a member of the government superhuman team, the Ultimates, over his use of the Spider-Man identity.|$|E

50|$|Licking can be {{prevented}} {{by the use of}} Elizabethan collars, battery-enhanced wraps, bandages, anti-licking ointments (which are <b>bad</b> <b>tasting),</b> and anti-lick strips (which are either <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> or simply provide a barrier). It is important to catch lesions early and keep the animal from licking them to then reduce inflammation and development of a habit. Topical medications such as corticosteroids or DMSO may be effective if used early.|$|R
40|$|Aposematism is a defence {{system used}} by toxic animals where the animals use warning colouration, often {{combined}} with warning gestures, {{to fend off}} predators. The most probable scenario is that the toxicity was developed prior to the warning colouration. Compared to other survival strategies, aposematism do not rely on the preys capability to hide, run away from or fight off the predator, but rather {{to be seen and}} avoided. Chicks will be influenced by the colour of the food, and how it tastes, to assess if the food is interesting and eatable or not. The hen will use sound to attract chicks to the food source, but will this overrule the aposematic colouration of prey? My hypothesis is that the chicks will eat most brown prey, with eating fewer <b>bad</b> <b>tasting,</b> and even fewer aposematic <b>bad</b> <b>tasting.</b> Further on my hypothesis is that the chicks that will be given sound during eating will eat more prey, compared to chickens not given sound during eating. In the experiment 96 domestic chicks, divided into 8 groups (sound or no sound, and <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> or neutral prey) were used. The chicks were trained and then tested in 4 days. In the first 12 trials (learning) green and yellow prey <b>tasted</b> <b>bad,</b> and brown <b>tasted</b> good. Green was <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> neutral, yellow <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> aposematic. In the last 3 trials (extinction learning) green, yellow and brown tasted good. Yellow prey is eaten more often than green prey during the learning tests, but chicks given yellow prey also show a higher amount of learning form day 1 to day 3, compared to chicks given green prey, although not always confirmed statistically. Sound did {{have an impact on the}} chicks attack rate, but it did not follow a clear pattern, and it too also shows no significant difference between different sound groups. In the extinction tests, chicks given green prey shows a higher degree of extinction learning, even though not statistically confirmed, as too with sound...|$|R
5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, <b>bad</b> <b>taste</b> in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|The first widely {{distributed}} comic strip to tackle LGBT themes {{and include a}} gay character was Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury. The strip introduced the character Andy Lippincott in 1976, and his diagnosis with HIV in 1989 and AIDS related death in 1990 was the first representation of this issue in comic strips. This storyline led to a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Trudeau, but three newspapers of the 900 carrying the strip refused to publish it as being in <b>bad</b> <b>taste.</b> Two years later, the long-standing character Mark Slackmeyer was revealed to be gay, continuing a reputation for controversial content. Slackmeyer, a liberal, continues to feature in the strip, with focus on {{his relationship with his}} politically conservative partner, Chase, including their marriage in 1999 and separation in 2007.|$|E

5000|$|In many areas, it is {{difficult}} to keep a roof clean enough for drinking. To reduce dirt and <b>bad</b> <b>tastes,</b> systems use a metal collecting-roof and a [...] "roof cleaner" [...] tank that diverts the first 40 liters. Cistern water is usually chlorinated, though reverse osmosis systems provide even better quality drinking water.|$|R
40|$|Rats {{which lost}} weight due to {{exercise}} showed increased acceptance of good tasting food and increased rejection of <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> food. This indicates that energy deficit results in heightened taste responsiveness {{and suggests that}} obese human beings may be highly taste responsive because they chronically maintain their weight at a level below its set point...|$|R

50|$|Various {{methods for}} masking bad water were used: Diophanes of Nicaea {{of the first}} century BC advised putting {{macerated}} laurel into rainwater, Paxamus proposed that bruised coral or pounded barley, in a bag, be immersed in <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> water. and the eighth century Arabian alchemist, Gerber, described various stills for purifying water that used wick siphons — to transfer water from one vessel to another.|$|R

25|$|After KUKL, Sigtryggur {{followed}} up with The Sugarcubes achieving big success abroad. Other music projects followed such as Bogomil Font, and by 1993 he moved with his wife to Madison, Wisconsin, where he collaborated with some local bands and from Chicago, set up a sublabel for <b>Bad</b> <b>Taste,</b> called <b>Bad</b> <b>Taste</b> USA, created his own drum session studio called The Slaughterhouse and recorded a few sampler discs at Laughing Cat and Æthen and Butch Vig's Smart studios. He collaborated with Jóhann Jóhannsson and released an album called Dip, then with Emilíana Torrini on her album Love in the Time of Science. He also played in Grindverk with Einar Örn and Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, and more recently in a duet called Steintryggur with Steingrímur Guðmundsson.|$|E
5000|$|Zooplankton {{have adapted}} by {{developing}} transparent bodies, bright colors, <b>bad</b> <b>tastes</b> and cyclomorphosis (seasonal changes in body shape). When predators release a chemical {{in the water}} to signal zooplankton; cyclomorphosis allows holoplankton to increase their spines and protective shields. Studies have shown that although small in size certain gelatinous zooplankton are rich in protein and lipid. [...] "Many holoplankton seem to have very little visible defense mechanisms; therefore, it is hypothesized that a chemical defense may be possible. Pelagic cnidarians have nematocysts that eject a tightly coiled venomous thread very rapidly. These threads penetrate the surface of their target and release a venom.|$|R
50|$|Consumption, {{especially}} mass consumerism {{has been}} criticized from various philosophical, cultural and political directions. Consumption can be deemed as overly conspicuous or environmentally untenable, and {{it can also be}} a mark of <b>bad</b> subjective <b>taste.</b>|$|R
25|$|Slightly-modified human wastes are {{pumped into}} the river downriver of several towns. Hamilton city {{has one of the}} most modern water {{treatment}} systems in the world following a 2003 report by GHB water consultants. In 2007 $22 million was spent upgrading the existing intake station south of the city at Riverlea. This will meet the cities demand until 2016. Waste water in its untreated state is 99.9% water and 0.1% other matter. A series of sophisticated machines produce clean water of a high standard getting rid of <b>bad</b> <b>tastes</b> odours and toxins to meet the upgraded NZ water standards. The Pukete 2 project which started in 2002 will upgrade the plant in a series of stages costing $24 million.|$|R
25|$|Heil Honey I'm Home! was a {{controversial}} 1950s-styled British sitcom about Hitler and Eva Braun living in suburbia, with Jewish next door neighbors. Eight episodes were produced, but only one, the pilot, was ever broadcast (in 1990), as both television executives and the viewers alike thought {{the show in}} deplorably <b>bad</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a {{national}} survey conducted in 2008, 64% of {{respondents indicated that they}} were satisfied with the quality of the water they received. Those who were not satisfied complained about turbidity, high levels of chlorine, <b>bad</b> <b>taste</b> and bad smell. This figure apparently does not include the level of satisfaction related to the continuity or pressure of water supply.|$|E
25|$|Osborne {{was one of}} {{the first}} writers to address Britain's purpose in the post-imperial age. He was the first to {{question}} the point of the monarchy on a prominent public stage.

50|$|Renovation of Andkhoy {{started in}} 1959, mainly {{at the eastern}} parts of the old town. The {{original}} plan of the infrastructure was reconditioned and reduced to half its volume of the developments to take place. The property owners refused to sell their land for further developments and the plan consequently failed. The infrastructure remained poor; for example, in 1973 only 13% of the houses had access to electricity and only at night. Lack of sanitary drinking water remained a major problem. The 15 meter deep wells had salty and awfully <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> water and the trenches had only twenty days running water in a month. To counteract this, there were water pools to preserve water for bad days to come every month.|$|R
25|$|Saliva is very {{important}} in the sense of taste. It is the liquid medium in which chemicals are carried to taste receptor cells (mostly associated with lingual papillae). Persons with little saliva often complain of dysgeusia (i.e. disordered taste, e.g. reduced ability to taste, or having a <b>bad,</b> metallic <b>taste</b> at all times).|$|R
25|$|Hairy tongue largely {{occurs in}} {{the central part of}} the dorsal tongue, just {{anterior}} (in front) of the circumvallate papillae, although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved. Discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue, and may be yellow, brown or black. Apart from the appearance, the condition is typically asymptomatic, but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a <b>bad</b> <b>taste.</b> There may also be associated oral malodor (intra-oral halitosis).|$|E
25|$|Judges Dieter Bohlen and Heinz Henn {{had started}} a quarrel with each other during the show. On April 14's show Henn {{made it clear that}} he did not agree with {{contestant}} Mark Medlock's song choices.

50|$|Schachter {{proposed}} that obese individuals are hypersensitive to external stimuli, both food-related and non-food related. Schachter {{found that a}} number of factors lead to differences in responses between obese individuals and normal individuals. Obese individuals will eat more than normal individuals when food is easy to get but will eat less than normal individuals when food is harder to get. An increased amount of visible food correlates with a {{decrease in the number of}} sandwiches eaten by normal individuals but an increase in the number eaten by obese individuals. Taste also caused variations in amount consumed. While both groups consumed less of the bad-tasting food than they did the good-tasting food, the obese individuals had a higher difference; they ate more of the good tasting food and less of the <b>bad</b> <b>tasting</b> food than normal individuals.|$|R
5000|$|One {{variety of}} choke pear is poire d'Angoisse, {{a variety of}} pear that was grown in Angoisse, a commune in the Arrondissement of Nontron in Dordogne, France, in the Middle Ages, which was hard, <b>bad</b> <b>tasting,</b> and almost {{impossible}} to eat raw. In the words of L'Académie française, the pear is [...] "si âpre et si revèche au goût qu'on a de la peine à l'avaler" [...] ("so harsh and crabbed of taste that one can only with difficulty swallow it"). [...] These qualities, and the common meaning of angoisse in French language ("anguish") apparently originated the French idiom avaler des poires d'angoisse ("swallow pears of Angoisse/anguish") meaning [...] "to suffer great displeasures". [...] Possibly because of this idiom, the names [...] "choke pear" [...] and [...] "pear of anguish" [...] {{have been used for}} a gagging device allegedly used in Europe, sometime before the 17th century.|$|R
