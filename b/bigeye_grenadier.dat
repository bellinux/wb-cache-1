40|$|A {{large sample}} of {{otoliths}} from <b>bigeye</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Macrourus holotrachys) caught as by-catch in the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fishery in Subarea 48. 3 was measured and weighed, and {{the usefulness of}} otoliths as predictors of fish size was determined. Otolith mass provides good estimates of fish length, whereas otolith length and width measurements provide less accurate estimates of fish length. Seasonal variations in fish mass with reproductive condition {{need to be considered}} if predictions of fish mass from otolith mass are undertaken. Otolith size/fish size models should be derived for each fish population under investigation. The length of fish chosen in such studies should be representative of the size range consumed by predators...|$|E
40|$|The {{biology of}} the <b>bigeye</b> <b>grenadier</b> Macrourus holotrachys caught as {{by-catch}} in the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides longline fishery conducted around South Georgia was investigated to improve data available for fisheries management. Age estimates suggest that M. holotrachys is a moderately slow growing species (K = 0. 10), reaching ages of > 30 years and attaining total lengths (L-T) > 80 cm (L-infinity = 33). The size at which 50 % of females {{had started to}} mature (L-int 50) for M. holotrachys was 21 cm pre-anal length (L-PA) and occurred at c. 9 years old. Estimates of natural mortality and Pauly's growth performance index {{were found to be}} low (M = 0 (.) 09 and Phi = 2. 82 respectively). Gonad maturity stage was described from macroscopic and histological investigation. Mature ovaries had oocytes at all developmental stages with between 22 and 55 % likely to be spawned each year. Absolute fecundity ranged from 22 000 to 260 000 eggs and was positively correlated with both pre-anal length and mass. A highly skewed sex ratio of 32 : 1, females: males, was found for specimens caught by longlines but not for a small sample of shallower trawl-caught specimens. It is suggested that females are far more susceptible to longline capture than males. Macrourus holotrachys is a bentho-pelagic predator and scavenger that feeds {{on a wide range of}} fishes and invertebrates. The fish are long lived, slow-growing species typical of deep-water grenadiers; fisheries management strategies should reflect their probable susceptibility to overfishing.

40|$|International audienceâ€˜POKER 2006 ', {{a bottom}} trawl fish biomass survey, was {{conducted}} from September to October 2006 {{in the northern}} part of the Kerguelen Plateau (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58. 5. 1). The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, <b>bigeye</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey. Some shelf and slope species (mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii)) exhibit low levels of biomass when compared to the results of previous surveys (SKALP surveys, 1987 and 1988). Other species (unicorn icefish (Channichthys rhinoceratus) and grey rockcod (Lepidonotothen squamifrons)) seem to have increased, even doubled, their biomass during the period between the two surveys. In addition to the commercial species, Zanclorhynchus spinifer was abundant on the shelf and Alepocephalus cf. antipodianus was abundant in the deep sea; the data on the latter are new. Data on the geographic and bathymetric distribution of the species provide evidence of geographically very stable species-specific concentrations. Distinct cohorts of some species (D. eleginoides and C. gunnari) were detected in some sectors. The survey has defined the distribution of species, commercial or not, that are important in the ecosystem and are of major interest for the management and conservation of fish populations in the are...|$|E
