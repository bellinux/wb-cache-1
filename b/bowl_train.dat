50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Arcadia Station {{was used as}} a testing ground for a number of special or {{experimental}} passenger rail services. After the Pasadena Subdivision was decommissioned in 1994, Arcadia became the destination for Metrolink's Rose <b>Bowl</b> <b>Train</b> on New Year's Day. In 1996, a Sprinter was run from Arcadia to Monrovia. For an unknown period of time, the station was the home of a private railcar called the Pine Bluff until its purchase in the mid-2000s. Amtrak-Santa Fe ran the Southwest Chief and Desert Wind over this line in Arcadia, but relocated the Desert Wind to the Fullerton Line in 1986. The Santa Fe line served the San Gabriel Valley until 1994, when the 1994 Northridge earthquake weakened the bridge in Arcadia.|$|E

50|$|After loading in the station, {{the train}} moves forward and stops. Mist blows {{in front of}} the train and thunder sounds as the train {{launches}} to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds by linear synchronous motors. The train immediately goes into a 140 ft Immelmann loop. After the first element, the train then goes down its first drop into a 125 ft vertical loop, the tallest vertical loop on a Wing Coaster, surpassing Wild Eagle at Dollywood. After the vertical loop, the train crosses over the exit from The Voyage's second drop, goes through an overbanked turn, and then an overbanked elevated spiral. The train then goes through a zero-g-roll parallel to The Voyage. After several curves next to The Voyage's triple-down drop and spaghetti <b>bowl,</b> the <b>train</b> dips down into a barn (which is the keyhole) where it then curves left back into the barn by doing an inline twist, crossing over The Voyage's underground tunnels. Once the inline twist ends the train enters the brake run to a right turn to another set of brakes before entering the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 1 minute and 18 seconds.|$|R

50|$|Construction of the Sugar Bowl {{lodge and}} the first {{chairlift}} installed in California, began {{during the summer of}} 1939. The lodge was designed by William Wurster and was erected with a sloping roof, so that snow would slide off towards the back side. The chairlift was designed by Henry Howard and built by the Riblet Tramway Company. Moore Dry Dock Company was hired to install the 13 towers, which were included in Howard's design, to span the 1,000 vertical feet {{up to the top of}} Mt. Disney. Miners were brought in from Nevada City and used shovels and picks and sometimes dynamite, to clear away trees and dig footings for the towers by hand. Lava formation in the mountain was encountered during construction and some of the footings had to be set within it. Sugar Bowl opened on December 15, 1939, but it hadn't snowed enough to go skiing yet, so a makeshift ice rink the size of a tennis court was quickly set up for everyone to enjoy. Two weeks later on January 4, 1940, a blizzard struck Sugar Bowl and the skiing at Sugar <b>Bowl</b> began, with <b>train</b> load after train load of skiers coming in unexpected numbers.|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} physical loading on the health status of the college students who attend the physical education activity classes, the subjective changes in their living body caused by exercise were studied according to sex and type of activity. In this investigation, 225 college students attending their physical education class for 50 minutes, were asked of their subjective symptoms of fatigue {{before and after the}} physical education activities (tennis, racketball, <b>bowling</b> and weight <b>training)</b> by questionnaire. The score of subjective symptoms of fatigue group I; "drowsiness and dullness" was decreased in those after the tennis games. The symptoms of "thirsty" (P< 0. 05) and "hands and legs trembling" (p< 0. 01) were significantly increased after the tennis games in men. The subjective symptoms of fatigue group I; "drowsiness and dullness" showed a decreasing trend after racketball games in both men and women, though symptoms of "tired legs" and "thirsty" were significantly increased after the racketball games (p< 0. 01). "Feeling like yawning" and "feeling sleepy" were significantly decreased after the bowling games (p< 0. 01) though symptom of "thirsty" was significantly increased (p< 0. 05). The symptoms of "feeling exhausted", "tired legs", "thirsty" and "hands and legs trembling" were significantly increased after weight training exercises (p< 0. 01) though symptoms of "feeling like yawning" and "feeling sleepy" were significantly decreased in men (p< 0. 01). However, the symptoms of fatigue before and after physical loading were not increased though the symptom of "tired eyes" was significantly decreased (p< 0. 01) in women. In conclusion, physical loading had little effect on the health status of the students. Therefore the physical education classes in this investigation could be expected to be of recreational benefit for the students...|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the larger}} field, many American {{football}} venues are generally unfit for the Canadian game. While there are several American stadia which could accommodate the extra [...] feet (nearly 6 yd per side in width (multi-purpose stadiums, baseball parks converted for football, and some soccer-specific stadiums are particularly good fits), most American stadia would lose between fifteen and eighteen rows of seating in each end zone because the field is 15 yd longer on each end. In many smaller venues, {{this would be the}} entire end zone section, losing seating for at least 3,000 spectators. During the CFL's failed expansion to American cities, Canadian football was either played on converted baseball grounds, or in some cases, on a field designed for American football (for instance, the Memphis Mad Dogs and the Birmingham Barracudas of the CFL, playing in the Liberty Bowl and at Legion Field, respectively, played the Canadian game on American fields because of the inability of the stadia to adapt to the larger field). The Alamodome, originally built as a multi-purpose dome, proved to best accommodate both Canadian football (the CFL's San Antonio Texans) and American football (Alamo <b>Bowl,</b> Dallas Cowboys <b>training</b> camp, the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina, the NFLPA Game, the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and the UTSA Roadrunners), although Canadian football is no longer played there. Similarly, Hornet Stadium fairly easily adapted to both the Canadian and American game, as it was built with a running track in which the Canadian field fits with only some cuts to the corners. Hornet Stadium hosts California State University, Sacramento (more often known as Sacramento State), hosted the Sacramento Surge and Sacramento Mountain Lions in American football and hosted the Sacramento Gold Miners in Canadian football.|$|R
40|$|Cricket is an {{established}} and traditional sport which is played in almost 100 countries worldwide. Within {{the domain of}} cricket, ball launching machines are used in a training environment to help batsmen develop new techniques, work on areas of weakness and face a high intensity of deliveries {{without the need for}} a real bowler. A need has been recognised by coaches at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for an advanced training system which incorporates the unique requirements of cricket bowling to include a fully programmable bowling machine which is capable of recreating any common bowling delivery and which is synchronised with an accurate bowler representation. A number of ball launching devices are currently available for sports training which provide a simple means of bowling, pitching or throwing a ball to a batsman or fielder. As technology progresses so too does the development of this equipment to produce more realistic training conditions. However much of this development has occurred within the domain of baseball and cannot easily be transferred into cricket. The research within this thesis is focused upon the development of a cricket specific training system. The requirements of the system have been developed using the House of Quality (HoQ) planning matrix following interviews and discussion forums with the system stakeholders. The focus of the current research has been the design and development of a bowling machine which is felt to be the key aspect of a training system which fulfils the need identified by the ECB coaching staff. The machine which has been developed is controlled using a computer based user interface (UI) and has the potential to recreate any bowling delivery with an accurate ball seam orientation and spin direction. This includes correctly oriented rifle spin which is necessary for spin bowling deliveries and which is not possible using any currently available machine technologies. Comparison testing has been carried out between the prototype machine, competitor machines and elite level spin bowlers. This has shown that the The Design and Development of a Novel Training System for Cricket prototype machine is capable of delivering the ball with similar speed and spin characteristics when compared to real bowlers and as such it outperforms existing technologies. In addition {{to the development of the}} machine, methods of representing a bowler have also been considered. The bowler representation application has been identified as a form of Augmented Reality where the real cricket bowling machine and a virtual bowler must be synchronised to deliver the ball simultaneously. A review of current technologies has been undertaken and is has been concluded from this investigation that the bowler representation should take the form of a display which is projected using a front projector with an image brightness in excess of 4000 lumens to ensure image clarity over the cricket wicket. In addition the screen used to project the image should be sharp over a narrow angle and robust for the harsh training environment, therefore a specular or fibreglass screen is required.
