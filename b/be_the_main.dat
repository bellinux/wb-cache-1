5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was {{perceived}} by the public to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered {{a greater proportion of}} the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity.

5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct rendezvous with the bombers, {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag). The longer-range bombers were ordered directly to fighter airfields {{to pick up their}} escorts {{on the way to the}} target. He determined that as many fighters as possible should remain on sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with the bombers. For now, this would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E

At the time the Australians believed there were around 390 Japanese defending the area surrounding the Genga River—considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> Japanese defence line in the northern sector—but it was later determined {{to be closer to}} 900 men from the 81st Infantry Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Shinzo Nakamura.|$|E

5|$|Overall the {{operation}} appeared to meet few of its initial aims. The political approach did {{lead to an}} increased discussion amongst {{the lower levels of}} Swedish officialdom as to the possibility of an invasion in Norway. However, it failed to convince the higher levels of government (with the exception of Nordenskiöld, who did not communicate his beliefs to anyone). Even the purchase of Norwegian securities went unnoticed. The overriding belief within the Swedish government was that any invasion of Norway would be diversionary, and that the European mainland would always <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> target of the Allies.|$|E
