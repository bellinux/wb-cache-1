I don't defend the game of politics as it is played, Mr. Wetherell, but all of us who are friends of Jethro's are generally willing to lend a hand in any little manoeuvre that is going on, and have a practical joke when we can. It was not until I saw you sitting there beside Duncan that the idea occurred to me. It didn't make a great deal of difference whether Duncan or Lovejoy got to the House or not, provided they didn't learn of the matter too early, because some of their men had been bought off that day. It suited Jethro's sense of humor to play the game that way--and it was very effective. When I saw you there beside Duncan I remembered that he had spoken about the Guardian letters, and the notion occurred to me to get him to show you his library. I have explained to him that you were innocent. I--I hope you haven't been worrying." ...|$|E
6000|$|The liberals were, to all appearance, {{pledged to}} the {{reconstruction}} [...] {{of the tax}} by their opinions, and the tories by their party [...] following. The small fraction of Peelites could probably be relied [...] upon the other way, and some few individuals with financial [...] knowledge and experience. The mission {{of the new government}} was [...] described by Lord Aberdeen in the House of Lords as a financial [...] mission, and the stress of it thus lay upon a person, very [...] ill-prepared. My opinions were with Peel; but under such [...] circumstances it was my duty to make a close and searching [...] investigation into the whole nature of the tax, and make up my mind [...] whether there was any means of accepting or compounding with the [...] existing state of opinion. I went to work, and laboured very hard. [...] When I had entered gravely upon my financial studies, I one day had [...] occasion--I know not what--to go into the city and to call upon [...] Mr. Samuel Gurney, to whom experience and character had given a [...] high position there. He asked me with interest about my [...] preparations for my budget; and he said, 'One thing I will venture [...] to urge, whatever your plan is,--let it be simple.' I was a man [...] much disposed to defer to authority, and I attached weight to this [...] advice. But as I went further and further into my subject, I became [...] more and more convinced that, as an honest steward, I had no option [...] but to propose the renewal of the tax in its uniform shape. I [...] constructed much elaborate argument in support of my proposition, [...] which I knew {{it would be difficult to}} answer. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that [...] no amount of unassisted argument would suffice to overcome the [...] obstacles in my way, and that this could only be done by large [...] compensations in my accompanying propositions.

6000|$|A {{walk on the}} Neck was {{proposed}} in {{the cool of the}} evening; for Satanstoe had many a pleasant path, pretty vista, and broad view. Away we went, then, the four of us, Kate leading the way, as the person most familiar with the [...] "capabilities." [...] We were soon on the shore of the Sound, and at a point where a firm, wide beach of sand had been left by the receding waters, rocks fringing the inner boundary toward the main. Here one could walk without confinement of any sort, there being room to go in pairs, or all abreast, as we might choose. Miss Bayard seeming a little coy, and manifesting a desire to keep near her friend, I abandoned the intention of walking at her side, but fell behind a little, and got into discourse with her brother. Nor was I sorry to have this early opportunity of sounding the party who was likely soon to become so nearly connected with me. After a few minutes, the conversation turned on the late revolution, {{and the manner in which}} it was likely to influence the future fortunes of the country. I knew that a portion of the family of my companion had adhered to the crown, losing their estates by the act of confiscation; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that a portion did not, and I was left to infer that Tom's branch belonged to the latter division of his name, inasmuch as his father was known to be very easy in his circumstances, if not absolutely rich. It was not long, however, before I ascertained that my new friend was a mild tory, and that he would have been better pleased had the rights we had sought, and which he was willing enough to admit had been violated, been secured without a separation of the two countries. As the Littlepages had actually been in arms against the crown, three generations of them, too, at the same time, and the fact could be no secret, I was pleased with the candor with which Tom Bayard expressed his opinions on these points; for it spoke well of the truth and general sincerity of his character.|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} {{is caused}} by the coming of the King; and I wish that I could present that event in just its sincere unimpressiveness. I have assisted at several such events on the Continent, where, especially in Germany, they are heralded as they are in the theatre, with a blare of trumpets, and a sensation in the populace and the attendant military little short of an ague fit. There, as soon as the majesties mount into their carriages from the station, they drive off as swiftly as their horses can trot, and their subjects, who have been waiting for hours to see them, make what they can of a meagre half-minute's glimpse of them. But how different was the behavior of that easy- going Majesty of England! As soon as I heard that he was coming, I perceived how anxious I had been in the half-year of my English sojourn to see him, and how bitterly I should have been disappointed to leave his realms without it. All kings are bad, I knew that well enough; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that some kings are not so bad as others, and I had been willing to accept at their face the golden opinions of this King, which, almost without exception, his lieges seemed to hold. Of course {{it is not hard to}} think well of a king if you are under him, just as it is not hard to think ill of him if you are not under him; but there is no use being bigotedly republican when there is nothing to be got by it, and I own the fact that his subjects like him willingly. Probably no man in his kingdom understands better than Edward VII. that he is largely a form, and that the more a form he is the more conformable he is to the English ideal of a monarch. But no Englishman apparently knows better than he when to leave off being a form and become a man, and he has endeared himself to his people from time to time by such inspirations. He is reputed on all hands to be a man of great good sense; if he is ever fooled it is not by himself, but by the system which he is no more a part of than the least of his subjects. If he will let a weary old man or a delicate woman stand indefinitely before him, he is no more to blame for that than for speaking English with a trace of German in his th sounds; he did not invent his origins or his traditions. Personally, having had it out with life, he is as amiable and as unceremonious as a king may be. He shares, as far as he can, the great and little interests of his people. He has not, so far as noted, the gifts of some of his sisters, but he has much of his mother's steadfast wisdom, and his father's instinct for the right side in considerable questions; and he has his father's prescience of the psychological moment for not bothering. Of course, he is a fetish; no Englishman can deny that the kingship is an idolatry; but he is a fetish with an uncommon share of the common man's divinity. The system which provides him for the people provides them the best administration in the world, always naturally in the hands of their superiors, social and political; but we could be several times rottener than we administratively are, and still be incalculably reasonabler, as republicans, than those well-governed monarchists.|$|E

In the team's autobiography from the same year, Hound Dog, Stoller himself remarks that he had created this [...] "fill" [...] while doing a piano accompaniment when the song was presented to Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records, with Spector playing guitar and Leiber doing the vocal.

5000|$|The {{second major}} theme of Hayden's gubernatorial career was to reappraise {{properties}} {{in order to}} adjust property taxes.

He put a system in place that worked annually with one third of the property population so that there would be a turnover in property taxes every three years. The reappraisal raised taxes on some of the citizens, and lowered the taxes on others. It helped the farmers and homeowners, but commercial property owners and real estate agents were enraged at how the property tax appraisal turned out. The issue heavily split the Republican party.
