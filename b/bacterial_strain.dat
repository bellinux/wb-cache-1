5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a <b>bacterial</b> <b>strain.</b> However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E

Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer. Similar stringency is required in PAM or the <b>bacterial</b> <b>strain</b> remains phage sensitive.|$|E

25|$|Phage {{display is}} a {{different}} use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein. Each phage's genome encodes the variant of the protein displayed on its surface (hence the name), providing {{a link between the}} peptide variant and its encoding gene. Variant phages from the library can be selected through their binding affinity to an immobilized molecule (e.g., botulism toxin) to neutralize it. The bound, selected phages can be multiplied by reinfecting a susceptible <b>bacterial</b> <b>strain,</b> thus allowing them to retrieve the peptides encoded in them for further study.|$|E
25|$|Although biofuel {{demand has}} risen to over one billion liters (about 260 million US gallons) yearly, {{fermentation}} remains a largely inefficient method of butanol production. Under normal living conditions, Clostridium bacterial communities have a low yield of butanol per gram of glucose. Obtaining higher yields of butanol involves manipulation of the metabolic networks within bacteria to prioritize the synthesis of the biofuel. Metabolic engineering and genetic engineering tools allow scientists to alter the states of reactions occurring in the organism, utilizing advanced techniques to create a <b>bacterial</b> <b>strain</b> capable of high butanol yield. Optimization can also be accomplished by the transfer of specific genetic information to other uni-cellular species, capitalizing on the traits of multiple organisms to achieve {{the highest rate of}} alcohol production.|$|E

25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, {{it is in a}} very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular <b>bacterial</b> <b>strain</b> (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Ahringer C. elegans RNAi feeding library {{prepared}} by cloning genomic DNA fragments {{has been widely}} used in genome-wide analysis of gene function. However, the library has not been thoroughly validated by direct sequencing, and there are potential errors, including: 1) mis-annotation (the clone with the retired gene name should be remapped to the actual target gene); 2) nonspecific PCR amplification; 3) cross-RNAi; 4) mis-operation such as sample loading error, etc. Results Here we performed a reliability analysis on the Ahringer C. elegans RNAi feeding library, which contains 16, 256 <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains,</b> using a bioinformatics approach. Results demonstrated that most (98. 3 %) of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains</b> in the library are reliable. However, {{we also found that}} 2, 851 (17. 54 %) <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains</b> need to be re-annotated even they are reliable. Most of these <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains</b> are the clones having the retired gene names. Besides, 28 strains are grouped into unreliable category and 226 strains are marginal because of probably expressing unrelated double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). The accuracy of the prediction was further confirmed by direct sequencing analysis of 496 <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains.</b> Finally, a freely accessible database named CelRNAi ([URL]) was developed as a valuable complement resource for the feeding RNAi library by providing the predicted information on all <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains.</b> Moreover, submission of the direct sequencing result or any other annotations for the <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains</b> to the database are allowed and will be integrated into the CelRNAi database to improve the accuracy of the library. In addition, we provide five candidate primer sets for each of the unreliable and marginal <b>bacterial</b> <b>strains</b> for users to construct an alternative vector for their own RNAi studies.
