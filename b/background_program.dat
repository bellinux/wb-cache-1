The program was generally produced in New York City and Washington, DC, but often was produced around the world including Osaka, Japan; Saigon, South Vietnam; Cairo, Egypt; Bonn, Germany; or Paris, France. Boyd's on-air career began in Boston, Mass. the 1970s as a general assignment reporter when WCVB-TV {{went on the air}} in 1972. He co-anchored weekend newscasts from 1976 to 1984*, early mornings from 1984 to 2000 and noontime newscasts from 1984 to 2006 when he was named special correspondent and field reporter for both WCVB's broadcast news operation and its website TheBostonChannel.com (now WCVB.Com).

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the apparent effectiveness {{of environmental education}} essential elements in school field trip programming. First, the elements essential to environmental education field trips were identified from the literature.

Finally, 24 environmental education programs at eight institutions in Montreal were observed to investigate the extent and methodology of implementation of the essential elements. With regard to the chief institution, {{it was concluded that}} (1) the educational programming appeared to significantly increase environmental knowledge, and (2) the environmental attitudes were most strongly correlated with student <b>background.</b> <b>Program</b> observation at the eight institutions demonstrated that a wide array of environmental topics was presented, but there was insufficient instruction of environmental issues and action strategies.

40|$|Although parent {{education}} {{and involvement in}} early childhood intervention programs {{is believed to be}} crucial to successful outcomes for children, research is not clear on what type of parent involvement is most important. Even Start Family Literacy programs afford a rare opportunity to study this topic because they focus on educating parent and child simultaneously, as well as incorporating {{parent education}} and parent involvement in the child’s literacy development. Using data from Even Start Family Literacy programs in a Southwestern state, this study investigated whether relations exist between a parents ’ educational <b>background,</b> <b>program</b> involvement, adult education outcomes and children’s preschool achievement outcomes. A discussion of limitations and future research is included. Results indicated that a) parents with higher levels of prior education tended to make lower gains on adult education measures, b) greater participation was related to greater gains in adult oral and literacy outcomes, c) parent gains in oral and literacy skills were related to children’s gains in problem-solving and language skills. In addition, after controlling for background factors, parent gains in literacy were predictive of children’s achievement outcomes...|$|E

40|$|A {{recent survey}} of 29 {{software}} projects of various size at Hewlett-Packard (“IEEE Software ” 10 : 5 [Sept/Oct ’ 03], pp 78 - 85), found that on average programmers produced 26 lines of code each day. A separate informal survey asked the question “How many lines of code can you write and be confident in their correctness? ” The average answer was seven. A humorous yet not-overly-pessimistic view suggests that most programmers create at least one bug every day. While {{the average number of}} lines written by programmers in a day has increased slightly in the last 20 years, {{it is unlikely that the}} number of correct lines of code that a programmer can write with confidence is growing. According to a 2002 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), software errors cost the U. S. economy an estimated $ 60 billion annually, or about 0. 6 percent of the GDP. This should place research aimed at improving the quality of software near the top of the agenda for computer science institutions. I feel that tools for program verification, program understanding, and reverse engineering are among the most pressing needs in our field. In my thesis, I addressed what I believe to be the most complex aspect of software, and one that has resisted many automatic methods of quality control: linked data structures. The subject of my thesis is shape analysis, static analysis that establishes properties of programs that perform destructive manipulation of heap-allocated linked data structures. <b>Background</b> <b>Program</b> verification is the process of applying formal methods to establish that a program satisfies a specification.

40|$|Abstract <b>Background</b> <b>Program</b> {{coverage}} {{is likely to}} be an important determinant of the effectiveness of community interventions to reduce neonatal mortality. Rigorous examination and documentation of methods to scale-up interventions and measure coverage are scarce, however. To address this knowledge gap, this paper describes the process and measurement of scaling-up coverage of a community mobilisation intervention for maternal, child and neonatal health in rural Bangladesh and critiques this real-life experience in relation to available literature on scaling-up. Methods Scale-up activities took place in nine unions in rural Bangladesh. Recruitment and training of those who deliver the intervention, communication and engagement with the community and other stakeholders and active dissemination of intervention activities are described. Process evaluation and population survey data are presented and used to measure coverage and the success of scale-up. Results The intervention was scaled-up from 162 women's groups to 810, representing a five-fold increase in population coverage. The proportion of women of reproductive age and pregnant women who were engaged in the intervention increased from 9 % and 3 %, respectively, to 23 % and 29 %. Conclusions Examination and documentation of how scaling-up was successfully initiated, led, managed and monitored in rural Bangladesh provide a deeper knowledge base and valuable lessons. Strong operational capabilities and institutional knowledge of the implementing organisation were {{critical to the success of}} scale-up. It was possible to increase community engagement with the intervention without financial incentives and without an increase in managerial staff. Monitoring and feedback systems that allow for periodic programme corrections and continued innovation are central to successful scale-up and require programmatic and operational flexibility. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract, Context Palliative {{medicine}} (PM), {{still in}} the development phase, is a new, growing specialty aimed at caring for both oncology and non-oncology patients. There is still confusion about the training offered in the various European PM certification programs. Objectives To provide a detailed, comparative update {{and analysis of the}} PM certification process in Europe, including the different training approaches and their main features. Methods Experts from each country completed an online survey addressing historical <b>background,</b> <b>program</b> name, training requirements, length of time in training, characteristic and content, official certifying institution, effectiveness of accreditation, and 2013 workforce capacity. We prepared a comparative analysis of the data provided. Results In 2014, 18 of 53 European countries had official programs on specialization in PM (POSPM) : Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and the U. K. Ten of these programs were begun in the last five years. The PM is recognized as a “specialty,” “subspecialty,” or “special area of competence,” with no substantial differences between the last two designations. The certification contains the term “palliative medicine” in most countries. Clinical training varies, with one to two years being the most frequent duration. There is a clear trend toward establishing the POSPM as a mandatory condition for obtaining a clinical PM position in countries' respective health systems. Conclusion PM is growing as a specialization field in Europe. Processes leading to certification are generally long and require substantial clinical training. The POSPM education plans are heterogeneous. The European Association for Palliative Care should commit to establishing common learning standards, leading to additional European-based recognition of expertise in PM...|$|E
