They were supplied by the banker and Royal Goldsmith, SirRobert Vyner, at a cost of £12,184– as much as three warships. A medieval anointing spoon and three swords had survived and were returned to the Crown, as were some historically important gemstones. Between 1660 and 1663, at the additional cost of some £18,000, almost two tons (4,400lb) of altar and banqueting plate were made for the king.|$|E

His revised and condensed two-volume Life of Washington was published in 1832.

25|$|A 2010 {{study found}} that, {{as a result}} of rising {{temperatures}} and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century, the rice yield growth rate has decreased in many parts of Asia, compared to what would have been observed had the temperature and solar radiation trends not occurred. The yield growth rate had fallen 10–20% at some locations. The study was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>records</b> from 227 farms in Thailand, Vietnam, Nepal, India, China, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. The mechanism of this falling yield was not clear, but might involve increased respiration during warm nights, which expends energy without being able to photosynthesize.|$|E

About 1803, a merchant named Robert Campbell imported a bay Arabian stallion, Hector, from India; Hector was said to have been owned by Arthur Wellesley, who later became known as the Duke of Wellington. In 1804 two additional Arabians, also from India, arrived in Tasmania one of whom, White William, sired the first purebred Arabian foal born in Australia, a stallion named Derwent.|$|E
500|$|A five-by-five {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a total of five in five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks—in a single game. Statistics for steals and blocks were not kept in the NBA until the 1973–74 season, so NBA five-by-fives were only possible from that season onward. Hakeem Olajuwon (six times) and Andrei Kirilenko (three times) are the only players to have recorded multiple five-by-fives (<b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>records</b> since the [...] season). Both are also the only players to record five-by-sixes (at least six in all five statistical categories). Only twice has a five-by-five coincided with a triple-double (both by Olajuwon) and only three times has a player recorded a five-by-five without registering at least a double-double (two by Kirilenko and one by Marcus Camby).|$|E

500|$|The {{surviving}} published {{version of}} the musical score appears in the format of a simplified keyboard transcription using a two-staff system (treble and bass). [...] It includes only occasional notations about the instruments used in the original full orchestral score, which has not survived. Therefore, musical elements from the original production such as inner harmonic parts, countermelodies, and accompaniment figurations are no longer known. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>records</b> of payments made to musicians at The Chestnut Street Theatre {{at the time of}} the premiere, it was likely that the production employed approximately 25 pieces, which may have consisted of pairs of woodwinds (flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons) and brasses (horns and trumpets) as well as some timpani and strings. Typically, however, the entire orchestra was used only for the overture and selected large chorus numbers, while solo numbers were accompanied by strings and one or two pairs of woodwinds. The brasses and timpani may have been used to invoke a sense of the military in numbers like Walter’s “Captain Smith.” ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Carew's {{claim of}} insubordination {{has been given}} support by James Watt, former Medical Director-General of the Royal Navy, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>records</b> of an {{epidemic}} of dysentery in Portsmouth which could have rendered the crew incapable of handling the ship properly, while historian Richard Barker {{has suggested that the}} crew actually knew that the ship was an accident waiting to happen, at which they balked and refused to follow orders. Marsden has noted that the Carew biography is in some details inconsistent with the sequence of events reported by both French and English eyewitnesses. It also reports that there were 700 men on board, an unusually high number. The distance in time to the event it describes may mean that it was embellished to add a dramatic touch. The report of French galleys sinking the Mary Rose as stated by Martin du Bellay has been described as [...] "the account of a courtesan" [...] by naval historian Maurice de Brossard. Du Bellay and his two brothers were close to king FrancisI and du Bellay had much to gain from portraying the sinking as a French victory. English sources, even if biased, would have nothing to gain from portraying the sinking as the result of crew incompetence rather than conceding to a victory to the much-feared gun galleys.|$|E
