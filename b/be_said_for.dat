5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> {{the souls of the}} family, both living and dead. It was built by Peter Lyte in about 1343, and was completed by 1358, and would have served both the original manor which now no longer survives and later {{the existing}} house. It has a small window, or squint, that permitted servants and others to observe communion from the house.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech had the edge in experience, forcing Georgia's defense to concentrate on stopping Tech's run game. Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took {{the field in the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl. The same could not <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> Georgia, whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Filling his role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with insights into the Tech defense.|$|E
5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} {{is that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from the nave pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E

5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, having been built around 1343, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> {{the souls of the}} family, both living and dead. The great hall was added in the 15th century and the Oriel Room in the 16th. Various renovations were undertaken during the 16th and 17th centuries after which the house fell into disrepair with the north range being demolished by the early 19th century. In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets bought the house and restored it in a period style, furnishing it with fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture, antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles, along with historic and period paintings. On his death in 1948 he left the house to the National Trust.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards {{to see themselves as}} heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that the}} local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the {{historian of the}} race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled {{because it was too}} early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{replication}} and transcription of DNA {{is highly}} standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> their karyotypes, {{which are often}} highly variable. There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization.|$|E

25|$|Prognathism, if not {{extremely}} severe, can {{be treated}} in growing patients with orthodontic functional or orthopaedic appliances. In adult patients this condition can be corrected {{by means of a}} combined surgical/orthodontic treatment, where most of the time a mandibular advancement is performed. The same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> mandibular prognathism.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{replication}} and transcription of DNA {{is highly}} standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> their karyotypes, which are highly variable.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, the Brothers {{reached the}} apogee of their fame with the story The Porcupines' War. It was filmed and {{subsequently}} released as a TV miniseries, which was viewed by nearly everyone living in Bulgaria at the time. The same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> Vasko de Gama from Rupcha Village, another extremely successful film based on a Mormarevi screenplay, released as TV miniseries in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Early {{theories}} placed Huron {{origin in}} the St. Lawrence Valley, with some arguing for a presence near Montreal and other St. Lawrence Iroquoian peoples. Wendat is an Iroquoian language. Recent research in linguistics and archaeology confirm such a historical connection between the Huron and the St. Lawrence Iroquois, but the same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>for</b> the Erie people, {{any or all of}} the later Six Nations of the Iroquois, or the defunct Susquehannocks.|$|E
25|$|In one {{of several}} of the graces or miracles narrated by Fr.
