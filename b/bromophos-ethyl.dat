40|$|Understanding the {{sorption}} equilibria of microcontaminants in soils {{requires the}} determination of the adsorbed analytes as well as those remaining in solution. On-line filtration-plus-LC-type microextraction offers an efficient alternative to the time-consuming classical procedures. The feasibility of a new simultaneous filtration-plus-liquid-chromatographic microextraction system with subsequent GCMS to study the partition equilibrium of pesticides in the interface soil-water was investigated. The method allows {{the determination of}} the amount of pesticide adsorbed in the soil and that remaining in solution by a single injection of the total slurry. As an example, the adsorption equilibria of selected pesticides, ranging from relatively polar triazines to nonpolar compounds such as hexachlorobenzene or <b>bromophos-ethyl,</b> in an organic soil were studied. Once separated and preconcentrated, the filter and the solid-phase cartridge fractions were independently dried by a stream of nitrogen, extracted with methyl acetate, and analyzed by GC-MS. The standard deviations for the total procedure were lower than 6. 2 % (soil) and 10 % (solution). The soil-water partition coefficients calculated for the selected compounds showed a good correlation with published octanol-water partition coefficients (...|$|E
40|$|Column liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) with pneumatically assisted electrospray (PA-ESP) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) followed by (tandem) mass spectrometry (MS or MS-MS) {{was used for}} the analysis of a test mixture of 17 pesticides. In order to achieve low-ng/l detection limits, solid-phase extraction (SPE) of a 100 -ml aqueous sample on a small cartridge packed with a hydrophobic sorbent was used. The LC set-up was coupled on-line to the MS part of the system. The complete analysis was automated by means of a gradient controller and a Prospekt valve switching, solvent selection and cartridge exchange unit. When using SPE-LC with either APCI or PA-ESP, the detection limits of 15 (out of the 17) pesticides in tap water were 0. 007 - 3 Î¼g/l in the full-scan and 0. 1 - 200 ng/l in the SIM mode, with an analysis time of 65 min. Fenchlorphos and <b>bromophos-ethyl</b> could not be detected by either ionization method. APCI full-scan spectra showed much less sodium and acetonitrile/water cluster adducts than PA-ESP spectra. Negative ion (NI) operation was less sensitive {{for the majority of the}} compounds tested (73 in total), but several organophosphorus pesticides, nitrophenols and chlorophenols only gave a response in the NI mode. PA-ESP-MS-MS and APCI-MS-MS gave similar product-ion spectra from protonated molecules; an MS-MS library was built for more than 60 pesticides and their degradation products, at constant settings of collision gas pressure (argon, 2. 0 X 1...|$|E
