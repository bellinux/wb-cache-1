40|$|The {{issue of}} pension benefit {{security}} {{has returned to}} the foreground of both economic and political debate in many OECD countries- following high profile losses of pension benefits due to plan sponsors becoming bankrupt and leaving underfunded pension schemes. Some countries have dealt with pension benefit protection via strong funding rules (the route taken for example by the Dutch authorities). Two OECD papers examine other methods for increasing benefit security in retirement – via pension benefit guarantee schemes (such as the Pension Protection Fund recently introduced in the UK) and the position of pension creditors within insolvency proceedings (which has been examined, for example, in Canada). Pension Benefit Guarantee Schemes are insurance type arrangements- with premiums paid by pension funds- which take on outstanding obligations which cannot be met by the insolvent plan sponsors. Arguments for such schemes stem from ‘market failure ’ (with workers not fully understanding the trade off between pensions – deferred wages – and current income), and diversification – as most workers are highly exposed to the insolvency of the plan sponsor (in terms of current and retirement income) and cannot properly diversify this risk (particularly where the pension is funded by <b>book</b> <b>reserves).</b> However challenges to these schemes exist – mainly in the form of moral hazard and adverse selection – which are problems for all insurance contracts, and potentially in the form of systematic risk (as bankruptcies tend t...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>reserve</b> <b>book</b> systems in academic libraries is re-viewed and problems with existing <b>reserve</b> <b>book</b> systems are discussed. The {{results are presented}} as a small-scale study of closed stack <b>reserve</b> <b>book</b> reading by one class of library school students. Waiting time and inconvenience occur even with a small class of fifteen students when {{only one or two}} copies of the required readings are placed on reserve and when students are only given the interval between two class periods to do the reading. The data from this study were used to develop a minimum cost decision model based on multiple channel infinite queueing theory. The study concludes that student waiting time is a significant and, until now, largely ignored factor in <b>reserve</b> <b>book</b> systems. ''T HE UNSATISFACTORINESS of the re-served book arrangements in most col-leges is agreed to by students, librar-ians, and instructors alike. The brief periods for which the books may be used, the necessity for many duplicates, the waste involved when reading lists are changed, the large number of vol-umes tied up which are not used, the crowded, noisy and restless condition of the <b>reserved</b> <b>book</b> reading room, the tendency of students never to go beyond the books given this special handling, are all causes of complaint.

40|$|The <b>book</b> <b>reserve</b> {{system is}} the most {{widespread}} method of financing occupational pension plans in Germany. The pension liabilities are mutually insured by the Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein VVaG (PSVaG) against bankruptcy. The PSVaG recently stated that the insurance system needed to be reformed. In the future, risk-adjusted premiums as foreseen for the newly established Pension Protection Fund in the United Kingdom could become feasible. We perform a credit portfolio analysis to determine the risk profile of the PSVaG. The magnitude of a tail risk event suggests that under the current financing system {{it can only be}} smoothed out over decades. Under an expected loss pricing plan insurance premiums would vary greatly. In a marginal risk contribution approach the variation of the premiums would be less pronounced.

50|$|The Pontifical is {{practically}} an episcopal ritual, containing formularies and rubrics for the sacraments and sacramentals {{which may be}} celebrated by a bishop, including especially the consecration of holy Chrism, and the sacraments of confirmation and Holy orders. However, {{it does not include}} the rites for the Mass or the Divine Office, which {{can be found in the}} Roman Missal and Liturgy of the Hours respectively. Because of the use of the adjective pontifical in other contexts to refer to the Pope, it is sometimes mistakenly thought that the Pontificale Romanum is a <b>book</b> <b>reserved</b> to the Pope. It could be argued that it is the book of those entitled to the use, in certain contexts, of the pontificalia, i.e. episcopal insignia.
