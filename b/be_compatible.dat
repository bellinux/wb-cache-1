5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water.

5|$|Because of {{religious}} and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> and wanted to found a society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E

5|$|Callisto {{has a very}} tenuous {{atmosphere}} {{composed of}} carbon dioxide. It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2micrometers. The surface pressure {{is estimated to be}} 7.5 bar (0.75 µPa) and particle density 4cm3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4days (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E

5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course <b>be</b> <b>compatible.</b> All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E

Bamber and two prisoners, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore, appealed that decision too, and in 2013 the European Court's Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software {{that they had not}} been paid for the content. Later that year, a £100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E

Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not <b>be</b> <b>compatible.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Sam Newton that Ecgric {{may in fact be}} identical to Eni's son Æthelric, whose descendants became kings of East Anglia. Æthelric's son Ealdwulf ruled from about 664 to 713. After Ecgric's death, three other sons of Eni ruled in succession before Ealdwulf, an indication that Raedwald's line was extinct. Æthelric's marriage to Hereswith suggests that it was expected that he would rule East Anglia and he may have been promoted by Edwin before 632. Æthelric was apparently dead by 647, at which time Anna was already ruling and Hereswith had gone to Gaul to lead a religious life. It has therefore been argued that Æthelric and Ecgric were in fact the same person, a suggestion that is disputed by the historian Barbara Yorke, who notes that the two names are too distinct to <b>be</b> <b>compatible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to <b>be</b> <b>compatible</b> with the Buran spacecraft.

Guy points out that the letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education.
