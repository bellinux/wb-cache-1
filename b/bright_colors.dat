5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and <b>bright</b> <b>colors</b> atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one.|$|E

Kiri Noh is performed the last in a five-play program. There are roughly 30 plays in this category, most of which are shorter than the plays in the other categories.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats {{also give}} the lizards a fitness {{advantage}} because the <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats attract more females, and therefore those males {{are more likely}} to reproduce. Although the <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats increases the likelihood of being eaten by predators, it also increases their sexual success. Therefore, the prevalence of <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats is maintained in this population of lizards. Based on the conflicting benefits of dull and <b>bright</b> <b>colored</b> throats, it is understandable that both morphs have been maintained in this species. Both traits give the lizards a different evolutionary advantage.|$|R

Games last an average of four minutes, though they can last several times more.|$|E
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with <b>bright</b> <b>colors,</b> serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E
5|$|Videoball is {{a minimalist}} sports video game by Action Button Entertainment. Up to six human and {{computer-controlled}} players form two teams.

The objective is to knock {{the ball into the}} opposing team's goal. Apart from exhibition matches, the game has a scenario challenge-based Arcade mode, and supports online team and ranked multiplayer matchmaking. Videoball has a simple visual style with <b>bright</b> <b>colors,</b> basic shapes, and many customization options.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by <b>bright</b> <b>colors,</b> such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart <b>bright</b> <b>colors</b> to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with <b>bright</b> <b>colors</b> and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the <b>bright</b> <b>colors</b> of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in <b>bright</b> <b>colors.</b> These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E
