To accomplish this, three major circuits were designed and tested: a new motor driver that incorporated 4 -spced control, a new feed <b>back</b> <b>circuit</b> that could temporarily store information, and an acoustic sensor circuit for driving an ultrasonic transmitter and amplifying the echo signal detected using an ultrasonic receiver. Software was also {{designed for the}} system to allow multiple levels of interfacing depending upon the complexity the user desired. The designed software includes a heuristic solution to the inverse kinematics problem of a three segment arm. Although the entire system was not built, prototypes of all of the circuits were built and tested to ensure the workability of the designs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{developed}} an advanced optical fiber Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring system with aphase compensation feed <b>back</b> <b>circuit.</b> Two lasers transmitted through the reference and sensing arms are combined by a 2 x 2 coupler and detected by two photodiodes as the intensity {{change of the}} interfered laser. Outputs of the photodiodes are then combined in a differential amplifier which extracts error signal and improves the S/N ratio. The developed system was demonstrated to detect weak guided wave AE signals such as zero-th order longitudinal cylindrical wave (Lo-mode) with the S/N ratio {{higher than that of}} PZT sensor. This system was utilized to monitor the oxidation resistance of various alloys during thermal cycles from 300 K to 1273 K. We detected weak AE signals from micro fractures of growing oxide films of boiler tube and austenitic stainless steel, but no AE from Inconel 600 tubes. Here the optical fiber sensor was wound over the tube at 600 K. Both the AE counts and amplitudes during thermal cycles showed clear tendency depending on the oxidation resistances of the alloys...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recently the vagal {{output of}} {{the central nervous system}} has been shown to {{suppress}} the innate immune defense to pathogens. Here we investigated by anatomical and physiological techniques the communication of the brain with the spleen and provided evidence that the brain has the capacity to stimulate the production of antigen specific antibodies by its parasympathetic autonomic output. Methodology/Principal Findings: This conclusion was reached by successively demonstrating that: 1. The spleen receives not only sympathetic input but also parasympathetic input. 2. Intravenous trinitrophenyl-ovalbumin (TNP-OVA) does not activate the brain and does not induce an immune response. 3. Intravenous TNP-OVA with an inducer of inflammation; lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activates the brain and induces TNP-specific IgM. 4. LPS activated neurons are in the same areas of the brain as those that provide parasympathetic autonomic information to the spleen, suggesting a feed <b>back</b> <b>circuit</b> between brain and immune system. Consequently we investigated the interaction of the brain with the spleen and observed that specific parasympathetic denervation but not sympathetic denervation of the spleen eliminates the LPSinduced antibody response to TNP-OVA. Conclusions/Significance: These findings not only show that the brain can stimulate antibody production by its autonomic output, it also suggests that the power of LPS as adjuvant to stimulate antibody production may also depend on its capacit...|$|E
