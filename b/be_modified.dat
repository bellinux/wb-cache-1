5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can <b>be</b> <b>modified,</b> although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E

The last two ships of the class are planned to <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> as patrol boats for service with the Montenegrin Navy.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{met with}} Arnold again in September 1943. He {{informed}} Arnold {{that there was}} now a second bomb shape under consideration, the Fat Man, and formally requested that further tests be carried out, that not more than three B-29s <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> to carry the weapons, and that the USAAF form and train a special unit to deliver the bombs. Arnold delegated responsibility for this to Major General Oliver P. Echols. In turn, Echols designated Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as the Project Officer.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Rabi {{returned}} to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> to confirm {{the properties of the}} atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and nuclear spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important to the field of medicine.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, two -100BSR SUD models, {{featuring}} the stretched upper deck (SUD) of the -300, were produced for JAL. The type's maiden flight occurred on February 26, 1986, with FAA certification and first delivery on March 24, 1986. JAL operated the -100BSR SUD with 563 seats on domestic routes until their retirement {{in the third}} quarter of 2006. While only two -100BSR SUDs were produced, in theory, standard -100Bs can <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> to the SUD certification. Overall, twenty-nine 747SRs were built, consisting of seven -100SRs, twenty -100BSRs, and two -100BSR SUDs.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E

5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars can <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), {{in which the}} linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E

Character statistics, such as experience points, abilities, and disciplines, can also <b>be</b> <b>modified.</b> Finally, the Storyteller can assume the role of any character at any given time. These functions allow the Storyteller to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it.|$|E
