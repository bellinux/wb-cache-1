An improved numerical algorithm based on the front tracking method, originally proposed by Tryggvason and his coworkers, has been validated against experiments over a wide range of intermediate Reynolds and <b>Bond</b> <b>numbers</b> using an axisymmetric model (Hua and Lou, J. Comput. Phys. 222 : 769 - 795, 2007).

To facilitate the simulation, mesh adaptation is implemented for both the front mesh and the background mesh, and the governing Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible, Newtonian flow are solved in a moving reference frame attached to the rising bubble. Specifically, the flow equations are solved using a finite volume scheme based on the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations (SIMPLE) algorithm, and it appears to be robust even in the range o...|$|R
