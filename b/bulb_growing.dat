5000|$|Noordwijkerhout (...) is a {{town and}} {{municipality}} in the western Netherlands, {{in the province of}} South Holland. The municipality covers an area of [...] km2 of which [...] km2 is water and had a population of [...] in [...] The town is in the <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> region (the Duin- en Bollenstreek) of the Netherlands, famed for its tulips.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{ornamental}} bulbs {{were introduced}} into Europe via Turkey and the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (who reigned 1520-1566) was noted for {{his love of}} gardens, where tulips and other bulbs were grown. Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, the ambassador to the sultan from Emperor Ferdinand I in Vienna, observed ornamental bulbous plants such as narcissi, hyacinths and [...] "those which the Turks call tulipam". The botanist Carolus Clusius, who was based in Vienna from 1573 to around 1580, devoted one volume of his 1576 botanical work Rariorum Plantarum Historia to bulbs, some of which he knew from introductions via Turkey, such as tulips, Iris susiana, Galanthus elwesii and Fritillaria persica. Clusius had {{a major impact on}} <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> in Europe. Through his later position as the Director of the Leiden Botanic Garden, he established the Netherlands as the centre of commercial ornamental <b>bulb</b> <b>growing.</b>|$|E
50|$|This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The <b>bulb</b> <b>grows</b> best in {{well-drained soil}} high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky {{outcrops}} {{as well as}} in open meadows or prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.|$|R
25|$|Consumption of {{incandescent}} light <b>bulbs</b> <b>grew</b> {{rapidly in the}} US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold, all with carbon filaments. When tungsten filaments were introduced, about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).|$|R
50|$|The virus also {{weakens the}} bulb and retards the plant's {{propagation}} through offset growths; as it progresses through each generation the <b>bulb</b> <b>grows</b> stunted and weak. Eventually {{it has no}} strength to flower, and either breaks apart or withers away, ending the genetic line. For this reason the most famous examples of tulips from color broken bulbs - the Semper Augustus and the Viceroy - no longer exist.|$|R
50|$|In 1899, Gibbs {{wrote to}} the United States Department of Agriculture {{regarding}} the commercial prospects of <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> in the region, and they took interest. In 1905, they sent Gibbs 15,000 imported bulbs from Holland to grow as an experiment, under a contract. The experiment was so successful that the United States Department of Agriculture established their own 10-acre test garden around Bellingham in 1908, which proved successful enough for the Bellingham Tulip Festival to begin in 1920 to showcase and celebrate {{the success of the}} bulb industry.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, William Roozen {{arrived to}} the United States, {{leaving behind a}} {{successful}} <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> business spanning six generations in Holland. After working on several different farms, Roozen started his own in Skagit County in 1950, and in 1955 purchased the Washington Bulb Company, making him the leader among the four flower-growing families in the area, and the Washington Bulb Company the leading grower of tulip, daffodil, and iris bulbs in North America. The farm operates a public display garden and gift shop called Roozengaarde, which, alongside the DeGoede family's Tulip Town, is a major attraction during the Tulip Festival.|$|E
50|$|Around 1883, George Gibbs, an {{immigrant}} from England moved to Orcas Island, where {{he began to}} grow apples and hazelnuts. Nine years later, he purchased five dollars worth of flower bulbs to grow, and when he dug them up a couple years later and saw how they had multiplied, realized the potential for <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> in the Puget Sound region. He contacted Dutch growers in Holland {{to learn about the}} business, only to find the Dutch to be highly secretive about their commercial practices. However, when he shipped off a few a bulbs to Holland, the impressed Dutch growers traveled to Orcas Island to see for themselves how tulips could grow outside Holland.|$|E
50|$|If not disturbed, {{which in}} the wild they seldom are, being dangerously poisonous, the <b>bulbs</b> <b>grow</b> for decades at least. As the <b>bulb</b> <b>grows</b> larger it {{produces}} more leaves, some six or eight in a season when mature. The leaves grow in a radial arrangement {{around the top of}} the bulb, emerging from a flat slit. The leaves are a decorative dark green, coriaceous in texture and mottled or spotted beneath, especially near the base. The margins of the leaves of all ages are elegantly ciliate, being fringed with eyelash-like bristles. The plant is strictly deciduous and endemic to a mainly winter-rainfall, partly semi-arid, region; the leaves emerging near {{the time of the first}} rains, about when the plant sheds the infructescence. The leaves dry out, curl up somewhat and detach towards late springtime or mid-summer, leaving little sign of the whereabouts of the dormant, buried bulb. If torn, whether live or as yet undecayed, the leaves dried sap forms silky threads that in past times cattle herders used to apply to bleeding cuts as a styptic.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bulbs</b> <b>grow</b> {{in small}} clumps {{in the shelter}} of trees, bushes and rocks. Their tunics {{are more or less}} equal with {{horizontal}} leaf-scars. Leaves number two or three, usually flat on the ground, appearing with the flowers or following on soon. Peduncles show quite a variation in length from 100-200 mm long.H. carneus was first described in 1821 by the English botanist John Bellenden Ker Gawler (1764-1842), first editor of Edward's Botanical Register.|$|R

5000|$|Born in London, Wallace earned at Trinity College, Oxford an MA in 1858 and an MD in 1861. He played {{first-class}} cricket {{there for}} the university club. He commenced practice in London, and was physician to the Middlesex Free Hospital. Afterwards he removed to Colchester, and for some years held an official appointment there, which he gave up, and started <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> (especially Japanese Lilies), and his sons have a very large and prosperous business of this nature at Colchester; he resumed his medical practice in the same town. He worked as an agent for new introductions of lilies and orchids. His company [...] "The New Plant and Bulb Company" [...] supplied lilies to Gertrude Jekyll.|$|E
50|$|As she got older, Currey {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on gardening, professional <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> in particular. She was owner of the Warren nursery and gardens in Lismore, which specialised in daffodils. Some of her daffodils were awarded the silver gilt Banksian medal in 1909 by the Royal Horticultural Society in London. Currey was elected {{a member of the}} Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland in 1901. Edith Somerville recalls Currey's resistance to a proposed local authority drainage scheme that could destroy her daffodil plots by sitting on a wall with a shotgun. Around 1900, Currey collected two colour forms of wood anemone, Lismore Blue and Lismore Pink, which are still cultivated today. She noted that blue forms of wood anemone always grew within close proximity to water, and was the recorder of the only Yellow Bartsia found in County Waterford.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the possible effects of occupational exposure to pesticides on central nervous system (CNS) function. A variety of neurobehavioral functions were assessed in a group of 129 workers in the <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> industry with at least ten years occupational exposure to pesticides and a group of 64 controls using the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES). The NES consists of a battery of computerized neurobehavioral performance tests which are designed to evaluate changes in attention, learning and memory, motor performance and perception. In addition psychiatric and mood scale questionnaires were administered. Statistical analyses showed no differences in the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms or subjective complaints between the two groups. Multivariate analyses of neurobehavioral functioning, however, revealed significant performance decrements in pesticide-exposed workers in tests related to attention as well as those involving perceptual coding. These data indicate that occupational exposure to pesticides in the <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> industry is associated with subtle changes in neurobehavioral functioning. Combined industrial hygiene and neurobehavioral studies aimed at monitoring exposures and neurobehavioral functioning in industrial workers are recommended...|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a difficult plant to cultivate. This is mainly due to several problems: 1) it likes bright light and this encourages algal growth which is difficult to clear from the leaves; 2) newly imported <b>bulbs</b> <b>grow</b> well {{in the first year}} but often fail in the second year, apparently {{due to a lack of}} food in the bulbs (cause still unknown); 3) seeds may be produced but often fail to germinate or thrive. Some enthusiasts recommend strong water movement and high filtration.|$|R
50|$|Imperial fritillaries (Fritillaria imperialis) are bulbs {{that were}} grown in France and Germany {{at the end}} of the 19th century, {{nowadays}} they are generally seen in gardens in Europe during spring (April and May). Because of this it is assumed that Van Gogh painted this work at that time of year. The orange-red flower is also known as the imperial crown or kaiser's crown. Each <b>bulb</b> <b>grows</b> between three and ten flowers, so Van Gogh used one or two bulbs to make the bouquet depicted in this picture.|$|R
5000|$|Oxalis violacea {{emerges in}} early spring from an {{underground}} <b>bulb,</b> and <b>grows</b> to an average height of approximately 7 inches. The three-part leaves have heart-shaped leaflets. It is similar in appearance to small clovers such as the shamrock.|$|R
40|$|In {{the natural}} aquatic environment, {{different}} abiotic and biotic factors {{may affect the}} fate of pesticides, {{and the performance of}} organisms. The overall aim of this thesis was to study the effects of pesticides on aquatic macrofauna in the field. Different approaches were used in research, including field sampling of aquatic macrofauna, in situ exposure experiments, and laboratory toxicity tests. Fieldwork was based in the flower <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> area of the Netherlands were pesticide concentrations in surface waters often exceed water quality standards. Promotores: W. J. G. M.

40|$|A {{factorial}} experiment using forced tulips in a greenhouse, in combinations of 3 spacings (8, 10 and 12 cm square plantings), 3 soil fertility levels {{and the use}} of bulbs grown on sandy loam soil and coastal sand dunes in preceding generation, was made to determine their effects on the quality and yield of tulip cut flowers. The results obtained were the following: 1. The closer spacings in tulips resulted in higher plant height but little splender growth than that of wider spacings. Contrary to expectation, wider-spaced plants where the competition for water, nutrients and light was less did not grow luxuriantly compared to closer spaced plants. 2. After-effect of <b>bulb</b> <b>growing</b> conditions in previous generation (soil texture in this experiment) was clearly observed as regards growth and flowering (bloom quality and yields) of forced tulips. Although growth of plants from sandy loam soil-grown bulbs was superior to the bulbs from sand dunes, flowering time was delayed by the use of bulbs from sandy loam soil. 3. Large amounts of fertilizer application during forcing in greenhouse had of little practical value since an apparent response to that was not seen. Leaves of plants without nutrition, however, were smaller and paler in color than any other plots. 4. The interactions among 3 factors were found to be highly significant and to be all interdependent...|$|E
50|$|Bulbous {{plant species}} cycle through {{vegetative}} and reproductive growth stages; the <b>bulb</b> <b>grows</b> to flowering size during the vegetative {{stage and the}} plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring. Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.|$|R
50|$|Isobel plays a piano that is full {{of pipes}} that fill it with water. Children play in the water, and wear masks. Isobel is later shown lying beside a river wearing a dress with lights in it. She pulls some light bulbs off her dress and plants them in the ground. The light <b>bulbs</b> <b>grow</b> and act as {{incubators}} or cocoons for toy airplanes inside them. When the airplanes grow big enough, they {{break out of the}} bulbs and fly away. At the same time, numerous skyscrapers grow out of the ground and eventually are covered in cockroaches. Isobel is also shown walking through the countryside, up a mountain, and beside a river.|$|R
50|$|Lilies are tall {{perennials}} {{ranging in}} height from 2 - 6 ft. They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their overwintering organs. In some North American species {{the base of}} the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons. Most bulbs are deeply buried, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the <b>bulb</b> <b>grows</b> naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at {{the base of the}} bulb.|$|R
5000|$|In both genera the <b>bulb</b> {{commonly}} <b>grows</b> to {{a mass of}} {{well over}} a kilogram, but the bulbs of Crossyne do not extend above ground at all unless because of erosion or similar factors, whereas Boophone bulbs tend to project perhaps halfway above the ground, depending on circumstances.|$|R
25|$|Given the {{versatility}} of both vegetables, {{they were}} usually boiled or steamed, and eaten by itself or as ingredients in soups and strews. Without {{the need for}} advanced agricultural technology, taro and sweet potatoes were a prime preference for farming. Canadian missionary George MacKay said of 19th century Taiwan: ‘the bulb of the sweet potato is planted in March. In about six weeks the vines are cut into pieces eight inches long, which are planted in drills, and from these vine-cuttings the <b>bulbs</b> <b>grow</b> and are ripe {{about the end of}} June. A second crop is planted in a similar way in July and is ripe in November.’ (Ibid). The influence of sweet potatoes and taro has been vast. They are still widely present in modern-day Taiwan, be it on the streets, night markets, or in successful food chains like ‘Meet Fresh’ (or 鮮芋仙).|$|R
50|$|Allium haematochiton {{has a small}} rhizome {{associated}} with clusters of brightly colored red <b>bulbs.</b> From these <b>grow</b> several naked green stems, each with a few withering, curling leaves.|$|R
50|$|It is a stem-rooting <b>bulb</b> that <b>grows</b> up to 1 m high, though usually rather less. The bulb {{itself is}} 4 - 5 in deep and live from 2 to 4 years. The leaves are slender and grassy. It bears {{from one to}} twenty reflexed and nodding flowers, usually red in colour, and which may be spotted with black. The flowers are scented.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} green, {{scattered}} and linear to lance-shaped with little {{hair on the}} margins and underneath. They are generally 3.5-7 cm long and 3-6 mm wide. The bulb is ovoid (egg-shaped) and is 2-3.5 cm tall and 2-3.5 cm in diameter. Their size is smaller than that of L. brownii. An individual <b>bulb</b> can <b>grow</b> and flower for a few years.|$|R
5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants with <b>bulbs</b> <b>grow</b> from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|R
