In 2012, she worked full-time as a marketing consultant for an energy company. Schünemann did some coaching and played for the regional league, but her knee still <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> and national league offers were cancelled.|$|E

500|$|Marilyn Monroe (1926–1962) was an American {{actress who}} {{appeared}} in 29 films between 1946 and 1961. After a brief career in modeling she signed short-term film contracts, first with 20th Century Fox, then Columbia Pictures, and appeared in minor roles {{for the first few}} years of her career. In 1950, she made minor appearances in two critically acclaimed films, The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve. The parts in the two films were against many of the roles into which she was typecast, that of the dumb blonde. Margot A. Henriksen, her biographer with the American National Biography, considers the typecast [...] "an unfair stereotype that <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> throughout her career".|$|E

In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "Loverboy", Carey {{embarked}} on a short promotional campaign for the song. On July19,2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out onto the filming stage, pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt. Seemingly anxious and exhilarated, Carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program, while waving to the crowd down below on Times Square, while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy. Carey then walked to Daly's platform and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble, leading him to exclaim [...] "Mariah Carey has lost her mind!". While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, she admitted that he was meant to act surprised {{in order to provide}} a more dramatic effect for the program. Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention, with many critics and newspapers citing her behavior as [...] "troubled" [...] and [...] "erratic". In the days following her appearance on TRL, Carey had begun displaying [...] "erratic behavior" [...] during a public record signing for the single at Tower Records in New York. As the appearance was filmed, she began rambling on several points, leading her to discuss radio-host Howard Stern, and how his form of humor on his program <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> greatly. At that point, Carey's publicist Cindi Berger grabbed the microphone from her hand, and ordered the cameras to stop filming. Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: ...|$|E
2500|$|In Xenoblade Chronicles X, she voices Lin Lee Koo, one of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the story. She auditioned and won the role despite the only direction she was originally given was that the video game involved [...] "space travel". Morris sought to preserve Lin's characteristics as strong female figure in her portrayal, describing her as [...] "super smart and very self-reliant... She can cook dinner and also kick your ass." [...] Morris's take on the character did however include using a deeper, older-sounding voice for Lin, partially to accommodate for the age change, and partially because it was believed that Western audiences would find the high-pitched Japanese version [...] "grating". She voiced between 1,600 and 1,800 lines of dialogue for Lin – above average for a video game. In response to a controversy over Lin's bikini costumes being more covered up in the North American and European versions, Morris said that it <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> that Lin was only 13 years old, but sees the censorship more as localization and that it would make the game open up to a wider audience.|$|E

2500|$|Gein and {{his mother}} were now alone. Augusta had a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and Gein devoted himself to taking care of her. Sometime in 1945, Gein later recounted, he {{and his mother}} visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to {{purchase}} straw. According to Gein, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith home came outside and yelled to stop. Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene. What <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> {{did not appear to be}} the brutality toward the dog but the presence of the woman. Augusta told Ed that the woman was not married to Smith so had no business being there. [...] "Smith's harlot", Augusta angrily called her. She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly. She died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67. Ed was devastated by her death; in the words of author Harold Schechter, he had [...] "lost his only friend and one true love. And he was absolutely alone in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although she {{canceled}} the bridge, Palin spent $25 {{million from the}} $223 million earmark to build the road on Gravina Island to an empty beach where the bridge would have gone. State officials said [...] "they were going ahead with the $25 million road because the money would otherwise have {{to be returned to}} the federal government." [...] The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, [...] "She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money." [...] According to Palin’s communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge [...] "isn't necessarily dead"; it may still be built with [...] "a less costly design". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when [...] "she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> and she wants to change it. [...] I think that Sarah Palin is someone who has the courage to re-evaluate situations as they developed." [...] Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that [...] "because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative." [...] The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.|$|E

60|$|All of {{a sudden}} Lin Slone stood out clearer in her mental vision--the finest type of a rider she had ever known--a strong, lithe, {{magnificent}} horseman, whose gentleness showed his love for horses, whose roughness showed his power--a strange, intense, lonely man in whom she had brought out pride, gratitude, kindness, passion, and despair. She felt her heart swell at the realization that she had changed him, made him kinder, made him divide his love as did her father, made him human, hopeful, longing for a future unfettered by the toils of desert allurement. She could not control her pride. She must like him very much. She confessed that, honestly, without a qualm. It was only bewildering moments of strange agitation and uncertainty that <b>bothered</b> <b>her.</b> She had refused to be concerned by them until they had finally impinged upon her peace of mind. Then they accused her; now she accused herself. She ought not go to meet Lin Slone any more.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, it {{was from}} St. Vincent that he wrote. He had left Martinique, I understand, in 1902, when St. Pierre, if you remember, was totally {{destroyed}} by volcanic eruption.

Of course {{he had no intention of}} ever going back there, and anyhow he never did, for he died about three years later. The lady went on living her own life quite happily. Apparently she did not hanker much after her faithless husband. I suppose that she never imagined for a moment that he meant to stick to her, and she certainly never <b>bothered</b> <b>her</b> head as to what his connections or friends over in England might be. Amongst her own kith and kin, the half-caste population of a French settlement, she was considered very well off, almost rich. After a very few years of grass-widowhood, she married again, without much scruple or compunction, which proves that she never thought that her English husband would come back to her.

6000|$|In other moments, {{when the}} world seemed all {{disorder}} and chaos,--as Mr. Shivers described it,--or when she felt within her, like demons, those inexpressible longings and desires, leaping and straining, pulling her, almost irresistibly, she knew not whither, Eda shone forth like a light in the darkness, like the beacon of a refuge and a shelter. Eda had faith in her, even when Janet had lost faith in herself: she went to Eda in the same spirit that Marguerite went to church; though she, Janet, more resembled Faust, being--save in these hours of lowered vitality--of the forth-faring kind.... Unable to confess the need that drove her, she arrived in Eda's little bedroom {{to be taken into}} Eda's arms. Janet was immeasurably the stronger of the two, but Eda possessed the masculine trait of protectiveness, the universe never <b>bothered</b> <b>her,</b> {{she was one of those}} persons--called fortunate--to whom the orthodox Christian virtues come as naturally as sun or air. Passion, when sanctified by matrimony, was her ideal, and now it was always in terms of Janet she dreamed of it, having read about it in volumes her friend would not touch, and never having experienced deeply its discomforts. Sanctified or unsanctified, Janet regarded it with terror, and whenever Eda innocently broached the subject she recoiled. Once Eda exclaimed:--"When you do fall in love, Janet, you must tell me all about it, every word!" ...|$|E
