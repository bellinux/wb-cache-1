40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative lateral load-resisting wall system, {{which is an}} evolution of the light-timber frame (LTF) shear walls currently available on the market. In comparison to traditional LTF walls, the novelty aspect {{is the use of}} Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) beams and studs instead of solid timber elements. Thanks to this ‘hybrid’ approach, this new system combines some peculiar aspects of LTF structures (such as the limited weight and the high dissipative behaviour) with the potentials of CLT. Moreover, the use of CLT elements limits the issues due to the compressive deformations on <b>bottom</b> <b>beams</b> and permits to employ some innovative connections with high mechanical properties. Cyclic shear tests are carried out on two configurations of interest, assembled by considering different layouts of the load-bearing elements. Test results are compared to the experimental data obtained on similar LTF systems and differences are critically discussed...|$|E
30|$|To {{compare the}} minimum column {{dimensions}} required by various design codes and recommendations, a reference cruciform beam-column joint {{is assumed to}} have beam hinging adjacent to the joint faces, a typical overstrength factor α_o = 1.25, a minimum axial compression P[*]=[*] 0.2 A_g f_c^', a common beam reinforcement ratio A_s,bot /A_s,top = 0.75, and an equal bar diameter d_b for the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> bars. Because of the larger stress gradient (α_s) along the bottom bars due to the unequal reinforcement ratio A_s,bot /A_s,top = 0.75, the minimum column dimension given by Eq. (3) and Table  1 would {{be determined by the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> bars passing through the joint.|$|R

A popular {{view is that the}} slanted <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> is a foot rest, however {{there is no evidence of}} foot rests ever being used during crucifixion, and it has a deeper meaning. The <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> may represent a balance of justice.

30|$|In {{common design}} practice, the beam {{reinforcement}} ratio A_s,bot /A_s,top usually ranges between 0.5 and 1.0. If the top reinforcement area (A_s,top) exceeds the bottom reinforcement area (A_s,bot) at a beam-column joint, relatively larger flexural compression would be {{developed at the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> ends in order to balance the greater flexural tension developed from the top beam bars at the same section. Thus, the compressive stress of the <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> bars at the joint face would be {{greater than that of}} the top beam bars at the opposite face. In other words, the stress gradient along the bottom bars is larger than that along the top bars in the joint, indicating a relatively severe bond demand for the bottom bars.|$|R
40|$|At Eindhoven University of Technology a {{research}} program on composite construction is underway aiming at {{the development of}} design rules for steel frames with precast concrete infill panels subject to horizontal loading. In two projects, 3 by 3 m steel frames are infilled with concrete: solid precast concrete panels discretely connected {{to the top and}} <b>bottom</b> <b>beams</b> and precast concrete panels discretely connected at the beam-column joints. The projects comprise experimental, numerical and analytical research into the in-plane composite behaviour of infilled steel frames. This paper presents preliminary experimental and numerical results of the first investigation. The discrete connections of the infill panel to the beam are able to resist tension, compression and shear. Preliminary studies were done to arrive at an optimum number and their locations. Two variations on this type of connection were tested experimentally. Four discrete connections allow the concrete panel to behave similarly to X-bracing in a trussed frame.

This paper presents preliminary finite element results of {{an investigation into the}} composite behaviour of a square steel frame with a precast concrete infill panel subject to lateral loading. Earlier, a full scale experiment was performed on a one-storey one-bay 3 by 3 m infilled frame structure which was horizontally loaded at the top and yielded a load displacement curve.

Experimental pullout tests on individual Frame-to-Panel-Connections, FPC 4, allowed the load deflection characteristics to be established. This made it possible to model the experimental non-linear behaviour of the connection by multi-linear tensile and compression springs in the finite element model. The results from the finite element model of the infilled frame structure with FPC 4 connections compares well with the experimentally obtained values for initial lateral stiffness, yielding level and ultimate strength. The proposed finite element model of the structure can be used for further parameter studies...|$|E
40|$|University of Minho is {{a partner}} of the INSYSME {{research}} project (Innovative Systems for earthquake resistant masonry enclosures in RC buildings), funded by the European Commission. The main aims of this project are to study new systems for masonry infill walls, which combine simplicity with low cost, and to propose recommendations and calculation procedures for their design to seismic actions, filling an existing gap in current regulations. At University of Minho a new construction system for masonry enclosures was developed, being composed of a new commercial unit and vertical steel reinforcement placed in ceramic brick frogs, connected to top and <b>bottom</b> <b>beams.</b> In this paper, the experimental work developed at the University of Minho for validation of the solution proposed for masonry infills is presented and discussed. The experimental validation process of the solution for the masonry enclosure walls was based on in-plane and out-of-plane static cyclic tests. The tests were carried in four specimens built at reduced scale (1 : 1. 5). In order to assess the in-plane behaviour, two specimens have been tested. The first test was done, in a specimen with masonry infill, until maximum drift. In the second test, only reinforcement concrete frame was tested, to access the contribution of masonry infill. For out-of-plane direction two specimens were tested one without reinforcement, and other with reinforcement. The out-of-plane test was carried using an airbag system. In this case only positive direction was considered. In-plane and out-of-plane tests were performed under displacement control according to a load pattern defined based on the FEMA 461 recommendations...|$|E

This paper presents preliminary experimental and finite element results of {{an investigation into the}} composite behaviour of a square steel frame with a precast concrete infill panel subject to lateral loading. The panel is connected at the corners {{to the ends of the}} top and <b>bottom</b> <b>beams.</b> The Frame-to-Panel-Connection, FPC 4 between steel beam and concrete panel consists of two parts. A T-section with five achor bars welded to the top of the flange is cast in at the panel corner at a forty five degree angle. The triangularly shaped web of the T-section is reinforced against local buckling with a stiffener plate. The second part consists of a triangular gusset plate which is welded to the beam flange. Two bolts acting in shear connect the gusset plate to the web of the T-section. This way the connection can act in tension or compression. Experimental pull-out tests on individual connections allowed their load deflection characteristics to be established. A full scale experiment was performed on a one-storey one-bay 3 by 3 m infilled frame structure which was horizontally loaded at the top. With the characteristics of the frame-to-panel connections obtained from the experiments on individual connections, finite element analyses were performed on the infilled frame structures taking geometric and material non-linear behaviour of the structural components into account. The finite element model yields reasonably accurate results. This allows the model to be used for further parametric studies. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|E

Notably, the bar compressive stress κα_o f_y is unlikely to reach α_o f_y as for the tensile stress, because of the limited compressive strain of the beam bar in the flexural compression zone at the beam ends.

5000|$|The {{vertical}} column supporting a plate with an offset weight {{must be in}} axial compression and flexure. Here the axial compression is carried by the bearing at the top beam in most balance scales, the lower beam just being supported horizontally at midpoint by {{the body of the}} scales by a simple peg-in-slot arrangement, so it effectively hangs beneath the top beam and stops the platforms from rotating. The flexural force in the column (a.k.a. bending moment) is taken by a pair of equal and opposite forces in the horizontal beams. So if the offset weight is towards the outside of the platform, further from the centre of the scales, the top beam will be in axial tension and the <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> will be in axial compression. These tensions and compressions are carried by horizontal reactions from the central supports, {{the other side of the}} scales is not affected at all, nor is the balance of the scales.|$|R

The flange, welded with the <b>bottom</b> <b>beam</b> flange as well as the web close to bottom flange, are jointed by high strength bolts. Stiffening plate is welded at top of the flange while downhand welding and high strength friction grip bolts are used for the top beam flange and the beam web, respectively. The connection reduces the construction period and costs. In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates. The experimental studies enabled improvement of the design of the connection to be used in moment-resisting steel frame structures.
