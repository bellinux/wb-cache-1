Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> or power failures, even though some <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-one years later, after {{suffering}} irreversible damage while carrying supplies to <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> in Greenland, the Terra Nova {{was set on}} fire and later sunk by gunfire off the southern coast of Greenland on 13 September 1943, at 60° 15′ 15″ N, 45° 55′ 45″ W. Its submerged remains were found in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The initial non-military {{application}} of distributed element filters {{was in the}} microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide the backbone of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, mass-production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic satellite television systems. An emerging application is in superconducting filters {{for use in the}} cellular <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> operated by mobile phone companies.|$|E

According to the {{independence}} of the <b>base</b> <b>station,</b> the basic characteristics of the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> are analyzed, and a heat transfer model of communication <b>base</b> <b>station</b> enclosing structure is constructed, and the change of the temperature data in the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is simulated using computer, and also all program module design flows of computer simulation are provided. Through the comparison between the result of field test on a typical <b>base</b> <b>station</b> and the simulation data, it is learnt that the temperature data simulated in the heat transfer model of the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> enclosing structure is similar to the average temperature within the measured <b>base</b> <b>station...</b>|$|R

5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals to the <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> is encrypted {{with a key}} known only to the base station and the terminal. For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted {{all the way through}} the network from the one user to the other.|$|E
5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental {{is the lack of}} indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings are that the location of <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E

40|$|A {{bidirectional}} two-hop {{relay network}} with decode-and-forward strategy is implemented using GNU Radio (software) and several USRPs (hardware) on Ubuntu (operating system). The relay communication system {{is comprised of}} three nodes; <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> A, <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> B, and Relay Station (the intermediate node). During the first time slot, <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> A and <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> B will each transmit data, e. g., a JPEG file, to Relay Station using DBPSK modulation and FDMA. For the final time slot, Relay Station will perform a bitwise XOR of the data, and transmit the XORed data to <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> A and <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> B, where the received data is decoded by performing another XOR operation with the original data...|$|R
5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and direct communication. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E

The downlink channel is the most studied with stochastic geometry models while models for the uplink case, which is a more difficult problem, are starting to be developed.|$|E
