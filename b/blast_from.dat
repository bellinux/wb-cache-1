5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate {{the effects of the}} <b>blast.</b> <b>From</b> evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons. Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1975, EMI/Capitol {{had issued}} greatest-hits {{collections}} on the Apple Records imprint for Lennon and Starr – Shaved Fish and <b>Blast</b> <b>from</b> Your Past, respectively. Since Lennon and Starr were still nominally Apple artists, they each had {{input into the}} content and packaging of their solo compilation, and Lennon, in particular, was active in promoting his album. Shaved Fish and <b>Blast</b> <b>from</b> Your Past sold reasonably well, in America, but their sales failed to match record-company expectations. For Harrison, there had been long delays between releases following the international success of his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970–71, due first to {{his commitment to the}} Bangladesh humanitarian aid project and later to his production work for Dark Horse Records acts Splinter and Ravi Shankar. Harrison issued his final studio album for Apple in the autumn of 1975, Extra Texture (Read All About It). As a result, by the time that Capitol came to prepare a compilation of his solo work the following year, he had effectively surrendered all artistic control over its content.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Navy {{decided that}} Nevada {{was too old to}} be retained, so they {{assigned}} it to be a target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads). The ship was hit by the <b>blast</b> <b>from</b> the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suggested}} that the blastic transformation in some patients with Ph 1 -positive chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) may be lymphoid in nature. It has recently been postulated that some patients with CML may undergo a T lymphoblastic crisis because the leukaemic <b>blasts</b> <b>from</b> these patients have high terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity and that some patients may undergo a non-T/non-B lymphoblastic crisis since leukaemic <b>blasts</b> <b>from</b> a majority of morphologically lymphoid type CML-BC cases react with antiserum specific for non-T/non-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The present study shows that leukaemic <b>blasts</b> <b>from</b> each of six patients with Ph 1 -positive chronic myelocytic leukaemia-blastic crisis (CML-BC) exerted a strong stimulation on allogeneic lymphocytes in 'one-way' mixed lymphocyte reaction. There was no apparent difference in stimulating capacity between morphologically myeloid type (four cases) and lymphoid type (two cases). The stimulating capacity of leukaemic <b>blasts</b> <b>from</b> patients with CML-BC was quite {{similar to that of}} <b>blasts</b> <b>from</b> all patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and from some patients with non-T/non-B type ALL. Leukaemic <b>blasts</b> <b>from</b> a patient with T-cell type ALL and cultured leukaemic T lymphoblastoid cells (2 lines) consistently failed to stimulate while cultured leukaemic null-cells (4 lines) consistently exerted a strong stimulation in 'one-way' mixed lymphocyte reaction. These observations suggest that leukaemic cells from patients with CML-BC, morphologically lymphoblastic type, are not T lymphoblasts although the possibility that these cells are non-T/non-B lymphoblasts cannot be ruled out entirely...|$|R

After their debriefing at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company—but they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer.|$|E
5|$|By late {{afternoon}} Béxar {{was occupied by}} about 1,500 Mexican soldiers. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a <b>blast</b> <b>from</b> the Alamo's largest cannon. Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional. On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.|$|E

5|$|Pluton {{spent much}} of 1933–1935 in {{dockyard}} hands after finishing her first round of modifications on 27 April 1933. She was refitted four times during this period to add more gunnery equipment and to rectify some of her defects. These included reinforcement of her superstructure {{where it had been}} damaged by the muzzle <b>blast</b> <b>from</b> her 138mm guns and replacement of her corroded aluminum ladders and booms with steel ones. A high-angle fire-control director for her 75mm guns was added, two of her 75mm gun were converted to powered, remotely controlled mounts, gun shields were added to the 75mm guns to protect their crews from blast and facilities for another 40 men was installed on her mine deck.|$|E
5|$|Travis assumed {{command of}} the Alamo {{garrison}} on February 11, when Neill was granted a furlough. On February 23, Santa Anna arrived in Béxar {{at the head of}} approximately 1500 Mexican troops. The 150 Texian soldiers were unprepared for this development. As they rushed to the Alamo, Texians quickly herded cattle into the complex and scrounged for food in nearby houses. The Mexican army initiated a siege of the Alamo and raised a blood-red flag signalling no quarter. Travis responded with a <b>blast</b> <b>from</b> the Alamo's largest cannon.|$|E
5|$|By about 19:30, Marlboroughs pumps had {{contained}} the flooding in the boiler rooms {{but she took}} {{on a list of}} around 7–8degrees. Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The <b>blast</b> <b>from</b> the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight compartments were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently shored up. Three more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19:33. She evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle <b>blast</b> <b>from</b> the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a <b>blast</b> <b>from</b> the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.|$|E
