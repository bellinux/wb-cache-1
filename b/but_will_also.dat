5|$|In an SMC, {{only one}} {{candidate}} is elected {{to represent the}} constituency in question. Thus, if an SMC parliamentary seat is vacated and the Prime Minister exercises discretion not to call a by-election in the SMC, the constituency's residents will not only lack a representative in Parliament <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> be without a Town Council chairman.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, {{although this is}} mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other snakes, Naja nigricollis can {{be either}} nocturnal or diurnal {{depending}} {{on the time of}} year, geographic location, and average daytime temperature. This adaptability allows the snake to better regulate its body temperature and {{to gain access to the}} most abundant food sources of a particular area. It feeds primarily on small rodents, such as small rats and mice, birds, and fishes, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> eat lizards, eggs, and other snakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess {{a keen sense}} of smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E
25|$|Limpkins {{are active}} {{during the day}} <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> forage at night. Where they are not persecuted they are also very tame and approachable. Even so, they are usually found near cover. They are not {{aggressive}} for the most part, being unconcerned by other species and rarely fighting with {{members of their own}} species.|$|E
50|$|Pine tree - Pinus sp. Caterpillars {{rather like}} Pinus sylvestris, <b>but</b> they <b>will</b> <b>also</b> eat Pinus nigra.|$|R

50|$|Its {{preferred}} diet is {{the eggs}} of other reptiles, <b>but</b> it <b>will</b> <b>also</b> eat small rodents and lizards.|$|R
25|$|The North American beavers {{prefer the}} (inner) bark of aspen and poplar <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash, {{hornbeam}} and occasionally pine and spruce. They will also eat cattails, water lilies and other aquatic vegetation, {{especially in the}} early spring (and contrary to widespread belief, they do not eat fish).|$|E
25|$|When the CharmCard {{system is}} fully implemented, {{it will be}} used not only on Maryland Transit Administration transit {{services}}, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> be able to be used in Washington D.C. on all WMATA buses, the Washington Metro and on most local bus services in Northern Virginia. Likewise, the WMATA SmarTrip card will be accepted by the fareboxes used by the MTA.|$|E
25|$|Many local chevra kadishas {{in urban}} areas are {{affiliated}} with local synagogues, and they often own their own burial plots in various local cemeteries. Some Jews pay an annual token membership fee to the chevra kadisha of their choice, {{so that when the}} time comes, the society will not only attend to the body of the deceased as befits Jewish law, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> ensure burial in a plot that it controls at an appropriate nearby Jewish cemetery.|$|E

25|$|In most {{realistic}} cases nowadays, non-natural {{additions to}} the fuels mentioned above will be used. Often, charcoal lighters like hexamine fuel tablets or ethyl alcohol {{will be used to}} start the fire, as well as various types of scrap paper. With the proliferation of packaged food, it is quite likely that plastics will be incinerated as well, a practice that not only produces toxic fumes <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> leave polluted ashes behind because of incomplete combustion at too-low open fire temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Wild banded {{mongooses}} (Mungos mungo) regularly use anvils to open {{food items}} {{with a hard}} shell such as rhinoceros beetles, bird eggs, snail shells or pupating dung beetles. They use a range of anvils commonly including rocks and the stems of trees, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> use the side-walls of gullys and even dried elephant dung. Pups as young as 2 months of age are already showing the behavioural patterns associated with using an anvil, however, successful smashing is usually shown in individuals older than 6 months of age.|$|E
25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> help to retain its value.|$|E
50|$|The brown-throated sunbird {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} nectar, <b>but</b> it <b>will</b> <b>also</b> take small fruits and berries. Juveniles are fed with insects.|$|R
50|$|The food {{is mainly}} seeds {{obtained}} by foraging on the ground, <b>but</b> it <b>will</b> <b>also</b> take insects, including butterflies and moths.|$|R
50|$|Its primary diet is amphibians, {{such as the}} {{northern}} cricket frog (Acris crepitans), <b>but</b> it <b>will</b> <b>also</b> consume lizards, and small rodents.|$|R
25|$|Gray langurs are {{primarily}} herbivores. However, unlike some other colobines {{they do not}} depend on leaves and leaf buds of herbs, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> eat coniferous needles and cones, fruits and fruit buds, evergreen petioles, shoots and roots, seeds, grass, bamboo, fern rhizomes, mosses, and lichens. Leaves of trees and shrubs rank {{at the top of}} preferred food, followed by herbs and grasses. Non-plant material consumed include spider webs, termite mounds and insect larvae. They forage on agricultural crops and other human foods, and even accept handouts. Although they occasionally drink, langurs get most of their water from the moisture in their food.|$|E
25|$|Since volumes are {{presented}} as block devices, {{they can also be}} formatted with any other file system, to add ZFS features to that file system, although this is not usual practice. For example, a ZFS volume can be created, and then the block device it presents can be partitioned and formatted with a file system such as ext4 or NTFS. This can be done either locally or over a network (using iSCSI or similar). The resulting file system will be accessible as normal, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> gain ZFS benefits such as data resilience, data integrity/.scrubbing, snapshots, and additional option for data compression.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 2015, Techland {{announced}} that they are developing , a standalone expansion for Dying Light. The title will be free to all players who purchased Dying Lights seasonal pass, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> be available for separate purchase. The Following will introduce a new story campaign, controllable vehicles, and a new map, the size {{of which is the}} same as all the previous maps from Dying Light combined. It was released on 9 February 2016. The expansion released alongside Dying Light: The Following – Enhanced Edition, which includes the base game, all the downloadable content and content updates, and the expansion.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 {{expectations}} were high that Waterford would retain their Munster title and {{challenge for the}} All-Ireland once again. After a disappointing National League campaign and a nine-point loss to Clare {{in the first round}} of the championship a players meeting was held where it was indicated that some of the team no longer wanted McCarthy in charge. From that another meeting with the County Board was held where McCarthy resigned as manager. McCarthy had a successful reign over Waterford and most will remember all the great games that he was involved in <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> remember the fact that Waterford never reached an All-Ireland final under him.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E
25|$|The Silver Surfer {{made his}} film debut in 20th Century Fox's , {{the sequel to}} the 2005 film Fantastic Four. Doug Jones played the Surfer on set, and a {{computer}} simulation enhanced the reflective look of his prosthetics. Laurence Fishburne provided the character's voice. The same year, 20th Century Fox hired J. Michael Straczynski to write the screenplay for a spin-off film. Straczynski said his script is a sequel, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> delve into the Surfer's origins. In mid-2009, Straczynski expressed doubts that spin-off would be produced. In this continuity, the Surfer's origins and powers {{are similar to those}} of his comic-book incarnation, in that he agrees to become Galactus' herald in return for the safety of his home world and the woman he loved. Also, if the Surfer is separated from his board, he becomes weaker; in addition, the board also serves as a beacon for Galactus. 20th Century Fox currently owns the live action film rights to the character.|$|E
