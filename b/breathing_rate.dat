5|$|The {{breathing}} gas mixtures {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba will depend on the time spent at each depth, the <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> of the diver, the type of breathing apparatus to be used, and reasonable allowances for contingencies.|$|E
25|$|Exercise {{increases}} the <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> {{due to the}} extra carbon dioxide produced by the enhanced metabolism of the exercising muscles. In addition passive movements of the limbs also reflexly produce {{an increase in the}} <b>breathing</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most {{severe cases}} of asthma {{are seen in}} {{children}} because of the increasing amount of time they spend outside and their <b>breathing</b> <b>rates,</b> and elders because of their sensitivity to toxins.|$|R
50|$|Limiting {{conditions}} {{vary with}} each diver and each profile, {{so it is}} necessary to analyze bailout requirements for each specific planned and contingency dive profile, cylinder volume and pressure, diving tables used and realistic assumed <b>breathing</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hydrostatic {{pressure}} {{differences between}} {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher <b>breathing</b> <b>rates</b> may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|R
25|$|Vigorous {{physical}} activity (such as exercise or hard labor) increases the body's demand for oxygen. The first-line physiologic {{response to this}} demand {{is an increase in}} heart rate, <b>breathing</b> <b>rate,</b> and depth of breathing.|$|E

25|$|Estimation of gas {{quantities}} for reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Under stress it {{is likely}} that a diver will increase <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> and decrease swimming speed. Both of these lead to a higher gas consumption during an emergency exit or ascent.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of lung {{mechanical}} behaviour {{as a function}} of respiratory frequency may be associated with significantly increased ventilation at high <b>breathing</b> <b>rates.</b> It follows that these measurements may be influenced by hypocapnia which has been shown to increase airflow resistance and to decrease dynamic compliance. To examine this possibility we continuously monitored the end-tidal CO 2 tension during the determination of pulmonary resistance and dynamic compliance as functions of frequency and we compared measurements obtained by the standard method and by a technique designed to prevent the development of hypocapnia at high <b>breathing</b> <b>rates.</b> We studied 11 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and also two smokers with normal spirometry and resistance. Although conventional measurements at frequencies higher than 40 - 45 breaths/min were associated with a significant decrease in end-tidal CO 2, no systematic {{differences were found between the}} values of pulmonary resistance and dynamic compliance obtained by the two techniques. Our data indicate that the development of hypocapnia at high <b>breathing</b> <b>rates</b> does not significantly affect measurements of resistance and compliance as functions of frequency, at least when the duration of each period of hyperventilation is limited to the minimum necessary for a single determination, which was less than 30 seconds in the present study. A comparison of our results with previously published data suggests that the time factor may be critical with respect to the possible effects of hypocapnia on these measurements...|$|R
30|$|During DP {{the cycle}} and <b>breathing</b> <b>rates</b> were tightly coupled (i.e. entrainment), with 52 breaths[*]·[*]min− 1 (0.87 Hz) being {{similar to the}} cycle rate (a ratio of 1 : 1) (r[*]=[*] 0.89, P[*]=[*] 0.007). In the case of DIA, the <b>rate</b> of <b>breathing</b> {{was similar to the}} cycle rate during the first session (approximately 0.79 Hz), but greater than cycle rate during the second (0.88 Hz vs. 0.78 Hz, P[*]=[*] 0.022).

40|$|International audiencePhotoplethysmographic signals {{obtained}} from a webcam are analyzed through a continuous wavelet transform to assess the instantaneous heart rate. The measurements are performed on human faces. Robust image and signal processing are introduced to overcome drawbacks induced by light and motion artifacts. In addition, the respiration signal is recovered using the heart rate series by respiratory sinus arrhythmia, the natural variation in heart rate driven by the respiration. The presented algorithms are implemented on a mid-range computer and the overall method works in real-time. The performance of the proposed heart and <b>breathing</b> <b>rates</b> assessment method was evaluated using approved contact probes {{on a set of}} 12 healthy subjects. Results show high degrees of correlation between physiological measurements even in the presence of motion. This paper provides a motion-tolerant method that remotely measures the instantaneous heart and <b>breathing</b> <b>rates.</b> These parameters are particularly used in telemedicine and affective computing, where the heart rate variability analysis can provide an index of the autonomic nervous system...|$|R
25|$|Bicarbonate ions {{are crucial}} for {{regulating}} blood pH. A person's <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> influences {{the level of}} CO2 in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes respiratory acidosis, while breathing that is too rapid leads to hyperventilation, which can cause respiratory alkalosis.|$|E

25|$|The <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> {{increases}} {{when the}} partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} in the blood increases. This is detected by central blood gas chemoreceptors on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata. The aortic and carotid bodies, are the peripheral blood gas chemoreceptors which are particularly sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of O2 though they also respond, but less strongly, to the partial pressure of CO2. At sea level, under normal circumstances, the <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> and depth, is determined primarily by the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide rather than by the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, which is allowed to vary within a fairly wide range before the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons respond to it to change the rate and depth of breathing.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolism}} of hummingbirds {{can slow}} {{at night or}} at any time when food is not readily available: the birds enter a hibernation-like, deep-sleep state (known as torpor) to prevent energy reserves from falling to a critical level. During night-time torpor, body temperature falls from 40 to 18 °C, with heart and <b>breathing</b> <b>rates</b> both slowed dramatically (heart rate to roughly 50 to 180 beats per minute from its daytime rate of higher than 1000).|$|R
25|$|A {{submersible}} {{pressure gauge}} {{is used to}} indicate the remaining gas pressure in a diving cylinder.

It is inherited in toy and miniature Poodles, and seen commonly in German Shepherds, Pomeranians, Bichon Frises, and Malteses.

25|$|The {{site and}} extent of {{absorption}} of inhaled gases and vapors are determined by their solubility in water. Absorption is also dependent upon air flow rates and the partial pressure of the gases in the inspired air.

It uses low-power components and a computationally efficient method to extract patient vital information: heartbeat and <b>breathing</b> <b>rates</b> as well as blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2). The prototype is monitored via a dSpace interface. The digital signal processing method (DSP) features an order- 32 RLS filter for adaptive noise cancelling (ANC) at 32 Hz...|$|R
25|$|The {{human body}} can adapt to high {{altitude}} through both immediate and long-term acclimatization. At high altitude, {{in the short}} term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the carotid bodies, which causes {{an increase in the}} breathing depth and rate (hyperpnea). However, hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of respiratory alkalosis, inhibiting the respiratory center from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{the body}} suspends {{homeostasis}} during paradoxical sleep. Heart rate, cardiac pressure, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> quickly become irregular {{when the body}} moves into REM sleep. In general, respiratory reflexes such as response to hypoxia diminish. Overall, the brain exerts less control over breathing; electrical stimulation of respiration-linked brain areas does not influence the lungs, as it does during non-REM sleep and in waking. The fluctuations of heart rate and arterial pressure tend to coincide with PGO waves and rapid eye movements, twitches, or sudden changes in breathing.|$|E
25|$|Sepsis is a {{life-threatening}} condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury {{to its own}} tissues and organs. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased <b>breathing</b> <b>rate,</b> and confusion. There also may be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. In the very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system, {{there may be no}} symptoms of a specific infection and the body temperature may be low or normal, rather than high.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{literacy}} and numeracy skills among Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) made diagnosis unreliable, since innumerate TBAs {{were unable to}} use watches or counting methods to assess <b>breathing</b> <b>rates</b> in infants. To overcome this problem, the Breath Counter uses an abacus for counting and an hourglass for timing. One bead of the abacus is moved for every ten breaths taken by the child; if the red bead is moved before the sand runs out in the hourglass, pneumonia is diagnosed.|$|R

25|$|Among both sexes, the {{excitement}} phase {{results in an}} increase in heart rate, <b>breathing</b> <b>rate,</b> and a rise in blood pressure. A survey in 2006 found that sexual arousal in about 82% of young females and 52% of young males arises or is enhanced by direct stimulation of nipples, with only 7–8% reporting that it decreased their arousal. Vasocongestion of the skin, commonly referred to as the sex flush, will occur in approximately 50-75% of females and 25% of males. The sex flush tends to occur more often under warmer conditions and may not appear at all under cooler temperatures.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest {{undertook}} a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests {{were performed to}} examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests {{on the way to}} the summit. Even at base camp, the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea level, blood oxygen saturation is generally 98–99%. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87%. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased <b>breathing</b> <b>rate,</b> often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely attempting to breathe.|$|E
25|$|John Ruben {{and others}} have argued that no {{evidence}} of nasal turbinates {{has been found in}} dinosaurs. All the dinosaurs they examined had nasal passages that were too narrow and short to accommodate nasal turbinates, so dinosaurs could not have sustained the <b>breathing</b> <b>rate</b> required for a mammal-like or bird-like metabolic rate while at rest, because their lungs would have dried out. However, objections have been raised against this argument. Nasal turbinates are absent or very small in some birds (e.g. ratites, Procellariiformes and Falconiformes) and mammals (e.g. whales, anteaters, bats, elephants, and most primates), although these animals are fully endothermic and in some cases very active. Other studies conclude that nasal turbinates are fragile and seldom found in fossils. In particular none have been found in fossil birds.|$|E
