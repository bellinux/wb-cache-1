Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the pianostool and lifts and beats handless sticks of {{arms on the}} keyboard, nodding with damsel's grace, his <b>bowknot</b> bobbing) ...|$|E

25|$|Boscobel's {{distinguishing}} {{feature is the}} unusual delicacy conveyed by the front facade and its ornamentation. Unique among Federal style buildings, carved wooden swags {{in the shape of}} drapery, complete with tassels and <b>bowknots,</b> grace the top of the second-story balcony. One-third of the face is glass, with thinner and larger contemporary panels used in the restoration to enhance the existing lightness. The windows are slightly recessed, and the front clapboards are closely fitted and matched in an apparent effort to suggest masonry.|$|R
60|$|When any {{stockholder}} {{had paid}} {{in as much}} as $100, the company issued him a Gold Bond and he became a bondholder. I asked Atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these Gold Bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock. Atterbury picked up one of them Gold Bonds, all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a <b>bowknot,</b> {{and he looked at me}} like his feelings was hurt.|$|E

5000|$|At Boudin's suggestion, McKim's {{mahogany}} {{side and}} console tables were painted to mimick white marble with gold veining, and the eagle supports and <b>bowknots</b> were gilded. The new color scheme for those pieces {{were intended to}} make them blend into the panelling. A new carpet, a copy of one Boudin designed for Leeds Castle, was woven by Stark Carpet Co. of New York City and installed. The [...] "Healy Lincoln" [...] portrait was restored, reversing conspicuous damage. The Chippendale reproduction side chairs were removed and replaced by the Chiavari chairs by McKim, Mead & White.|$|R
5000|$|A rosette [...] is a small, {{circular}} {{device that}} is typically {{presented with a}} medal. The rosettes are either worn on the medal to denote a higher rank, or for situations where wearing the medal is deemed inappropriate, such as on a suit. Rosettes are issued in nations such as Belgium, France, Italy and Japan. Rosettes are also sometimes called <b>bowknots,</b> due to their shape. Moreover, a large rosette is sometimes pinned onto the ribbon which suspends a medal, typically the Officer (and sometimes Grand Officer)'s badge of certain orders of chivalry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was rather}} {{glad to be}} rid of him, and I was glad that the next performers, who were a lady and a gentleman contortionist of Spanish- American extraction, behaved more impartially. They were really {{remarkable}} artists in their way, and though it's a painful way, I couldn't help admiring their gift in <b>bowknots</b> and other difficult poses. The gentleman got abundant applause, but the lady at first got none. I think perhaps it was because, with the correct feeling that prevailed among us, we could not see a lady contort herself with so much approval as a gentleman, and that there was a wound to our sense of propriety in witnessing her skill. But I could see that the poor girl was hurt in her artist pride by our severity, and at the next thing she did I led off the applause with my umbrella. She instantly lighted up with a joyful smile, and the young mother in the orchestra leaned forward to nod her sympathy to me while she clapped. We were fast becoming a domestic circle, and it was very pleasant, but I thought that upon the whole I had better go." ...|$|R

50|$|It was posited by James J. Rorimer in 1942 {{that they}} were {{commissioned}} by Anne of Brittany, to celebrate her marriage to Louis XII, King of France on 6 December 1491. The clue derived from the occurrence of A and reversed E tied with a cord in a <b>bowknot</b> throughout the series of tapestries. As Rorimer surmised, the letters A and E are interpreted as {{the first and the}} last letters of Anne's name, citied the elisions in the medieval age.|$|E

The standout example was created for Mademoiselle d’Aubigné’s wedding, which included: earrings, two pendants, loops and clasps for the sleeves, 32 buttons, and a large <b>bowknot.</b> There is a bias to towards paste parures from the period surviving to the present.

5000|$|The {{region was}} {{explored}} by John C. Fremont on {{several of his}} expeditions in the 1840s. Fremont corrected the cartographic error of Miera, establishing firmly that the river did not drain the Great Salt Lake. In 1869, the river was surveyed and mapped by John Wesley Powell {{as part of the}} first of his two expeditions to the region. During his two voyages in 1869 and 1871, he and his men gave most of the current names of the canyons, geographic features, and rapids along the river. For example, [...] "we sweep around another great bend to the left, making a circuit of nine miles, and come back to a point within 600 feet of the beginning of the bend. In the two circuits we describe almost the figure 8. The men call it a `bowknot' of a river; so we name it <b>Bowknot</b> Bend." [...] (Powell, 1869) ...|$|E
40|$|Landslide {{monitoring}} is {{very important}} in predicting the behavior of landslides, thereby ensuring environment, life, and property safety. On the basis of our previous studies, a novel combined optic fiber transducer (COFT) for landslides monitoring and the related analysis methods are presented. Based on the principles of optical fiber microbending loss, the empirical formula of the shearing displacement of sliding body versus optical loss was established through a stretching test of optical fiber <b>bowknot.</b> Then the COFT grouting direct shearing tests, a large-scale landslide model test, and numerical modeling verification with FLAC 3 D are carried out. According to the results, the initial measurement precision of the designed COFT in sandy clay is 1 [*]mm; its monitoring sliding distance is larger than 26. 5 [*]mm. The calculated values based on empirical formula are in good agreement with the laboratory tests and numerical simulation results. When the ratio of cement and sand in mortar is 1 [*]:[*] 5, the error between the calculated displacement and the measured displacement of sliding surface is the smallest. The COFT with expandable polystyrene (EPS) as its base material performs better in monitoring sandy clay slopes because both the error and the mean square deviation of the empirical formula are smaller...|$|E
