40|$|Bamboo treadle {{pumps are}} usually {{made of steel}} and have two barrels. The pumping {{mechanism}} is constructed of bamboo and the pump is operated by alternately depressing the bamboo pedals with ones feet. Bamboo treadle pumps can pump water from depths of up to 7 - 8 metres. They can pump from boreholes and open bodies of water but they cannot produce a pressurised flow and so cannot individually be used to raise water higher than {{the body of the}} pump. This can be achieved by locating pumps in vertical series. Bamboo treadle pumps can be produced by anyone with standard metalworking skills and simple metalworking tools such as welding equipment and a <b>barrel</b> <b>roller.</b> A bamboo treadle pump is a lightweight, portable means of pumping water from shallow depth...|$|E
40|$|Increasing the {{throughput}} of {{the powerful}} single-step glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method using a prototype simplified roll-to-roll (R 2 R) system has been explored. While the conventional GLAD technique is popular for fabricating nanostructured devices in a single deposition step, {{it is not a}} high-output process. To evaluate the feasibility of large area GLAD deposition, the authors examined the geometrical considerations required to eventually achieve GLAD in a roll-to-roll manufacturing system. Nominal deposition and rotation angles were mathematically translated to their effective R 2 R counterparts, allowing for deposition recipes of the archetype GLAD nanostructures (slanted posts, vertical posts, and square spirals) and the mechanics of the phi-sweep technique to be converted to this space. Representative structures were then deposited, and the phi-sweep technique successfully applied, in a prototype single <b>barrel</b> <b>roller</b> R 2 R experimental system. This prototype system provides a foundation for moving GLAD from the laboratory to mass production. 9 2013 American Vacuum Society. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

50|$|A <b>barrel</b> organ (or <b>roller</b> organ) is a {{mechanical}} musical instrument consisting of bellows {{and one or}} more ranks of pipes housed in a case, usually of wood, and often highly decorated. The basic principle {{is the same as}} a traditional pipe organ, but rather than being played by an organist, the barrel organ is activated either by a person turning a crank, or by clockwork driven by weights or springs. The pieces of music are encoded onto wooden barrels (or cylinders), which are analogous to the keyboard of the traditional pipe organ.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background and Purpose A {{tubeless}} PCNL {{can reduce}} postoperative pain, {{the need for}} analgesics, hospital stay, and postoperative urinary leakage. However, perioperative or delayed bleeding remains the primary postoperative concern. We demonstrate a simple and cost-effective method to develop a clear nephrostomy tract after completion of a tubeless PCNL. Materials and Methods Four consecutive patients with renal calculi > 3 cm underwent a tubeless PCNL. We used a 24 Fr nephroscope and a 24 Fr transurethral resectoscope. Intraoperative urologist-directed percutaneous renal access was performed under fluoroscopy. After calculi removal, active bleeders were identified via a clear Amplatz renal sheath. The sheath provided excellent visualization of the nephrostomy tract {{for the detection of}} bleeders and surrounding structures. Bleeders were electrocauterized using a <b>roller</b> <b>barrel</b> electrode. During extraction of the renal sheath, the surgeon can confirm hemostasis in the tract and apply intermittent suction. Results Bleeding primarily originated from the torn calyeceal mucosa and the parenchyma. Tract electrocauterization was successful. All patients had mild hematuria, which resolved within two days. The average hemoglobin decrease was 1. 65 g/dL (0. 8 - 2. 1) and no patients required a transfusion. No perioperative complications occurred. On postoperative day 2, the patients could ambulate without a Foley catheter. During three months of follow-up, delayed bleeding or percutaneous urine leakage did not occur. Conclusions Electrocauterization with a <b>roller</b> <b>barrel</b> electrode and a clear Amplatz renal sheath is an effective method to obtain hemostasis after completion of a PCNL. Our technique is cost-effective and readily adapted without the need for additional instruments...|$|R
5000|$|The HK21 is a {{selective}} fire roller-delayed blowback-operated firearm with a semi-rigid locking mechanism designed to retard the rearward {{movement of the}} bolt. This delay was achieved by artificially increasing the inertia of the bolt by using an angular, interposed transmission system, installed symmetrically to the bore axis, with two cylindrical rollers acting as transmission elements against a movable locking piece which drives the heavy bolt carrier. The two-piece bolt assembly consists of a bolt head, which contains the aforementioned rollers, and a supporting locking piece and bolt carrier. During the [...] "unlocking" [...] sequence, the bolt head receives the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge and exerts rearward pressure against the rollers, seated in recesses in the <b>barrel</b> extension. The <b>rollers</b> are driven inward against angled ramps of the barrel extension and interact with the wedge-shaped locking piece, projecting it backwards. Thus a 4:1 transmission ratio is maintained (as long as the rollers move on the inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and locking piece) of the bolt carrier and locking piece relative to the bolt head; the bolt carrier travels backwards four {{times faster than the}} bolt head, ensuring a safe drop of pressure within the barrel prior to extraction. Since extraction is carried-out under relatively high pressure, the barrelâ€™s chamber received a series of flutes designed to help free the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, rollers with insulating screens placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, rollers with screen and rollers with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the <b>barrel</b> of <b>roller</b> allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|R
