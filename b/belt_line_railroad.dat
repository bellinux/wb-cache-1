The highway passes over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision and heads {{south-southwest}} near urban {{residential and commercial}} areas and reaches a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with Grays Ferry Avenue. I-76 widens to six lanes and continues south near urban development, curving southeast and running between the Philadelphia Gas Works to the southwest and urban neighborhoods to the northeast and reaching an eastbound interchange for 28th Street and a westbound interchange with Vare Avenue and Mifflin Street.

The freeway makes a sharp turn to the east and passes under the Harrisburg Subdivision, heading near commercial areas and coming to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with the eastern terminus of PA 291 at Penrose Avenue, providing access to the Philadelphia International Airport. The Schuylkill Expressway continues east near urban residential neighborhoods and reaches an interchange with PA 611 (Broad Street). From here, I-76 widens to six lanes and passes north of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, coming to an interchange with 7th Street and Packer Avenue that has an eastbound exit and entrance and a westbound exit. A short distance later, the freeway comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance providing access to I-95 and Front Street. Immediately after, the road has a westbound toll plaza for the Walt Whitman Bridge. The freeway heads onto the seven-lane Walt Whitman Bridge, which carries it over Front Street, I-95, a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad spur, industrial areas in the Port of Philadelphia, Christopher Columbus Boulevard, the Philadelphia <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Railroad,</b> and finally the Delaware River.

5000|$|The Philadelphia <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Railroad</b> {{was created}} in 1889 {{with the purpose of}} {{allowing}} any Philadelphia railroad to have access to the Port of Philadelphia. The railroad was used as a way to fight the railroad empire of the Pennsylvania Railroad, trying to bring other railroads {{to gain access to the}} Philadelphia waterfront via a right-of-way that the Pennsylvania Railroad had miraculously not yet taken. From September 5, 1982 to December 17, 1995, a heritage trolley using historic cars ran along the tracks in the Penn's Landing area between the Ben Franklin Bridge and Pier 51. The trolley used newly installed overhead wires and poles and was operated by the Buckingham Valley Trolley Association. [...] After the trolley service ceased, the wires and poles were removed.

[...] While the lawsuit was pending, the Philadelphia Belt Line petitioned the Surface Transportation Board for a declaratory order confirming that the Philadelphia Belt Line retained its right-of-way and would continue to do so unless the Board granted an application for abandonment of that rail line. The Board denied the petition, finding that the Philadelphia Belt Line had never constructed or operated a rail line on the property being used by SugarHouse and that it had presented no evidence that it had failed to support its argument [...] "that a right-of-way granted by a municipality, but never exercised or developed or otherwise perfected under the Transportation Act of 1920 [...] [...] [...] must be authorized to be abandoned the Board under 49 U.S.C. §10903 before it may be dissolved." ...|$|E
