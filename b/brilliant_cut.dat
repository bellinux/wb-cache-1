5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E
25|$|Around 1900, the {{development}} of diamond saws and good jewelry lathes enabled {{the development}} of modern diamond cutting and diamond cuts, chief among them the round <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut.</b> In 1919, Marcel Tolkowsky analyzed this cut: his calculations took both brilliance (the amount of white light reflected) and fire into consideration, creating a delicate balance between the two. Tolkowsky's calculations would {{serve as the basis}} for all future <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> modifications and standards.|$|E

25|$|Tolkowsky's guidelines, while revolutionary {{in their}} day, {{are not a}} {{definitive}} {{solution to the problem}} of finding the optimum proportions of a round <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> diamond.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{with the}} {{increased}} understanding of light dynamics and diamond cutting, many companies have developed new, modified round <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> diamonds. If designed correctly, these extra facets of the modified round brilliant could benefit the overall beauty of a diamond, such as in 91 facet diamonds.|$|E
25|$|Because {{both the}} {{pavilion}} and crown are comparatively shallow, step cut stones {{are generally not}} as bright and never as fiery as <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> stones, but rather accentuate a diamond's clarity (as even the slightest flaw would be highly visible), whiteness, and lustre (and therefore good polish).|$|E
5000|$|Marcel Tolkowsky (25 December 1899 [...] - [...] 10 February 1991) was {{a member}} of a Jewish family from Poland of diamond cutters and an {{engineer}} by education.

25|$|There {{are several}} older {{modified}} <b>brilliant</b> <b>cuts</b> of uncertain age that, while no longer widely used, are notable for history's sake. They are all round in outline and modify the standard round brilliant by adding facets and changing symmetry, either {{by dividing the}} standard facets or by placing new ones in different arrangements. These cuts include: the King and Magna cuts, both developed by New York City firms, with the former possessing 86 facets and 12-fold symmetry and the latter with 102 facets and 10-fold symmetry; the High-Light cut, developed by Belgian cutter M. Westreich, with 16 additional facets divided equally between the crown and pavilion; and the Princess 144, introduced in the 1960s, with 144 facets and 8-fold symmetry. Not {{to be confused with}} the mixed Princess cut, the Princess 144 cut makes for a lively stone with good scintillation; the extra facets are cut under the girdle rather than subdivided. The extra care required for these sub-girdle facets benefits the finished stone by mitigating girdle irregularity and bearding (hairline fracturing).|$|R
25|$|A {{diamond cut}} is a style or design guide used when shaping a diamond for {{polishing}} {{such as the}} <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut.</b> Cut does not refer to shape (pear, oval), but the symmetry, proportioning and polish of a diamond. The cut of a diamond greatly affects a diamond's brilliance; this means if it is cut poorly, it will be less luminous.|$|E
25|$|The term Hearts and Arrows {{is used to}} {{describe}} the visual effect achieved in a round <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> diamond with perfect symmetry and angles that exhibit a crisp and complete pattern of Hearts & Arrows. When viewed under a special magnifying viewer, a complete and precise visual pattern of 8 hearts is seen while looking down through the pavilion, and 8 arrows can be seen when viewing the stone in the table up position.|$|E
25|$|Mixed cuts share {{aspects of}} both (modified) {{brilliant}} and step cuts: they {{are meant to}} combine the weight preservation and dimensions of step cuts with the optical effects of brilliants. Typically the crown is <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> and the pavilion step-cut. Mixed cuts are all relatively new, with the oldest {{dating back to the}} 1960s. They have been extremely successful commercially and continue to gain popularity, loosening the foothold of the de facto standard round brilliant.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{settlement}} {{in the town of}} Corning was made near the site of the future city in 1796. The community was set apart from the town as a village in 1848. Corning was incorporated as a city in 1890. As the glass industry developed, Corning became known as the [...] "Crystal City" [...] which was supported by companies such as Hawkes, Sinclair, and Hunt - which produced some of the finest American <b>Brilliant</b> Period <b>cut</b> glass between 1880-1915.|$|R
25|$|The first <b>brilliant</b> <b>cuts</b> were {{introduced}} {{in the middle of}} the 17th century. Known as Mazarins, they had 17 facets on the crown (upper half). They are also called double-cut brilliants as they are seen as a step up from old single cuts. Vincent Peruzzi, a Venetian polisher, later increased the number of crown facets from 17 to 33 (triple-cut or Peruzzi brilliants), thereby significantly increasing the fire and brilliance of the cut gem, properties that in the Mazarin were already incomparably better than in the rose. Yet Peruzzi-cut diamonds, when seen nowadays, seem exceedingly dull compared to modern-cut brilliants. Because the practice of bruting had not yet been developed, these early brilliants were all rounded squares or rectangles in cross-section (rather than circular). Given the general name of cushion—what are known today as old mine cuts—these were common by the early 18th century. Sometime later the old European cut was developed, which had a shallower pavilion, more rounded shape, and different arrangement of facets. The old European cut was the forerunner of modern brilliants and was the most advanced in use during the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The Empress Eugénie Diamond is an oval-shaped <b>brilliant</b> diamond, {{perfectly}} <b>cut,</b> {{and weighing}} 51 carats. It {{is named for}} the French empress Eugénie de Montijo, who owned it in the late 19th century. It is currently {{in the hands of}} a private collector.|$|R
25|$|Even {{with modern}} techniques, the cutting and {{polishing}} of a diamond crystal always {{results in a}} dramatic loss of weight; rarely is it less than 50%. The round <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> is preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly-shaped crystals such as macles {{are more likely to}} be cut in a fancy cut (that is, a cut other than the round brilliant), which the particular crystal shape lends itself to. The prevalence and choice of a particular fancy cut is also influenced by fashion; generally speaking, these cuts are not held to the same strict standards as Tolkowsky-derived round brilliants. Most fancy cuts can be grouped into four categories: modified brilliants, step cuts, mixed cuts, and rose cuts.|$|E

The {{earliest}} donations were {{noted in the}} museum's annual report on June 30, 1899, when the institution reported that Dr. L. T. Chamberlain gave them two cut Yogos and 21 other sapphires for their Dr. Isaac Lea gem and mineral collection. The record-setting [...] cut Yogo is also held by the Smithsonian. In 2006, gemologist Robert Kane of Fine Gems International in Helena, which has the world's largest selection of Montana sapphires, donated 333 Montana sapphires, weighing a total of , to the Smithsonian's Gem and Mineral Collection, along with 98.48grams of 18K yellow gold {{for the creation of}} a piece of jewelry. A representative of the Smithsonian asked Paula Crevoshay, a jewelry designer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to create a piece of finished jewelry from these gems. Crevoshay felt that a butterfly motif would best represent America's natural beauty, honor her mother's love of butterflies, and display the wide range of colors found in Montana sapphires. Crevoshay named the brooch [...] "Conchita" [...] in honor of her mother; it is also referred to as the [...] "Sapphire Butterfly Brooch", [...] "Conchita Sapphire Butterfly", and the [...] "Montana Butterfly Brooch". Two of the sapphires used are cabochon cut and the rest are <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut.</b> The majority are from the Rock Creek deposit. The largest one, however, is a blue Yogo used for the butterfly's head. Other sapphires used included yellow, purple, pink, and orange gems.

2500|$|While {{the round}} <b>brilliant</b> <b>cut</b> is {{considered}} standard for diamond, with its shape and proportions nearly constant, {{the choice of}} fancy cut is influenced heavily by fashion. For example, the step cut baguette—which accentuates a diamond's luster, whiteness, and clarity but downplays its fire—was all the rage during the Art Deco period, whereas the mixed Princess cut—which accentuates a diamond's fire and brilliance rather than its luster—is currently gaining popularity. The princess cut is also popular among diamond cutters: of all the cuts, it wastes the least of the original crystal. Older diamonds cut before ca. 1900 were cut in [...] "primitive" [...] versions of the modern round brilliant, such as the rose cut and old mine cut (see History section). Although there is a market for antique stones, many are recut into modern brilliants to increase their marketability. There is also increasing demand for diamonds to be cut in older styles {{for the purpose of}} repairing or reproducing antique jewelry.|$|E
