5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, <b>birth</b> <b>parents</b> and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his <b>birth</b> <b>parents</b> after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal, Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E

Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) openly states his distaste for the documentary. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is pressed with questions about why she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures. Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension.

40|$|Eighteen adoptees who had met {{both their}} birth mothers and birth fathers were {{surveyed}} {{in order to}} determine (a) the types of post-reunion relationships they developed with each <b>birth</b> <b>parent</b> and (b) the factors that facilitated or hindered their reunions. While adoptees were more likely to develop a personal rather than non-personal relationship with birth mothers, relationships with birth fathers were more evenly divided between personal and non-personal relationships. Thematic analysis revealed some similarities in the factors that influence reunions with each <b>birth</b> <b>parent</b> (e. g., <b>birth</b> <b>parent</b> characteristics, support from others), though some differences also emerged (e. g., reactions to pregnancy and relinquishment). Issues of kinship, identity, and family structure are discussed, along with implications for counseling...|$|R

50|$|The {{placement}} of older children can take two widely divergent paths. Generally speaking {{when a child}} has bonded to a <b>birth</b> <b>parent</b> then a need for an adoptive placement arises, it is usually critical for that child's emotional welfare to maintain ties with the <b>birth</b> <b>parent.</b> Sometimes a parent raised a child, but a problem has arisen, and parenting is no longer possible, {{and there are no}} family members able to take over the parenting role, so adoption is the best option.|$|R

5|$|Sometime in {{the spring}} of 1827, Poe turned over his manuscripts to an 18-year-old printer named Calvin F. S. Thomas, whose family may have been known by Poe's <b>birth</b> <b>parents.</b> Thomas had {{previously}} only printed labels, flyers, and other small jobs. Poe used his own money to pay for the publication of his poems as the 40-page collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, the only known book printed by Thomas. The collection was pamphlet-sized, 6.75 by 4.5 inches. Poe was 18 years old when the collection was released in July 1827 and only 50 copies were printed. The total production number is the subject of dispute; various scholars believe the number was slightly lower (only 20 copies) or substantially higher (as many as 200).|$|E

25|$|Children {{found to}} be unable to {{function}} {{in a foster home}} may be placed in Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs) or other such group homes. In theory, the focus of treatment in such facilities is to prepare the child for a return to a foster home, to an adoptive home, or to the <b>birth</b> <b>parents</b> when applicable. But two major reviews of the scholarly literature have questioned these facilities' effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Attitudes {{and laws}} {{regarding}} adoption vary greatly. Whereas all cultures make arrangements whereby children whose <b>birth</b> <b>parents</b> are unavailable to rear {{them can be}} brought up by others, not all cultures have the concept of adoption, that is treating unrelated children as equivalent to biological children of the adoptive parents. Under Islamic Law, for example, adopted children must keep their original surname {{to be identified with}} blood relations, and, traditionally, women wear a hijab in the presence of males in their adoptive households. In Egypt, these cultural distinctions have led to making adoption illegal.|$|E
50|$|A {{single person}} may adopt a child {{if they are}} aged over 21, {{domiciled}} in the UK or Ireland, and are either in a marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting relationship with the parent of the child.

25|$|Approximately In 1816, Jeong Hak-yu, {{the second}} son of Jeong Yak-yong, a {{prominent}} politician and scholar of Joseon dynasty at the time, wrote a poem called Nongga Wollyeongga (농가월령가). This poem, {{which is an}} important source of Korean folk history, describes what ordinary Korean farming families did in each month of a year. In the description of the month of August the poem tells of a married woman visiting her <b>birth</b> <b>parents</b> with boiled dog meat, rice cake, and rice wine, thus showing the popularity of dog meat at the time (Ahn, 2000; Seo, 2002). Dongguk Sesigi (동국세시기), a book written by a Korean scholar Hong Seok-mo in 1849, contains a recipe of Bosintang including a boiled dog, green onion, and red chili pepper powder.|$|E
25|$|Morgan has a {{dream about}} a ritual {{sacrifice}}. The Witches Council thinks {{that it is}} a vision of the future.

The council sends Hunter to New York, the place where the coven is suspected to operate, to investigate. Morgan goes with Hunter; however, she also wishes to discover more about her <b>birth</b> <b>parents,</b> something which can only be done in New York. At the invitation of Bree, they stay at the apartment of Bree's father. Robbie, Sky and Raven come along for the ride.|$|E
50|$|Another way older {{children}} can be placed for adoption is where the birth parents' rights were terminated by a court due to improper parenting or abuse. Although the child may still foster idealized feelings for that failing parent {{it is not uncommon}} in these adoptions for there to be no contact between the child and adoptive <b>parent,</b> and the <b>birth</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|R
40|$|This set {{of seven}} {{experiments}} examines reasoning about the inheritance and acquisition of physical properties in preschoolers, undergraduates, and biology experts. Participants (N =  390) received adoption vignettes {{in which a}} baby animal was born to one parent but raised by a biologically unrelated parent, and they judged whether the offspring {{would have the same}} property as the <b>birth</b> or rearing <b>parent.</b> For each vignette, the animal parents had contrasting values on a physical property dimension (e. g., the <b>birth</b> <b>parent</b> had a short tail; the rearing parent had a long tail). Depending on the condition, the distinct properties had distinct functions (“function‐predictive”) were associated with distinct habitats (“habitat‐predictive”), or had no implications (“non‐predictive”). Undergraduates' bias to view properties as inherited from the <b>birth</b> <b>parent</b> was reduced in the function‐ and habitat‐predictive conditions. This result indicates a purpose‐based view of inheritance, whereby animals can acquire properties that serve a purpose in their environment. This stance was not found in experts or preschoolers. We discuss the results in terms of how undergraduates' purpose‐based inheritance reasoning develops and relates to larger‐scale misconceptions about Darwinian evolutionary processes, and implications for biology education...|$|R

He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. When he returned home, his parents informed Norris that he and his younger sister were both unwanted children, and that they had intended to divorce when both children reached adolescence.|$|E

500|$|The {{adoption}} {{requirements and}} policies for adopting children {{have made it}} harder for foster families and potential adoptive families to adopt. Before a family can adopt, they must go through state, county, and agency criteria.

[...] Adoptive parents also have to deal with criteria that are given by the <b>birth</b> <b>parents</b> of the adoptive child. The different criteria for adopting children makes it harder for couples to adopt children in need, but the strict requirements can help protect the foster children from unqualified couples.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about child-based effects on parents’ anxiety {{symptoms}} early in life despite the possibility that child characteristics {{may contribute to the}} quality of the early environment and children’s own long-term risk for psychological disorder. We examined bidirectional effects between parent anxiety symptoms and infant fear-based negative affect using a prospective adoption design. Infant fear-based negative affect and adoptive parent anxiety symptoms were assessed at child ages 9, 18, and 27 months. <b>Birth</b> <b>parent</b> negative affect was assessed at child age 18 months. More anxiety symptoms in adoptive parents at child age 9 months predicted more negative affect in infants 9 months later. More infant negative affect at child age 9 months predicted more anxiety symptoms in adoptive parents 18 months later. Patterns of results did not differ for adoptive mothers and adoptive fathers. <b>Birth</b> <b>parent</b> negative affect was unrelated to infant or adoptive parent measures. Consistent with expectations, associations between infant negative affect and rearing parents’ anxiety symptoms appear to be bidirectional. In addition to traditional parent-to-child effects, our results suggest that infants’ characteristics may contribute to parent qualities that are known to impact childhood outcomes...|$|R
