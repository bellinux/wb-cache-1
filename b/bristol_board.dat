Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to <b>Bristol</b> <b>board,</b> from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E
500|$|Bechdel {{wrote and}} {{illustrated}} Fun Home over a seven-year period. Her meticulous artistic process made {{the task of}} illustration slow. She began each page by creating a framework in Adobe Illustrator, on which she placed the text and drew rough figures. She used extensive photo reference and, for many panels, posed for each human figure herself, using a digital camera to record her poses. Bechdel also used photo reference for background elements. For example, to illustrate a panel depicting fireworks seen from a Greenwich Village rooftop on July 4, 1976, she used Google Images to find {{a photograph of the}} New York skyline taken from that particular building in that period. She also painstakingly copied by hand many family photographs, letters, local maps and excerpts from her own childhood journal, incorporating these images into her narrative. After using the reference material to draw a tight framework for the page, Bechdel copied the line art illustration onto plate finish <b>Bristol</b> <b>board</b> for the final inked page, which she then scanned into her computer. The gray-blue ink wash for each page was drawn on a separate page of watercolor paper, and combined with the inked image using Photoshop. Bechdel chose the bluish [...] wash color for its flexibility, and because it had [...] "a bleak, elegiac quality" [...] which suited the subject matter. Bechdel attributes this detailed creative process to her [...] "barely controlled obsessive-compulsive disorder".|$|E

6000|$|I {{must first}} make the reader {{understand}} what I mean by a wall's being gathered up. Take {{a piece of}} tolerably thick drawing-paper, or thin <b>Bristol</b> <b>board,</b> five or six inches square. Set it on its edge on the table, and put a small octavo book on the edge or top of it, and it will bend instantly. Tear it into four strips all across, and roll up each strip tightly. Set these rolls on end on the table, and they will carry the small octavo perfectly well. Now the thickness or substance of the paper employed to carry the weight {{is exactly the same}} as it was before, only it is differently arranged, that is to say, [...] "gathered up."[35] If therefore a wall be gathered up like the <b>Bristol</b> <b>board,</b> it will bear greater weight than it would if it remained a wall veil. The sticks into which you gather it are called Piers. A pier is a coagulated wall.|$|E

Burrows drew her panels at an image size of 3" [...] × 6" [...] on <b>Bristol</b> <b>boards</b> measuring 3½" [...] × 6½". Burrows' series ran in competition for a time with Ethel Hays' similarly themed and well-established Flapper Fanny Says panel from NEA. As writers such as F.

[...] He rummaged in the roll-top desk on which Nat Hicks kept bills, buttons, calendars, buckles, thread-channeled wax, shotgun shells, samples of brocade for [...] "fancy vests," [...] fishing-reels, pornographic post-cards, shreds of buckram lining. He pulled out a blurred sheet of <b>Bristol</b> <b>board</b> and anxiously gave it to her. It was a sketch for a frock.

6000|$|The humblest {{volunteer}} {{in the ranks}} of art, who has served a campaign or two ever so ingloriously, has at least this good fortune of understanding, or fancying he is able to understand, how the battle has been fought, and how the engaged general won it. This is the Rhinelander's most brilliant achievement--victory along the whole line. The [...] "Night-watch" [...] at Amsterdam is magnificent in parts, but on the side to the spectator's right, smoky and dim. The [...] "Five Masters of the Drapers" [...] is wonderful for depth, strength, brightness, massive power. What words are these to express a picture! to describe a description! I once saw a moon riding in the sky serenely, attended by her sparkling maids of honor, and a little lady said, with an air of great satisfaction, [...] "I MUST SKETCH IT." [...] Ah, my dear lady, if with an H.B., a <b>Bristol</b> <b>board,</b> and a bit of india-rubber, you can sketch the starry firmament on high, and the moon in her glory, I make you my compliment! I can't sketch [...] "The Five Drapers" [...] with any ink or pen at present at command--but can look with all my eyes, and be thankful to have seen such a masterpiece.|$|E
6000|$|... § II. Now you cannot quite {{treat the}} wall as you did the <b>Bristol</b> <b>board,</b> and twist it up at once; but let us {{see how you can}} treat it. Let A, Fig. IX., be the plan of a wall which you have made inconveniently and expensively thick, and which still appears to be {{slightly}} too weak for what it must carry: divide it, as at B, into equal spaces, a, b, a, b, &c. Cut out a thin slice of it at every a on each side, and put the slices you cut out on at every b on each side, and you will have the plan at B, with exactly the same quantity of bricks. But your wall is now so much concentrated, that, if it was only slightly too weak before, it will be stronger now than it need be; so you may spare some of your space as well as your bricks by cutting off the corners of the thicker parts, as suppose c, c, c, c, at C: and you have now a series of square piers connected by a wall veil, which, on less space and with less materials, will do the work of the wall at A perfectly well.|$|E

6000|$|... 25. Then take a {{piece of}} smooth, but not glossy, <b>Bristol</b> <b>board</b> or {{pasteboard}}; divide it, with your pencil and rule, into squares as large as those of the very largest chess-board: they need not be perfect squares, only as nearly so as you can quickly guess. Rest the pasteboard on something sloping as much as an ordinary desk; then, dipping your brush into the color you have mixed, and taking up as much of the liquid as it will carry, begin at the top of one of the squares, and lay a pond or runlet of color along the top edge. Lead this pond of color gradually downwards, not faster at one place than another, but as if you were adding a row of bricks to a building, all along (only building down instead of up), dipping the brush frequently so as to keep the color as full in that, and in as great quantity on the paper, as you can, so only that it does not run down anywhere in a little stream. But if it should, never mind; go on quietly with your square till you have covered it all in. When you get to the bottom, the color will lodge there in a great wave. Have ready a piece of blotting-paper; dry your brush on it, and with the dry brush take up the superfluous color as you would with a sponge, till it all looks even.|$|E

Can she give lessons in anything? paint card-racks? do fine work? She finds that women are working hard, and better than she can, for twopence a day.

The man of the Fancy Repository and Brompton Emporium of Fine Arts (of whom she bought the screens, vainly hoping that he would repurchase them when ornamented by her hand) can hardly hide the sneer with which he examines these feeble works of art. He looks askance at the lady who waits in the shop, and ties up the cards again in their envelope of whitey-brown paper, and hands them to the poor widow and Miss Clapp, who had never seen such beautiful things in her life, and had been quite confident that the man must give at least two guineas for the screens. They try at other shops in the interior of London, with faint sickening hopes. [...] "Don't want 'em," [...] says one. [...] "Be off," [...] says another fiercely. Three-and-sixpence has been spent in vain--the screens retire to Miss Clapp's bedroom, who persists in thinking them lovely.|$|R
