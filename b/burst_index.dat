The <b>burst</b> <b>index</b> takes into account both the number of delayed cells and the delay they have experienced.

Papers made from recycled fiber were then impregnated with the resultant cellulose acetate. Effects of impregnation conditions on the paper properties were statistically investigated by employing central composite design (CCD) based response surface methodology (RSM). Four response variables, namely density, <b>burst</b> <b>index,</b> smoothness, and rate of surface wettability were analyzed. Polynomial estimation model of each response was developed as functions of three independent variables, which are pressing temperature (T), dipping time (D), and concentration of cellulose acetate (C). The paper which was impregnated based on the calculated optimum condition (T: 163 oC, D: 2. 8 minutes, and C: 2. 7 percent), possessed a density of 0. 5450 g/cm 3, rate of surface wettability of 0. 012 o/s, <b>burst</b> <b>index</b> of 2. 84 kPa m 2 /g, and paper smoothness of 475 mL/min.

The layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly process of creating highly structured thin films was adopted to modify the surface of OCC fibres. Poly dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PDADMAC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) have been used to build up polyelectrolyte multilayers on OCC fibres under a certain condition. Zeta potential analyzer was used to monitor the dynamic adsorption of PDADMAC and HEC with different amount on OCC fibers. Strength measurements of the sheets including tensile <b>index</b> and <b>bursting</b> <b>index</b> were also determined, showing a significant improvement in physical strength with the increase of adsorbed layer number.

Furthermore, filtration time analysis of OCC fibre suspension showed that the built up of PDADMAC and HEC on OCC fibres could improve the fiber-fiber joint strength of joints from polymer-treated fibers, which made the filtration time decline from 30 s to 10. 6 s. In addition, SEM was introduced to observe the morphology of the PDADMAC/HEC multilayers.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the enzymatic deinking of various types of waste paper. Studies on the optimization of enzymatic deinking have been performed previously using commercially available enzyme preparations containing cellulase and hemicellulase. The enzymatic deinking of different types of waste paper demonstrated a high efficiency of 86. 6 % on laser-printed paper, but a low deinking efficiency of 12. 9 % was obtained with newspaper. All enzymatic treatments significantly improved the drainage rate of the deinked waste paper. Enzymatic deinking increased the tensile index of magazine paper but reduced the tensile index of bubble jet-printed paper, photocopy paper and newspaper. Enzymatic hydrolysis caused a 21. 1 % reduction in the tear index for bubble jet-printed paper, but a 3. 1 % increase in the tear index was obtained for laser-printed paper relative to respective blank. In addition, enzymatic hydrolysis increased the <b>burst</b> <b>index</b> by 4. 7 % relative to blank for laser-printed paper.

The improvement of strength properties can be ascribed to the increase in carboxyl groups and crystallinity, and a decrease in fines content and kink index, {{as well as to the}} removal of a portion of xylan and lignins from the fiber surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of two [4 -butyltrimethylammonium]-xylan chloride polyelectrolytes (BTMAXs) on bacterial cellulose (BC) was evaluated. The first strategy was to add the polyelectrolytes to the culture medium together with a cell suspension of the bacterium. After one week of cultivation, the films were collected and purified. The second approach consisted of obtaining a purified and homogenized BC, to which the polyelectrolytes were added subsequently. The films were characterized in terms of tear and <b>burst</b> <b>indexes,</b> optical properties, surface free energy, static contact angle, Gurley porosity, SEM, X-ray diffraction and AFM. Although there are small differences in mechanical and optical properties between the nanocomposites and control films, the films obtained by BC synthesis {{in the presence of}} BTMAXs were remarkably less opaque, rougher, and had a much lower specular gloss. The surface free energy depends on the BTMAXs addition method. The crystallinity of the composites is lower than that of the control material, with a higher reduction of this parameter in the composites obtained by adding the BTMAXs to the culture medium. In view of these results, it can be concluded that BC–BTMAX composites are a promising new material, for example, for paper restoration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) system, the throughput decreases rapidly {{with increase}} in control packet processing time Tcp. The {{negative impact of}} Tcp will become sig-nificant as the optical fiber transmission rate increases. By ana-lyzing {{the relationship between the}} throughput and Tcp, we at-tempt to improve the throughput. Different possible solutions are discussed. We found that using extra random offset time can sig-nificantly improve the throughput at the expense of increase in data <b>burst</b> delay. <b>Index</b> Terms—optical <b>burst</b> switching, optical packet switching, control overhead, offset time I...|$|R
