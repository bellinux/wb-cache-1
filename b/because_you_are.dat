5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E

500|$|Arguably the {{highlight}} of the year was the defeat of the Centre Praying Colonels by a score of 24 to 0. It was Centre's first loss to a southern team since 1916. A story goes that tackle Bill Fincher sought to knock Centre quarterback [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin out of the game, taking with him brass-knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{not going to be in}} there very longabout three minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should {{like to see you}} again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come...

During his voiceover session, he noted, [...] "I always find voice work really fascinating <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> working on one element of your make up as an actor—focusing more intently on one part of your toolbox if you like—in a way so everything seems to go into producing that vocal effect.

Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen.

500|$|Lew Grade, the ITC Entertainment financier, ordered Anderson {{to cancel}} {{production}} on The Secret Service during a test {{screening of the}} pilot episode, [...] "A Case for the Bishop", in December 1968. Objecting to the concept {{on the grounds that}} audiences in the United States would be confused by the Unwinese, Grade capped the production at the thirteen episodes that either had been completed or were in production {{at the time of the}} screening. Anderson countered that a nonsense language such as Unwinese is inherently incomprehensible, and questioned Grade's reasoning for the cancellation, responding that [...] "I chose Stanley Unwin <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not supposed to understand Stanley Unwin, even if you're British.

500|$|Consequently, if a {{parliamentary}} seat falls vacant mid-term, {{it does not}} have to be filled immediately as [...] "he vacancy does not affect the mandate of the Government, nor its ability to deliver on its programmes or promises. And this mandate continues until the next general election is called, when the incumbent team will render account to the electorate." [...] The Prime Minister said that the Singapore system of government was based on this model for two reasons: first, to [...] "encourage voters to think very carefully when they are voting during general elections, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not only voting for your representative in the constituency, you are voting for the government in the country"; and, secondly, [...] "to maximise the chances of a stable, effective government in between general elections".|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him. He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> driving me up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E
500|$|Ferraro gained immediate, {{large-scale}} media attention. At first, journalists {{focused on}} her novelty as {{a woman and her}} poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?" [...] was often directed to her. Ted Koppel questioned her closely about nuclear strategy and during Meet the Press she was asked, [...] "Do you think that in any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a woman?" ...|$|E

[...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if I am? So be it.

500|$|... "Next to You" [...] is a R and pop song. The song has lyrics about a relationship, but Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy {{said that}} the song also {{contained}} inspirational lyrics. It features [...] "digitized" [...] violins. According to the sheet music at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 116beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Bieber and Brown's vocal ranges spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C6. The song features the chord progression of E–B–Cm–A. Nadia Noir of WNOW-FM said the song was a hybrid of a [...] "dance-jam" [...] and [...] "love-song." [...] Furthermore, AOL Music's Charley Rogulewski called the song a [...] "dreamy pop love song." [...] The song sees Brown and Bieber trading verses and the chorus in lyrics like [...] "I'll be there when you're insecure/ Let you know that you're always lovely/ Girl, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{the only thing that}} I got right now." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{hopes of}} winning over the opposition, Hitler {{arranged}} meetings in Munich {{with the three}} Greater Ruhr Gau leaders, including Goebbels. Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally. The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them. Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: [...] "I love him... He has thought through everything," [...] "Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius." [...] He later wrote: [...] "Adolf Hitler, I love you <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius." [...] As {{a result of the}} Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.|$|E
500|$|Later, Rose {{explained}} his intent further in The Washington Post: [...] "The cartoonists treated Islam {{the same way}} they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> part of our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims." [...] The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket ('The Threat from [...] the Darkness) condemning Islamic spiritual leaders [...] "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire." [...] In October 2005, Politiken, another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.|$|E
