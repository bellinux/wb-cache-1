5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way.

5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid {{to predict the future}} or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{struggle}} with diabetes, Mau died {{on his home}} island of Satawal at 18:30 Micronesia time, Monday, July 12, 2010. As is the tradition on Satawal, travel between the islands was temporarily suspended in Mau's honour. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no morgue on the island, Mau was buried the following day, and a nightly rosary was held until the memorial service on July 21 at Santa Soledad Church. Mau's son Henry Yarofalpiy will continue teaching students about their culture, preserving the legacy of his father.|$|E

5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way}} from Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The only exception to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{temperature}} {{difference between the}} core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E

This was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> already an asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{partners}} {{may also}} require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a danger that}} learned helplessness can {{be the result of}} repeated failure to communicate successfully.

Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator.

5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen as a working document, compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.|$|E
