5|$|Nuaym {{then came}} up with an {{efficient}} stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions {{of the rest of the}} Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} {{published the}} allegation that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned {{in some way that}} 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and that he may have been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext {{in the hope that the}} police, seeing him cross the threshold, would <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E

25|$|The room number 217 {{has been}} changed to 237. Timberline Lodge, located on Mt. Hood in Oregon, {{was used for the}} {{exterior}} shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in The Shining, because future guests at the Lodge might <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film. Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of the United States are {{entitled}} to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits. Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not know how to take advantage of social welfare programs. Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due to welfare reforms. In addition, parents who are undocumented may <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs. When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases this and then would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive.|$|E

500|$|The {{race was}} umpired by former Cambridge Blue Mike Sweeney, his fourth {{appearance}} in the role.

[...] The race was sponsored by Beefeater Gin who, prior to the race, had signed a three-year contract to continue their involvement in the race, worth £250,000. The BBC also extended their deal with a new five-year contract to broadcast the race in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves [...] "material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc." [...] Some libraries went as far as burning the newly forbidden books. Shortly after this, in one of his carefully oblique public criticisms of McCarthy, President Eisenhower urged Americans: [...] "Don't join the book burners....

Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that he [...] "preferred this episode of 30 Rock" [...] compared to the previous episode, [...] "SeinfeldVision". Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly asked his readers [...] "do you feel like Liz Lemon took a back seat, and if so, did you mind?", adding that [...] " [...] Baldwin and [...] Morgan get the laughs, but like the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine , 30 Rock requires three distinct flavors.

Harris tells the children not to <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> tell someone {{if they have been}} improperly touched, saying, [...] "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help. You can't protect them from trouble that they themselves have caused, and it's better to say something so that you and the family can get the help you need.

Andy (Ed Helms), still upset from his recent broken engagement with Angela (Angela Kinsey), suggests that Kevin should be mean to Lynne, providing only backhanded compliments and ignoring her calls. Jim (John Krasinski) suggests he ask her out, but not immediately and take things slow. Pam (Jenna Fischer), on the other hand, suggests he ask her out immediately and not <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> express himself to her. When Lynne visits the office, Kevin said he has decided to simply tell her what exactly he is thinking. He tells her {{that she has a}} nice smile and he would like to take her out to dinner and a movie, which she accepts. Kevin then accidentally says [...] "Nice...boobs", but Lynne seems flattered by the statement.|$|E
500|$|Pacini {{stated that}} Retro tried {{to design the}} game so that the only {{difficult}} parts would be boss battles and players would not <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> explore because [...] "the challenge of the game was finding your way around". Senior designer Mike Wikan said that the focus on exploration led the team to spend time making the platform jumping [...] "approachable to the player", and to ensure the gameplay had [...] "shooting [...] a very important, though secondary, consideration". Retro Studios developed the storyline {{under the supervision of}} Yoshio Sakamoto, who verified that the ideas were consistent with the lore of the earlier games. The developers intended that Kraid, a boss from Metroid and Super Metroid, would appear in Prime, and designer Gene Kohler modeled and skinned him for that purpose, but he was cut for time reasons. The [...] team considered implementing the Speed Booster power-up from Super Metroid but concluded it would not work well because of the first-person perspective and [...] "limitations imposed by the scale of our environment".|$|E

He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've done my whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that other people would <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> take. Stone Rollin means I'm going all the way out there this time".|$|E

Some of my friends are taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by 'Nevermore'." [...] Poe's popularity resulted in invitations to recite [...] "The Raven" [...] and to lecture– in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary salon, a guest noted, [...] "to hear [...] repeat the Raven... is an event in one's life."

500|$|Orville {{followed}} his brother's success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer, Virginia, starting on September 3, 1908. On September 9, {{he made the}} first hour-long flight, lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds. On September 17, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger, serving as an official observer. A few minutes into the flight {{at an altitude of}} about , a propeller split and shattered, sending the Flyer out of control. Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital, becoming the first airplane crash fatality. Orville was badly injured, suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs. Twelve years later, after he suffered increasingly severe pains, X-rays revealed the accident had also caused three hip bone fractures and a dislocated hip. The brothers' sister Katharine, a school teacher, rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville's side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization. She helped negotiate a one-year extension of the Army contract. A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked, [...] "Has it got your nerve?" [...] "Nerve?"

[...] Subsequently, a personal message left by Carey is shown, reading [...] "After every storm, if you look hard enough, a rainbow appears..." [...] Five testimonials from fans are shown, each telling of their own personal problems and hardships.
