5|$|Saddam Hussein {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion {{he had taken the}} first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, Karpinski led US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld {{on a tour}} of the Abu Ghraib {{prison to}} {{demonstrate}} the way it had been used <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> to torture his enemies.|$|E
25|$|One of Brandt's last public {{appearances}} was in flying to Baghdad, Iraq, to free Western hostages held <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Brandt secured {{the release of}} a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his airplane landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the Frankfurt Airport.|$|E

25|$|The Iraq War {{began in}} March 2003 as an {{invasion}} of Ba'athist Iraq by a force led by the United States. The Ba'athist government led <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was toppled within a month. This conflict {{was followed by a}} longer phase of fighting in which an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. During this insurgency, the United States was in the role of an occupying power.|$|E
25|$|Water buffalo {{are also}} present in the {{southern}} region of Iraq in the Mesopotamian Marshes. The draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{was an attempt to}} punish the south for the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. After 2003 and the Firdos Square statue destruction, these lands were reflooded and a 2007 report on Maysan and Dhi Qar shows a steady {{increase in the number of}} water buffalo. The report puts the number at 40,008 head in those two provinces.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{following}} the Gulf War, Iraqi–Kuwaiti relations suffered bitterly and consequently Kuwaiti–Iranian relations began to greatly improve and flourish. Bilateral relations were gradually strengthened, partly because Iran and Kuwait were both invaded <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and with exchanges of Iranian and Kuwaiti {{political and economic}} delegations leading to the signing of several economic and trade agreements. In February 2006, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Kuwait opening {{a new chapter in}} relations between the two countries. The well reported visit was the first to Kuwait by a high-ranking Iranian official in 27 years.|$|E
50|$|Together with Abdul Karim Qassim, {{he was one}} of {{the leaders}} of the coup that toppled King Faisal II in 1958. On October 7, 1959 there was an {{unsuccessful}} assassination attempt on his life <b>by</b> twenty-two-year-old <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|R

50|$|According to Western sources, Aviaconversiya deceivers were {{activated}} around Baghdad <b>by</b> the <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{government of}} Iraq {{in order to}} disrupt Coalition GPS devices, namely satellite-guided munitions, during the 2003 Iraq War. Russian officials dismissed the allegations, as did Aviaconversiya.|$|R
25|$|During the 1970s, Baghdad {{experienced}} {{a period of}} prosperity and growth because of {{a sharp increase in}} the price of petroleum, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. The masterplans of the city (1967, 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice. However, the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's continuous bombardments of Tehran's residential districts.|$|E
25|$|Sovereignty was {{transferred}} to a Governing Council Iraqi interim government led by Iyad Allawi as Iraq's first post-Saddam prime minister; this government {{was not allowed to}} make new laws without the approval of the CPA. The Iraqi Interim Government was replaced {{as a result of the}} elections which took place in January 2005. A period of negotiations by the elected Iraqi National Assembly followed, which culminated on 6 April 2005 with the selection of, among others, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and President Jalal Talabani. Prime Minister al-Jaafari led the majority party of the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA), a coalition of the al-Dawa and SCIRI (Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq) parties. Both parties are backed by Tehran, and were banned <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Iraq imposed an {{economic}} blockade over the region, reducing its oil and food supplies. Elections held in June 1992 produced an inconclusive outcome, with the assembly divided almost equally {{between the two}} main parties and their allies. During this period, the Kurds were subjected to a double embargo: one imposed by the United Nations on Iraq and one imposed <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> on their region. The severe economic hardships caused by the embargoes fueled tensions between the two dominant political parties, the KDP and the PUK, over control of trade routes and resources. Relations between the PUK and the KDP started to become dangerously strained from September 1993 after rounds of amalgamations occurred between parties. This led to internecine and intra-Kurdish conflict and warfare between 1994 and 1996.|$|E
50|$|The Tikriti Jewish {{community}} was mostly gone by 1948. <b>By</b> the time <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> rose to power {{there were only}} two Jewish families in the city.|$|R
5000|$|Among other things, Bremer {{repeatedly}} {{asserted that}} {{when he came to}} Iraq, the Iraqi army had abandoned its barracks, and therefore [...] "there was no army to disband". He also repeatedly defended his decision to expel Ba'ath Party members from government posts <b>by</b> comparing <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> with Adolf Hitler.|$|R
50|$|Article 140 of the Constitution of Iraq {{states that}} before the {{referendum}} is carried out, measures {{should be taken to}} reverse the Arabization policy employed <b>by</b> the <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> administration during the Al-Anfal Campaign. Thousands of Kurds returned to Kirkuk following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The referendum will decide whether enough have returned for the area to be considered Kurdish.|$|R
25|$|The {{parliament}} of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region {{was established}} in Erbil in 1970 after negotiations between the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Mustafa Barzani, but was effectively controlled <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> until the Kurdish uprising {{at the end of}} the 1991 Gulf War. The legislature ceased to function effectively in the mid-1990s when fighting broke out between the two main Kurdish factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The city was captured by the KDP in 1996 with the assistance of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. The PUK then established an alternative Kurdish government in Sulaimaniyah. KDP claimed that on March 1996 PUK asked for Iran's help to fight KDP. Considering this as a foreign attack on Iraq's soil, the KDP asked the Iraqi government for help.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{the last}} Iraqi census counted 1.4million Christians. They were tolerated under the secular regime of Saddam Hussein, who even {{made one of}} them, Tariq Aziz his deputy. However {{persecution}} <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> continued against the Christians on an ethnic, cultural and racial level, as the vast majority are Mesopotamian Eastern Aramaic speaking Ethnic Assyrians (aka Chaldo-Assyrians). The Assyrian -Aramaic language and written script was repressed, the giving of Hebraic/Aramaic Christian names or Akkadian/Assyro-Babylonian names forbidden (Tariq Aziz's real name is Michael Youhanna for example), and Saddam exploited religious differences between Assyrian denominations such as Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Ancient Church of the East, {{in an attempt to}} divide them. Many Assyrians and Armenians were ethnically cleansed from their towns and villages under the al Anfal Campaign in 1988, despite this campaign being aimed primarily at Kurds.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Abbas {{was given}} {{sanctuary}} in Iraq <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> Abbas (born in a Syrian refugee camp) made {{his new home}} in Gaza (after being given amnesty in 1996 {{in line with the}} 1993 signing of the Oslo peace accords). He became a representative of the Palestine National Council. The administration of President Bill Clinton aware of Abbas' resurfacing neither asked for his extradition nor requested he be turned over to Italy who had found him guilty in absentia. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution 99-0 asking Clinton to request Abbas' extradition to the USA. The Congressional Research Service held that the statute of limitations and not expired because Abbas was a fugitive from justice. Clinton's critics also pointed out that the US was not a signatory to the Oslo accords, and that they make no mention of the USA's ability to prosecute anyone. Throughout the 1990s Abbas moved back and forth from Baghdad to the West Bank, secretly recruiting more Palestinians to join the PLF, while he told the news media that he was reformed and that the Achille Lauro hijacking had been an accident.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990 Iraq, led <b>by</b> President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> invaded Kuwait. In {{the middle}} of the month U.S. President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred {{thousand}} troops, along with a strong force of naval support, to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multinational force in a standoff with Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} the {{sanctions}} on the civilian population of Iraq have been disputed. Whereas it was widely believed that the sanctions caused a major rise in child mortality, recent {{research has shown that}} commonly cited data were doctored <b>by</b> the <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> regime and that [...] "there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions".|$|R
25|$|The city of Khorramshahr {{was almost}} {{completely}} destroyed {{as a result}} of the scorched earth policy ordered <b>by</b> Iraq's leader, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> However, Iranian forces were able to prevent the Iraqis from attempting to spread the execution of this policy to other major urban centres.|$|R
25|$|Powell {{came under}} fire {{for his role in}} {{building}} the case for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In a press statement on February 24, 2001, he had said that sanctions against Iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> As {{was the case in the}} days leading up to the Persian Gulf War, Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar Richard Clarke in front of the 9/11 Commission. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a unilateral approach. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.|$|E
500|$|In {{testimony}} before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 1989, Schwarzkopf maintained that the Soviet Union {{was a threat to}} the region, but when giving an overview of the countries in the region, noted that Iraq posed a threat to its weaker neighbors. He implored that the U.S. [...] "seek to assert a moderating influence in Iraq." [...] With regional turmoil growing, Schwarzkopf became concerned about the threat posed <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> focusing the attention of his command to prepare to respond to {{what he thought was a}} [...] "more realistic scenario." [...] That year, his command began planning to counter an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, seeing it as a likely conflict which would threaten the interests of the United States. In early 1990 he testified again before the Senate Armed Services Committee in threat-assessment hearings that the Cold War was ending and it was less likely the Soviet Union would exert military force in the region. Though he declined to identify Iraq specifically as a threat, he noted a regional conflict was the most likely event to destabilize the region, and noted Iraq's ceasefire with Iran meant it was continuing to grow and modernize its military. In early 1990, he drafted a war plan, Operations Plan 1002-90, titled [...] "Defense of the Arabian Peninsula," [...] which envisioned an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia through Kuwait.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the Iraqi {{legal and}} penal code was changed <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and the ruling Ba'ath Party, thereby {{making it a}} felony to [...] "promote or acclaim Zionist principles, {{including}} freemasonry, or who associate [...] with Zionist organizations." ...|$|E
50|$|Kuprikov {{suffered}} a fatal {{death in the}} early 1990s. He was serving in Iraq in the Gulf War and was captured <b>by</b> some of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> militants. His body was traded back to Russia in 1992 for some ground-to-air missiles. His body was terribly decomposed.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, {{after being}} {{approached}} by a Kuwaiti expatriate in New York, Hill & Knowlton took on [...] "Citizens for a Free Kuwait."

25|$|Camp Ashraf {{is located}} {{northeast}} of the Iraqi town of Khalis, about 120 kilometers west of the Iranian border and 60 kilometers north of Baghdad, and is {{the seat of the}} PMOI. Iraq and Iran have designated the PMOI a terrorist group, though not the United States, European Union or United Nations. The PMOI was welcomed into Iraq in the 1980s <b>by</b> then-President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> who funded and armed the group, which fought alongside Iraqi forces during the Iran–Iraq War.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the 2003 Iraq War, {{she took}} a {{position}} on the alleged threat posed <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> For example, in an interview with Tony Snow on a February 23, 2003 episode of Fox News Sunday, Garofalo said of the Iraqi dictator: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Yellow revolution", [...] "yellow wind", [...] "yellow storm" [...] {{were thrown}} as slurs <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> against Iran due to Hulagu's 1258 sack of Baghdad during the Mongol wars and the terms [...] "Persian" [...] and [...] "Elamites" [...] {{were also used}} by Saddam as insults.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, with the {{eruption}} of the Iran–Iraq War, another Kurdish rebellion erupted in northern Iraq, initiated with Iranian support. The revolt [...] ended with a massive killing campaign <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> in 1986-1989. During the Al-Anfal campaign an estimated 182,000 Kurds {{lost their lives in}} north Iraq and hundreds of thousands forced to become refugees, fleeing mostly to neighbouring Iran.|$|E
50|$|Bahrain was {{an active}} member of the {{coalition}} that fought to remove the Taliban regime from Afghanistan in 2001; the Kingdom provided ships for the naval cordon in the Indian Ocean put in place to intercept fleeing Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.However, the Kingdom opposed unilateral action against Iraq in 2003, and to the annoyance of Washington in the run up to the war sought to defuse the crisis <b>by</b> offering <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> asylum as a way of avoiding war.|$|R
50|$|In July 2003, Pope {{admitted}} leaking confidential Foreign Affairs Select Committee evidence, to The Guardian {{chief political}} correspondent Patrick Wintour. The move was described {{as an attempt to}} “bounce” MPs on the committee into clearing Alastair Campbell of “sexing up” the so called Dodgy Dossier. This was of evidence into the threat, posed <b>by</b> Iraqi leader <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1981, when Ayatollah Khomeini {{dismissed}} President Bani Sadr and a {{new wave}} of arrests and executions started in the country, Rajavi and Bani Sadr fled to Paris from Tehran's airbase.
