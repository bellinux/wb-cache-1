30|$|<b>Balance</b> <b>quality</b> {{measured}} by a modified bathroom scale is correlated with standard clinical tests, which are frequently used to assess frailty or fall risk. The BQT device {{is very easy to}} use, user friendly, and fits well in the usual environment of older adults, with no difference detected when compared to a typical bathroom scale. The BQT can, therefore, be used as part of a set of tests for frailty detection, or as a stand-alone tool for <b>balance</b> <b>quality</b> assessment and ecological balance monitoring. Further investigations can be envisaged in order to refine some of the steps used to build the balance score, in particular the thresholds used to attribute scores to each of the four variables.

30|$|Balance is {{essential}} in order to perform typical activities of daily living. However, the ability of people to maintain their balance decreases with age and/or neurological or musculoskeletal disorders. Older adults with poor balance have {{an increased risk of}} falls and adverse health outcomes (Fried et al. 2001), and also reduced physical activity levels, leading to an increased risk of frailty (Fried et al. 2005) and a decline towards dependence (Tinetti and Williams 1997; Gill et al. 1995). Despite this gradual decline, it is possible to slow down or even prevent the decline for community-dwelling elderly if an appropriate intervention program is put in place (Gill et al. 2002). In order to be effective, the intervention program needs to start as early as possible, which means {{there is a need for}} tools that are able to detect as early as possible any decrease in <b>balance</b> <b>quality.</b> Thus, an adapted prevention or rehabilitation program could be put in place, with progress followed over time. Accordingly, it {{is essential}} to detect balance impairment as early as possible, and then to monitor <b>balance</b> <b>quality</b> under ecologically valid conditions. Any evaluation tool needs to be easy to use (non professional users), socially acceptable (community dwelling elderly) and relevant with respect to well-established clinical tests.|$|E
30|$|Frailty and {{detection}} of fall risk are major issues in preventive gerontology. A simple tool frequently used in daily life, a bathroom scale (<b>balance</b> <b>quality</b> tester: BQT), was modified {{to obtain information}} on the balance of 84 outpatients consulting at a geriatric clinic. The results computed from the BQT were compared {{to the values of}} three geriatric tests that are widely used either to detect a fall risk or frailty (timed get up and go: TUG; 10  m walking speed: WS; walking time: WT; one-leg stand: OS). The BQT calculates four parameters that are then scored and weighted, thus creating an overall indicator of <b>balance</b> <b>quality.</b> Raw data, partial scores and the global score were compared with the results of the three geriatric tests. The WT values had the highest correlation with BQT raw data (r =  0.55), while TUG (r =  0.53) and WS (r =  0.56) had the highest correlation with BQT partial scores. ROC curves for OS cut-off values (4 and 5  s) were produced, with the best results obtained for a 5  s cut-off, both with the partial scores combined using Fisher’s combination (specificity 85  %: < 0.11, sensitivity 85  %: > 0.48), and with the empirical score (specificity 85  %: < 7, sensitivity 85  %: > 8). A BQT empirical score of less than seven can detect fall risk in a community dwelling population.|$|E

40|$|Falls are a {{major cause}} of death in older people. One method used to predict falls is {{analysis}} of Centre of Pressure (CoP) displacement, which provides a measure of <b>balance</b> <b>quality.</b> The <b>Balance</b> <b>Quality</b> Tester (BQT) is a device based on a commercial bathroom scale that calculates instantaneous values of vertical ground reaction force (Fz) as well as the CoP in both anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions. The entire testing process needs to take no longer than 12 s to ensure subject compliance, making it vital that calculations related to balance are only calculated for the period when the subject is static. In the present study, a method is presented to detect the stabilization period after a subject has stepped onto the BQT. Four different phases of the test are identified (stepping-on, stabilization, balancing, stepping-off), ensuring that subjects are static when parameters from the balancing phase are calculated. The method, based on a simplified cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm, could detect the change between unstable and stable stance. The time taken to stabilize significantly affected the static balance variables of surface area and trajectory velocity, and was also related to Timed-up-and-Go performance. Such a finding suggests that the time to stabilize could be a worthwhile parameter to explore as a potential indicator of balance problems and fall risk in older people...|$|E
