40|$|In this paper, the kinetic and {{thermodynamic}} hydrogen adsorption {{characteristics of}} a novel composite comprising TiNT decorated with the Prussian blue analogue Cd 3 FeIII are investigated at high pressures and different temperatures. It is shown that <b>boundary-layer</b> (<b>film)</b> diffusion does not play a limiting role in the mass transport of hydrogen inside the composite material. The diffusion coefficient and time constant at different temperatures and pressures are calculated using an intra-particle diffusion model. The results suggest that molecular diffusion dominates Knudsen diffusion in the composite material. There are clear improvements in the mass transport characteristics compared to bulk Cd 3 FeIII. The Gibb's free energy is estimated by fitting isotherm equilibrium data to the Dubinin–Astakhov model and {{is used to calculate}} the enthalpy and the entropy of adsorption. The calculated value of enthalpy is characteristic of a physisorption process and is considerably higher than the activation energy for intraparticle diffusion, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of hydrogen is not mass transport to the adsorption sites...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{conceptual}} model of fracture-flow-enhanced matrix diffusion, which correlates with fracture-flow velocity, i. e., matrix diffusion enhancement induced by rapid fluid flow within fractures. According to the <b>boundary-layer</b> or <b>film</b> theory, fracture flow enhanced matrix diffusion may dominate mass-transfer processes at fracture-matrix interfaces, because rapid flow along fractures results in large velocity and concentration gradients at and near fracture-matrix interfaces, enhancing matrix diffusion at matrix surfaces. In this paper, {{we present a}} new formulation of the conceptual model for enhanced fracture-matrix diffusion, and its implementation is discussed using existing analytical solutions and numerical models. In addition, we use the enhanced matrix diffusion concept to analyze laboratory experimental results from nonreactive and reactive tracer breakthrough tests, {{in an effort to}} validate the new conceptual model...|$|R
30|$|The plot of log qt against 0.5 log t gives a {{straight}} line with positive intercept for intra-particle diffusion-controlled adsorption process. If the calculated intra-particle diffusion coefficient, DP, value falls {{in the range of}} 10 − 11 to 10 − 13 cm 2 /s, then the rate-determining step will be intra-particle diffusion. Also, if the calculated film diffusion, DF, value is found within the range 10 − 6 to 10 − 8 cm 2 /s, then the rate-limiting step will be controlled by <b>film</b> (<b>boundary-layer)</b> diffusion (Debnath and Ghosh 2008, Menkiti, et al. 2014).|$|R
