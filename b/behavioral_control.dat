When alcohol and caffeine are consumed jointly, the effects produced by caffeine are affected, but the alcohol effects remain the same. For example, when additional caffeine is added, the drug effect produced by alcohol is not reduced. However, the jitteriness and alertness given by caffeine is decreased when additional alcohol is consumed.

25|$|Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scale (IPAS) is a 30-item self-report questionnaire. Half of {{the items}} {{describe}} impulsive aggression and half the items describe premeditated aggression. Aggressive behavior has traditionally been classified into two distinct subtypes, impulsive or premeditated. Impulsive aggression {{is defined as a}} hair-trigger aggressive response to provocation with loss of <b>behavioral</b> <b>control.</b> Premeditated aggression is defined as a planned or conscious aggressive act, not spontaneous or related to an agitated state. The IPAS is designed to characterize aggressive behavior as predominately impulsive or predominately premeditated in nature. Those subjects who clustered on the impulsive factor showed a broad range of emotional and cognitive impairments; those who clustered on the premeditated factor showed a greater inclination for aggression and anti-social behaviour.|$|E
40|$|Research in {{face-to-face}} teams shows conflicting results {{about the}} impact of <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> on trust; some research shows that controls increase the salience of good behavior, which increases trust while other research shows that controls increase the salience of poor behavior that decreases trust. The only study in virtual teams, which examined poorly functioning teams, found that controls increased the salience of poor behavior, which decreased trust. We argue that in virtual teams <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> amplify the salience of all behaviors (positive and negative) and that an individual’s selective perception bias influences how these behaviors are interpreted. Thus the link from <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> to trust is more complex than first thought. We conducted a 2 2 experiment, varying the use of <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> (controls, no controls) and individual team member behaviors (reneging behaviors designed to reduce trust beliefs and fulfilling behaviors designed to increase trust beliefs). We found that <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> did amplify the salience of all behaviors; however, contrary to what we expected, this actually weakened the impact of reneging and fulfilling behaviors on trust. We believe that completing a formal evaluation increased empathy and the awareness of context in which the behaviors occurred and thus mitigated extreme perceptions. We also found that <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> increased the selective perception bias which induced participants to see the behaviors their disposition to trust expected rather than the behaviors that actually occurred...|$|R

40|$|This explorative study {{contributes}} to the limited body of knowledge on the financial impacts of using multiple forms of controls in managerial performance evaluations. The study explores (1) how short-term profitability is affected by headquarters' emphasis on financial, nonfinancial and selected <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> in the performance evaluation of overseas subsidiary managers, and (2) whether the effects of such evaluations vary with perceived environmental changes. Documentary and survey data for a sample of multinational companies headquartered in Finland propose that the emphasis of financial controls by top management improves short-term profitability more than an emphasis on nonfinancial or <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls.</b> Simultaneous emphasis of all three types of controls does not significantly increase short-term profitability over an emphasis on financial controls, because {{the positive effect of}} <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> is mostly offset by a negative effect of nonfinancial controls. Perceived environmental changes appear to moderate the relationship between the headquarters' emphasis on nonfinancial controls and short-term profitability. These findings imply that in the short-term and regardless of the environmental contingencies analyzed, financial controls are more effective than nonfinancial or <b>behavioral</b> <b>controls</b> in improving profitability, but packages comprising financial and <b>behavioral</b> (action accountability) <b>controls</b> in particular can improve short-term profitability even more. ...|$|R
25|$|Social {{behavior}} and wound healing: Oxytocin is also thought to modulate inflammation by decreasing certain cytokines. Thus, the increased release in oxytocin following positive social interactions {{has the potential}} to improve wound healing. A study by Marazziti and colleagues used heterosexual couples to investigate this possibility. They found increases in plasma oxytocin following a social interaction were correlated with faster wound healing. They hypothesized this was due to oxytocin reducing inflammation, thus allowing the wound to heal more quickly. This study provides preliminary evidence that positive social interactions may directly influence aspects of health. According to a study published in 2014, silencing of oxytocin receptor interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of female mice resulted in loss of social interest in male mice during the sexually receptive phase of the estrous cycle. Oxytocin evokes feelings of contentment, reductions in anxiety, and feelings of calmness and security when in the company of the mate. This suggests oxytocin may be important for the inhibition of the brain regions associated with <b>behavioral</b> <b>control,</b> fear, and anxiety, thus allowing orgasm to occur. Research has also demonstrated that oxytocin can decrease anxiety and protect against stress, particularly in combination with social support.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Behavioral</b> <b>control</b> is an {{important}} application of cognitive inhibition in behavioral psychology, as is emotional control. Depression {{is an example of}} cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. [...] "There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes". Anger is another important emotion affected by cognitive inhibition. [...] "Trait anger is a robust predictor of the angry and aggressive response to hostile situational input, {{but it is important to}} better understand the mechanisms underlying this personality...individuals low in trait anger systematically recruit cognitive control resources within hostile contexts". When situations that may elicit anger leading to violence arise, cognitive inhibition is used extensively. Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in [...] "trait anger", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli. Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} {{the main reason}} for this slight difference between GA and the Solver solutions is due to the several <b>behavioral</b> and <b>control</b> setting parameters associated with the GA (Table  1). The developed GA requires that values have to be selected for the <b>behavioral</b> and <b>control</b> setting, including: initial population, crossover percent, the number of elites, migrated population, selection method, and crossover method. The values for these metrics are usually determined by trial and error or tuned to a specific dataset. This can be time consuming and mean that when applied to a slightly different set of data, slightly higher errors are incurred in the prediction (e.g., tuning the control metrics for the training data subset and then applying them to the testing data subset). One advantage of the Solver optimizers is that they can be setup and applied rapidly avoiding the need to tune any <b>behavioral</b> or <b>control</b> metrics.|$|R

Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and blame externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause.
