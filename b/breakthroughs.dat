30|$|According to the {{fluidity}} variation {{before and}} after steam <b>breakthrough,</b> a tapering distribution of steam <b>breakthrough</b> channel in heavy oil reservoirs is described. And based on this description, the steam <b>breakthrough</b> volume and blocking volume for single direction complete <b>breakthrough</b> well, single direction incomplete <b>breakthrough</b> well and multidirectional <b>breakthrough</b> wells within one well group are calculated.|$|R
30|$|In {{the process}} of steam flooding, there always occurs multidirectional steam <b>breakthrough</b> within one well group. So before quantitatively {{describing}} the steam <b>breakthrough</b> channel and calculating the blocking volume, the degree of steam <b>breakthrough</b> should be judged. According to the judgment based on CIP and considering the design of blocking volume, all producers are divided into complete steam <b>breakthrough</b> wells and incomplete steam <b>breakthrough</b> wells. Then the calculation of steam <b>breakthrough</b> volume and blocking volume relies on the tapering distribution of the steam <b>breakthrough</b> channel.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, in the {{statistical}} process, {{we find the}} calculated <b>breakthrough</b> volumes of the complete <b>breakthrough</b> well tend to be larger {{than those of the}} numerical simulation results. However, the calculated volumes of the incomplete <b>breakthrough</b> well {{are more likely to be}} smaller than those of the numerical simulation results. This phenomenon might result from the difference of the calculation methods. For the complete <b>breakthrough</b> well, due to the steam override, the variety of the steam and condensate water profiles of different layers is large. For the calculation method of the complete <b>breakthrough</b> well, the steam override is not taken into consideration. For the incomplete <b>breakthrough</b> well, the <b>breakthrough</b> radius is smaller than the well spacing, and this may lead to the calculated <b>breakthrough</b> area being smaller than the real steam and condensate water area. In summary, the precise relation between the calculated <b>breakthrough</b> volume and the numerical simulation results for complete <b>breakthrough</b> wells and incomplete <b>breakthrough</b> wells needs further study.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To develop {{prognostic}} {{models for}} {{risk of a}} <b>breakthrough</b> seizure, risk of seizure recurrence after a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure, and likelihood of achieving 12 -month remission following a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure. A <b>breakthrough</b> seizure is one that occurs following at least 12 months remission whilst on treatment. METHODS: We analysed data from the SANAD study. This long-term randomised trial compared treatments for participants with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Multivariable Cox models investigated how clinical factors affect the probability of each outcome. Best fitting multivariable models were produced with variable reduction by Akaike's Information Criterion. Risks associated with combinations of risk factors were calculated from each multivariable model. RESULTS: Significant factors in the multivariable model for risk of a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure following 12 -month remission were number of tonic-clonic seizures by achievement of 12 -month remission, time taken to achieve 12 -month remission, and neurological insult. Significant factors in the model for risk of seizure recurrence following a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure were total number of drugs attempted to achieve 12 -month remission, time to achieve 12 -month remission prior to <b>breakthrough</b> seizure, and <b>breakthrough</b> seizure treatment decision. Significant factors in the model for likelihood of achieving 12 -month remission after a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure were gender, age at <b>breakthrough</b> seizure, time to achieve 12 -month remission prior to <b>breakthrough,</b> and <b>breakthrough</b> seizure treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis to consider risk of a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure and subsequent outcomes. The described models {{can be used to}} identify people most likely to have a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure, a seizure recurrence following a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure, and to achieve 12 -month remission following a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure. The results suggest that focussing on achieving 12 -month remission swiftly represents the best therapeutic aim {{to reduce the risk of}} a <b>breakthrough</b> seizure and subsequent negative outcomes. This will aid individual patient risk stratification and the design of future epilepsy trials...|$|R
30|$|The {{value of}} CIP is between 0 and 1. In order to use CIP to define whether steam <b>breakthrough</b> happens or not, value ranges should be determined.

30|$|Steam <b>breakthrough</b> {{has a great}} {{negative}} influence {{on the development of}} steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. In this article, a new profile control design based on quantitative identification of steam <b>breakthrough</b> channel is introduced. Firstly, dual-sandpack experiments are conducted to study the characteristics and influencing factors of steam <b>breakthrough.</b> Then based on the experimental results as well as pretreatment and combination of geological parameters and production data, comprehensive identification parameter (CIP) is achieved through the analytic hierarchy process to quantitatively describe the degree of steam <b>breakthrough.</b> Afterward, the <b>breakthrough</b> types of production wells are determined by CIP and the volume of <b>breakthrough</b> channels and profile control parameters among the injector and the producers are calculated according to the tapering distribution of steam <b>breakthrough</b> in the process of steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. The experiment results show that there exists a large difference between <b>breakthrough</b> channels and non-breakthrough areas in temperature and oil recovery. Permeability contrast is an important factor, which influences the direction of steam <b>breakthrough,</b> and temperature has a great correlation with oil recovery under the heterogeneous condition. The determination of CIP is an attempt to quantify the degree of <b>breakthrough</b> and it combines many factors, which show the difference between the injector and the producer, as well as the difference between producers. All producers of the steam flooding well group can be divided into complete <b>breakthrough</b> wells with CIP over 0.5 and incomplete <b>breakthrough</b> wells with CIP below 0.5 for calculating conveniently. Based on the tapering distribution of the steam <b>breakthrough</b> channel, blocking parameters considering oil drainage radius around the injector, temperature distribution between the injector and the producer and the demand of blocking effect and field reality are obtained to calculate the blocking volume for complete <b>breakthrough</b> wells and incomplete <b>breakthrough</b> wells. This method {{could be used as a}} tool to judge <b>breakthrough</b> degree and design profile control parameters for oilfields with heavy oil reservoirs.|$|R

30|$|Currently, {{there are}} rare studies on {{quantitative}} {{identification of the}} steam <b>breakthrough</b> channel. Correspondingly to their steam <b>breakthrough</b> identification theories, Dong and Liu (2012) uses heat invading volume to quantitatively describe <b>breakthrough</b> channel.

However, the phenomenon of steam <b>breakthrough</b> is not always reflected by the sudden change of temperature. Zheng et al.
