5|$|Despite {{their strong}} first half {{up to that}} point, Bolton went a goal behind in the 37th minute. Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman {{received}} the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> John Barnes, he ran past Bolton defender Alan Stubbs, then past Scott Green. His subsequent shot was not powerful, but Bolton goalkeeper Keith Branagan could not stop the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> going into the goal, giving Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|As a batsman, Miller was out {{for four}} in the first innings, not {{offering}} a shot to an inswinger. In the second innings, Miller's first ball was a hat-trick <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> English captain Norman Yardley; he survived a loud leg before wicket appeal and then hit a six into the grandstand, {{on his way to}} 74. Australia declared at 7/460, 595runs ahead. Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409runs.|$|E

5|$|At Bordeaux, Gourcuff quickly {{asserted}} {{himself into}} the squad for the 2008–09 season scoring on his league debut against Caen in a 2–1 victory and also helping Bordeaux capture their 2nd Trophée des champions title. He scored Bordeaux's 4th and final goal in the team's 4–0 triumph over Vannes in the Coupe de la Ligue final. Gourcuff also provided the assist on the third goal. He scored two goals in Bordeaux's Champions League campaign against Roma and CFR Cluj. On 11 January 2009, Gourcuff scored a goal that was voted {{the goal of the}} season by fans against Paris Saint-Germain in a 4–0 victory. Upon receiving the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> teammate Matthieu Chalmé, just outside the box, Gourcuff performed a swift Marseille turn, eluding PSG defender Sylvain Armand, followed by quickly shifting the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> his right foot to his left causing Sammy Traoré to lose balance, before bringing the ball back to his right foot and blasting it past Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Mickaël Landreau with the outside of his right foot.|$|E
5|$|Baggio scored another match-winning {{goal in the}} quarter-finals {{to defeat}} Spain 2–1 with three minutes remaining. After {{receiving}} the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Giuseppe Signori, he dribbled past the Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, scoring off-balance from a tight angle. He was also involved in the build-up which led to Italy's first goal by Dino Baggio.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{initially}} {{struggled against}} the English bowling. He faced his first <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling {{from the other}} end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first 20 minutes and Australia had scored only 14 after the first 30 minutes. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|The game {{itself was}} closely contested. Staubach {{completed}} 25 passes, but also threw two interceptions. Late {{in the fourth}} quarter, Navy took the lead, 22–21. With less than three minutes remaining, the Midshipmen kicked off and halfback Ken Ambrusko fielded the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> the Terrapins' endzone. Ambrusko returned it 101 yards for a touchdown, and Maryland won the game, 27–22.|$|E

5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 34 in the First Test at Johannesburg, Harvey amassed 178 in {{the first}} innings of the Second Test at Cape Town, which set up a first innings lead of 248 runs. He then scored 23 not out to guide Australia to an eight-wicket victory in the second innings. This was {{followed}} by an unbeaten 151 in {{five and a half}} hours at Durban, regarded as one of his finest Test innings. Having been dismissed for 75 on a wet wicket {{in the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/59 in pursuit of a victory target of 336. On a crumbling, sticky pitch, the Australians were having extreme difficulty with the spin of Hugh Tayfield and faced their first Test defeat against South Africa for 39 years. Despite a few square cuts, Harvey adapted his game to play a patient innings, prompting heckling from spectators {{for the first time in}} his career. On 40, a <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Tufty Mann broke through his defence and Harvey thought himself bowled, only to see that the ball had goven for byes. However, Mann and Tayfield began to tire in the heat and Harvey began to score more quickly, reaching 50 in 137 minutes by the lunch break. He registered his slowest ever century on his way to guiding his team to an improbable victory by five wickets. Harvey brought up the winning runs by clipping a <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Mann to the midwicket boundary.|$|E
5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E

His second was scored with a half volley from a tight angle, assisted by Demetrio Albertini with a lobbed ball.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{began the}} 1991 season with Buffalo. The Pirates {{promoted}} Banister from {{the minor leagues}} on July 23, 1991, when catcher Don Slaught was injured and placed on the disabled list. Manager Jim Leyland used Banister as a pinch hitter for pitcher Doug Drabek {{in the eighth inning}} of that day's game against the Atlanta Braves at Three Rivers Stadium. Using Cecil Espy's bat, Banister hit a <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Dan Petry and just beat shortstop Jeff Blauser's throw to first base. Banister is one of only 15 batters (excluding pitchers) in baseball history to record a hit in his only major league plate appearance.|$|E
5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting. Morris tried to force a <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Laker away, but hit it {{from the middle of}} his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in the past. Barnes then reached his half-century after 135 minutes, pulling Barnett for four, and the Australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting. At the adjournment, the tourists were 104/1.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw).

The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything with his left hand, including brushing his teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E
5|$|Celestine Babayaro, who {{had been}} {{struggling}} with an injury, played no further part in the final and was substituted before the second half commenced. Terry came on in his place to partner Desailly, which meant Gallas moved to left-back. Arsenal resumed play and a shot by Henry was kept out by Cudicini. The scare brought Chelsea to life and resulted in the team enjoying their best spell of the match. Guðjohnsen's effort in the 57th minute forced a save from Seaman, who tipped the ball over the bar. Jesper Grønkjær then roamed forward and played the ball to Le Saux, but the defender's shot went well over. Chelsea continued to pile pressure on Arsenal; Grønkjær's pass intended for Hasselbaink in the 61st minute was intercepted just in time by Adams and Melchiot's header unsettled Seaman in goal. Wiltord then collected the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> midfield and played a one-two with Henry, but directed his shot wide from the left flank. Chelsea made their second change in the 67th minute, bringing on Zola for Hasselbaink. The substitution {{did not have the}} desired effect as Arsenal went a goal ahead. Adams cleared the Chelsea danger and Wiltord's reverse pass found Parlour with acres of space to manoeuvre. The midfielder advanced as the Chelsea defence backed off and looked up before curling the <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> 25 yards. His effort went over a diving Cudicini, into the top right-hand corner of the Chelsea goal.|$|E
