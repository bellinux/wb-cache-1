2500|$|The Catlow Valley is a tectonic {{depression}} called a graben. It is bounded {{on the east}} and west by high, uplifted fault-block mountains—Hart Mountain to the west and Steens Mountain to the east—with which it forms a horst and graben geological feature.

Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|R

60|$|Of {{course the}} cougars were far {{on their way}} by that time, and were telling neighbors about the brave hunter's leap for life; so I devoted myself to further efforts to find an outlet. The niche I had jumped into opened below, as {{did most of the}} breaks, and I worked out of it to the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rim</b> wall, and tramped a long, long mile before I reached my own trail leading down. Resting every five steps, I climbed and climbed. My rifle grew to weigh a ton; my feet were lead; the camera {{strapped}} to my shoulder was the world. Soon climbing meant trapeze work--long reach of arm, and pull of weight, high step of foot, and spring of body. Where I had slid down with ease, I had to strain and raise myself by sheer muscle. I wore my left glove to tatters and threw it away to put the right one on my left hand. I thought many times I could not make another move; I thought my lungs would burst, but I kept on. When at last I surmounted the rim, I saw Jones, and flopped down beside him, and lay panting, dripping, boiling, with scorched feet, aching limbs and numb chest.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe PAS kinase Rim 15 is {{proposed}} to integrate signals from different nutrient-sensing pathways and to control transcriptional reprogramming of Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon nutrient depletion. Despite th{{is proposed}} role, previous transcriptome analyses <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 mutants solely focused on growing cultures. In the present work, retentostat cultivation enabled {{analysis of the}} role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 under severely calorie-restricted, virtually non-growing conditions. Under these conditions, deletion <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> 15 affected transcription of over 10 -fold more genes than in growing cultures. Transcriptional responses, metabolic rates and cellular morphology indicated a key role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 in controlled cell-cycle arrest upon nutrient depletion. Moreover, deletion <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 reduced heat-shock tolerance in non-growing, but not in growing cultures. The failure <b>of</b> <b>rim</b> 15 cells to adapt to calorie restriction by entering a robust post-mitotic state resembles cancer cell physiology and shows that retentostat cultivation of yeast strains can provide relevant models for healthy post-mitotic and transformed human cells...|$|R

40|$|Yeast cells contain two Bro 1 domain proteins: Bro 1, {{which is}} {{required}} for endosomal trafficking, and Rim 20, which {{is required for}} the response to the external pH via the Rim 101 pathway. Rim 20 associates with endosomal structures under alkaline growth conditions, when it promotes activation <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 101 through proteolytic cleavage. We report here that the pH-dependent localization <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 is contingent on the amount of Bro 1 in the cell. Cells that lack Bro 1 have increased endosomal Rim 20 -green fluorescent protein (GFP) under acidic conditions; cells that overexpress Bro 1 have reduced endosomal Rim 20 -GFP under acidic or alkaline conditions. The novel endosomal association <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 -GFP in the absence of Bro 1 requires ESCRT components including Vps 27 but not specific Rim 101 pathway components such as Dfg 16. Vps 27 influences the localization of Bro 1 but is not required for RIM 101 pathway activation in wild-type cells, thus suggesting that Rim 20 enters the Bro 1 localization pathway when a vacancy exists. Despite altered localization <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20, the lack of Bro 1 does not bypass the need for signaling protein Dfg 16 to activate Rim 101, as evidenced by the expression levels <b>of</b> the <b>Rim</b> 101 target genes RIM 8 and SMP 1. Therefore, endosomal association <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 20 is not sufficient to promote Rim 101 activation...|$|R

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{protein kinase}} Rim 15 p was {{identified}} previously as a stimulator of meiotic gene expression. Here, {{we show that}} loss <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 p causes an additional pleiotropic phenotype in cells grown to stationary phase on rich medium; this phenotype includes defects in trehalose and glycogen accumulation, in transcriptional derepression of HSP 12, HSP 26, and SSA 3, in induction of thermotolerance and starvation resistance, and in proper G 1 arrest. These phenotypes are commonly associated with hyperactivity of the Ras/cAMP pathway. Tests of epistasis suggest that Rim 15 p may act in this pathway downstream of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK). Accordingly, deletion <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> 15 suppresses the growth defect of a temperature-sensitive adenylate-cyclase mutant and, most importantly, renders cells independent of cAPK activity. Conversely, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>RIM</b> 15 suppresses phenotypes associated with a mutation in the regulatory subunit of cAPK, exacerbates the growth defect of strains compromised for cAPK activity, and partially induces a starvation response in logarithmically growing wild-type cells. Biochemical analyses reveal that cAPK-mediated in vitro phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 p strongly inhibits its kinase activity. Taken together, these results place Rim 15 p immediately downstream and under negative control of cAPK and define a positive regulatory role <b>of</b> <b>Rim</b> 15 p for entry into both meiosis and stationary phase...|$|R
