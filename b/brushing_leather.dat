60|$|My father's house, Stonecote, has {{a rather}} ungainly {{appearance}} if viewed {{from across the}} valley. But it is roomy and open and fairly challenges the winds of the equinoxes. Its main windows are of a shallow bow shape. One of them is among my first remembrances. I am seated in a bright tartan frock on a pomatum pot--a coloured picture of Mr Shandy, as I remember, on its lid--and around me are the <b>brushes,</b> <b>leather</b> cases, knick-knacks, etc., of my father's dressing table. My father is shaving himself, his chin and cheeks puffed out with soapsuds. And now I look at him, and now at {{his reflection in the}} great looking-glass, and every time that happens he makes a pleasant grimace at me over his spectacles.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is composed of}} <b>brushed</b> aluminum, natural <b>leather,</b> white fabric, and liquid metal materials. A projected instrument panel shows {{the performance of the}} Miray. The cockpit was inspired by the Chevrolet Corvette.|$|R
50|$|RHA officers' pattern {{sealskin}} (formerly bearskin) busby (not to {{be confused}} with the bearskin cap, as worn by soldiers in the guards, and infantry), with tall white plume (ostrich feathers) attached to ferrule to the top of the front. Lanyard looped around cap. Red busby bag apparently, in during the Napoleonic period, the bag could contain dried fruit (raisins) for sustenance when times were hard. It is also said that the other ranks' horse hair plumes were used in place of a shaving <b>brush.</b> Black <b>leather</b> chin strap faced with brass links. Only worn by King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery officers, and Royal Artillery directors of music.|$|R
60|$|He helped Jane to {{her feet}} and to a chair. Then with the wet scarf he had used to bathe her face he wiped the blood from the stone flags and, picking up the gun, he threw it upon a couch. With that he began to pace the court, and his silver spurs jangled musically, and the great gun-sheaths softly <b>brushed</b> against his <b>leather</b> chaps.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface of}} the town is uneven, but has deep, dark soil that yielded good crops of grain, corn and apples. The east and west {{branches}} of the Nezinscot River join at Buckfield Village, supplying water power for mills. Products included lumber, roof shingles, barrel staves, box boards, shovel handles, snow-shovels, handsleds, drag-rakes, brushes, <b>brush</b> blocks, powder-kegs, <b>leather</b> harness, cutting-blocks and men's boots. In 1870, {{the population of the}} town was 1,494. The Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad passed through the town. Its depot was at Buckfield Village, the business center for the area.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} surface demolding of mold affected Sorghum at AICRP on Post Harvest Technology using PKV mini dal mill. The PKV mini dal mill was modified and used for polishing of mold affected sorghum. The polishing trials were conducted by using 5 types of rollers (Emery No. 40, Emery No. 60, Emery No. 80, nylon <b>brush</b> roller and <b>leather</b> roller), four feed rates (90, 120, 150 and 180 kg/h) and two rotating speed of roller (900 and 1200 rpm). It {{was found that the}} PKV mini dal mill with some modifications can be used to polish mold affected sorghum...|$|R
60|$|This lonely {{horseman}} bestrode a steed of magnificent build, perfectly white {{except for}} a dark bar of color running down the noble head from ears to nose. Sweatcaked dust stained the long flanks. The horse had been running. His mane and tail were laced and knotted to keep their length {{out of reach of}} grasping cactus and <b>brush.</b> Clumsy home-made <b>leather</b> shields covered the front of his forelegs and ran up well to his wide breast. What otherwise would have been muscular symmetry of limb was marred by many a scar and many a lump. He was lean, gaunt, worn, a huge machine of muscle and bone, beautiful only in head and mane, a weight-carrier, a horse strong and fierce like the desert that had bred him.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the years, Enríquez {{remained}} mostly {{focused in}} his role as a merchant, exploiting this distinction to move legal and smuggled products with success. He could easily use his privateering ships to launder goods that were otherwise illegal, investing the saving in land and properties. On occasion, he even received permission to openly import illegal merchandise. He used these exceptions to compensate for materials that were lacking in Puerto Rico. His enemies tried to expose him, but with little success. In 1718, they testified that Enríquez had smuggled clothes and other items hidden aboard the sloop La Gloria. Led by Pozo, the group launched another defamatory campaign against him. The attorney of San Juan even blamed him for a shortage of food, after he attempted to export 700 units of merchandise citing that the market was oversaturated. Due to this action the food was retained at port and spoiled. As a consequence, Enríquez deduced that for the well-being of his business, the best was to move and sell the merchandise as far away as possible. His sloops were sent in long voyages, with the incursions of La Aurora and El Aguila lasting periods of nearly two years and nine months respectively. They operated and moved merchandise between Habana, Santiago and Cartagena. These ships were in fact buying and selling contraband by veiling it as products captured by privateering. Upon returning to San Juan, both of these vessels arrived without any privateering spoils. Despite this, Enríquez gathered so much merchandise that it was unrivaled in Puerto Rico, selling anything that covered basic necessities of the citizens, ranging from food to <b>brushes,</b> razors, <b>leather,</b> locks and clothes. They also offered other commodities, such as playing cards, wines imported from Spain and equipment required for horse riding. Enríquez managed four warehouses, which besides storing merchandise were also used to manufacture anything that his ships needed. He divided them by class, separating the ones where food was stored from the ones where backup equipment was kept.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} wrestling masks {{were often}} masks {{attached to a}} top that snapped in the groin making it very uncomfortable for the people wearing it. If the masks were not attached to the top, then they were made from uncomfortable material such as <b>brushed</b> pig skin, <b>leather</b> or suede. It wasn't until a Mexican shoe maker called Antonio Martinez created a mask on request from Charro Aguayo that would become the standard for wrestling masks created since then. The basic design has not changed much over the years, consisting of four pieces of fabric sewn together to create the basic shape that covers the entire head. The mask has openings for the eyes, nose and mouth with colorful trim around the open features, this trim is known as [...] "Antifaz" [...] in Spanish. The back of the mask is open with a [...] "tongue" [...] of fabric under laces to keep it tight enough to not come off accidentally during a match. The first variation in style came when the jaw and mouth area {{was removed from the}} mask to expose the skin. [...] Other masks have solid material over the mouth, nose, eyes or all three, in the case of fabric covering the eyes a stretched fabric that is see through up-close is used.|$|R
40|$|This is an Open Access article {{published}} by Elsevier and distributed {{under the terms}} of the Creative Commons Attribution licence, [URL] paper presents the findings of a user study which explored tactile and aesthetic responses to new and artificially aged mobile phone cases made from bamboo, walnut, cork, <b>leather,</b> <b>brushed</b> titanium, plastic and rubber. The paper outlines test methods for accelerated ageing of the external enclosures of consumer electronics based on the types of wear experienced in use, and the use of semantic differential scales (SDS) to probe user attitudes to these materials. The results indicate that preferences for the materials tested were extremely subjective, and even a single participant can have conflicting requirements for the characteristics of the materials (for example, sleek and shiny yet easy to grip). Whilst in general participants preferred the new materials and saw the ageing process as negative, there were examples where the aged samples either scored more highly due to durability (titanium) or received positive comments about the aesthetic changes caused by severe ageing (bamboo and leather). This study captured the participants' immediate, visceral response to the materials, which may be very different to their feelings towards materials and objects that they have owned and interacted with for a period of time...|$|R

40|$|Open burning is {{the burning}} of any matter {{in such a manner}} that its {{products}} are emitted directly into the ambient air without passing through an adequate stack, duct or chimney. The materials burnt nclude paper, trees, trash, <b>brush,</b> leaves, cans, <b>leather,</b> plastics, grass, and other debris where smoke and other emissions are released directly into the air the contents of which results into health and environmental effects such as bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer, immune system repression, reproductive system disorders, birth defects and others. To assess people’s knowledge on the health and environmental effects associated with open burning of household wastes at Kinondoni Municipality in Dar es Salaam City. This was a cross sectional descriptive study that involved 300 respondents. Structured closed and openended questionnaire were used in data collection and the study was carried in between February to May, 2007. Data coding was done during data collection & quantitative data analysis was done rough SPSS Version 12, a computer package programme, whereas qualitative data sociological/anthropological methods in data analysis were used. Health and environmental awareness of people on effects of open burning practice was high (61. 7 %). However, out of 300 respondents, 213 (71. 0 %) reported to continue using open burning as their final disposal mechanism due to poor existing infrastructure (76. 0 %), cost implication (94. 8 %). Low frequency of waste collection (94. 3 %) and as normal practice habit (46 %). The results from this study showed that people are aware of the health and environmental effects ssociated with open burning of household wastes. However the existing infrastructure, low frequency of waste ollection and refuse collection fee becomes the major barrier hence need thoroughconsideration...|$|R
