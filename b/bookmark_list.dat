50|$|There are {{at least}} two interpretations of the term microcontent. Usability adviser Jakob Nielsen {{originally}} referred to microcontent as small groups of words that can be skimmed by a person to get a clear idea of the content of a Web page. He included article headlines, page titles, subject lines and e-mail headings. Such phrases also may be taken out of context and displayed on a directory, search result page, <b>bookmark</b> <b>list,</b> etc. The second use of the term extends it to other small information chunks that can stand alone or be used in a variety of contexts, including instant messages, blog posts, RSS feeds, and abstracts.|$|E
5000|$|The memex (originally coined [...] "at random", though {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} a portmanteau of [...] "memory" [...] and [...] "index") {{is the name of the}} hypothetical proto-hypertext system that Vannevar Bush described in his 1945 The Atlantic Monthly article [...] "As We May Think". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, [...] "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility." [...] The memex would provide an [...] "enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory". The concept of the memex influenced the development of early hypertext systems (eventually leading to the creation of the World Wide Web) and personal knowledge base software. [...] The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for the purpose of concrete illustration was based upon a document <b>bookmark</b> <b>list</b> of static microfilm pages, and lacked a true hypertext system where parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the common textual format. Early electronic hypertext systems were thus inspired by memex rather than modeled directly upon it.|$|E

However, <b>bookmark</b> <b>lists</b> for active web users can grow very long very quickly. Since usermaintained <b>bookmark</b> <b>lists</b> can easily grow long and somewhat harder to use, it is usefil to have an automatically maintained shorter list of useful sites.

It combines two existing tools: ffl MOMspider [Fielding 1994] is a tool to verify whether links are still valid and whether documents they point to have been modified or moved. ffl Fish-Search [De Bra & Post 1994 b] is a search tool for finding new interesting documents {{in the neighborhood of}} a given set of (addresses of) documents. FishNet keeps track of the evolution of a domain of interest by periodically running MOMspider and FishSearch and presenting the user with newly found documents. The user can put documents in the hotlist or in a reject list. This positive and negative feedback are constantly used to improve the precision of the search. 1.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} people have to handle in their everyday life is increasing and consequently cognitive load increases as well. The tech-nical development has caused an explosion of information surrounding us. This development {{can also be used}} to build tools that decrease the cognitive work needed when sorting information pushed at us. These tools must base how they sort on a nuanced and detailed model of users and objects in general. How people sort and categorise information is individual. Accord-ing to theories within distributed cognition and activity theory internal knowledge structures are reflected in how the individual structures infor-mation externally. How information is sorted into heaps at the desk, in the bookshelf, in the <b>bookmark</b> <b>list</b> mirrors the internal structure. This thesis presents the Virtual Bookshelf Approach which utilises a person’s internal structure of information. People’s individual way of classifying information is captured in semantic views where entities are gathered that best represents an area of interest according to the individual. The model should also include more general objects such as places, organisations etc., to be able to develop tools that will be used in everyday services where matching and relevance judgement is the main purpose. The main contribution of this licentiate thesis is a model of a general information object and a system designed to implement and study tools that utilise semantic views in the process of modelling and matching in-formation objects. In the virtual bookshelf system the internal semantic views are modelled in a vector space model. The system handles the collected information, creates the information space, performs relevance judgement between objects, serves applications with data and handles positioning. iii i...|$|E

Quality metrics : This talk {{discusses}} the core development activities of the Quality Metrics project at Emory's Woodruff Library. This project is being conducted under an IMLS grant to research requirements for and build a working prototype digital library search system. What this project is doing that is new is truly generalizing and integrating explicit and latent quality indicators which allow users to ascertain the fitness of digital library resources. Most search engine components have only one indicator: content-query similarity (relevance). Google only has two, adding PageRank to the latter. Our system, QM-search, will have an unlimited number of these, which will be customizable by the digital librarian for the target community and collections, and even customizeable from user to user or search to search. Some basic examples of quality indicators that digital libraries might be able to exploit would be activations (views online or check-outs in circulation), selection (compilation in <b>bookmark</b> <b>lists</b> online or additions to course reserves lists), extent of review (from a peer-reviewed journal, conference, or not?), or citation-based metrics. The ouput of QM-search will be in a completely generalized XML format, with the search results represented as a structure based on the structure specified in the input organization spec. This XML output can be transformed into presentation HTML resembling anything from a linear Google-like search results list to an A 9 -like column display to more exotic groupings and breakdowns. Requirements for QM-search are being gleaned from focus groups being conducted at Emory (preliminary results will be shared), and development is being conducted as a high-level layer atop the excellent Lucene open source search engine project.

We then describe three more advanced meth-ods of manipulating Delicious data using RSS, JSON, and XML. Code samples using PHP and JavaScript are provided.

A query posed by one peer is first evaluated locally; if the result is unsatisfactory the query is forwarded to selected peers.
