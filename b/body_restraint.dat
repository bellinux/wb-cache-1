This study aimed {{to investigate the}} relationship between these health behaviors using a multivariate model. Two models, one for full and one for partial mediation, were tested using Structural Equation Modeling. The Model for full mediation tested whether the relationship among general distress and smoking are fully mediated by <b>body</b> dissatisfaction, <b>restraint,</b> and binge eating. The model for partial mediation hypothesized that the relationships among general distress, and smoking are mediated by <b>body</b> dissatisfaction, <b>restraint,</b> and binge eating. Results indicated that there was not {{a significant difference between the}} full and partial model and therefore, the full model was retained as it is more parsimonious. In addition, a test of model invariance was conducted on the full mediation model to test form potential differences in Black and Whites.

40|$|Corticotropin {{releasing}} factor (CRF) is {{the primary}} mediator of stress responses, and nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) {{plays an important role}} in the modulation of these stress responses. Thus, in this multidisciplinary study, we explored the relationship between the N/OFQ and the CRF systems in response to stress. Using in situ hybridization (ISH), we assessed the effect of <b>body</b> <b>restraint</b> stress on the gene expression of CRF and N/OFQ-related genes in various subdivisions of the amygdala, a critical brain structure involved in the modulation of stress response and anxiety-like behaviors. We found a selective upregulation of the NOP and downregulation of the CRF 1 receptor transcripts in the CeA and in the BLA after <b>body</b> <b>restraint.</b> Thus, we performed intracellular electrophysiological recordings of GABAA-mediated IPSPs in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) to explore functional interactions between CRF and N/OFQ systems in this brain region. Acute application of CRF significantly increased IPSPs in the CeA, and this enhancement was blocked by N/OFQ. Importantly, in stress-restraint rats, baseline CeA GABAergic responses were elevated and N/OFQ exerted a larger inhibition of IPSPs compared with unrestraint rats. The NOP antagonist [Nphe 1]-nociceptin(1 - 13) NH 2 increased the IPSP amplitudes in restraint rats but not in unrestraint rats, suggesting a functional recruitment of the N/OFQ system after acute stress. Finally, we evaluated the anxiety-like response in rats subjected to restraint stress and nonrestraint rats after N/OFQ microinjection into the CeA. Intra-CeA injections of N/OFQ significantly and selectively reduced anxiety-like behavior in restraint rats in the elevated plus maze. These combined results demonstrate that acute stress increases N/OFQ systems in the CeA and that N/OFQ has antistress properties...|$|E

BackgroundUp-to-date anthropometric {{information of}} the U. S. firefighter population is needed for updating ergonomic and safety specifications for fire apparatus. MethodA stratified sampling plan of three-age by three-race/ethnicity combinations was used to collect anthropometric data of 863 male and 88 female firefighters across the U. S. regions; 71 anthropometric dimensions were measured (Study 1). Differences among original, weighted, and normality transformed data from Study 1 were compared to allowable observer errors (Study 2). ResultsOn average, male firefighters were 9. 8 kg heavier and female firefighters were 29 mm taller {{than their counterparts in}} the general U. S. population. They also have larger upper-body builds than those of the general U. S. population. The data in weighted, unweighted, and normality transformed modes were compatible among each other with a few exceptions. ConclusionThe data obtained in this study provide the first available U.

40|$|Abstract: Intratracheal {{instillation}} {{is widely}} used for respiratory toxicity tests in experimental animals. However, there are wide varia-tions in the techniques used for instillation, and it is thus difficult to compare the results obtained using different techniques. To exam-ine the effect of instillation methods, we compared the distribution of a test substance in the lungs of rats after intratracheal instillations under various conditions. Rats received an intratracheal instillation of 0. 3 mL of india ink suspension under different conditions as follows: 3 different angles of <b>body</b> <b>restraint,</b> 0 ° (supine horizontal), 45 ° (supine head up) and 90 ° (vertical head up); 2 instillation speeds, high (40 mL/min) and low (4 mL/min); and 2 different devices, a standard bulb-tipped gavage needle and an aerosolizing microsprayer designed for intratracheal instillation. One hour after treatment under these various conditions, rats were sacrificed, and the local distribution of the suspension in the lungs was observed. No animal restrained in the supine head-up or vertical head-up position died from the treatment; however, fatalities were observed when rats were restrained in the supine horizontal position except under high-speed dosing conditions with a microsprayer. Better distribution of the suspension in the lungs was observed in the rats restrained in the supine head-up position after instillation at high speed when compared with other conditions.

40|$|A 50 -year-old Japanese woman {{consulted}} {{the emergency department}} of our hospital for bleeding due to an intractable postoperative wound on the lower abdomen; the postoperative wound was owing to a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 1 year previously for acute cholecystitis. She presented with a painful ulcer on her right lower abdomen. She also presented with multiple scars, skin grafts on the extremities, and a missing left lower leg, the causes for {{all of which were}} unexplained. The results of her blood test were normal, except for the hemoglobin level. Histology of the skin biopsy specimen from the ulcer did not show any specific findings. The previous surgeon who had performed the laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed that surgical wound dehiscence had occurred during her admission. After a <b>body</b> <b>restraint</b> had been applied, the ulcer improved. Medical records indicated that she had been admitted to the department of plastic surgery at our hospital for skin grafting of a leg ulcer. During that admission, she refused to consult with the department of psychiatry, although the staff suspected mental disorders. Therefore, we diagnosed her with cutaneous Munchausen syndrome. After vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy had been performed to prevent her from traumatizing the ulcer again, it rapidly became granulated and reepithelialized. Munchausen syndrome is characterized by feigning physical symptoms to seek attention. Patients self-inflict numerous lesions, keep getting admitted to different hospitals, and feign acute illness, usually spectacular diseases.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{three-dimensional}} characteristics of vestibulocollic reflexes during natural locomotion. Here we determined how well head stability is maintained by the angular and linear vestibulocollic reflexes (aVCR, lVCR) during quadrupedal locomotion in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. Animals walked on a treadmill at velocities of 0. 4 – 1. 25 m/s. Head rotations were represented by Euler angles (Fick convention). The head oscillated in yaw and roll at stride frequencies (≈ 1 – 2 Hz) and pitched at step frequencies (≈ 2 – 4 Hz). Head angular accelerations (100 – 2, 500 °/s 2) were sufficient to have excited the aVOR to stabilize gaze. Pitch and roll head movements were < 7 °, peak to peak, and the amplitude was unrelated to stride frequency. Yaw movements were larger due to spontaneous voluntary head shifts and were smaller at higher walking velocities. Head translations were small (≤ 4 cm). Cynomolgus monkeys positioned their heads more forward in pitch than the rhesus monkeys. None of the animals maintained a forward head fixation point, indicating that the lVCR contributed little to compensatory head movements in these experiments. Significantly, aVCR gains in roll and pitch were close to unity and phases were ≈ 180 ° over the full frequency range of natural walking, which is in contrast to previous findings using anesthesia or passive trunk rotation with <b>body</b> <b>restraint.</b> We conclude that the behavioral state associated with active body motion is necessary to maintain head stability in pitch and roll over the full range of stride/step frequencies encountered during walking...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} is surveyed to determine human tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations.

These data are compared and presented {{on the basis of}} a trapezoidal pulse. The effects of <b>body</b> <b>restraint</b> and of acceleration direction, onset rate, and plateau duration on the maximum tolerable and survivable rapidly applied accelerations are shown. Results of the survey indicate that adequate torso and extremity restraint is the primary variable in tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. The harness, or restraint system, must be arranged to transmit the major portion of the accelerating force directly to the pelvic structure and not via the vertebral column. When the conditions of adequate restraint have been met, then the other variables, direction, magnitude, and onset rate of rapidly applied accelerations, govern maximum tolerance and injury limits. The results also indicate that adequately stressed aft-faced passenger seats offer maximum complete body support with minimum objectionable harnessing. Such a seat, whether designed for 20 -, 30 -, or 40 -G dynamic loading, would include lap strap, chest (axillary) strap, and winged-back seat to increase headward and lateral G protection, full-height integral head rest, arm rests (load-bearing) with recessed hand-holds and provisions to prevent arms from slipping either laterally or beyond the seat back, and leg support to keep the legs from being wedged under the seat.

40|$|NASA's Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) is {{challenged}} with primary mission objectives of demonstrating deep space Extravehicular Activity (EVA) and tools, and obtaining asteroid samples {{to return to}} Earth for further study. Although the Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit (MACES) {{is used for the}} EVAs, it has limited mobility which increases fatigue and decreases the crews' capability to perform EVA tasks. Furthermore, previous Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) spacewalks have benefited from EVA interfaces which have been designed and manufactured on Earth. Rigid structurally mounted handrails, and tools with customized interfaces and restraints optimize EVA performance. For ARCM, some vehicle interfaces and tools can leverage heritage designs and experience. However, when the crew ventures onto an asteroid capture bag to explore the asteroid and collect rock samples, EVA complexity increases due to the uncertainty of the asteroid properties. The variability of rock size, shape and composition, as well as bunching of the fabric bag will complicate EVA translation, tool restraint and body stabilization. The unknown asteroid hardness and brittleness will complicate tool use. The rock surface will introduce added safety concerns for cut gloves and debris control. Feasible solutions to meet ARCM EVA objectives were identified using experience gained during Apollo, Shuttle, and ISS EVAs, terrestrial mountaineering practices, NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) 16 mission, and during Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory testing in the MACES suit. The proposed concept utilizes expandable booms and integrated features of the asteroid capture bag to position and restrain the crew at the asteroid worksite. These methods enable the capability to perform both finesse, and high load tasks necessary to collect samples for scientific characterization of the asteroid. This paper will explore the design trade space and options that were examined for EVA, the overall concept for the EVAs including translation paths and <b>body</b> <b>restraint</b> methods, potential tools used to extract the samples, design implications for the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV) for EVA, the results of early development testing of potential EVA tasks, and extensibility of the EVA architecture to NASA's exploration missions...|$|E

40|$|Hypersonic {{cruise missile}} always adopts the {{configuration}} of waverider <b>body</b> with the <b>restraint</b> of scramjet. As a result, the lateral motion exhibits serious coupling, and the controller design of the lateral lateral system cannot be conducted separately for yaw channel and roll channel. A multiple input and multiple output optimal control method with integrators is presented to design the lateral combined control system for hypersonic cruise missile. A hypersonic cruise missile lateral model is linearized as a multiple input and multiple output plant, which is coupled by kinematics and fin deflection between yaw and roll. In lateral combined controller, the integrators are augmented, respectively, into the loop of roll angle and lateral overload {{to ensure that the}} commands are tracked with zero steady-state error. Through simulation, the proposed controller demonstrates good performance in tracking the command of roll angle and lateral overload...|$|R
40|$|The current International Space Station {{configuration}} {{includes a}} Japanese Experiment Module which {{relies on a}} large manipulator and a smaller dexterous manipulator to operate outside the pressurized environment of the experiment module. The module's flight demonstration is a payload that will be mounted in the aft flight deck on STS- 87 to evaluate a prototype of the dexterous manipulator. Since the payload operations entail two 8 -hour scenarios on consecutive days, adequate operator restraint at the workstation will be critical to the perceived {{success or failure of}} the payload. Simulations in reduced gravity environment on the KC- 135 A were the only way to evaluate the restraint systems and workstation configuration. Two astronaut and two non-astronaut operators evaluated the Advanced Lower Body Extremities Restraint Test and a foot loop restraint system by performing representative tasks at the workstation in each of the two restraint systems; {{at the end of each}} flight they gave their impressions of each system and the workstation. Results indicated that access to the workstation switch panels was difficult and manipulation of the hand controllers forced operators too low for optimal viewing of the aft flight deck monitors. The workstation panel should be angled for better visibility, and infrequently used switches should be on the aft flight deck panel. Pitch angle and placement of the hand controllers should optimize the operator's eye position with respect to the monitors. The lower <b>body</b> <b>restraint</b> was preferred over the foot loops because it allowed operators to maintain a more relaxed posture during long-duration tasks, its height adjustability allowed better viewing of aft flight deck monitors, and it provided better restraint for reacting forces imparted on the operator at the workstation. The foot loops provide adequate restraint for the flight demonstration tasks identified. Since results will impact the design of the workstation, both restraints should be flown and used during operation of the flight demonstration payload to evaluate the effect of restraint during long-duration tasks...|$|E
40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary Extravehicular Space Suit Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. The suit was designed for maximum mobility at 8. 3 psid, reduced mass, and to have high fidelity life support interfaces. As Z- 2 will be man-tested at full vacuum in NASA JSC's Chamber B, it was manufactured as Class II, making it the most flight-like planetary walking suit produced to date. The Z- 2 suit architecture is an evolution of previous EVA suits, namely the ISS EMU, Mark III, Rear Entry I-Suit and Z- 1 spacesuits. The suit is a hybrid hard and soft multi-bearing, rear entry spacesuit. The hard upper torso (HUT) is an all-composite structure and includes a 2 -bearing rolling convolute shoulder with Vernier sizing mechanism, removable suit port interface plate (SIP), elliptical hemispherical helmet and self-don/doff shoulder harness. The hatch is a hybrid aluminum and composite construction with Apollo style gas connectors, custom water pass-thru, removable hatch cage and interfaces to primary and auxiliary life support feed water bags. The suit includes Z- 1 style lower arms with cam brackets for Vernier sizing and government furnished equipment (GFE) Phase VI gloves. The lower torso includes a telescopic waist sizing system, waist bearing, rolling convolute waist joint, hard brief, 2 bearing soft hip thigh, Z- 1 style legs with ISS EMU style cam brackets for sizing, and conformal walking boots with ankle bearings. The Z- 2 Requirements Verification Plan includes the verification of more than 200 individual requirements. The verification methods include test, analysis, inspection, demonstration or a combination of methods. Examples of unmanned requirements include suit leakage, proof pressure testing, operational life, mass, isometric man-loads, sizing adjustment ranges, internal and external interfaces such as in-suit drink bag, partial pressure relief valve, purge valve, donning stand and ISS <b>Body</b> <b>Restraint</b> Tether (BRT). Examples of manned requirements include verification of anthropometric range, suit self-don/doff, secondary suit exit method, donning stand self-ingress/egress and manned mobility covering eight functional tasks. The eight functional tasks include kneeling with object pick-up, standing toe touch, cross-body reach, walking, reach to the SIP and helmet visor. This paper will provide an overview of the Z- 2 design. Z- 2 requirements verification testing was performed with NASA at the ILC Houston test facility. This paper will also discuss pre-delivery manned and unmanned test results as well as analysis performed in support of requirements verification...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} stereotypes that develop from weight and public eating habits. Female college students (n = 120) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. A scenario was read that depicted a female who was either underweight or overweight and consumed either a small or large amount of food; questions pertaining to the character immediately followed the scenario. In addition, participants completed scales related to body esteem, tendencies to hide the <b>body,</b> and eating <b>restraints.</b> Results indicated that the overweight female was perceived as having more negative personality traits and was seen as more likely to eat larger amounts in private. Results also suggested that the underweight female that ate a large amount of food and the overweight female that ate a small amount in public were both perceived as happy with their bodies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cross-sectional and {{experimental}} {{research has shown}} that female smokers more frequently report using cigarettes to control negative affect, manage dietary <b>restraint,</b> and suppress <b>body</b> image dissatisfaction. However, there has been little research to identify cognitive mechanisms that may underlie these effects. Cross-stimulus attentional bias is one such mechanism. Aims and Hypotheses: We hypothesized that, when compared to neutral stimuli, in-vivo appetitive stimuli would enhance motivation to obtain a particular substance. More specifically, in-vivo smoking stimuli would increase attentional bias to smoking-related pictorial cues, whereas in-vivo food stimuli would increase attention to smoking-related and food-related pictorial cues. We also hypothesized that environmental tobacco smoke exposure history, negative affect, dietary <b>restraint,</b> <b>body</b> image dissatisfaction, and perceived appetite suppression of smoking would influence these attentional biases, such that higher levels of these characteristics would produce greater attentional biases. Method: Thirty-five female smokers were exposed to visual stimuli containing two independent pictorial cues: smoking/neutral, smoking/food, neutral/food, or neutral/neutral. Twenty images were presented in 3 counter-balanced, within-subjects sets differentiated by smoking (cigarette pack), food (snack) and neutral (jewelry) in-vivo stimuli. Attentional bias was measured using eye-tracking technology. Dietary <b>restraint,</b> <b>body</b> image dissatisfaction, negative affect, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure were assessed with self-report measures before the manipulations. Results: Effects counter to the hypotheses were observed, as in-vivo cigarettes and snack foods did not cause participants to differentially attend to pictorial smoking or food stimuli. Initial and maintained attention to smoking pictorial cues was greater than attention to food and neutral cues only when participants were administered a non-appetitive in-vivo stimulus. None of the theoretically hypothesized personality characteristics served as predictors or moderators of attentional bias. Discussion: Findings with the neutral in-vivo stimulus replicate and extend previous research identifying attentional bias for smoking cues among smokers. Results also enhance understanding of how attentional bias may change when smokers encounter other types of appetitive stimuli. These findings encourage further theoretical and clinical exploration of how the relationship between motivation and attentional bias can be conceptualized and translated from the laboratory to the natural environment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} potential {{risk factors of}} recurrent overeating by investigating relationships between basic need satisfaction, emotional eating, dietary <b>restraint,</b> <b>body</b> mass index and recurrent overeating. University students and women who accessed overeating related websites (N = 321) completed the Basic Need Satisfaction Inventory, the emotional and restraint subscales of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, the oversnacking and binging subscales of the Yale Eating Patterns Questionnaire; and provided demographic information. The study supported Modeling and Role-Modeling theory, as basic need satisfaction negatively correlated with emotional eating, and self-esteem and self-actualisation significantly predicted emotional eating. Analysis of an adaptation of the cognitive-behavioural model of bulimia nervosa showed that emotional eating mediated the relationship between both self-esteem and self-actualisation and recurrent overeating, and interestingly, dietary restraint {{was not related to}} other variables. It was concluded that intervention for binge eating should reflect the importance of psychological triggers rather than only behavioural cues...|$|R
30|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on samples of non-clinical adolescents. Miller et al. (2006) {{reported}} the interaction of neuroticism and extraversion in relation to symptoms of eating disorders in a non-clinical sample of university students. Keel et al. (1998) indicated that adolescent males who reported disordered eating (anorexia and bulimia) expressed greater <b>body</b> dissatisfaction, depression, <b>restraint,</b> and poorer interoceptive awareness as compared to matched and randomly selected controls. More recently, Fitzsimmons-Craft et al. (2012) examined, the relation between reports of anxiety, dimensions of trait perfectionism and BED in non-clinical university students in a longitudinal study. They support the notion that BED is generally affected by both trait- and state-like characteristics. Similar results were found in a cross-sectional study by Cuzzocrea et al. (2012) who reported that these aspects seem {{to play a role in}} eating behaviors in non-clinical adolescents: neuroticism seems to be the personality trait most related both in males and females, while psychoticism seems to better differentiate eating behaviors between genders.|$|R
