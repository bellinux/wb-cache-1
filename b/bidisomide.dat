40|$|The deoxyuridine {{suppression}} {{test was}} performed on isolated rat bone marrow cells in order to study the effect of <b>bidisomide,</b> a new Class I antiarrhythmic agent, on folate-dependent DNA synthesis. Methotrexate and 5 -fluorouracil, two known inhibitors of DNA synthesis, {{were included in the}} study to validate the test system. Methotrexate and 5 -fluorouracil, at a concentration of 5. 5 mu M, decreased thymidine incorporation into DNA by way of the de novo pathway (thymidylate synthase activity). The salvage pathway of DNA synthesis (thymidine kinase activity), however, was not affected by these anticancer drugs. <b>Bidisomide</b> up to 1 mM did not affect the folate-dependent thymidylate synthase activity, nor the thymidine kinase activity of isolated rat bone marrow cells...|$|E
40|$|Prolongation {{of action}} {{potential}} duration (APD) and the {{effective refractory period}} (ERP) is one mechanism to prevent reentrant atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Because arrhythmias are usually associated with an elevated sympathetic tone and in-crease of circulating catecholamines, the potential influence of catecholamines on antiarrhythmic effects of an agent are cnt-ical to predicting the potential clinical response. In this {{study the effects of}} three different antiarrhythmic agents, <b>bidisomide,</b> flecainide and dofetilide, each of which prolongs atrial ERP, were compared before and after treatment with isoproterenol, a 3 -adrenergic agonist. Standard intracellular microelectrode re-cording techniques were used to record action potentials from isolated canine atrial tissue. <b>Bidisomide</b> and flecainide elicited a 20 to 27 msec increase in APD and ERP that was independen...|$|E
