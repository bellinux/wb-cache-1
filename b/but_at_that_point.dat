In the Spring of 2014 he earned his captain's license from the Northeast Maritime Institute by completing three months of night classes. In June 2014 he graduated on the Honor Roll (highest grades) from Old Rochester Regional High School (ORR) in Mattapoisett. He was an all-around high school athlete who played baseball, rowed crew, and ran track.

25|$|R.A. Kartini {{loved her}} father deeply, {{although}} {{it is clear that}} her deep affection for him became yet another obstacle to the realization of her ambitions. He was progressive enough to allow his daughters schooling until the age of twelve, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> firmly closed the door to further schooling. In his letters, her father also expressed his affection for Kartini. Eventually, he gave permission for her to study to become a teacher in Batavia (now Jakarta), although previously he had prevented her from cral of her pen friends worked on her behalf to support Kartini in this endeavour. Many of her friends expressed their disappointment when Kartini's ambition was finally thwarted.

Kartini and her younger sister, R.Ayu Rukmini.|$|E

Although they didn't go on any huge runs to extend the lead tremendously, they were able to push it up to 14 when they had the score 30-44 with about three to four minutes left in the second half.

25|$|The ferries were {{in major}} decline by the 1950s. In 1948, the No. 3 {{was taken off}} of regular service and was sold in 1953. The cost of {{operating}} the ferries was high, and the last sailing by the No. 4 ferry took place on August 30, 1958. The No. 4 was later sold {{to be used in}} Prince Rupert. Later, No. 4 returned to Vancouver and was tied up on the Vancouver side of Burrard Inlet. She was in desperate need of a refit and had to be kept afloat with pumps to keep the water out of her hull. When the power failed and the pumps stopped she went to the bottom. The No. 5 was converted into the Seven Seas Restaurant at the foot of Lonsdale in North Vancouver. It remained there until 2002 when the City of North Vancouver and the federal courts had it demolished after a long-standing dispute over who would be responsible if it sank and concern that the hull was in danger of imminent collapse.

In 1963-1964, electoral changes to the Legislative Council, which abolished the 10 three-member seats and created 15 two-member seats in their place, resulted in the seat shrinking into the wealthy western suburbs region. Thereafter, it was a safe seat for the Liberal Party.

Since then, he has become a recurring character. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide in 2000 that [...] "we [...] painted ourselves into a corner with our Christmas episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him." [...] The name [...] "Santa's Little Helper" [...] was chosen because, according to writer Al Jean in the same TV Guide article, [...] "we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. <b>But,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> nobody was thinking long-term.

[...] Although [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. Jean told the Houston Chronicle in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and [...] "the next seven didn't have the dog, people wondered why." [...] He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.|$|E

2500|$|Being {{a booming}} city with many low-skilled jobs, waves of {{immigrants}} came into Lowell {{to work the}} mills. The original 30 Irish that came to help build the canals were led by Hugh Cummiskey along the Middlesex canal from Charleston to Pawtucket Falls on foot April 6, 1822. They were met by Kirk Boott and given a pittance. No allowance was made for housing or other provisioning. These were followed by a new group after the Irish Potato Famine, and later Catholic Germans. These Irish were herded onto land that was not {{under the control of}} the mills into an area now called [...] "The Acre" [...] - <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> called [...] "Paddy Camp Lands". Ethnic tensions - sometimes stoked by mill companies seeking to use members of one community as strikebreakers against members of another - were not unheard of, and in the 1840s, the nativist, anti-Catholic American Party (often called the Know-Nothing Party) won elections in Lowell. By the 1850s, industry competition increased as more manufacturing centers were built elsewhere, Lowell's mills employed increasing numbers of immigrant families, and the early [...] "Lowell System" [...] of Yankee women workers living in company boardinghouses was transformed. [...] In its place, large, densely populated ethnic neighborhoods grew around the city, their residents more rooted in their churches, organizations, and communities than the previous era's company boardinghouse dwellers.|$|E

2500|$|RCA {{acted as}} the sales agent {{for a small}} line of Westinghouse and GE branded {{receivers}} and parts used by home constructors, originally for a limited market of amateur radio enthusiasts. By 1922, the rise of broadcasting had dramatically increased the demand for radio equipment by the general public, and this development {{was reflected in the}} title of RCA's June 1, 1922 catalog, [...] "Radio Enters the Home". RCA began selling receivers under the [...] "Radiola" [...] name, marketing equipment produced by GE and Westinghouse under the production agreement that allocated a 60%–40% ratio in output between the two companies. Although the patent cross-licensing agreements had been intended to give the participants domination of equipment sales, the tremendous growth of the market led to fierce competition, and in 1925 RCA fell behind Atwater Kent as the leader in receiver sales. RCA was particularly hamstrung by the need to coordinate its sales within the limits of the GE/Westinghouse production quotas, and often had difficulty keeping up with industry trends. However, it made a key advance in early 1924 when it began to sell the first superheterodyne receivers, whose high level of performance increased the brand's reputation and popularity. Until late 1927 all the RCA receivers ran on batteries, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> plug-in AC sets were introduced, which provided another boost in sales.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1979, Ted and Kenneth Gärdestad had {{a fourth}} attempt at Melodifestivalen {{and this time}} they won with the song [...] "Satellit", a mid-tempo rock track whose {{arrangement}} bore resemblances to Toto's 1978 hit [...] "Hold the Line". The similarities caused speculation of plagiarism in the Swedish media and disqualification from the contest. The {{connection between the two}} songs was that the song's producer Janne Schaffer had heard four of the future Toto members, Steve Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro, David Hungate and Steve Lukather, experimenting with a guitar and bass riff during the Blue Virgin Isles sessions in Los Angeles, which eventually evolved into [...] "Hold the Line". Schaffer was inspired by what he had heard when he wrote the arrangement for [...] "Satellit", <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> neither [...] "Hold the Line" [...] nor Toto's debut eponymous album had been released. Jeff Porcaro told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet in February 1979: [...] "No, it's not a rip-off, Ted did not steal our song. Those piano triplets and that bass and guitar line go back to the 1950s {{and the fact that we}} both have happened to use variations on the same theme in our songs right now is purely coincidental." [...] Consequently, Ted represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest held in Jerusalem in March 1979. After having competed four times in the pre-selections before winning and with his personal connection to ABBA, [...] hopes and expectations were high. The song scored eight points and finished seventeenth out of nineteen participating entries, making it Sweden's then-second-lowest placing in the contest. The Swedish-language single became a Top 10 hit back home in Sweden and [...] "Satellit" [...] is regarded as one of Ted's signature tunes. The English-language version of the track never charted and neither did the re-issue of Blue Virgin Isles, which included both versions, making it clear that Ted's Scandinavian audiences favoured his Swedish-language material.|$|E
