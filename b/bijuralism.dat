25|$|Canadian federal {{statutes}} {{must use}} the terminology {{of both the}} common law and civil law for those matters; this {{is referred to as}} legislative <b>bijuralism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{the legacy}} of the Custom of Paris in New France is that its evolved successor, Quebec’s modern system of civil private law, laid the {{foundation}} for Canadian <b>bijuralism,</b> which has been a distinct and important feature of justice in Canada since its inception.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the relationship between the}} federal Income Tax Act (ITA) and provincial private law, evaluating judicial decisions and statutory provisions according to the goals of Canadian <b>bijuralism</b> expressed in the policy on legislative <b>bijuralism</b> adopted by the federal Department of Justice in June 1995, the preamble to the first Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 1, and new sections 8. 1 and 8. 2 of the federal Interpretation Act. The first part of the article reviews notable cases in which Canadian courts have recognized a relationship of complementarity between the ITA and provincial private law, looking at cases arising in Quebec in which courts have relied on the civil law, and cases arising in the rest of Canada in which courts have looked to the common law and applicable provincial statutes. The second part of the article considers cases in which Canadian courts have dissociated the interpretation of the ITA from provincial law, examining key legal concepts that have been interpreted with little or no regard for the private law of the applicable province, such as the concepts of a gift and a charitable purpose or activity, the distinction between an employee and an independent contractor, the meaning of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s residence, and the concepts of an acquisition and a disposition of property. The third part of the article explains the goals of Canadian <b>bijuralism</b> set forth in the Department of Justice policy on legislative <b>bijuralism</b> and recent legislative initiatives, and the implications of these developments for the interpretation and amendment of the ITA. With respect to statutory interpretation, it is argued, new section 8. 1 of the Interpretation Act mandates a reconsideration of several cases in which courts have dissociated the interpretation of the ITA from provincial private law. Where complementarity with provincial private law produces unacceptable differences in tax consequences among different provinces, however, the article proposes specific legislative amendments...|$|E
40|$|For many years, the {{determination}} of which organizations should qualify for the significant tax benefits accorded to "registered charities" ("organismes de bienfaisance enregistres") under the Canadian Income Tax Act has been based, in all provinces, {{on the concept of}} charity developed by the English common law of charitable trusts. However, there are other sources of meaning for the concept of "charity" ("bienfaisance") in Canada, including ancient, civil law sources that continue to form part of the basic law of Quebec. This study challenges the longstanding, unijural approach to the registered charity provisions {{on the basis of the}} constitutional division of powers, and the federal government's commitment to respecting <b>bijuralism</b> and bilingualism in its legislative texts. It explores the diverse, legal sources concerning charity and the devotion of property to the public good that form part of the law of property and civil rights in the provinces. Finally, it examines how these diverse provincial sources might affect the current approach to the registered charity provisions, and the project of ensuring that federal laws are accessible to each of Canada's Francophone civil law, Francophone common law, Anglophone civil law and Anglophone common law audiences...|$|E
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of property {{plays an important role}} in the federal Income Tax Act (ITA), determining eligibility for a number of tax benefits, including entitlement to capital cost allowance, investment tax credits, and the deductibility of interest expenses incurred in respect of eligible property. In spite of its importance, the concept of an {{acquisition of}} property is not defined in the ITA, and it has been subject to divergent interpretations in the common law and the civil law. The author traces the sources of law informing the meaning of an {{acquisition of property}} in the common law and the civil law, and concludes that certain transactions may be subject to different tax consequences depending on whether they occurred in a common law province or in Quebec. The author demonstrates that the primary reference for determining whether a taxpayer acquired property — the twofold test in M. N. R. v. Wardean Drilling Ltd. — is premised on common law concepts and is incompatible with the goals of Canadian <b>bijuralism</b> expressed in the Federal Law — Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 1 and section 8. 1 of the federal Interpretation Act. In response to this contradiction, the author proposes a number of statutory amendments to ensure the uniform and predictable application of the ITA across Canada...|$|E
