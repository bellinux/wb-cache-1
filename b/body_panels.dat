5|$|Aston Martin Racing {{adapted the}} DB9 for sports car racing, {{producing}} the DBR9 for FIA GT1 and the DBRS9 for FIA GT3. These two cars are lightened DB9s; the interior features are removed and the aluminium <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> {{are replaced by}} carbon fibre panels. Additionally, the engine has been tweaked in both the cars to produce more horsepower.|$|E
5|$|FF Developments, in {{addition}} to their design work on the gearbox and rear axle assembly were given responsibility for their manufacture. The aluminium chassis components and <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> were manufactured and assembled at Abbey Panels factory in Coventry, before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham. The car, including chassis and body components, consists of approximately 3000 unique parts.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles play a {{prominent}} role in the game, replacing the moves and transformations featured in its predecessors. The vehicles can be built freely by the player from over 1600 different components available, such as <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> engines, wheels, wings, propellers, fuel tanks and weapons. Vehicles range from automobiles, motorbikes, boats and aeroplanes. In order to create vehicles, the player must collect vehicle parts and bluepints which are scattered throughout the hub world, or can be earned after winning specific challenges. The player may also purchase preset blueprints and vehicle parts from Humba Wumba in Showdown Town. In addition, players can also send and receive blueprints over Xbox Live.|$|E
5000|$|Built from February 1947. Top third <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> now had {{full-length}} [...] "chicken wire". Long rear vent <b>panel.</b> Center third <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> now had two portholes; {{area between}} covered with chicken wire, over 4 smaller rectangular openings.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2015-16 A-League {{season to}} {{determine}} the medal a new four <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> was introduced that independently vote on a 3-2-1 basis after each regular season match, which is consolidated into a single 3-2-1 vote. The four <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> consists of: ...|$|R
50|$|In addition, the NTSB {{recommended}} strengthening {{and increased}} {{testing of the}} <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> and floor joists for school buses.|$|R
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel <b>body</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{retained the}} aluminium <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> of the XJ220 concept, {{but for the}} production vehicles, Abbey Panels of Coventry were contracted to provide the exterior panels. The scissor doors were dropped for the production model, and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest {{in the car and}} insisted the design had to be seen to be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company. Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated by the change in the wheelbase, which was reduced by 200mm.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had lost}} its UK title, Razer still reigned as {{champion}} of the Extreme All-Stars tournament. Its first battle to defend this title was against twice UK champion Chaos 2 and dual-spinner 13 Black. Razer and 13 Black joined forces to eliminate Chaos 2, in what was its last ever fight on Robot Wars. Razer's next battle against Spawn Again was a rematch from the series five semi-finals. Razer was again the aggressor: it repeatedly punctured Spawn Again's <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> prompting its constructors to seek safety by driving themselves into the pit. Razer's next battle was one-on-one versus 13 Black. Following an impact with the arena wall, 13 Black stopped spinning for long enough that Razer could lift it with the arm and lower it into the pit. In the All-Stars grand final, Razer faced Firestorm4. Razer manoeuvred its wedge underneath Firestorm4, lowered the arm and immobilised its opponent. Razer was All-Stars champion {{for a second time}} running.|$|E
5000|$|Built from July 1945. High, flat-topped 36 in (914 mm) roof fans. Top third <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> had [...] "chicken wire" [...] in {{openings}} only. Short rear vent <b>panel.</b> Center-third <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> {{with three}} equally-spaced porthole windows and D17 traction motors. As-built Phase I F3 units are {{identical to the}} F2, they differ only in electrical equipment and numberboard size. Three highly modified locomotives survive from this series, rebuilt as FP10s, all for Metro-North Railroad.|$|R
50|$|The same {{techniques}} {{were also used}} in high end low volume car production (coachbuilding) and adopted for aftermarket hot rodding <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> modifications.|$|R
50|$|Each car is 3200 mm wide over <b>body</b> <b>panel,</b> {{floor to}} rail is 1100 mm high and roof to rail is 3910 mm high.|$|R

25|$|The DMC-12 {{features}} {{a number of}} unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted stainless-steel <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> and a rear-mounted engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{and early}} cars utilised stressed skin aluminium bodywork, though later models incorporated chassis members of steel. The Minicar was amongst the first British cars to use fibreglass <b>body</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
50|$|As of 2008 the Clan Club is active, {{and through}} its long-standing members Dave Excell and Dave Weedon one can {{purchase}} any <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> {{or even a}} complete new bodyshell.|$|R
2500|$|Under the {{innovative}} <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> structure, the concept vehicle had a conventional front-mounted [...] AMC V8 engine with rear-wheel drive (FR layout). The compact-sized AMC Cavalier rode on a [...] wheelbase and offered seating capacity for six adults.|$|R
50|$|Built from March 1948. (Surviving F3's former BAR 42,44,46 {{are still}} Phase 2 and {{were built in}} MAY 1948) Center third <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> now has no chicken wire between the portholes; the four {{rectangular}} openings now have louvres.|$|R
25|$|The Mark III Polo shared its {{platform}} with the SEAT Ibiza Mark II. The Ibiza was actually launched before the Polo, and shared essentially all its mechanicals, the dashboard and other interior components, {{although there were}} no <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> shared between the two cars. The saloon and estate versions of the Mark III Polo were actually re-badged SEAT Córdoba models, and had no <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> {{in common with the}} Polo hatchback. The SEAT Inca and Volkswagen Caddy vans were also based on this model. The Volkswagen Lupo and SEAT Arosa were also based on a shortened version of the Mark III Polo platform.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the unique door design, the Z1 body featured several other innovations: removable plastic <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> a flat undertray, a roll-hoop integrated into the windscreen surround and continuously zinc welded seams.|$|E
25|$|When {{coming up}} to lap Patrick Gaillard, John Watson misjudged Gaillard's braking point and hit him. Watson's McLaren was {{launched}} into the air over Gaillard's Ensign. Gaillard continued after a pitstop to replace some of the Ensign car's <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> however Watson's race was over.|$|E
50|$|Exterior {{changes on}} the Hardtop version {{includes}} a slanted nose which requires a new grille, a thinner headlamp assembly that match the slanted nose, frameless door windows, thinner tail lamp, front fenders and bumper. <b>Body</b> <b>panel</b> is stamped different from the standard version.|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{innovative}} <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> structure, the concept vehicle had a conventional front-mounted 343 cuin L [...] AMC V8 engine with rear-wheel drive (FR layout). The compact-sized AMC Cavalier rode on a 108 in wheelbase and offered seating capacity for six adults.|$|R

He {{is a member of}} the Space Studies Board and current Chair of the Primitive <b>Bodies</b> <b>Panel</b> of the Decadal Studies for Planetary Exploration.|$|R
25|$|The Z1 {{is unique}} for its plastic <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> and {{vertically}} sliding doors which {{drop into the}} door sills. It {{is one of the}} first BMWs to use a multi-link rear suspension. The sole drivetrain specification is the 2.5Litre straight-six engine and 5-speed manual transmission from the E30 325i.|$|E
25|$|When Leyland Motors {{joined with}} British Motor Holdings and Rover and Jaguar became {{corporate}} partners these projects were cancelled to prevent internal competition with Jaguar products. The P8 {{in particular was}} cancelled in a very late stage of preparation- Rover had already ordered the dies and stamping equipment for making the car's <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> at Pressed Steel when ordered to stop work.|$|E
25|$|The Nash Ambassador and Statesman {{continued}} with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> rear window glass, dash panels and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy {{owing to the}} lighter unitized Nash body.|$|E
50|$|One of the museum's {{most unusual}} {{features}} is a 1924 Hispano-Suiza H6C with a <b>body</b> <b>paneled</b> with tulipwood. Over the years, {{the museum has}} also housed a 1962 John F. Kennedy limousine and a Chinese Hongqi, the first Chinese-made automobile to be imported to the United States.|$|R
25|$|With the XJ40, Jaguar {{began to}} place more {{emphasis}} on build quality as well as simplification of the XJ's build process. With 25 per cent fewer <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> pressings required versus the Series XJ, the new process also saved weight, increased the stiffness of the chassis, and reduced cabin noise.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{research}} on dosing and controllability of non-contact magnetic pulse straightening {{is presented in}} the article. Illustrations of dosed magnetic-pulse action are given by the example of an element of a Subaru <b>body</b> <b>panel.</b> It is demonstrated that non-contact straightening does not damage the protective paint coating of a car bod...|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} projections {{were to have}} annual {{production of}} 150,000 Premiers. Magna International had signed a contract in 1986 to supply <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> for the Premiers. As a result, the automotive supplier received $10 million grants from the governments of both Canada and Ontario to expand the metal stamping plant in Milton, Ontario. However, the Premier did not achieve its sales targets, with calendar year production for 1989 only reaching 32,720 examples.|$|E
25|$|The VAZ-2105, {{based on}} the Fiat 124 {{mechanicals}} but modernised and restyled, was introduced in 1979 and marketed outside the Soviet Union under the Riva or Laika trade names, depending on the country. Square headlights and new <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> distinguish this car from the earlier models. The 2105 was third best selling automobile platform after the Volkswagen Beetle and the Ford Model T, {{and one of the}} longest production run platforms alongside the Volkswagen Beetle, the Hindustan Ambassador and the Volkswagen Type 2.|$|E
25|$|The saloon and estate {{versions}} of the Mark III, which debuted in 1995, were essentially rebadged version of the SEAT Córdoba, which were launched early in 1994. They were referred to internally by Volkswagen as the Typ 6KV, and shared <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> with the SEAT model rather than the Polo hatchback models, with some cosmetic alterations such as new rear and front bumpers and headlights. The Volkswagen Caddy 9K van also shares the same platform and front-end styling as the 6KV models.|$|E
50|$|Production of {{the final}} series of Heinkel Tourist, the 103 A2, began in August 1960. The {{telescopic}} forks of the previous series were replaced by a two-sided trailing-link fork late in the A2 production run. The rear <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> was restyled and was not interchangeable with those of earlier series.|$|R
