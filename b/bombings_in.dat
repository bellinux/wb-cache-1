5|$|On 21 January 1985, nine stupas {{were badly}} damaged by nine bombs. In 1991, a blind Muslim preacher, Husein Ali Al Habsyie, {{was sentenced to}} life {{imprisonment}} for masterminding a series of <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1980s, including the temple attack. Two other members of the Islamic extremist group that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986, and another man received a 13-year prison term.|$|E

He was charged with disorderly conduct and released, along with George Clooney and several others.|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} {{related to}} crime and terrorism were not {{high on the}} agenda of the system's planners at its inception. After the Madrid train <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station in 2001, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying bulky items.|$|E
5|$|There were {{a number}} of car <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> Ramadi, Haditha and Al Qaim {{following}} the US withdrawal from Iraqi cities on 30 June. Throughout the last months of the year, additional attacks, mainly assassinations, occurred around Fallujah and Abu Ghraib. In October, twin bombings killed 26 people and wounded 65 at a reconciliation meeting in Ramadi. In December, a coordinated double suicide bombing outside Ramadi's government compound killed 25 people and severely wounded Governor Qasim Al-Fahdawi, who lost an arm.|$|E

5|$|AQI {{launched}} {{a series of}} attacks in Jordan in late 2005 that were partially based out of Anbar. The group had already unsuccessfully attacked the Trebil checkpoint along the Jordanian border with Anbar Province in December 2004. In August, two US warships in Aqaba, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ashland, were attacked with rockets; the cell which carried out the attacks then fled into Iraq. On 9 November, three Iraqis from Anbar carried out suicide <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> Amman, killing 60. A fourth bomber, also from Anbar, was caught.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris {{became one}} {{front of the}} Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN {{targeted}} and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to {{the imposition of a}} curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> Zagreb, Josip Manolić, who had just been appointed head of the Croatian intelligence service, claimed Croatian right-wing extremists were responsible. Operation Labrador was abandoned after the ZNG and the Croatian police captured the Yugoslav Air Force headquarters in Zagreb on 15 September 1991, during the Battle of the Barracks. The materials captured inside the facility included codes and computer disks related to Operation Labrador, as well as Sabolović's notes. Sabolović turned the materials over to his immediate superior at headquarters, Mirko Martić, but Martić failed to destroy them. In response, Sabolović fled Zagreb. Croatian police took almost a month to analyze the captured materials properly and uncover Operation Labrador. Sabolović later claimed that only a part of the Operation Labrador network was dismantled, but he was contradicted by KOS Major Mustafa Čandić who was posted at the Zemun headquarters of KOS.|$|E

50|$|On 5 February 1992, four bombs {{exploded}} in public buildings and on two buses, line 2 and line 30, in Urumqi, Xinjiang, China. The <b>bombings</b> resulted <b>in</b> three deaths and 23 injuries.|$|R
5|$|On August 28, the {{occupation}} of Japan led by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers began. The surrender ceremony was held on September 2, aboard the United States Navy battleship , at which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, thereby ending the hostilities. Allied civilians and military personnel alike celebrated V-J Day, {{the end of the}} war; however, some isolated soldiers and personnel from Japan's far-flung forces throughout Asia and the Pacific islands refused to surrender for months and years afterwards, some even refusing into the 1970s. The role of the atomic <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> Japan's unconditional surrender, and the ethics of the two attacks, is still debated. The state of war formally ended when the Treaty of San Francisco came into force on April 28, 1952. Four more years passed before Japan and the Soviet Union signed the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which formally brought an end to their state of war.|$|E
5|$|Following the battalion's {{return from}} East Timor {{it was again}} {{restructured}} to resume {{its role as a}} two-company commando battalion. However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second TAG {{to be based on the}} east coast of Australia. The TAG is supplemented by clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch who form the Water troop. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002. Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> October that year, further resources became available. The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002. Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003. In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D Company being formed. Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November.|$|E
5|$|From late 2001, Hercules began {{flying into}} Afghanistan {{to support the}} SAS {{squadron}} deployed as part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. Five Hercules of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali <b>Bombings</b> <b>in</b> October 2002. In February 2003, a detachment of Hercules from No.36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. These aircraft arrived on 10February, and began flying transport sorties twelve days later. The C-130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19March. During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq, one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12April. The C-130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces. As {{the first phase of the}} war wound down, Australian Hercules flew medical supplies into Baghdad shortly after the city was captured. A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan, as well as the forces stationed in Iraq. The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20,000operational flying hours by March 2010. An American contractor travelling on an Australian C-130 in Iraq was killed on 27June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after it took off from Baghdad.|$|E
50|$|The 1 February 2008 Baghdad bombings {{occurred}} on 1 February 2008, when two suicide <b>bombings</b> occurred <b>in</b> Baghdad, {{the capital of}} Iraq. The blasts killed 98 people and injured over 200 others.|$|R

5|$|Six of No.36 Squadron's Hercules {{evacuated}} over 450 civilians from Cambodia {{following the}} coup in July 1997. The unit again became {{responsible for its}} own routine maintenance in 1998, when No.486 Squadron was disbanded. A detachment from No.36 Squadron supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. The squadron was assigned four C-130Es previously operated by No.37 Squadron during the latter's transition to the new C-130J Super Hercules, which commenced in 1999; the E models were retired the following year. No.36 Squadron was once more awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001. It took part in relief efforts following the Bali <b>Bombings</b> <b>in</b> October 2002. In February 2003, it deployed a detachment of two Hercules to the Middle East {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. The aircraft arrived on 10February, and began flying transport sorties less than two weeks later. A No.36 Squadron Hercules became the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase, west of Baghdad, after it was secured by Australian special forces personnel. One aircraft was hit by ground fire near Baghdad on 27June 2004, killing a coalition passenger. The detachment remained in Iraq until September 2004, when it was relieved by two C-130Js from No.37 Squadron. No.36 Squadron also participated in Operation Sumatra Assist {{in the wake of the}} 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.|$|E
5|$|In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian {{and other}} foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. The same year, the squadron began operations with two ex-Qantas Boeing 707s, handing them over to No.33 Flight (later No.33 Squadron) {{at the beginning of}} 1981. No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles on John Paul II's 1986 tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a stud bull presented to the Chinese government, kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia, and an exhibition of China's Entombed Warriors. In February 1987, the unit again joined No.36 Squadron, along with No.33 Squadron, as part of a re-formed No.86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group). The following year, No.37 Squadron achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours on the Hercules. The Australian public had the experience of flying in the C-130s when the aircraft were employed by the Federal government to provide transport during the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines. In December 1990 and January 1991, a detachment of C-130s from Nos.36 and 37Squadrons flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War. No.37 Squadron transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace in January 1993, and provided a shuttle service between Kenya and Somalia during May. No.486 Squadron was disbanded in October 1998, having transferred its C-130 maintenance functions to Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons. No.37 Squadron began re-equipping with new-model C-130J Hercules in September 1999. Its aircraft formed part of a detachment of C-130s supporting INTERFET forces in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000, under Operation Warden. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001, the same year it took delivery of its twelfth and final C-130J. Five C-130s of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons participated in relief efforts following the Bali <b>bombings</b> <b>in</b> October 2002.|$|E
