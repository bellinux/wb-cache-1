40|$|Background The Bornean banteng (Bos javanicus lowi) is an {{endangered}} subspecies that often inhabits logged forest; however {{very little is}} known about the effects of logging on their ecology, despite the differing effects this has on other ungulate species. A <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>scoring</b> system was created for the Bornean banteng using camera trap photographs from five forests in Sabah, Malaysia, with various past and present management combinations to establish if banteng nutrition suffered as a result of forest disturbance. Results One hundred and eleven individuals were photographed over 38, 009 camera trap nights from April 2011 to June 2014 in five forests. Banteng within forests that had a recent history of reduced-impact logging had higher <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>scores</b> than banteng within conventionally logged forest. Conversely, when past logging was conducted using a conventional technique and the period of forest regeneration was relatively long; the banteng had higher <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>scores.</b> Conclusion The <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>scoring</b> system is appropriate for monitoring the long-term nutrition of the Bornean banteng and for evaluating the extent of the impact caused by present-day reduced-impact logging methods. Reduced-impact logging techniques give rise to individuals with the higher <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>scores</b> in the shorter term, which then decline over time. In contrast the trend is opposite for conventional logging, which demonstrates the complex effects of logging on banteng <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>scores.</b> This is likely to be due to differences in regeneration between forests that have been previously logged using differing methods.

If a stallion has a <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>score</b> less than 3 or greater than 8, reproductive performance is compromised.|$|E
5000|$|Breeding mares with a <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>score</b> {{less than}} five have been linked in {{research}} to problems with reproduction. The energy demands of milk production for a foal are very high, so most mares will lose condition while lactating. Also, a mare with a <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>score</b> {{less than five}} will have more difficulty conceiving.

Recently, a camera that automatically <b>scores</b> and records <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> <b>scores</b> of cattle has been released to the market (DeLaval International AB,Tumba, Sweden). The objective {{of this study was to}} validate the correlation of the cameras’ automated scores with conventional manual scores. Three experienced individuals scored the cows manually, which were recorded and averaged by cow, to compare with the automated scores. All data analysis was performed using SAS 9. 3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Using PROC UNIVARIATE, descriptive statistics were found for the averaged manual and automated scores. The average score for all the manual scores was 3. 38 ± 0. 48 (mean ± SD) The average automated score was 3. 27 ± 0. 27 (mean ± SD). The scores were compared using PROC CORR and the correlation coefficient was 0. 78 (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The correlation demonstrated a strong positive relationship between the manually obtained scores and the automated scores. The agreement between the scores indicates that the automated system can provide BCS that corresponds with a conventional manual scoring system. The automated system may encourage more producers to adopt BCS into their management practices. Using BCS, producers will be able to make management decisions to improve milk yield, reproduction success, and lower disease occurrence...|$|R
