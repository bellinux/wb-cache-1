30|$|The {{influence}} of internal mass transfer on productivity {{as well as}} the performance of packed bed bioreactor was determined by varying a number of parameters; chitosan coating, flow rate, glucose concentration and particle size. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were immobilized in chitosan and non-chitosan coated alginate beads to demonstrate the effect on particle side mass transfer on substrate consumption time, lag phase and ethanol production. The results indicate that chitosan coating, <b>beads</b> <b>size,</b> glucose concentration and flow rate {{have a significant effect on}} lag phase duration. The duration of lag phase for different <b>size</b> of <b>beads</b> (0.8, 2 and 4  mm) decreases by increasing flow rate and by decreasing the <b>size</b> of <b>beads.</b> Moreover, longer lag phase were found at higher glucose medium concentration and also with chitosan coated beads. It was observed that by increasing flow rates; lag phase and glucose consumption time decreased. The reason is due to the reduction of external (fluid side) mass transfer as a result of increase in flow rate as glucose is easily transported to the surface of the <b>beads.</b> Varying the <b>size</b> of <b>beads</b> is an additional factor: as it reduces the internal (particle side) mass transfer by reducing the <b>size</b> of <b>beads.</b> The reason behind this is the distance for reactants to reach active site of catalyst (cells) and the thickness of fluid created layer around alginate beads is reduced. The optimum combination of parameters consisting of smaller <b>beads</b> <b>size</b> (0.8  mm), higher flow rate of 90  ml/min and glucose concentration of 10  g/l were found to be the maximum condition for ethanol production.|$|R

40|$|The role of slurry {{rheology}} in stirred media milling of quartzite {{has been}} investigated by varying important grinding parameters such as media bead density and size, addition of chemicals, solids concentration, stirrer rotational speed {{as well as the}} combined effect of these factors. Media bead density has an evident but complex effect on stirred milling performance, depending on stirrer rotational speed and solids concentration. The effect of media <b>bead</b> <b>size</b> on the ultra-fine grinding of quartzite is relevant to the feed size. Optimal ratio of media <b>bead</b> <b>size</b> to the median size of a feed is between 150 and 200. The combined effect of grinding <b>bead</b> <b>size</b> and stirrer speed or solids concentration is insignificant. The addition of Dispersant S 40 or a lower solids concentration results in better grinding performance (i. e., a higher energy efficiency and a smaller median size) due to the maintenance of lower viscosities at shear rates investigated during grinding. Stirrer rotational speed interacts with solids concentration. For a given solids concentration, an optimal stirrer speed exists. The observed phenomena {{can be explained by the}} interaction of slurry rheology and the stress intensity of individual grinding bead. In addition, an empirical particle size-energy model provides a good fit (R 2 > 0. 904) to the grinding results under the experimental conditions investigated. Furthermore, the wear of grinding media beads is involved. ZrO 2 beads have a lowest wear rate whereas the wear of SiO 2 beads is most serious.

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effects of}} grain size and nutritional conditions on the penetration rate and metabolic activity of Escherichia coli strains in anaerobic, nutrient-saturated chambers packed with different sizes of glass beads (diameters, 116 to 767 μm) under static conditions. The chambers had nearly equal porosities (38 %) but different calculated pore sizes (range, 10 to 65 μm). Motile strains always penetrated faster than nonmotile strains, and nutrient conditions that resulted in faster growth rates (fermentative conditions versus nitrate-respiring conditions) resulted in faster penetration rates for both motile and nonmotile strains {{for all of the}} bead sizes tested. The penetration rate of nonmotile strains increased linearly when <b>bead</b> <b>size</b> was increased, while the penetration rate of motile strains became independent of the <b>bead</b> <b>size</b> when beads having diameters of 398 μm or greater were used. The rate of H 2 production and the final amount of H 2 produced decreased when <b>bead</b> <b>size</b> was decreased. However, the final protein concentrations were similar in chambers packed with 116 -, 192 -, and 281 -μm beads and were only slightly higher in chambers packed with 398 - and 767 -μm beads. Our data indicated that conditions that favored faster growth rates also resulted in faster penetration times and that the lower penetration rates observed in chambers packed with small beads were due to restriction of bacterial activity in the small pores. The large increases in the final amount of hydrogen produced without corresponding increases in the final amount of protein made indicated that metabolism became uncoupled from cell mass biosynthesis as <b>bead</b> <b>size</b> increased, suggesting that pore size influenced the efficiency of substrate utilization...|$|E

40|$|The flow of dry {{granular}} material in a half-filled rotating drum is studied. The {{thickness of the}} flowing zone is measured for several rotation speeds, drum <b>sizes</b> and <b>beads</b> <b>sizes</b> (size ratio between drum and beads ranging from 47 to 7400). Varying the rotation speed, a scaling law linking mean velocity vs thickness of the flow, v∼ h^m, is deduced for each couple (beads, drum). The obtained exponent m is not always equal to 1, value previously reported in a drum, but varies with the geometry of the system. For small size ratios, exponents higher than 1 are obtained due to a saturation of the flowing zone thickness. The exponent of the power law decreases with the size ratio, leading to exponents lower than 1 for high size ratios. These exponents imply that the velocity gradient of a dry granular flow in a rotating drum is not constant.
