Additionally, several similarities have <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare's tragedy of the same name.

5|$|Belldandy is {{regarded}} by commentators {{as an example}} of the magical girlfriend character, and comparisons have <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> with the characters of Samantha from Bewitched and Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie.

5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E

For political reasons, Russia and Ukraine could not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> {{in the same}} group or in groups scheduled to be played {{on the same day}} (due to a potential clash of teams and clash of fans). Therefore, if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group B, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, and if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group A or B.|$|R
