5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after the <b>border</b> between the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer <b>border</b> of West Berlin, which was also the <b>border</b> between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German <b>Border</b> Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of <b>border</b> protection facilities began.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary Europe is {{not anymore}} {{characterized}} by traditional National-State <b>borders,</b> {{but rather by}} new <b>borders</b> within National-State <b>borders.</b> These new <b>borders</b> arise by cultural, ethnic and religious identity claimed by national and non-national citizens {{who live in the}} same public space. Therefore, these new <b>borders</b> are not territorial <b>borders,</b> such as those, which divide a state from another, but rather identitaries <b>borders.</b> The fact that even territorial <b>borders</b> are nowadays less strong is a problem for law. Indeed, law needs a territory, which is a space with <b>borders</b> where the rules of a legal system are in force. The aim of this paper will be to focus on how the law manages the phenomenon of strengthening of the identirary <b>borders</b> in order to understand what are the solutions that states give to identity making claims...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, the East German side of the <b>border</b> was guarded {{initially}} by the <b>Border</b> Troops (Pogranichnyie Voiska) of the Soviet NKVD (later the KGB). They were supplemented from 1946 by {{a locally}} recruited paramilitary force, the German <b>Border</b> Police (Deutsche Grenzpolizei or DGP), before the Soviets handed over full control of the <b>border</b> to the East Germans in 1955/56. In 1961, the DGP was converted into a military force within the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA). The newly renamed <b>Border</b> Troops of the GDR (Grenztruppen der DDR, commonly nicknamed the Grenzer) came under the NVA's <b>Border</b> Command or Grenzkommando. They were responsible for securing and defending the borders with West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic Sea and West Berlin. At their peak, the Grenztruppen had up to 50,000personnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{the road}} between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. <b>border</b> was {{completed}} {{as a state}} highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the <b>border</b> between Charles and Prince George's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract. At this time, the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown, Mechanicsville and Beantown, and the Charles-Prince George's county <b>border</b> and TB were proposed as state highways. By 1915, {{the entire length of}} the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. <b>border</b> was completed. This state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown, between north of Morganza and Hughesville, between the Charles-Prince George's county <b>border</b> and north of TB, and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. <b>border</b> while the remainder was an unpaved state road.|$|E
