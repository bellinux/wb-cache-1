The Advanced Paramedic Clinical Activity Study (APCAS) was initiated to provide {{an evaluation of the}} impact of the AP programme on patient care in Ireland. Aim The aim of this study is to provide an insight into the clinical activity of APs over a six month period in the Mid-West region of Ireland. Methods A prospective study was initiated whereby all ambulance calls dispatched by the regional Ambulance Control Centre were recorded by the attending AP, including calls received via the statutory 999 / 112 system. Participating APs were asked to complete a separate call log data sheet recording all demographic and clinical information for every call attended during the study period. Results A total of 17 APs participated and 1, 969 ambulance calls were recorded in APCAS. The Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick was the <b>busiest</b> <b>receiving</b> facility.

5000|$|After {{the death}} of his first wife, Mr. Verma who's the {{managing}} director of his firm remarries Durgadevi (Bindu), so that she can look after his son, Ravi Verma (Jeetendra). She actually seems to have a good relationship with both him and Ravi. Subsequently, Durga also gets pregnant and gives birth to a son Kiran Verma (Kiran Kumar). After a few years as Mr. Verma passes away, Durga decides to enter into politics with the help of Sewakram (Prem Chopra). Ravi takes over from his father as the managing director of his firm and instantly {{falls in love with a}} poor girl Usha (Madhuri Dixit) after seeing a dance performance of hers. Due to this he also gives her a typist job in his firm. But she initially disagrees to this relation due their status differences but Ravi still disregards this. Durgadevi also disagrees with the marriage due to the same reason reminding him of how his rich father married his mother who was also a typist. But later she falsely agrees so she can win the hearts of the poor to vote for her for her upcoming election as the state's chief minister. Usha then starts to love each Ravi a lot. After the marriage, Durga stands for election and wins to become the state's Chief Minister. Usha once overhears about the actual reason why Durga agreed to her and Ravi's marriage which saddens her but hides this from others. Meanwhile, she also becomes pregnant where Durgadevi doesn't seem focused on it especially once in front of Usha and Ravi which shocks them since she's <b>busy</b> <b>receiving</b> calls from other politicians for her election victory. Ravi, for his business-related work, has to travel to London, England after initially disagreeing to leave Usha alone in a situation where she's pregnant. But he believes his mother will take good care of her. Kiran tells his mother that he has had an affair with Usha before she married Ravi which is apparently false. Shocked with this Durgadevi decides to deal with this situation. Usha falls prey to Durgadevi, Kiran and Sewakram and is thrown out of the house after Kiran falsely accuses her of seducing him. Ravi arrives back home and also disowns her after finding it hard to believe she [...] "stooped so low". Along with this, Usha's mother and sister who was attempted to be raped by Kiran once in Ravi's office with the scene slightly in front of Usha are burnt to death in their house by Kiran and his friend and helper. They also try to kill Usha and her unborn baby but they miraculously survive after the baby is born and live with a kind hearted taxi driver Hamid who lost his right leg because of Kiran and his helper and helped Usha and her daughter Madhu survive. Usha forgets her in-laws and Ravi and begins a new life. Hamid becomes close to Usha and Madhu. Years later he dies and Madhu now a young woman and college student who is a duplicate of her mom finds out from Sewakram about her family and her mother's past life. Thus she plans for revenge on her paternal grandmother and uncle for what they did to her mother. She pretends to be someone else by entering the Verma household where only her loving father remembers her mother's face after she becomes a typist in his firm. She also quickly wins their hearts and becomes their secretary to help them in any matter. Part of her revenge also includes falsely accusing Kiran for seducing her and this what makes Ravi wonder after Kiran mentions of what actually they did to Usha. Later they find out who she is as her revenge is completed. She tells her mother this who becomes angry. Miraculously Ravi comes to their home and he and Usha reunite lovingly. But Madhu hates him as he never searched for her over the years. So Ravi tells her about what his mother and brother did to Usha and Sewakram was a part of telling her everything so he can gain the Verma business firm. Shocked Madhu takes on revenge on him along with her dad and Durga and Kiran realize their grave mistake of hurting Usha. Madhu also falls in love with Kiran's initially poor brother-in-law Chandar (Deepak Tijori) who lives in the Verma household after his initially poor sister, a teacher Chanda (Archana Puran Singh) suddenly married him after Usha was thrown out of the house. Durga and Ravi also initially disagreed to this marriage due to status differences. Kiran is run over by Sewakram and Sewakram is killed by Shyamsundar (Anupam Kher), Ravi's paternal uncle and husband of his aunt Mrs. Shyamsundar (Aruna Irani) who left the Verma house after Kiran's marriage. He was also the only one to believe in Usha's innocence after she was falsely accused of seducing Kiran. Before dying Kiran sadly confesses lying about Usha to his mother about their affair and she seducing him on the day she was thrown out. His death is honoured by everyone in the Verma household who all forgive him and finally reunite.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{previous}} {{study shows that}} <b>busy</b> professionals <b>receive</b> in excess of 50 emails per day of which approximately 23 % require immediate attention, 13 % require attention later and 64 % are unimportant and typically ignored. The flood of emails impact mobile users even more heavily. Flooded inboxes cause busy professionals to spend considerable amounts of time searching for important messages, {{and there has been}} much research into automating the process using email content for classification; but we find email priority depends also on user context. In this paper we describe the Personal Messaging Assistant (PMA), an advanced rule-based email management system which considers user context and email content. Context information is gathered from various sources including mobile phones, indoor and outdoor locationing systems, and calendars. PMA uses separate scales of importance and urgency to prioritize emails and to decide on an appropriate action, such as SMS to user, defer to later, file or forward. Initial results yield 96 % recall and 88 % precision in importance classification of emails; 95 % recall and 92 % precision in urgency classification of emails. PMA shows a 30 X reduction in false-negative rates over existing systems. A key contribution of our work has been to leverage an extensible set of context information, gathered in a mobile environment, for the classification of emails and customizable decision making...|$|R

In this project the aspect of hypoglycaemia was studied in a <b>busy</b> medical <b>receiving</b> ward at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. A large proportion of inpatients have diabetes and episodes of hypoglycaemia experienced by this population can delay discharge and indeed be detrimental to health. Thus it is important from both an organisational and patient perspective to manage this population well. In this project BM machine data was analysed to identify patients who were hypoglycaemic. These patients were then tracked down to study the subsequent management and compared this against recommended guidance. Following this an intervention was made to promote identification, management, documentation, and prevention of hypoglycaemia. This was deliberately a simple intervention involving discussions with staff and provision of basic documented guidance next to every BM machine. In the first phase 17 patients were identified and in a second and third phase 16 patients each time were further identified. Patients in the study were both type 1 and type 2 diabetics. Initial results in phase I were compared to results in phase II and III respectively. This intervention produced significant improvements in management with correct monitoring of low BMs (i. e. upon identification of low BM repeat within 1 hour) improving from 47 % to 100 % (for Phase II and III).

Sex industry {{is represented by}} three groups of subjects: organizers, perpetrators, services consumers. However, not all these individuals are criminally liable for their actions. Bringing a criminal case is preceded by detection of elements of crime, which is often carried out by a test purchase. Underworld evolution dictates the need for active use of other crime detection actions. The role of rapid and well-coordinated work of the inquiry body, its interaction with the preliminary investigation agency at the stage of detection of these crimes is emphasized. The attributes of these crimes are: advertisements on the recruitment of women {{to work in the}} service (leisure) sector and personal vehicles drivers; advertisements on the services of an intimate nature; business cards and leaflets advertising the services of an intimate nature (directly or covertly); Internet advertisements offering the services of an intimate nature; groups of girls, constantly residing in baths and saunas, headed by young men or their presence at the same locations along the main streets or <b>busy</b> highways; information <b>received</b> on the law enforcement bodies hotlines; statements and complaints of the people against girls of easy virtue living in adjacent apartments.
