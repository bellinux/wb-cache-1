40|$|The land {{development}} process involves decision-making by landowners, developers and builders {{in the context}} of a changing socioeconomic environment. Essential to that process is the transfer of property rights either wholly (freehold) or partly (leasehold) from landowners to builders. This process is examined in Huddersfield between 1770 and 1911. Development from 1770 to 1850 was dominated by, the Ramsden Estate. Building was undertaken in an ad, hoc and informal manner by small capitalists from all ranks of society. Some limited <b>building</b> took place <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> but most houses were built on leasehold tenure or tenancy at will, the latter being available on the Ramsden Estate. After 1850 an increasing number of landowners participated in {{land development}} as suburbanisation took place, firstly amongst the upper middle classes and after 1880 amongst the lower middle classes. Consequently the Ramsden Estate's near monopoly of development land declined" and that Estate found it increasingly difficult to let land on the terms and conditions it wished. Builders, however, had a widening choice of locations in which to build and exhibited a preference for land available on long-term leasehold. By 1867 this had become the tenure on which land was available throughout Huddersfield. During the final years of the nineteenth century a number of changes were manifest in the mechanics of land development. Construction costs rose, primarily as a result of the introduction of byelaws governing house-building. Thus, not only did builders increasingly concentrate <b>on</b> <b>building</b> for the lower middle classes at the expense. of the working classes, but they also increased the size of building projects. Moreover, house building was now chiefly initiated by members of the lower middle classes or <b>building</b> contractors <b>on</b> a speculative basis rather than the contractual basis that had been the practice. Meanwhile, landowners found themselves in increasing competition with each other in the supply of land. By the beginning of the twentieth century some of the smaller landowners were offering <b>land</b> for development <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> as well as leasehold tenure, whichever a builder preferred...|$|R

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} August 1987 Swaziland's Fourth National Development Plan advocates {{the development}} of outgrower schemes based on the example of Vuvulane Irrigated Farms as an alternative strategy for rural development (Swaziland government 1985 : 309). If this recommendation were to be adopted as agricultural policy, it would necessitate land reform in the areas where these schemes are to be established. This {{is because of the}} existing division in land ownership between Swazi Nation <b>Land</b> and <b>freehold</b> Title Deed <b>Land.</b> Swazi Nation Land is held by the King "in trust" for "the nation" and allocated through chiefs to Swazi subjects. Private property in land in Swaziland dates to the concessionary era when large scale concessions were made to European land speculators and prospective farmers {{in the late nineteenth century}} by King Mbandzeni. Contrary to what has been argued in much of the literature on Swaziland, this land division has not entailed {{the development of}} dualism in agriculture, with the "modern" agricultural sector based <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> title deed <b>land</b> and the "traditional" sector on Swazi Nation Land (SNL). Rather, both the land division and dualism are products of the development of capitalist relations which have generated an uneven and differential development characterised by the evolution of large-scale multinational and South African dominated enterprises <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> <b>land,</b> and the development of petty commodity production on SNL. One question arising out of the advocation of the development of outgrower schemes and various forms of contract farming in Swaziland relating to land tenure, is whether or not such schemes can be established on SNL. To put it more specifically: is private ownership in land a pre-requisite for the establishment of viable contract farming schemes? This study will show that while <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> leased out to petty commodity producers is undoubtedly advantageous for the owners of capital, in terms of the extra control which can be exerted over petty commodity producers, this is by no means a pre-requisite for the development of outgrower schemes. While it will be demonstrated that land tenure is not indicative of the form of production which takes place in agriculture, the chief concern of this paper is to examine the extent to which outgrower schemes in Swaziland have succeeded in their stated objectives of bringing "commercial farming" to the peasantry. The key question which emerges is whether or not outgrower schemes facilitate peasant accumulation and create the conditions for the reproduction of a rich and/or middle peasantry. Answers to these questions will be sought through an examination of three outgrower schemes. Two of these, (Vuvulane Irrigated Farms and Mpetsheni Pineapple Settlement Scheme) are <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> Title Deed <b>Land,</b> while one (Casalee Tobacco Project) is <b>on</b> both <b>freehold</b> and SNL where petty commodity producing participants are based. The paper argues that contract farming and outgrower schemes are best understood in the context of the social relations to which this form of capitalist development in agriculture gives rise. Such schemes have differentiating effects and create the conditions for the reproduction of a middle peasantry, as well as the potential for more systematic accumulation by peasant producers. In Swaziland land tenure both <b>on</b> SNL and <b>freehold</b> title deed <b>land,</b> through restricting the size of land holdings of scheme participants, may have constraining effects on the extent to which accumulation becomes possible for petty commodity producers on such schemes...|$|R
50|$|The 1950s saw the {{introduction}} of television to Australia and by 1959 Channel Nine and Channel Seven both commenced broadcasting in Brisbane resulting in Brisbane City Council giving permission {{for the construction of}} transmission towers on Mount Coot-tha. Eventually two more towers were constructed for Channel Ten and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The three towers for the commercial television stations, Channel Seven, Channel Nine and Channel Ten, are located <b>on</b> private <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> along with their respective studio facilities. The fourth tower, used by the ABC, is on land owned by the Brisbane City Council. The towers are highly visible from many parts of Brisbane, even at night as they are mounted with blinking warning lights for aviation purposes. The towers are not included in the entry in the Heritage Register.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{introduction}} {{is to provide a}} brief outline of the scope and the progression of the thesis. Since {{the latter part of the}} nineteenth century, it has been a well-established principle of real property law in England and Wales that the burden of a positive covenant cannot run directly with <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> at law or in equity. The fact that a positive covenant cannot run directly with <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> has for many years been acknowledged to be a major defect of English land law. In Chapter I, the rules which govern the enforceability of freehold covenants are examined. Further, the chapter identifies why the Judges in the nineteenth century decided not to permit the burden of a positive covenant to run with <b>freehold</b> <b>land.</b> Conveyancers use a number of techniques and devices in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle. However, none of them are foolproof. In Chapter II, a number of devices which are used by conveyancers in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle are examined and evaluated. The difficulties which can arise from the present law's failure to provide a satisfactory means whereby positive covenants may be made to run with <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> are identified in Chapter III. Local authorities possess a number of statutory powers to impose positive covenants <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> and to enforce them against successive owners. In Chapter IV, consideration is afforded to some aspects of their powers in this regard. The need to reform the present law has long been recognised. However, despite the fact that several Reports have been made and one draft Bill produced reform has still not been achieved. In Chapter V, the major proposals made for reform in the 1960 's and 1970 's are considered. Further, reasons are advanced to explain why reform of the law of positive covenants has proved to be so difficult to secure. One of the main consequences of the present law is that the vast majority of flats in England and Wales are held on long leases. The popular preference is for freehold not leasehold ownership. Several common law countries have comprehensive "condominium" legislation making full provision for rights and obligations, etc., in regard to freehold flats. The relevant legislation of New South Wales and Trinidad and Tobago is examined in Chapters VI and VII respectively. One objective of these chapters is to demonstrate that there are viable alternatives to using leasehold schemes for blocks of flats. In 1984, the Law Commission published their Report on Positive and Restrictive Covenants. Chapter VIII deals with this Report and with a number of other relevant recent development...|$|R

40|$|Land-clearing {{represents}} {{the first step}} in agricultural development and signals a shift in landscape function towards provisioning ecosystem services, in particular food production. In the process, other types of ecosystem services are often unintentionally lost as illustrated by the associated decline in biodiversity, increased soil erosion and emission of greenhouse gases. In 2003, the Northern Territory state government in Australia promulgated a moratorium on the clearing of native vegetation <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> in the Douglas-Daly river catchment, an area experiencing increasing pressure from agricultural development. The moratorium was intended to limit the rate and extent of land-clearing {{for a period of time}} so that informed policy could be concurrently developed to guide future land-clearing and minimise negative impacts. Under the moratorium, land-clearing required a permit and had to conform to broad guidelines; clearing was confined to <b>freehold</b> <b>land,</b> was prohibited in close proximity to wetlands, rivers and rainforest to safeguard water quality, and there were prescribed limits on percentages cleared by property, vegetation type, sub-catchment, and the whole catchment. Remotely sensed data (1977 – 2011) were used to explore the effectiveness of the moratorium. The analysis shows that, during moratorium years (2002 – 2009), clearing rates accelerated rather than slowed in the moratorium area and was mostly (81 %) conducted without the required permits. The extent of land cleared after the moratorium was declared, and the fallow nature of some of this land a decade later, suggests that much of the land-clearing may have been completed in anticipation of stricter future controls. The moratorium failed because it was not formally legislated and was too broadly defined. Consequently, the non-binding nature of the land-clearing guidelines, and the absence of systematic monitoring of land cover change or penalties for clearing land without a permit, led to uninformed and uncontrolled clearing. This paper demonstrates that effective policy is only as good as its level of implementation...|$|R

40|$|Extract] The Australian Centre for Tropical Research (ACTFR) {{was engaged}} by Telstra to {{undertake}} a brief ecological survey of a proposed site for {{the location of a}} CMTS. The proposed Telstra CMTS is to be located <b>on</b> <b>freehold</b> <b>land</b> (Easting 360 200, Northing 8131 530, Zone 55) in the foot-hills of the Lamb Range, immediately adjacent to the Cairns suburb of Redlynch, and within 1 km of Redlynch Post Office. The property description is "part of Lot 17 on R 703170, Parish of Cairns". Access to the proposed site will be along an existing track, off from Harvey Road, and which crosses over the Cairns-Kurandarail line. A separate route above the access track for a powerline is also proposed. The area to be utilised for the proposed tower is approximately 150 square metres (i. e. a footprint of about 10 m x 15 m). It will comprise of a Telstra equipment hut and a 41 m Z 3 Tower, with associated antennae and dishes (R. Grinsell pers. comm.). On-site construction will also involve the sinking of foundations, building of a 2 m block retaining wall and manproof perimeter fencing. Installation of the CMTS will necessitate the upgrading of the access track from Harvey Road. The proposed installation site and access routes are potentially of some conservation significance, with nationally threatened species occurring in the local area and Barron Falls National Park adjacent to the lot on which the proposed CMTS will be sited. The western boundary of the Park, which forms part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, is located approximately 200 - 300 metres east of the proposed installation site. Scope The ACTFR had the following survey objectives: 1. to conduct a limited flora survey (and fauna review) of the proposed Telstra CMTS site and along the proposed access and powerline routes; 2. to comment on the impacts of the proposed development on the local vegetation and faunal communities and, if necessary, to make recommendations to ameliorate those impacts...|$|R

40|$|Australian {{policies}} to preserve native vegetation on farms rest on mandatory regulations without compensation, whereas policies in most OECD countries rest on voluntary conservation with compensation. In New South Wales, the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1998 restricts farmers from clearing native vegetation <b>on</b> their own <b>freehold</b> <b>land,</b> and offers no compensation. The Act may therefore impose opportunity costs, or losses in income, on landholders. These opportunity costs are estimated for {{a case study}} property in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, and these results are then generalised to assess the broad trade-offs between development and preservation. The losses in income appear to vary between 5 and 10 per cent of annual income, depending on livestock prices. The flow of these losses over time appears to total some $ 26 m for all properties of this kind in the immediate region. In addition to imposition of these direct opportunity costs, the regulations hinder land sales and so hinder adjustment by landholders to changing conditions.
