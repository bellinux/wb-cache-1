5|$|In February 2009, FATA's provincial {{government}} officially declared Islamic law in Swat {{to achieve a}} ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E
5|$|Following {{news of the}} fighting, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps {{called on}} its troops {{deployed}} in western Slavonia to reinforce the 30th Partisan Division. The corps felt it could weaken its positions in western Slavonia <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) peacekeepers were expected to deploy there {{by the end of}} the month based on the Vance plan. Those troops consisted of the Volunteer Battalion of the 5th Corps, and they were augmented by the 2nd Howitzer Battalion of the 5th Mixed Artillery Regiment. The 1st Battery of the 5th Light Anti-Aircraft Defence Regiment was also added to the battalion.|$|E

5|$|Moran {{represented}} Virginia's 8th congressional district, {{an area in}} Northern Virginia that is {{just across}} the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.; the district includes Arlington county, and the cities of Alexandria, Falls Church and parts of Fairfax. The redistricting that followed the 2000 census also gave Moran a portion of Reston, Virginia. His district {{is located in the}} Dulles Technology Corridor and is the home of many federal defense contractors as well as a significant number of those who work in the information technology industry. Many federal employees also reside within the district, mostly due to its proximity to Washington and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Department of Defense and various other agencies are headquartered there.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell and his Indian allies prepared a major offensive. In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition {{came to a halt}} after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Most of the Indians dispersed after learning that the reports of imminent invasion were false, but Caldwell led 300 Indians into Kentucky and delivered a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. After his victory at Blue Licks, Caldwell was ordered to cease operations <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Great Britain were about to make peace. Although General Irvine had finally gotten permission to lead his own expedition into the Ohio Country, rumors of the peace treaty killed enthusiasm for the undertaking, which never took place. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the final blow in the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|A third burst, Charlie, {{planned for}} 1947, was {{canceled}} primarily <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Navy's inability to decontaminate the target ships after the Baker test.

50|$|The {{agreement}} is a treaty under international law, but not under <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution <b>because</b> in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States laws require majority approval in both houses, while treaties require two-thirds approval in the Senate only.

5|$|The first {{official}} trial {{for war crimes}} committed at Treblinka was held in Düsseldorf between 12 October 1964 and 24 August 1965, preceded by the 1951 trial of SS-Scharführer Josef Hirtreiter, which was triggered by charges of war crimes unrelated to his service at the camp. The trial was delayed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and the Soviet Union had lost interest in prosecuting German war crimes {{with the onset of}} the Cold War. Many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1964 and 1965 eleven former SS camp personnel were brought to trial by West Germany, including commandant Kurt Franz. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Artur Matthes (Totenlager) and Willi Mentz and August Miete (both from Lazaret). Gustav Münzberger (gas chambers) received 12 years, Franz Suchomel (gold and money) 7 years, Otto Stadie (operation) 6 years, Erwin Lambert (gas chambers) 4 years, and Albert Rum (Totenlager) 3 years. Otto Horn (corpse detail) was acquitted.|$|E

50|$|To this day, {{terminology}} {{around these}} diseases remains confusing <b>because</b> in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom {{motor neurone disease}} refers to both ALS specifically and to the spectrum of ALS, PMA, PLS, and PBP.

25|$|A {{potential}} {{route for}} the Royal Navy {{to get the}} SPS-6C was the Mutual Defense Assistance Pact (MDAP), but by 1954-5 the MDAP programme was running down.

25|$|The victorious {{great powers}} also gained an {{acknowledgement}} of their status through permanent {{seats at the}} League of Nations Council, where they acted {{as a type of}} executive body directing the Assembly of the League. However, the Council began with only four permanent members – the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Japan – <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, meant to be the fifth permanent member, did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles, thus preventing American participation in the League. Germany later joined, and left along with Japan, and the Soviet Union joined.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States has not {{ratified}} the Basel Convention or its Ban Amendment, and has few domestic federal laws forbidding {{the export of}} toxic waste, the Basel Action Network estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China. This figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the EPA, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and the World Reuse, Repair and Recycling Association.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, volunteers had {{to travel}} across Yugoslavia, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Norway and Sweden {{to make their way}} to Finland. They {{travelled}} without any weapons by a special train, officially classified as “tourists going to ski-camp”. The battalion was embarked at Edinburgh to Bergen {{as a part of a}} convoy. This convoy had to be protected by air and naval cover <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and the German Reich were in a state of war and there was great fear of German attacks (“Phony War”). Finally the battalion arrived in Finland on 2 March after three weeks' travelling.|$|E
5000|$|...

50|$|Association {{football}} {{was perceived as}} an especially bad fit {{for this type of}} stadium <b>because,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, <b>the</b> sport does not draw as many fans to games as American football or baseball (with the partial exception of Seattle), resulting in the stadium being filled to only a fraction of its capacity. This led to the soccer-specific stadium movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{bank has}} also been criticized by Vietnam War {{veterans}} for funding projects in Laos, <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States' 15% stake in the bank, underwritten by taxes. Laos became a communist country after the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam, and the Laotian Civil War was won by the Pathet Lao, which is widely understood to have been supported by the North Vietnamese Army.|$|R
25|$|During the 1930s, Japan's {{increasingly}} expansionist policies {{brought it}} into renewed conflict with its neighbors, Russia and China (Japan had fought the First Sino-Japanese War with China in 1894–95 and the Russo-Japanese War with Russia in 1904–05; Japan's imperialist ambitions {{had a hand}} in precipitating both conflicts). In March 1933, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in response to international condemnation of its conquest of Manchuria and subsequent establishment of the Manchukuo puppet government. On January 15, 1936, Japan withdrew from the Second London Naval Disarmament Conference <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Great Britain refused to grant the Japanese Navy parity with theirs. A second war between Japan and China began with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937.|$|E
25|$|The IWW {{clashed with}} the United Mine Workers union in April 1916, when the IWW picketed the {{anthracite}} mines around Scranton, Pennsylvania, intending, by persuasion or force, to keep UMWA members from going to work. The IWW considered the UMWA too reactionary, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Mine Workers negotiated contracts with the mine owners for fixed time periods; the IWW considered that contracts hindered their revolutionary goals. In what a contemporary writer pointed out was a complete reversal of their usual policy, UMWA officials called for police to protect United Mine Workers members who wished to cross the picket lines. The Pennsylvania State Police arrived in force, prevented picket line violence, and allowed the UMWA members to peacefully pass through the IWW picket lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} first used to {{describe}} nations with greater than great power status as early as 1944, but only gained its specific meaning {{with regard to the}} United States, the United Kingdom and its empire and the Soviet Union after World War II. This was <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance. The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch-American geostrategist Nicholas Spykman in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order. This formed the foundation for the book The Geography of the Peace, which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the British Empire and United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world.|$|E
