40|$|Swine research, 2005 {{is known}} as Swine day, 2005 Two {{experiments}} were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of lactose products and specialty protein sources on feed flow ability as measured by angle of repose. Angle of repose is the maximum angle in which a pile of ingredient retains its slope. A large angle of repose represents a steeper slope and poorer flow ability. A 70 : 30 corn-soybean meal blend served as the base to which all specialty ingredients were added. In Experiment 1, six lactose sources were evaluated. Three sources were fine, powdered whey permeates, and the other sources were coarse-ground whey permeate, edible-grade spray-dried whey, and a crystalline lactose source. Lactose sources were added at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 % to the corn-soybean meal <b>blend.</b> <b>Angle</b> of repose was then measured on these mixtures, as well as on the individual lactose sources. There was a lactose source × level interaction (P< 0. 0001) observed. Increasing lactose source decreased angle of repose, but the coarse whey permeate had a much greater improvement in flow ability, resulting in the interaction. In Experiment 2, five specialty protein sources were evaluated: powdered or granulated spray-dried animal plasma, powdered or granulated spray-dried blood cells, and select menhaden fish meal. Specialty protein sources were added at 0, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, and 10 % to the 70 : 30 corn-soybean meal blend. There was a specialty protein source × level interaction (P< 0. 0001) observed. As powdered animal plasma and blood cells increased, angle of repose increased, resulting in poorer flow ability. With the addition of granulated animal plasma and blood cells, angle of repose decreased, indicating better flow ability. Increasing fish meal did not influence angle of repose. These data confirm that greater flow ability is observed with granulated specialty protein or coarsely ground lactose sources...|$|R

40|$|Different {{formulations}} of biodegradable starch-polyester blend nanocomposite materials have been film blown on a pilot scale film blowing tower. The physical properties of different films {{have been examined}} by thermal and mechanical analysis and X-ray diffraction. The {{results show that the}} addition of an organoclay (from 0 to 5 wt%) significantly improves both the processing and tensile properties over the original starch <b>blends.</b> Wide <b>angle</b> X-ray diffraction (WAXD) results indicate that the best results were obtained for 30 wt% starch blends, and the level of delamination depends on the ratio of starch to polyester and amount of organoclay added. The crystallisation temperature of the nanocomposite blends is significantly lower than the base blend. This is probably due to the platelets inhibiting order, and hence crystallisation, of the starch and polyester. The mechanical and thermal properties of the blends are also sensitive to the way the clay particles are dispersed. (C) 2003 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} two {{experiments to}} determine the effect of added glycerol or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend on the flow ability characteristics of ground corn or ground corn and 15 or 30 % spray-dried whey. Experiments were conducted using corn ground by either a full circle, tear drop hammer mill or a three-high roller mill at the Kansas State University Grain Science Feed Mill. Flow ability was determined by measuring angle of repose. In Exp. 1 we evaluated the effects of added soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend on the flow ability of ground corn. Samples were ground through a roller mill (RM) or hammermill (HM). Particle size mean and standard deviations of the ground corn were 645 microns and 1. 97 for the roller mill and 674 microns and 2. 31 for the hammer mill. Soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 blend of soy oil/glycerol was added to the ground corn at 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 % for a total of 30 samples (1 RM sample, 1 HM sample, 3 liquid sources, and 5 levels of added liquid). In Exp. 2, we evalu-ated the effects of added soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend on the flow ability of 85 : 15 or 70 : 30 blend of HM ground corn and spray-dried whey. Soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 blend of soy oil/glycerol was added to the ground corn and spray-dried whey-based diets at 0, 4, or 8 % for a total of 18 samples (1 HM sample, 2 levels of added whey, 3 liquid sources, and 3 levels of added liquid). Angle of repose was then measured, and replicated 4 times on each sample. In Exp. 1 there was a three way interaction (P< 0. 05) between mill type, liquid source, and percent liquid added. Roller mill ground grain had decreased angle of repose (better flow ability) compared to HM ground grain. The addition of soy oil increased angle of repose, decreasing flow ability. The addition of glycerol or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol <b>blend</b> decreased <b>angle</b> of repose, improving flow ability with HM ground corn. Addition of glycerol did not influence flow ability when added to RM corn ground. In Exp. 2 there was a three way interaction (P< 0. 05) between spray-dried whey level, added liquid source, and percent of liquid added. The addition of glycerol or the 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol <b>blend</b> decreased <b>angle</b> of repose, improving flow ability. The addition of glycerol decreased angle of repose greater in the 15 % spray-dried whey sample compared to the 30 % spray-dried whey sample. The addition of soy oil increased angle of repose regardless of spray-dried whey concentration. These data suggest that the addition of glycerol to a meal diet containing HM ground corn will improve flow ability...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) blends were {{successfully}} impregnated with timolol maleate, an anti-glaucoma drug, using a supercritical solvent impregnation (SSI) technique. Supercritical fluid impregnation efficiency results {{suggested that the}} best impregnating conditions were obtained when a cosolvent was used and when specific drug–polymer interactions occurred {{as a consequence of}} different chemical structures due to polymer blending. Pressure can be either a favourable factor, when there is enough drug affinity for the polymers, or an unfavourable factor when weaker bonding is involved. In order to determine the relative hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the <b>blends,</b> contact <b>angle</b> analysis was performed, while crystallinity determination was also useful to understand the obtained release profiles. Drug loading, heterogeneous/homogeneous dispersion of drug inside the matrix, hydrophilicity, crystallinity, all seem to influence the obtained drug release rates. The “in vitro” release results suggested that a sustained drug release rate can be obtained by changing the SSI operational conditions and by modulating the composition of blends, as a mean to control crystallinity, hydrophilicity and drug affinity for the polymer matrix. After a first day burst release, all samples showed a sustained release profile (1. 2 – 4 μg/(ml day), corresponding to a mass of 3 – 10 μg/day) which is between the therapeutic and toxic levels of timolol maleate, during a period of 1 month.

Differenctial scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis showed that PLA was able to crystallize on heating, and that the addition of ZrP could promote extent of PLA crystallization, whereas the presence of CLO and SEP did not significantly affect the crystallization on heating and melting behaviour of PLA matrix. Dynamic Mechanical Thermoanalysis (DMTA) results showed that addition of all nanoparticles brought considerable improvements in E' of PLA, resulting in a remarkable increase of elastic properties for PLA nanocomposites. The melt viscosity and dynamic shear moduli (G',G") of PLA nanocomposites were also enhanced significantly by the presence of CLO and SEP, and attributed to the formation of a PLA/nanoparticle interconnected structure within the polymer matrix. The oxygen permeability of PLA did not significantly vary upon addition of SEP and ZrP nanoparticles. Only addition of CLO led to about 30 % decrease compared to PLA permeability, due to the good clay dispersion and clay platelet-like morphology. The characteristic high transparency of PLA in the visible region was kept upon addition of the nanoparticles. Based on these achievements, a high potential of these PLA nanocomposites in sustainable packaging applications could be envisaged...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrically}} conductive elastomer blends based on styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) tri-block copolymer and polyaniline-dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (PANI. DBSA) were prepared by two methods, namely, melt mixing and in situ polymerization of aniline {{in the presence}} of SBS. The influence of composition and synthetic methods on the properties of SBS/PANI has been studied. SBS/PANI blends are characterized for physico-mechanical properties such as density, tensile strength and tensile modulus. A drastic reduction in volume resistivity with increase in PANI content is noticed for blends prepared by in situ polymerization compared to melt mixing method. Using Porod's law we have estimated the inter-face thickness and the value turns out to be 0. 55 +/- 0. 04 in all cases.

40|$|This work aims at {{studying}} {{the role of}} interface properties on the rheological behavior of non-compatibilized and compatibilized polymer blends. Blends of polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) with polystyrene (PS) and PS functionalized with oxazoline (PSOX) with concentrations of up to 20 w/w of the dispersed phase were used. It was observed that until a critical concentration is reached the increase in PSOX content leads to {{a significant increase in}} (a) the elasticity at low frequencies and (b) the relaxation time after cessation of flow, both in shear and extension. This points to a likely significant role played by interface elasticity. Since no chemical reactions occur between PMMA and the oxazoline groups of PSOX, the latter is probably caused by the partial miscibility between PMMA and PSOX. Beyond this critical concentration, the amount of PSOX does not have a significant influence on the rheological behavior of the blends. In order to gain an insight into the relaxation dynamics of the droplets and interface, and their relationship with the rheological behavior of the <b>blends,</b> small <b>angle</b> light scattering (SALS) was used in diluted blends (1 wt % of the dispersed phase) during step shear. SALS shows a slight deformation of dispersed phase in the vorticity direction for the 99 PMMA/ 1 PSOX blend while the droplets of the 99 PMMA/ 1 PS blend deforms in the flow direction only. This result confirms the large increase in the interfacial elasticity for the 99 PMMA/ 1 PSOX blend. (C) 2010 The Society of Rheology. [DOI: 10. 1122 / 1. 3439732]status: publishe...|$|R

The morphology of the blend scaffolds exhibited a thin layer structure before calcium ions treatment, and much more rod-like structure appeared at the layer surface with adding the increase content of sodium alginate in the blend scaffolds.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of {{amorphous polymer}} blends {{has been extensively}} studied in the past, but {{now there is a}} growing interest for polymer blends where {{one or more of the}} components can crystallize. In this study we investigate such blends, namely miscible polycarbonate (PC) /acrylic <b>blends.</b> Using small <b>angle</b> X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy, we demonstrate that the amorphous acrylic component mostly segregates inside the spherulites between the lamellar bundles (interfibrillar segregation). Varying the PC molecular weight or the mobility of the amorphous component (by changing its molecular weight and T-g) does not change the mode of segregation. So far qualitative predictions of the mode of segregation in semicrystalline polymer blends have been proposed using the delta parameter (the ratio between the diffusion coefficient D of the amorphous component in the blend and the linear crystallization rate G), introduced by Keith and Padden. Our results suggest that other parameters have to be considered to fully understand the segregation process. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Polym Sci B: Polym Phys 36 : 2197 - 2210, 1998...|$|R
40|$|The project, {{for which}} {{this study is}} created, is the virtual dancer of the University of Twente. In this project, there was an issue that the {{transition}} from one dance animation to another was not natural looking. This problem was {{the basis of the}} problem on how to generate natural looking transitions between animations, which is the basis for this study. To create natural looking transitions, the angular velocity and angular acceleration of each joint is taken into account. To calculate a meaningful angular velocity and angular acceleration, we have chosen to use Euler angles to represent the rotations. In this study we consider two different problems: transitions between two animations with and without an overlap in time. To generate the transition when there is no overlap in time between two animations, two techniques are presented: The extrapolation of the two animations and splines. The extrapolation extends the two animations, creating an overlap in time that is interpolated. When there is an overlap in time between two animations, those two animations are blended using the exponential map. This technique is also used when there are more than two animations at the same time. Tests showed that <b>blending</b> using Euler <b>angles</b> is impossible t...|$|R
40|$|Block {{copolymer}} (BCP) phase {{segregation and}} self-assembly into {{two or more}} distinct domains are primarily dictated by two parameters: the block volume fraction, f, and {{the product of the}} segment-segment interaction parameter and the length of polymer chain, XN. The volume fraction determines a block copolymer 2 ̆ 7 s phase segregated morphology, whereas XN dictates its overall segregation strength, or phase stability. In order to achieve smaller domain sizes, the interaction parameter must be increased to compensate for the decrease in chain length. In the melt, PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO (Pluronic) triblock copolymer surfactants do not phase segregate primarily due to their low molecular weights and insufficient segregation strength, or low XN. Strong hydrogen bonding and selective interactions of PEO chains with homopolymers capable of hydrogen bonding, such as poly(acrylic acid) were shown to increase the effective segregation strength of the <b>blend.</b> Small <b>angle</b> X-ray scattering demonstrated highly ordered sub- 10 nm domains resulting from phase segregation of the blends. The strong hydrogen bonding interaction between PEO and H-bonding homopolymers was also utilized to incorporate polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) into silicate films. In order to improve the compatibility between hydrophobic POSS with hydrophilic Pluronic copolymers, POSS-decorated acrylate monomer was copolymerized with acrylic acid. This eliminated the macrophase segregation between the BCP templates and POSS molecules. The inclusion of POSS is shown to increase the mechanical performance of the low-k films. A supercritical CO 2 synthesis route enables the transport of silica precursors into the polymer blends. An increase of hardness of up to 1. 8 GPa at k = 2. 4 and 1. 2 GPa for k = 2. 1 was observed for these mesoporous organosilicate films. Finally, this work has also focused on the formation of ordered domains of the Pluronic surfactants into a ternary solvent system consisting of two liquid solvents and compressed CO 2. Compressed CO 2 can influence the compatibility of liquid solvents, inducing phase separation or phase mixing.

DSC showed that the polysaccharide reduced the crystallinity of PCL and had a nucleation effect, which was also confirmed by OM analysis. Hoffman-Weeks analysis was performed on PCL and blend samples allowing calculation of their equilibrium melting temperatures (Tm 0). WAXD showed that the crystalline unit cell type was the same for PCL and blends. FTIR-ATR did not evidence interactions between blend components. Thermal stability was affected {{by the type of}} polysaccharide. Microparticles (< 125 ím) were produced from blends by cryogenical milling and characterized by scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM). Selective laser sintering (SLS), a new rapid prototyping technology for scaffold fabrication, was applied to sinter blend microparticles according to a PC-designed two-dimensional geometry (strips and 2 2 mm 2 square-meshed grids). The optimal experimental conditions for sintering were established and laser beam parameters (beam speed, BS, and power, P) were found for each blend composition. Morphology of sintered objects was analyzed by SEM and found to be dependent on the morphology of the sintered powders. Sintered samples were analyzed by chemical imaging (CI), FTIR-ATR, DSC, and contact angle analysis. No evidence of the occurrence of degradation phenomena was found by FTIR-ATR for sintered samples, whereas DSC parameters of PCL and blends showed changes which could be attributed to some molecular weight decrease of PCL during sintering. CI of sintered samples showed that the polysaccharide phase was homogeneously dispersed within the PCL matrix, with the only exception being the PCL/D <b>blend.</b> The contact <b>angle</b> analysis showed that all samples were hydrophilic.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to characterise the {{miscibility}} of several poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), EVA, based polymer blends. EVA has many industrial applications and is often present as one of several polymeric components. Consequently, there is considerable interest in the thermodynamics of these blend systems. The thermodynamics of these blends was studied using several techniques: differential scanning calorimetry; phase contrast optical microscopy; small angle neutron scattering and wide angle X-ray scattering. Characterisation was also to include assessing the relative enthalpic and entropic thermodynamic contributions to the Rory-Huggins interaction parameter (%) of these blends. To determine the enthalpic interaction parameter, a "mixing calorimeter" was designed and constructed to measure accurately the "heat of mixing" values on blending these polymers. Free energy interaction parameters were determined from melting point depression and small angle neutron scattering measurements. In all the blends studied, the heat of mixing was endothermic and consequently, the enthalpic interaction parameters were positive i. e. unfavourable to miscibility. Miscibility in these blends can therefore only be achieved by a dominant entropic contribution, favourable to miscibility. Using phase contrast optical microscopy, both miscible and immiscible phase behaviour was observed in this series of blends. This shows good agreement with predictions of miscibility from heat of mixing, melting point and small angle neutron scattering measurements, based on the classical Flory-Huggins lattice theory. Wide angle X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetry results have associated miscible blends with crystallisation effects between the <b>blend</b> components. Small <b>angle</b> neutron scattering has been used to determine the concentration and temperature dependence of interaction parameters in a miscible blend. From these values the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) of the blend was predicted.

It was concluded that the classical Flory-Huggins lattice theory (despite its many well documented Limitations) appears to be particularly suited to the thermodynamic characterisation of miscibility in these polymer blends...|$|R

Also, the pure unmodified milk fat, {{and the soft}} (SBF 23), medium (SBF 27) and hard (SBF 42) fractions of the same were transformed into powder by spray chilling the molten samples. The effect of chilling with air and nitrogen was investigated. The powders were satisfactorily stable at 5 °C, but were relatively unstable at ambient temperatures. The powders' particle size distributions ranged from 4. 44 to 215. 56 μm. The powder characteristics were influenced {{by the size of}} the nozzle, the atomising gas pressure, the chilling temperature, the feed flow rate, and to a lesser extent, the feed temperature. The shelf life of the unmodified milk fat powders stored at 20 °C, 5 °C and - 10 °C was assessed. The powders chilled with air had excessively oxidised after one month of storage at all the temperatures, whereas powders processed with nitrogen were still usable after the same period of storage. Lower peroxide values were recorded for the powders stored at - 10 °C and 5 °C, while significantly higher values were obtained for the samples stored at 20 °C. The powdered fats dry-blended successfully with skim milk and calcium caseinate powders at the ambient temperature. In comparison, the hard fraction mixed better than the other softer fractions.
