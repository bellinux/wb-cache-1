50|$|A {{sedimentary}} deposit may {{have experienced a}} mixing of noncontemporaneous remains within single sedimentary units via physical or biological processes; i.e. a deposit could be ripped up and redeposited elsewhere, meaning that a deposit may contain {{a large amount of}} fossils from another place (an allochthonous deposit, as opposed to the usual autochthonous). Thus, a question that is often asked of fossil deposits is to what extent does the fossil deposit record the true biota that originally lived there? Many fossils are obviously autochthonous, such as rooted fossils like crinoids, and many fossils are intrisically obviously allocthonous, such as the presence of photoautotrophic plankton in a <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> that must have sunk to be deposited. A fossil deposit may thus become biased towards exotic species (i.e. species not endemic to that area) when the sedimentology is dominated by gravity driven surges, such as mudslides, or may become biased if there is very little endemic organisms to be preserved. This is a particular problem in palynology.|$|E
30|$|Due {{to their}} low size, {{microplastics}} are ingested {{by a variety}} of species ranging from protozoans to marine mammals [7, 75, 143, 144]. Their uptake depends on properties such as size, shape, density and colour. For instance, low-density (i.e. buoyant) microplastics are ingested by pelagic filter feeders, high-density microplastics by <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> feeders [7, 132, 145]. Many filter feeding and deposit feeding organisms are indiscriminate feeders: they capture food of a suitable size without further selection [9]. The following four sections provide an overview of uptake, translocation within the body, excretion and trophic transfer of microplastics as investigated in laboratory studies with aquatic organisms. Afterwards, field studies with aquatic organisms and studies with terrestrial organisms are discussed.|$|E
40|$|The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a topographically complex {{feature in}} the North Atlantic Ocean with little {{exploration}} of benthic fauna except in association with hydrothermal venting, resulting in the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the MAR benthos away from these sites remaining largely unknown. Stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur were undertaken on fauna collected {{north and south of}} the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone, in areas believed to be devoid of hydrothermal venting, to investigate the trophodynamics of the benthic assemblage. δ 13 C and δ 34 S values of the benthic and bentho-pelagic fauna indicated a dependence on photosynthetic primary production, with no influence from an unknown chemosynthetic source. A large trophic discrimination in δ 13 C between consumers and potential food sources (particulate organic matter and surficial sediments) suggested reworking of organic carbon before assimilation by benthic fauna. Interpretation of sediment δ 15 N values was difficult as these ranged between − 0. 74 and 23. 14 ‰, suggesting further work is required to understand nitrogen utilisation by <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> feeders. Differences in trophic guilds (predators, predator–scavenger, surface deposit feeders, subsurface deposit feeders and suspension feeders) were evident for δ 13 C and δ 15 N, with the main difference between the mobile predators–scavengers and the <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> feeders. Dividing the assemblage based on trophic guilds into food chains dependent on phytodetritus (deposit and suspension feeders) and predation–scavenging (fishes and crustaceans) resulted in strong positive correlations between δ 15 N and δ 13 C at both stations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the quantity and distribution of bark debris resulting from log rafting. Three distinct problems were studied: (I) the quantity of bark dislodged from the logs while being placed in the rivers and during transport in log rafts; (2) the percentage of the bark that sinks as a function of time; and (3) the amount of bark and debris in existing <b>benthic</b> <b>deposits.</b> Two major areas were studied covering both fresh and salt water: the Klamath River in South-Central Oregon and the Yaquina River estuary near Newport in Western Oregon. The logs stored in the Klamath River consisted primarily of ponderosa pine, and those in the Yaquina estuary were primarily Douglas fir. Studies by several authors listed high chemical oxygen demands and low dissolved oxygen contents in waters used for the storage of logs. Fish kills have been noted from bark deposits in lakes and streams. Photographic measurements of logs were used to determine the percentage of bark dislodged. For Douglas fir logs approximately 17 percent of the bark is dislodged during unloading and 5 percent during raft transport, for a total of 22 percent. Comparatively, the total for ponderosa pine was only 6 percent. Flotation studies showed a total of 10 percent sinkage in water within one day and 75 percent in two months, regardless of the species. The pine bark sank at a faster rate as compared to the fir bark; primarily due to the smaller size of the pine bark. Core samples were taken in areas free of log rafting, in areas of log raft storage and in areas of log dumping {{to determine the extent of}} bark debris in the <b>benthic</b> <b>deposits.</b> Samples consisting of primarily deposited bark had a volatile solids content of about 15 pounds per cubic foot. The average increase in volatile solids content in the log storage areas as compared to the control samples was approximately two pounds of volatile solids per cubic foot. For the log dumping areas this average increase ranged from 0. 5 to 15 pounds of volatile solids per cubic foot. The results of this study indicate clearly that large amounts of bark are added to the water courses used for log storage and that large amounts of bark debris presently exist in the <b>benthic</b> <b>deposits</b> of these water courses...|$|R
40|$|A feeding {{model for}} a generalized, <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> feeder is derived from a filter-feeding model and used to predict how such a deposit feeder would adjust its feeding to {{maximize}} its net energy gain. Under the assumption that deposit feeders are utilizing the bacterial fraction of the sediment or other surface organic coatings as food, the model predicts that the smallest particles should always be ingested, while the selection of larger particles depends on several parameters, including gut passage time and assimilation efficiency of the deposit feeder. The model also predicts relationships among particle size selection, assimilation ef-ficiency, gut passage time, gut volume, and particle rejection costs. Empirical investigations of marine de-posit feeding have suggested several generalizations. Rather than using non-living organic matter directly, most de-posit feeders digest the microbial epi-growth of particles (e. g. Fenchel 1970...|$|E

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured in Western Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf sediments, porewater, and benthic biota. Concentrations and fluxes in sediments decreased sharply {{away from the}} tip of the peninsula toward its interior. Sedimentary PCB fluxes were an order of magnitude lower than reported elsewhere, supporting the notion of a pristiner Antarctic environment. Hexa-chlorinated biphenyls dominated (40 – 100 %) the PCB profiles in the sediments, while trichlorinated biphenyl 28 was the most abundant PCB congener in the porewater. PCB and OCP concentrations in holothurians were comparable to concentrations in other low trophic level biota in the Antarctic food web (i. e., krill). The partitioning of PCBs and OCPs between the sediments and porewater can be explained by a dual-mode model, which included both organic carbon and black carbon as partitioning media. Alternatively, a simpler one-parameter prediction assuming coal tar-like organic carbon performed equally well in explaining porewater concentrations The majorities of PCBs (63 – 94 %) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula sediments were bound to black carbon or recalcitrant tar-like organic carbon, thereby lowering porewater concentrations.

Lower trophic level fauna are important conduits of MeHg from sediment {{and water to}} estuarine and coastal fish harvested for human consumption. However, the sources and pathways of MeHg to these coastal fisheries are poorly known particularly the potential for transfer of MeHg from the sediment to biotic compartments. Across a broad gradient of human land impacts, we analyzed MeHg concentrations in food webs at ten estuarine sites in the Northeast US (from the Hackensack Meadowlands, NJ to the Gulf of Maine). MeHg concentrations in water column particulate material, but not in sediments, were predictive of MeHg concentrations in fish (killifish and Atlantic silversides). Moreover, MeHg concentrations were higher in pelagic fauna than in benthic-feeding fauna suggesting that MeHg delivery to the water column from methylation sites from within or outside of the estuary {{may be an important}} driver of MeHg bioaccumulation in estuarine pelagic food webs. In contrast, bulk sediment MeHg concentrations were only predictive of concentrations of MeHg in the infaunal worms. Our results across a broad gradient of sites demonstrate that the pathways of MeHg to lower trophic level estuarine organisms are distinctly different between <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> feeders and forage fish.

However, current mathematical models of bioturbation do not explicitly link rates of particle mixing with realistic biological reworking mechanisms. To address this problem, I present a transition-matrix model of bioturbation that quantitatively links the reworking activities of individual organisms and community-level particlemixing rates. Solutions to the model are presented for two kinds of tracers; particle-reactive radionuclides with a constant input flux and conservative tracers added to the sediment as a pulse. The model was used to predict the vertical profiles of excess 234 Th and 210 Pb in the field. The model parameters were determined from benthic community-structure data. Model predictions were then compared to measured profiles of these tracers. On the basis of this comparison, I inferred that maldanid polychaetes at the study site were collecting sediment at the sedimentwater interface and depositing it at depth. This transport mechanism had a large effect on the predicted tracer profiles. A sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that deposit feeding by the two most abundant species, Mediomastus ambiseta and Nucula annulata, was the most important process determining the burial rate of the tracers. The model results also indicated that the combined effects of deposit feeding and sedimentation were sufficient to determine the vertical distributions of excess 234 Th and 210 Pb at the study site...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the general}} paucity of {{integrated}} information on offshore benthic communities in the Adriatic Sea and given the vulnerability of this particular coastal system, microphytobenthos, meiofauna and macrofauna were synoptically investigated {{in front of the}} Emilia-Romagna coast (northern Adriatic Sea) in September 2010 and March 2011. As required by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which extends its action beyond the territorial waters (within 12 nmi) of the Member States, our findings could help to fill the gap of knowledge on the environmental status in offshore areas since the study was carried out also at > 12 nmi from the coastline. In fact, sediment samples for the analysis of the benthic communities were collected from a 10 -point-station grid that covered an area of about 400 km 2 with water depths ranging from 13 to 50 m. The variability of the sediment grain size and other chemical variables in the sediment suggests the presence of two distinct environmental contexts that enhance the proliferation of different benthic communities. At the inshore stations (depth 20 m) had muddier sediments, which likely exerted a greater retention of sediment-bound organic matter. These conditions seemed to favour <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> feeders like meio- and macrofaunal annelids. Surprisingly, a conspicuous microphytobenthic community, mainly represented by the diatom Paralia sulcata, has been observed even at remarkable depths (~ 50 m) opening new questions regarding the role of these organisms in dim-light conditions. Although the investigated benthic communities were, to some extent, moderately influenced by multiple stressors, the co-existence of sensitive taxa (such as meiofaunal copepods and the amphipod Ampelisca spp.) with opportunistic ones (i. e., C. gibba) suggests that the benthic domain in the investigated area is not severely impacted. </p...|$|E

The maximum possible list of benthic macroalgae species has been compiled in accordance with modern concepts of these groups systematics. According to the obtained results the flora of the Barents Sea consists of 178 species: 74 – red, 70 – brown, and 34 – green seaweeds. The algae diversity of the Murman coast is the highest one with 153 species, while the diversity of seaweeds of the Arctic areas coast is much poorer, i. e. the southeastern part of the sea – 64 species, Arctic archipelagos of Franz-Joseph Land – 60 species and Novaya Zemlya – 41 species. On Svalbard, the main species diversity of algae is confined to the western coast; whereas there are only 39 species of seaweeds on the Barents Sea coast. The light diving gear has been used for hydrobotanical methods with sample areas.

The green filamentous macroalga Chlorodesmis fastigiata significantly reduced tissue recovery in A. pulchra, but not in A. aspera. It led to the infection of A. pulchra with ciliates. The brown seaweed, Lobophora variegata, the encrusting coralline alga Porolithon (= Hydrolithon) onkodes, and turf algae, had only minor effects on coral recovery.

40|$|Remote open oceans were {{traditionally}} {{considered as}} sinks of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) such as industrial chemicals (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). In the context of reduced primary emissions as well as global warming, previous polluted reservoirs such as soil, large water bodies, and glaciers may act as secondary sources returning these POPs back to the atmosphere and ocean. It was also hypothesized that biogeochemical activities associated with phytoplankton {{in the water column}} would lead to the coupling of air-plankton systems to draw down the lipophilic POPs from the overlying atmosphere, similar to the biological pump taking up CO 2 from the atmosphere during phytoplankton blooms and then depositing it to the deep ocean. It has been found that POPs accumulate to high levels in apex predators such as whales and polar bears. To fully understand how POPs biomagnify along the food web, it is important to quantify the transfer of POPs from environmental media (sediments and water) to the base of food webs. This dissertation research was conducted in three remote oceans to verify these hypotheses. 1) In the first study, air and water samples were collected simultaneously on R/V Revelle during a scientific cruise in the N. and S. Pacific for POPs analysis. Results suggest that the Pacific was acting as a secondary source returning PCBs back to the air. This was the first work documenting the open ocean as a secondary PCB source. In contrast, this study showed gas exchange hexachlorobenzene of (HCB) was at steady-state between the air and ocean with no net transfer of HCB. 2) In the second study, air, water, and zooplankton samples (copepod Calanus) were collected simultaneously during the North Atlantic Bloom (NAB) in 2008 in a relatively small area south of Iceland. The POPs measurement showed dissolved phase concentrations of lipophilic OCP remained constant with time as the bloom evolved. Also, the OCPs were not being drawn from air to water during the main bloom as previous studies have hypothesized. Further our data and data from prior Arctic measurements suggested that the Arctic was a source of higher concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and both the atmospheric (polar easterlies) as well as oceanic transport (East Greenland Current) would bring HCHs to the lower latitudes. Last, the measurements indicated that equilibrium partitioning governed the transfer of POPs from water into Calanus. To explore the measurements further, a box model was developed and used to investigate the fate of POPs during the bloom. Biogeochemical processes considered included air-water exchange, partitioning to particulate organic carbon (POC), removal by sinking POC, and biogeochemical degradation. Modeling results demonstrated that partitioning to POC was the dominant process determining the fate of OCPs in the NAB 2008. 3) In a final study, sediments and benthic biota were collected along the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research grids. For the first time, POPs concentrations in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) continental shelf sediments, porewater, and <b>benthic</b> <b>deposit</b> feeding holothurians were determined. High concentrations of POPs were found in close vicinity to major scientific research stations. Concentrations decreased sharply away from the locations with anthropogenic activity. This suggested that local activities were the dominant source of POPs in the WAP rather than long range transport by atmospheric and oceanic motion. The Westerlies and Antarctic Circumpolar Current may have acted as dynamical barriers to transports from the southern continents. The majority of POPs in the WAP sediments was bound to black carbon and was not available for uptake by benthic biota. POPs in the holothurians were in equilibrium with those in the porewater. Different bioaccumulation factors obtained suggestd that there were differences in lipids of the different benthos and in situ contamination patterns. ...|$|E

The succession rests unconformably on the deep-water sediments of allochthonous Ligurian units and is represented by up to 350 m thick carbonates and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate rocks. Two main units are recognized, each characterized by a distinct facies association. The basal unit (upper Burdigalian) consists of rhodalgal rudstones and packstones of shelf environment, dominated by echinoids, bryozoans, coralline algae and <b>benthic</b> foraminifera, <b>deposited</b> in temperate conditions and showing a transgressive pattern. It gradually passes into mixed carbonate-siliciclastic shallow water-facies, (Langhian in age) characterized {{by an increase in}} terrigenous components and planktonic and benthic taxa. Sediment starvation during the Langhian is suggested by the occurrence of glaucony-rich packstones with abundant planktonic foraminifera. The succession grades upwards into upper Langhian-lower Serravallian planktonic foraminifera-rich marls. Increasing detrital discharge and water depth up section result in drowning of the carbonate shelf. Debris-flow deposits including material of extraformational origin are intercalated at different levels, in particular from the uplifting south-western margins, close to the Ligurian thrusts. The inception and demise of these temperate rhodalgal-foramol carbonate sediments located in a wedge-top Epiligurian basins is primarily controlled by synsedimentary tectonics, which in turn affects relative sea-level rise, and nutrient and detrital input. In particular, tectonics controlled the initial stage of the transgression, determining the configuration of the basin, subdivided in narrow submerged palaeotopographic lows and relatively elevated areas. Synsedimentary tectonics related to the thrust migration was also the main controlling factor in the demise of carbonate sedimentation, through the combined effect of two processes: increasing the subsidence of the basin, and triggering the terrigenous discharge from the erosion of the uplifted Apenninic relieve...|$|R

Populations of the fossorial ghost shrimp Callianassa kraussi, the bentho-pelagic amphipod Grandidierella lignorum and the epifaunal crab Hymenosomia orbiculare together account for 96 % of total benthic biomass in the upper regions of this estuary.

In the benthic consumer community of the upper Gamtoos estuary, suspension feeders make up 98 % of biomass and thus clearly dominate over deposit feeders.

40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to examine marine food webs since the 1980 s and has become a valuable tool for studying carbon sources and trophic structures in benthic food chains in the Arctic. Prior to the present study, no one has used stabile isotope analysis to test for a difference in the main carbon source or trophic structure along a depth gradient in the Arctic. Carbon sources (pelagic POM, sediment POM and macroalgae) and consumers (<b>benthic</b> filter feeders, <b>deposit</b> feeders, grazers, scavengers and predators and grazing zooplankton) were collected from Isfjorden, Svalbard, at depths ranging from 0 – 400 m. There was a big overlap in both δ 13 C and δ 15 N for most of the carbon sources sampled, making it difficult to identify one single food source to any of the depths. Most benthic primary consumers (filter-feeding bivalves and grazers) were enriched in δ 13 C relative to pelagic POM, sediment POM and the brown algae Chorda filum at all depths. Most primary consumers fell in between the fractionation rates of the two groups of brown algae (filter-feeding bivalves), or were enriched in δ 13 C relative to the isotopically lightest carbon source sampled in this study (grazers). This suggests that a) a mixture of multiple carbon sources constitute the diets of most primary consumers, and possibly the entire benthic food web, and b) the benthic primary consumers utilize one or more carbon sources not sampled in this study. The δ 15 N among primary consumers varied somewhat between stations, but this was not reflected higher up in the food chain. The biggest difference in δ 15 N was found for the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus sp., which is likely caused by different feeding strategies among specimens inhabiting shallow and deep waters...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{radiocarbon}} and tephra-dated sediment core from Lifebuoy Lake, {{located on}} the north-east coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, was analysed for pollen, spores, diatoms, chironomids and tephra in order to uncover regional environmental history. The 6500 -year environmental history of Lifebuoy Lake correlates with the broad regional patterns of vegetation development and climate dynamics with both diatoms and chironomids showing near-synchronous changes. Between ca. 6300 and 3900 calyrBP, the lake ecosystem was naturally enriched, with several Stephanodiscus species dominating the diatom plankton. This natural eutrophication state {{is likely to be}} due to a combination of the base-rich catchment geology, the fertilisation effect of several fires in the catchment, silica input from tephra layers and, possibly, nitrogen input from seabirds. The substantial tephra deposit at about 3850 calyrBP might have stopped sedimentary phosphorus from entering the lake water thus decreasing the trophic state of the lake and facilitating the shift in diatom composition to a benthic Fragiliariaceae complex. Both diatoms and chironomids showed simultaneous compositional changes, which are also reflected by statistically significant changes in their rates of change 300 – 400 years after the arrival of Pinus pumila in the lake catchment. The rapid increase in both total diatom concentration and the percentage abundance of the large heavy species, Aulacoseira subarctica might be a response to the change in timing and intensity of lake spring turn-over due to the changes in the patterns of North Pacific atmospheric circulation, most notably westward shift of the Aleutian Low. The two highest peaks in A. subarctica abundance at Lifebouy Lake occurred during opposite summer temperature inferences: the earlier peak (3500 – 2900 calyrBP) coincided with warm summers and the latter peak (300 calyrBP–present) occurred during the cold summer period. These imply that A. subarctica shows no direct response to the changes of summer air temperature. Instead, it appears to thrive during the periods of increased winter precipitation, thicker ice and late spring turn-over periods, i. e., shows indirect response to climate. The clearest effect of tephra deposition on the lake ecosystem is above 908 cm (ca. 3800 calyrBP) where the tephra deposit might have caused the shift from Stephanodiscus-dominated planktonic assemblages to the Fragilariaceae complex of <b>benthic</b> species. Tephra <b>deposits</b> might have also contributed towards the development of eutrophic plankton from about 6300 calyrBP.

40|$|Microbialites (<b>benthic</b> {{microbial}} carbonate <b>deposits)</b> {{were discovered}} in a hypersaline alkaline lake on Eleuthera Island (Bahamas). From the edge towards {{the centre of the}} lake, four main zones of precipitation could be distinguished: (1) millimetre-sized clumps of Mg-calcite on a thin microbial mat; (2) thicker and continuous carbonate crusts with columnar morphologies; (3) isolated patches of carbonate crust separated by a dark non-calcified gelatinous mat; and (4) a dark microbial mat without precipitation. In thin section, the precipitate displayed a micropeloidal structure characterized by micritic micropeloids (strong autofluorescence) surrounded by microspar and spar cement (no fluorescence). Observations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with a cryotransfer system indicate that micrite nucleation is initiated within a polymer biofilm that embeds microbial communities. These extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are progressively replaced with high-Mg calcite. Discontinuous EPS calcification generates a micropeloidal structure of the micrite, possibly resulting from the presence of clusters of coccoid or remnants of filamentous bacteria. At high magnification, the microstructure of the initial precipitate consists of 200 – 500 nm spheres. No precipitation is observed in or on the sheaths of cyanobacteria, and only a negligible amount of precipitation is directly associated with the well-organized and active filamentous cyanobacteria (in deeper layers of the mat), indicating that carbonate precipitation is not associated with CO 2 uptake during photosynthesis. Instead, the precipitation occurs at the uppermost layer of the mat, which is composed of EPS, empty filamentous bacteria and coccoids (Gloeocapsa spp.). Two-dimensional mapping of sulphate reduction shows high activity in close association with the carbonate precipitate {{at the top of the}} microbial mat. In combination, these findings suggest that net precipitation of calcium carbonate results from a temporal and spatial decoupling of the various microbial metabolic processes responsible for CaCO 3 precipitation and dissolution. Theoretically, partial degradation of EPS by aerobic heterotrophs or UV fuels sulphate-reducing activity, which increases alkalinity in microdomains, inducing CaCO 3 precipitation. This degradation could also be responsible for EPS decarboxylation, which eliminates Ca 2 + -binding capacity of the EPS and releases Ca 2 + ions that were originally bound by carboxyl groups. At the end of these processes, the EPS biofilm is calcified and exhibits a micritic micropeloidal structure. The EPS-free precipitate subsequently serves as a substrate for physico-chemical precipitation of spar cement from the alkaline water of the lake. The micropeloidal structure has an intimate mixture of micrite and microspar comparable to microstructures of some fossil microbialites...|$|R

40|$|The Upper Cretaceous {{succession}} in the SE Zagros (Bandar Abbas area) {{is characterized}} by marked changes in fades and thickness. These changes relate to sediment deposition in a foreland basin along the NE margin of the Arabian plate. The succession was measured at eight outcrop sections in the Khush, Faraghun, Gahkum, Genow and Khamir anticlines. The measured sections illustrate a transition from shallow-water carbonate platform deposits (Cenomanian to Coniacian) to deep-water fades (Santonian to Maastrichtian). Outcrop observations were compared to data from ten off- and onshore wells and {{to a series of}} seismic profiles. Four cross-sections were constructed using well and outcrop data and illustrate fades and thickness variations within the Upper Cretaceous. Based on these regional profiles, the Late Cretaceous depositional history of the Bandar Abbas area was reconstructed and can be divided into two tectono-sedimentary phases suggesting a transition from a passive to an active margin. Sedimentation during Phase I (late Albion to Coniacian) took place in shallow-water carbonate platform and intrashelf basin settings (Sarvak Formation), and four third-order sequences can be recognised. The uppermost sequence is locally capped by fresh-water, pisolith-bearing carbonate sand and conglomerates with local laterite and palaeosols of the Coniacian Laffan Formation. Shallow-water facies consist mainly of wackestone to packstones with abundant <b>benthic</b> foraminifera. Sediments <b>deposited</b> in intrashelf basins are dominated by oligosteginid-bearing fades. Eustatic variations in sea level, the creation of a foreland basin and salt tectonics most probably controlled patterns of sedimentation during this phase. During the second tectono-sedimentary phase (Phase II: Santonian to Late Maastrichtian), sediments were dominated by pelagic marls and gravity flow deposits. Lateral thickness variations become more marked to the NE as a result of obduction processes and the creation of the foreland basin. Allochthonous ophiolitic and radiolarite-bearing units are common {{in the northern part of}} the Fars region but are restricted to a few localities in the Bandar Abbas area. Traces of allochthonous materials occur in the SE-most part of the Khush anticline; thrust slices in offshore seismic profiles may link to the Hawasina nappes of Oman. At the top of the Phase II succession, pelagic facies locally interfinger with Omphalocyclus and Loftusia-bearing fades (Tarbur Formation) and evaporites (Sachun Formation). These deposits are overlain by slumped and dolomitized shallow-water carbonates of the Paleocene - Eocene Jahrum Formation. The sedimentary sequence in the Bandar Abbas area illustrates a far-field response to Late Cretaceous obduction processes and foreland basin development, as well as to halokinetic activity. Rapid variations in thickness and fades document the evolution of depositional processes in the foreland basin. © 2011 The Authors. Journal of Petroleum Geology © 2011 Scientific Press Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategies of}} marine invertebrates have {{been related to}} various aspects of both their ecology, and their phylogenetic history. It has been {{the purpose of this}} thesis to try and separate these components among Siphonaria, a group of marine pulmonates. The taxonomy of these species is revised and I conclude that nine species are valid. All species <b>deposit</b> <b>benthic</b> egg masses and development may be either direct (S. anneae, S. compressa, S. dayi, S. nigerrima, S. serrata and S. tenuicostulata) or planktonic (S. capensis, S. concinna and S. oculus). Data on distribution and life-history relating to mode of larval development is then presented for 26 species of Siphonaria worldwide. Fifteen species are direct developers, nine are planktonic developers and a further two appear to have a dual developmental capacity, retaining both the velar swimming apparatus of a planktonic developer and the crawling foot of a direct developer. Direct developing species hatch from larger egg capsules, and generally occur higher on the shore than planktonic developers. Worldwide, planktonic developers are more widespread than direct developers, and individual planktonic species may have a greater latitudinal range. In most S~honaria subgenera, mode of larval development appears to be constant, although two subgenera (Patel/opsis and Sacculosiphonaria) include both developmental types. Locally, the intertidal zonation of three sympatric species (S. capensis, S. concinna and S. serrata) does not support a model which predicts direct development on the high shore and planktonic development on the low shore. However, distributions do correspond to particular intertidal microhabitats, and while there may be no, direct relationship between mode of larval development and intertidal height, the physical structure of egg masses, and the microhabitats used for spawning appear adaptive with regards to desiccation in the intertidal. S. concinna (planktonic development) and S. serrata (direct development) occur in similar microhabitats and are likely to be under similar selection pressures. In having different modes of larval development, there appears to be more than one optimal solution in a particular selective regime. In addition, both species seem to apportion similar amounts of energy to reproduction for each spawning episode, and also annually suggesting an optimum allocation of resources to reproduction. Genetic investigations using PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) confirm the status of the southern African species initially described, and indicate greater genetic variability associated with planktonic developing species than direct developing species. The systematic relationships revealed by DNA fingerprinting support the current classification systems, and also have implications with regards the evolution of larval development: direct development may be the plesiomorphic condition in, and among, some Siphonaria groups. There are both phylogenetic and adaptive explanations for the distribution of reproductive mode among benthic marine invertebrates. An evolutionary question, however, {{is not just a matter}} of either adaptation or constraint, it is a combination of these. Both contribute to the distribution of developmental mode among Siphonaria...|$|R
40|$|Global {{change is}} {{increasingly}} impacting coastal marine systems. Organisms inhabiting the intertidal zone {{may be especially}} vulnerable to additional anthropogenic influences, which augment the naturally stressful, highly variable conditions {{to which they are}} already subjected and may lead to the manifestation of artificially severe carry-over effects (COEs). In marine invertebrates with complex life histories, COEs can occur between life stages, when the conditions experienced by one stage influence the characteristics or performance of the next, as well as trans-generationally, in which case the environment experienced by a parental generation affects offspring. Most of the existing literature surrounding COEs focuses only on those between life stages or generations, seldom both simultaneously, and do so with the implementation of only a single stressor. In nature however, organisms may be affected by both forms of COE, since the presence of one does not preclude the other, and are invariably subjected to multiple co-occurring stressors that can interact in complex ways. Consequently, how trans-generational COEs might impact the propagation of stress through offspring life stages remains unclear, and how these processes operate in a global change context is little understood. It was here aimed to elucidate the role of COEs under ongoing global change by addressing these common literature imitations and taking the novel approach of examining how the effects of multiple, global change-associated stressors carry-over from a parental generation through their offspring’s life stages in order to provide a more realistic representation of the conditions under which COEs manifest in the field. This was done using Siphonaria australis, an intertidal pulmonate limpet that <b>deposits</b> <b>benthic</b> egg masses, from which hatch planktonic veliger larvae. Adult S. australis were subjected to one of four treatments for 4 h/day over four weeks to induce trans-generational COEs: a no-stress control, a pollution treatment with added copper (5. 0 μg/L), a “climate change” treatment with elevated temperature (25 °C) and UVR (1. 7 W/m 2), and a full global change treatment incorporating all three stressors. At the end of this period, the egg masses laid under each of these adult treatments were subjected to further experimentation for two weeks by being redistributed among the same four treatments again, so as to produce 16 unique treatment histories of adult-to-egg mass stress. Of these, 11 provided successfully hatching larvae, which were reared and observed for COEs between life stages (from egg to larva) under ambient conditions (ie. no added stressors) for 27 days. In adult S. australis survivor size, the size of egg masses laid and the size of individual eggs varied in complex ways over time and across treatments, while the number of survivors was unaffected by stress. Egg masses were unaffected in terms of hatching time but displayed strong responses to parental and developmental stress exposure through hatching success, and the percentage of viable eggs per egg mass, with the latter clearly declining according to adult treatment severity and both showing trans-generational COEs. Larval characteristics were extremely varied across treatment histories and highly context-dependent as hatching size, size reached by 27 days, growth rate, and size at death all showed evidence of COEs between generations and life stages, as well as interaction between both types of COE, with the number of survivors again being the only unaffected response variable. Overall, trans-generational COEs were slightly more common than those between life stages. These results show that both forms of COE, each triggered by exposure to multiple stressors in progenitors and developmental stages, interact to form highly context-dependent legacies of mostly impaired performance in S. australis larvae. This implies that COEs may become more prominent with worsening stressors in the future and suggests that the role of COEs in the persistence of marine invertebrates under ongoing global change may so far have been underestimated by the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{prospecting}} for pharmaceuticals {{in natural}} organisms (bioprospecting) {{can be used}} as a tool for the conservation of biological diversity. However, bioprospecting can only be considered compatible with conservation if it is conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner. In order to prevent the overcollection of vulnerable organisms it is essential to gain an understanding of the local distribution and abundance of the target organisms. In this study, the egg masses of intertidal molluscs were targeted as a novel source of biologically active compounds. Surveys of the molluscan fauna were conducted on 13 intertidal reefs along the Wollongong Coast, New South Wales, Australia. In total, 161 species of intertidal molluscs were found and the benthic egg masses from 47 species were identified. Only 31 % of these molluscs have been previously recorded from intertidal surveys in the region and 66 % of the species may be regarded as regionally rare. Repeated surveys of the 13 reefs revealed that the species diversity recorded in a single inventory was representative of the cumulative diversity detected. ‘Hotspots’ of molluscan diversity were found on the northern side of two large headlands (Bass Point and Bellambi Point), which are characterised by a high habitat complexity and shelter from strong wave action. Three selective pressures could potentially lead to the evolution of chemical defence in molluscan egg masses: predation, disease and surface fouling. Marine molluscs may rely on a range of alternative strategies to protect their egg masses from predators, including physical protection in leathery egg capsules, camouflage and rapid embryonic development, as well as behavioural mechanisms, such as brooding and the deposition of large aggregated egg masses. Predator feeding trials provided evidence of chemical defence in five out of eight species that were tested. On the other hand, observational studies provided no evidence to suggest that molluscan egg masses are chemically defended against surface fouling by macroorganisms. A range of macrophytes and epizooites were observed on the surface of both gelatinous egg masses and leathery egg capsules. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of fouling was low, probably because of their ephemeral nature and the fact that most molluscs deposit egg masses on the underside of boulders. Disease appears to be a significant selective pressure leading to the evolution of chemical defence in molluscan egg masses. Two assays were used to screen the egg masses of marine molluscs for antimicrobial activity against human and marine pathogens; a modified version of the traditional Zone of Inhibition assay and the Fluorescein Diacetate assay. These two assays have small sample requirements and thus it was possible to screen the egg masses of 42 molluscs and four polychaetes. Antimicrobial activity against at least one human pathogen was found in the egg masses of 36 species, including two polychaetes and a wide range of molluscs. The egg masses from a number of species clearly lose activity during embryonic development. The antimicrobial activity also appears to be greater in the internal matrix, rather than on the outer surfaces of molluscan egg masses. Surface bacteria could be responsible for the observed activity in some species but are unlikely to be the source of antimicrobial agents in leathery egg capsules, or the gelatinous egg ribbons of Aplysia spp. The egg masses of Dicathais orbita and Aplysia juliana were found to inhibit ecologically significant marine bacteria, as well as Gram negative and Gram positive human pathogenic bacteria and the yeast Candida albicans. The compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity in the egg masses of the common muricid Dicathais orbita were isolated using bioassay-guided fractionation. These were then identified by mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three antimicrobial compounds were characterised (tyrindoleninone, tyriverdin and 6 -bromoisatin) and these are all known precursors to the ancient dye Tyrian Purple. Tyrindoleninone is the most abundant volatile organic compound found in the fresh eggs and this compound was shown to be toxic to bacteria at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. As the eggs develop, most of the tyrindoleninone is converted into tyriverdin, which was found to be effectively bacteriostatic at 0. 5 µg/ml but was not cytotoxic at 1 mg/ml. This compound is considered to be a useful new drug lead. The 6 -bromoisatin, which is likely to be an oxidative artefact derived from the other precursors, exhibited mild cytolytic activity against a range of bacteria. As the larvae began hatching, most of the tyriverdin was converted into Tyrian Purple in the egg masses. Tyrian Purple did not exhibit any significant antimicrobial activity, although it is highly insoluble in aqueous media. Nevertheless, these studies provide evidence for a chemical ripening process in the egg masses of Dicathais orbita, which may provide a means of avoiding autotoxicity to the larvae during hatching. Extracts from the egg masses of 23 molluscs were then examined for the precursors of Tyrian Purple, as well as other potential antimicrobial agents, using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. The egg masses from six species of Muricidae were found to contain the precursors of Tyrian Purple. However, these compounds were not found in the egg masses of species from any other family. A range of other related indoles, as well as di- and tribromoimidazoles/pyrazoles were also found in the egg masses of the Muricidae. Most of these compounds have not been previously described from a natural source and they could all contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity in the muricid egg masses. The egg masses of the Aplysiidae were found to contain some bioactive polychlorinated hydrocarbons and a range of long chain unsaturated fatty acids. Halogenated compounds were not found in the egg masses of any other species, although fatty acids could be partly responsible for the observed antimicrobial activity in most of the gelatinous egg masses. A high diversity of volatile organic compounds was found in the molluscan egg masses, but further work is required to identify the active components. Clearly, bioprospecting can contribute to conservation through the development of comprehensive species inventories. Bioprospecting can be conducted with minimal impact on the environment and the discovery of novel bioactive compounds provides an incentive for conservation. All marine molluscs that <b>deposit</b> <b>benthic</b> egg masses have potential pharmaceutical value and therefore an effort should be made to conserve both them and their natural habitats. Bass Point would be an appropriate site for an intertidal protected area in the Wollongong region...|$|R
