25|$|The {{clinical}} presentation among invasive disease is also dominated by skin and soft tissue infections, including a small subset of patients presenting with severe necrotizing fasciitis. Moreover, {{it is an}} important cause of bone and joint infections, and this disease manifestation is reported to be increasing. Less commonly it can present as pneumonia, endocarditis, genital or intraabdominal infections. Primary <b>bacteraemia,</b> infection without identifiable focal origin, comprises approximately 20% of the reported cases.|$|E
25|$|The first pivotal step in {{infectious}} pathogenesis is {{the attachment}} to the host tissues. The M-protein, the most extensively studied SDSE virulence factor, has been documented to facilitate both adherence to and internalization into host cells. Other adhesins have also been described, including the genes gfba, fnB, fbBA, fnBB, lmb and gapC; all mediating binding to fibronectin. gfba was recently shown contribute to bacterial internalization into endothelial cells and intracellular persistence. These properties may explain the tendency of recurrent <b>bacteraemia</b> observed in human SDSE-cases.|$|E
25|$|Without {{access to}} {{appropriate}} antibiotics (principally ceftazidime or meropenem), the septicemic form of melioidosis exceeds 90% in mortality rate. With appropriate antibiotics, {{the mortality rate}} is about 10% for uncomplicated cases but up to 80% for cases with <b>bacteraemia</b> or severe sepsis. It seems certain that access to intensive care facilities is also important, and probably at least partially explains why total mortality is 20% in Northern Australia but 40% in Northeast Thailand. Response to appropriate antibiotic treatment is slow, with the average duration of fever following treatment being 5 to 9 days.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} results of 4, 642 blood cultures taken from 2, 190 patients from 1960 to 1967 in one London hospital. The results suggested that an increased incidence of <b>bacteraemias</b> at this particular hospital was mainly due to {{the increase in the number}} of patients having blood cultures. Some of the <b>bacteraemias</b> were terminal or transient and probably of doubtful clinical significance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bacteraemias</b> during burn wound {{manipulation}} are frequent, especially following burn wound excision. However, these <b>bacteraemias</b> {{seem not}} to have any clinical consequences, and their treatment is therefore controversial. Over a 20 -month period 35 surgical debridement procedures were recorded prospectively in 18 burn patients. Blood culture samples were drawn before, during, and after surgical excision. <b>Bacteraemias</b> were found in ten out of the 35 patients (28 %), and 16 of the 105 blood samples (15 %) were positive. All three blood samples were positive in one case ("primary bacteraemia"), while others were "transient bacteraemia". Six positive blood cultures were considered to be "bacteraemias induced by wound manipulation" and seven "bacteraemias of unknown source". <b>Bacteraemias</b> of unknown source were not recorded at any time while "bacteraemias induced by wound manipulation" were recorded after day 5 post-burn. Patients with more than 40 % TBSA had 4. 3 times more bacteraemic risk than patients with less extensive TBSA. Blood pressure and white blood cell variations were observed in bacteraemic patients but without any clinical relevance. We conclude that bacteraemic rates were high and that there were two different patterns of bacteraemia- both transient and with no clinical relevance...|$|R
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the alimentary tract, genital tract, or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and tonsillitis, to severe necrotising fasciitis and <b>bacteraemia.</b> The incidence of invasive disease has been reported to be rising. Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine mastitis and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) have been most frequently reported.|$|E

40|$|We have {{analysed}} the <b>bacteraemias</b> occurring before {{discharge from}} hospital in patients subjected to open-heart surgery. The overall incidence was 2 Â· 7 %. The predominant organisms at first were staphylococci and streptococci, but in the later years of the study almost all positive blood cultures were due to Gram-negative bacilli. Short-term prophylactic antibiotics were used throughout. Eleven of the 12 Gram-positive <b>bacteraemias</b> occurred after the period of antibiotic prophylaxis; eight of the patients had endocarditis and a further three had serious wound infections. Most of the 32 Gram-negative bacillaemias occurred while antibiotics were being given. Some were transient phenomena in well patients; others were associated with terminal states. Infection was {{a major cause of}} death in four patients, however, and two patients had endocarditis. Serratia, providence, hafnia, and citrobacter were all identified as well as the more usual escherichia, klebsiella, and pseudomonas. We discuss the possible origins and management of these <b>bacteraemias...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{knowledge}} of current epidemiology and resistance patterns {{is crucial to}} the choice of empirical treatment for <b>bacteraemias</b> in haematology and cancer patients. METHODS: A literature review on <b>bacteraemias</b> in cancer patients considered papers published between January 1 st 2005 and July 6 th 2011. Additionally, in 2011, a questionnaire on the aetiology and resistance in <b>bacteraemias,</b> and empirical treatment, was sent to participants of the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) meetings; recipients were from 80 haematology centres. RESULTS: For the literature review, data from 49 manuscripts were analysed. The questionnaire obtained responses from 39 centres in 18 countries. Compared with the published data, the questionnaire reported more recent data, and showed a reduction of the Gram-positive to Gram-negative ratio (55 %: 45 % vs. 60 %: 40 %), increased rates of enterococci (8 % vs. 5 %) and Enterobacteriaceae (30 % vs. 24 %), a decreased rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 % vs. 10 %), and lower resistance rates for all bacteria. Nevertheless the median rates of ESBL-producers (15 - 24 %), aminoglycoside-resistant Gram-negatives (5 - 14 %) and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (5 - 14 %) were substantial, and significantly higher in South-East vs. North-West Europe. CONCLUSIONS: The published epidemiological data on <b>bacteraemias</b> in haematology are scanty and mostly dated. Important differences in aetiology and resistance exist among centres. Updated analyses of the local epidemiology are mandatory to support appropriate empirical therapy...|$|R

After receiving full intensive care support, antibiotics and tumour removal, the patient made a complete recovery and he is at present doing well. This case illustrates that high concentrations of catecholamine secreted by a phaeochromocytoma might cause multiple organ failure syndrome secondary to multiple organism <b>bacteraemias</b> due to transient episodes of intestinal ischaemia...|$|R
30|$|Results: The study covered 34317 patient bed days (16887 pre- and 17430 post-introduction of {{chlorhexidine}} bathing). There were {{an identical}} number of MDRO acquisitions {{in each group}} (290), giving rise to an MDRO acquisition rate per 1000 bed days of 17.17 {{in the control group}} compared to 16.63 in the chlorhexidine group (P[*]=[*] 0.70). CLABSI incidence per 1000 bed days was higher in the control group compared to the chlorhexidine group (9.51 vs 7.90; P[*]=[*] 0.26). The incidence of significant <b>bacteraemias</b> per 1000 bed days was similar in the the two groups (5.57 before and 5.45 during chlorhexidine bathing; P[*]=[*] 0.88), but the incidence of <b>bacteraemias</b> due to skin commensals per 1000 bed days was lower in the chlorhexidine group (7.22 vs 5.45; P[*]=[*] 0.04).|$|R
30|$|Discussion: Community-acquired or {{nosocomial}} KP <b>bacteraemias</b> represent severe infections where resuscitation {{is required}} in half of the cases. This probably explains why {{there is no difference}} in mortality between the two groups. However, it can be assumed that the trend of excess mortality in the KpHM group is not significant due to insufficient sample size.|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{bloodstream}} infections {{was conducted in}} the large regional hospital in Ubon Ratchatani, northeastern Thailand between 1989 and 1998, during {{the onset of the}} HIV epidemic. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella/Enterobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa <b>bacteraemias</b> remained constant whereas infections caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, non-typhoid Salmonellae, Cryptococcus neoformans, Penicillum marneffei {{and to a lesser extent}} Streptococcus pneumoniae all rose. Burkholderia pseudomallei infections were unrelated to HIV, whereas the other infections were associated directly with HIV. Group D non-typhoid Salmonellae bloodstream infections (mainly Salmonella enteritidis) rose coincident with the increase in HIV seroprevalence, and preceded the increase in the other HIV-associated infections. Other non-typhoid Salmonella <b>bacteraemias</b> increased two years after the rise in group D infections, and invasive yeast infections increased four years later, coincident with the increase in AIDS. Increasing Group D non-typhoid Salmonella bloodstream infections are an early warning signal of an impending rise in AIDS...|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: Our {{study shows}} that in a large {{population}} of adults admitted to ICU for SIM, 7.5 % have a community-acquired co-infection, mainly <b>bacteraemias</b> and pulmonary infections. These results emphasize the need to search for co-infection in these patients and make therapeutic adaptations accordingly. Male sex, respiratory distress and acidosis at admission may help to identify patients most at risk.|$|R

5000|$|All Cronobacter species, except C. condimenti, {{have been}} linked {{retrospectively}} to clinical cases of infection in either adults or infants. The majority of Cronobacter cases occur in adults, most often <b>bacteraemia</b> and have not been studied in detail.

[...] Additionally, Cronobacter spp. are associated as causative agents of neonatal <b>bacteraemia,</b> meningitis and necrotising enterocolitis. However, multilocus sequence typing has shown that the majority of neonatal meningitis cases in the past 30 years, across 6 countries have been associated with only one genetic lineage of the species Cronobacter sakazakii called 'Sequence Type 4' or 'ST4', and therefore this clone appears to be of greatest concern with infant infections.|$|E
50|$|Bacteremia (also <b>bacteraemia)</b> is the {{presence}} of bacteria in the blood.

30|$|Conclusions: At our large University Hospital ICU with a {{heterogeneous}} patient population, {{the introduction of}} routine daily chlorhexidine-impregnated cloth bathing appears to significantly {{reduce the incidence of}} <b>bacteraemias</b> due to skin commensals and demonstrates a non-significant reduction in CLABSIs. Given the uncertainties surrounding diagnosis in the ICU, the effect seen may be of benefit in reducing the use of antibiotics to cover for these skin commensals - both in terms of antibiotic stewardship and health economics.|$|R

30|$|Prospective study {{conducted}} {{over a period}} of 12 Â months in two adult patient intensive care units. Safety rounds were conducted three days a week ascertaining 37 safety measures (grouped into 10 blocks). In each round, 50 % of the patients and 50 % of the measures were randomized. The impact of this safety tool was analysed on indicators of structure (safety culture, healthcare protocols), process (improvement proportion related to tool application, IPR) and outcome (mortality, average stay, rate of catheter-related <b>bacteraemias</b> and rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia, VAP).|$|R
40|$|A pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccine (PCV 7) {{was introduced}} into the United Kingdomâs childhood immunisation schedule in September 2006. Evaluation of {{its impact on the}} incidence of invasive pneumococcaldisease (IPD) as assessed by routine reports of laboratory-confirmed cases should take into account possible long-term trends due to factors like changes in case ascertainment. To this end, we compared pre-PCV 7 trends in reported IPD incidence in England and Wales identified by blood culture with those for two other <b>bacteraemias,</b> Escherichia coli and non -pyogenic streptococci, for which there has not been any public health intervention. While no trend was detected in the age group 65 years and older, there was an annual increase of 3 % and 11 % in those aged under five years and between five and 64 years, respectively, which was similar for IPD and the other two pathogens. After PCV 7 introduction, a continuing trend was only found for non-pyogenic streptococci in under five year-olds. These trends in the incidence for <b>bacteraemias</b> for which there has been no intervention could suggest that there have been changes in case ascertainment because of increased reporting or blood culturing.

40|$|AbstractBacteria {{that produce}} extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBLs) are an {{increasing}} healthcare problem and their rapid detection {{is a challenge}} that must be overcome in order to optimize antimicrobial treatment and patient care. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) {{has been used to}} determine resistance to Î²-lactams, including carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae, but the methodology has not been fully validated as it remains time-consuming. We aimed to assess whether MALDI-TOF can be used to detect ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from positive blood culture bottles in clinical practice. In the assay, 141 blood cultures were tested, 13 of them were real <b>bacteraemias</b> and 128 corresponded to blood culture bottles seeded with bacterial clinical isolates. <b>Bacteraemias</b> were analysed by MALDI-TOF after a positive growth result and the 128 remaining blood cultures 24 h after the bacterial seeding. Î²-lactamase activity was determined through the profile of peaks associated with the antibiotics cefotaxime and ceftazidime and its hydrolyzed forms. Clavulanic acid was added to rule out the presence of non-ESBL mechanisms. Overall data show a 99 % (103 out of 104) sensitivity in detecting ESBL in positive blood cultures. Data were obtained in 90 min (maximum 150 min). The proposed methodology has a great impact on the early detection of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from positive blood cultures, being a rapid and efficient method and allowing early administration of an appropriate antibiotic therapy...|$|R
