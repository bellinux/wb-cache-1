We present {{globally}} convergent multigrid {{methods for}} the nonsymmet-ric obstacle problems as {{arising from the}} discretization of <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>models</b> of American options with local volatilities and discrete data.

25|$|Following {{early work}} by Louis Bachelier and later work by Robert C. Merton, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes {{made a major}} {{breakthrough}} by deriving a differential equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. By employing the technique of constructing a risk neutral portfolio that replicates the returns of holding an option, Black and Scholes produced a closed-form solution for a European option's theoretical price. At the same time, the model generates hedge parameters necessary for effective risk management of option holdings. While the ideas behind the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model</b> were ground-breaking and eventually led to Scholes and Merton receiving the Swedish Central Bank's associated Prize for Achievement in Economics (a.k.a., the Nobel Prize in Economics), {{the application of the}} model in actual options trading is clumsy because of the assumptions of continuous trading, constant volatility, and a constant interest rate. Nevertheless, the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model</b> {{is still one of the}} most important methods and foundations for the existing financial market in which the result is within the reasonable range.|$|E
25|$|In finance, in {{particular}} the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model,</b> changes in the logarithm of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). Some mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot have argued that log-Levy distributions, which possesses heavy tails {{would be a more}} appropriate model, {{in particular}} for the analysis for stock market crashes. The use of the assumption of normal distribution occurring in financial models has also been criticized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his works.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous <b>Black-Scholes</b> <b>model)</b> use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E

25|$|Closely {{following}} the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed {{the original version}} of the binomial options pricing model. It models {{the dynamics of the}} option's theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the option's life. The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model)</b> a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black–Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes {{developed}} the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model,</b> which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. [...] It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time. [...] Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model</b> on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.|$|E

2500|$|In many cases, {{options are}} traded on futures, {{sometimes}} called simply [...] "futures options". A put is {{the option to}} sell a futures contract, and a call is the option to buy a futures contract. For both, the option strike price is the specified futures price at which the future is traded if the option is exercised. Futures are often used since they are delta one instruments. Calls and options on futures may be priced similarly to those on traded assets by using {{an extension of the}} Black-Scholes formula, namely the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model</b> for futures. For options on futures, where the premium is not due until unwound, the positions are commonly referred to as a fution, as they act like options, however, they settle like futures.|$|E

2500|$|Intuitively speaking, moneyness {{and time}} to expiry form a {{two-dimensional}} coordinate system for valuing options (either in currency (dollar) value or in implied volatility), and changing from spot (or forward, or strike) to moneyness is a change of variables. Thus a moneyness function is a function M with input the spot price (or forward, or strike) and output a real number, which is called the moneyness. The condition of being a change of variables is that this function is monotone (either increasing for all inputs, or decreasing for all inputs), and the function can depend on the other parameters of the <b>Black–Scholes</b> <b>model,</b> notably time to expiry, interest rates, and implied volatility (concretely the ATM implied volatility), yielding a function: ...|$|E
