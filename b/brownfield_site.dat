5|$|The New England Quarter is a mixed-use {{development}} {{in the city of}} Brighton and Hove, England. It was built between 2004 and 2008 on the largest <b>brownfield</b> <b>site</b> in the city, adjacent to Brighton railway station. Most parts of the scheme have been finished, but other sections are still being built and one major aspect of the original plan was refused planning permission.|$|E

Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old grain store at the site was demolished {{to make room for the}} center. A total of eight buildings were torn down to make room the complex as part of a redevelopment of a <b>brownfield</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E

The main {{thoroughfares}} are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street furniture and coloured ambient lighting will be colour-coded to match. A stylised map of the site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the <b>brownfield</b> <b>site</b> to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E

The lot was {{purchased}} and {{designed as a}} mixed-use development zone by Hunt Building Corporation, including a lifestyle center, housing, offices, and a grocery store. In November 2006, ABQ Uptown was opened, and brought more retail chains to the area, including several stores that previously did not serve Albuquerque or New Mexico, such as the state's only Apple Store. Below the infill site, a three level, 300 space parking garage was built to facilitate extra parking.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1974, Bush Terminal {{was still}} an active port facility, with vessels that docked between its piers. In 1974, the City of New York Department of Ports and Terminals hired a private company to fill the spaces between Piers 1 through 4 to make space for parking {{shipping}} containers. Filling, however, was halted in 1978 after reports of environmental violations. New York City officials later learned that toxic wastes including oils, oil sludges, and wastewaters had been dumped at the site, making the four piers a polluted brownfield. In 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki announced a $36 million plan to clean up and redevelop the Bush Terminal piers. The plan included a $17.8 million grant {{from the state of}} New York, the largest single grant the state had ever awarded to clean up a <b>brownfield</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E

Although {{numerous}} federal and state lists of contaminated lands are known-totaling more than 380, 000 sites-there is no comprehensive estimate ofunlisted or total <b>brownfield</b> <b>sites.</b> This article uses economic base contraction analysis to provide an estimate ofthe number and acreage ofbrownfield sites, by type and as a percentage ofthe land, in 31 large cities in the United States. This approach recognizes that brownfields are the outcome of years of decline in central-city manufacturing, trade, transportation, and residential uses. Using a moderately restrictive defini-tion ofbrownfield, {{there are an estimated}} 75, 000 formerly industrial <b>brownfield</b> <b>sites</b> in these U. S. central cities, on 93, 000 acres. This is about 5 % ofthe land area in these communities. Another 20, 000 acres are present in these same cities in the form of residential brownfields.

500|$|Plans {{to build}} a new stadium in Manchester were {{formulated}} before 1989 as part of the city's bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics. Manchester City Council submitted a bid that included a design for an 80,000-capacity stadium on a greenfield site west of Manchester city centre. The bid failed and Atlanta hosted the Games. Four years later the city council bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, but this time focusing on a <b>brownfield</b> <b>site</b> [...] east of the city centre on derelict land that was the site of Bradford Colliery, known colloquially as Eastlands. The council's shift in focus was driven by emerging government legislation on urban renewal, promising vital support funding for such projects; the government became involved in funding the purchase and clearance of the Eastlands site in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Various {{proposals}} were put forward for more {{effective use of}} the land. The first was in 1989, when a mixed-use development, centred on a new pedestrianised square outside St Bartholomew's Church, was planned. It would have included a supermarket, offices, houses and other shops, and a relief road designed to take traffic away from the congested London Road. The Environmental Services Department of what was then Brighton Borough Council produced a planning brief for the site in October 1993, stating a desire to [...] "recreate in the area west of London Road a vital, urban, mixed use townscape which links a regenerated and environmentally enhanced London Road shopping centre with North Laine and the station".

St Paul's Developments, the site developer, had often applied for {{planning}} permission to build housing and leisure facilities on the site {{over the course of}} six years, only to be refused. It was finally granted permission to begin building a £4.7 million housing estate on the site in 2007. Named Riverside Crescent, this is being constructed by Barratt and Persimmon.

A new bus link to Blaydon will improve transport links. The plans for the residential development first went on display at Stella RC Primary School on 5 October 2005.
