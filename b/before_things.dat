25|$|Riding the {{momentum}} of their late season run, on April 4 the Drillers went into Milwaukee and hammered the Wave {{in the first game}} of their best-of-three series 20–6. This game is also notable as the first game ever on the radio, as the locale station CKER agree to broadcast the playoff away games, with PR man Bruce Rakoczy and assistant coach Sean Fleming doing the play-by-play and commentary. Things did not go without a hitch though, {{and as a result of}} technical difficulties, the listening public was left listening to polka music for more than three quarters of the game <b>before</b> <b>things</b> finally got sorted out.|$|E
25|$|During the 2000s, {{the foreign}} {{ministry}} warned that the increasing influence of the EU would further isolate Israel in global affairs. In {{the wake of a}} series of diplomatic rifts with Turkey {{and the rise of the}} Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2011, Israel had increasingly unfriendly relations with those countries for a few years <b>before</b> <b>things</b> improved. During roughly the same period, Israeli relations with many countries in Europe including Greece and Cyprus in the context of the Energy Triangle and in Asia, including China and India, were enhanced, largely on account of the growth of Israel's high-tech economy. Israeli ties with Egypt have improved since the Muslim Brotherhood was removed from power there, while ties to Turkey have been uneven since their 2010 nadir but less dismal than that point.|$|E
25|$|What {{originally}} {{began as}} an annual observance of Tibetan Uprising Day turned into street protests by large numbers of monks from various monasteries for several days. Crowd control and arrests escalated the tensions eventually setting off a riot by thousands of Tibetans in the Ramoche section of Lhasa on March 14, 2008. When the police fled the scene, rioters looted and burned more than 1200 Chinese shops, offices, and residences and set fire to nearly 100 vehicles. In the end, an estimated 22 were dead and 325 injured, mostly Han. Total damage was estimated at $40 million USD. Eventually the paramilitary People's Armed Police were sent in and 50-100 Tibetan rioters were killed <b>before</b> <b>things</b> quieted down. Meanwhile, in the Gansu Province, a demonstration by 400 monks were met with force that ignited riots by more than 5000 Tibetans who again burned down the establishments of local Han and Hui people before security forces arrived.|$|E

25|$|United's chances {{continued}} to flow thick and fast. Michael Carrick rounded the goalkeeper {{only to be}} tackled on the line by Distin, whilst Patrice Evra had a shot turned onto the post by David James <b>before</b> <b>things</b> went {{from bad to worse}} for the Manchester side. With 12 minutes to play, Portsmouth counter-attacked down the right hand side, forcing a two-on-two situation. The ball was squared to Milan Baroš, who was felled by Kuszczak in the box. The referee had no hesitation in sending Kuszczak off, despite both Rooney and Anderson having gotten back behind the ball before the foul. Nevertheless, referee Atkinson's decision meant that United had no recognised goalkeeper available for the remaining time. Wayne Rooney offered his services, but that would have left United without a recognised centre-forward, so Rio Ferdinand was given the responsibility of attempting to save the penalty. However, although he dived the right way, Ferdinand was unable to get a hand to the ball, and Sulley Muntari gave Portsmouth the lead. United fought hard to get their deserved equaliser, but even Ronaldo's free kick was off-target, and United were knocked out of the FA Cup.|$|E
500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. I knew {{it would be interesting to}} act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters <b>before</b> <b>things</b> get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".|$|E
500|$|Critics also {{commented on}} the {{contrast}} between lyrical themes and underlying music. Digital Spys Harry Fletcher wrote that there is [...] "something eminently Mancunian" [...] about the clash in styles. Uncut praised the band's [...] "innovative songcraft", but added [...] "their tendency to overthink and squeeze every drop of pleasure from their work does them few favours", while Mojo suggested that they were [...] "self-consciously dialing everything up to 11 <b>before</b> <b>things</b> go up in flames". The Guardians Alexis Petridis compared the album's sound to its themes in a three-star review, suggesting that the album [...] " [...] the information overload of 24-hour rolling news so well that it essentially provokes the same reaction: it's often compelling, but you occasionally find yourself gripped by an overwhelming urge to turn it off". The album was among the favourites for the Mercury Prize, with British bookmakers Ladbrokes at one time offering odds of 4/1, but was not among the twelve albums selected for the shortlist. BBC News Online included the album on their list of [...] "ten albums they missed".|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is an electropop-influenced disco track. Minogue's breathy and whisper-y vocal {{delivery}} and the electronic {{production of the}} song make it similar to [...] "I Believe in You", a single from Minogue's greatest hits album Ultimate Kylie (2004). Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue invites her lover to dance with her, beginning with a line in which she softly sings [...] "Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance? I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?". During the anthemic chorus of the song, which is backed by a warbling synthesizer riff, Minogue asserts that her previous relationships do not [...] "compare" [...] to her present one, singing [...] "All the lovers that have gone before, they don't compare to you/ Don't be frightened, {{just give me a}} little bit more/ They don't compare, all the lovers." [...] UK-based music website Popjustice opined that the song is [...] "not really about relaxing while you dance, it's about relaxing into a relationship." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog felt the [...] "elegiac" [...] and sad-toned chorus [...] "makes the verses transform from a straightforward plea for dancefloor action into what sounds like a demand that everyone join Kylie for one last dance <b>before</b> <b>things</b> become spoiled forever." [...] The song features a bridge section in which Minogue again asks her lover to dance with her, after which an electronic breakdown takes place. According to the sheet music of the song published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is composed in the key of C major and follows a midtempo of 142 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the key of G3 to A4.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Lawrence’s founding, two {{newspapers}} were {{started in the}} town: The Kansas Pioneer and the Herald of Freedom. Both touted the Free State mission. A third paper, the Kansas Free State, was also created and began printing in early January 1855. The establishment of these papers angered a number of pro-slavery {{people who lived in}} the region (as well as those living in Western Missouri). The pro- and anti-slavery groups managed to co-exist with one another for only a few short months <b>before</b> <b>things</b> finally boiled over on November 21, 1855. It was on this date that the pro-slavery settler Franklin Coleman shot and killed the Free Stater Charles Dow at Hickory Point (about fourteen miles south of Lawrence) because of a land claim, with the former contending that he had acted in self-defense. According to the Border War Encyclopedia, [...] "Politics had not motivated Coleman to kill Dow, but the murder marked the genesis of the violent political divisions that characterized Kansas for the next 10 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{is accused of}} having ignored warnings about fire safety in tower blocks. A former chief fire officer and secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, Ronnie King, said ministers stonewalled requests for meetings and efforts to tighten rules. He said that the then–housing minister Gavin Barwell, refused requests for meetings. King said: “We have had replies, but the replies were {{to the effect that}} you have met my predecessor [...] and {{there were a number of}} matters that we are looking at and we are still looking at it. (...) They always seem to need a significant loss of life <b>before</b> <b>things</b> are changed.” After six people were killed in the 2009 Lakanal House fire, the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider, and the Department for Communities and Local Government agreed to hold a review in 2013. In March 2014, the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group sent a letter to then–Minister for Communities Stephen Williams, which said in part: [...] After further correspondence, Williams replied: [...] Jeremy Corbyn has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all high-rise social housing.|$|E
