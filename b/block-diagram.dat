5000|$|The {{most basic}} way of {{creating}} the PWM signal {{is to use a}} high speed comparator ("C" [...] in the <b>block-diagram</b> above) that compares a high frequency triangular wave with the audio input. This generates a series of pulses of which the duty cycle is directly proportional with the instantaneous value of the audio signal. The comparator then drives a MOS gate driver which in turn drives a pair of high-power switches (usually MOSFETs). This produces an amplified replica of the comparator's PWM signal. The output filter removes the high-frequency switching components of the PWM signal and recovers the audio information that the speaker can use.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSystems {{theory and}} cell biology have enjoyed a long {{relationship}} {{that has received}} renewed interest {{in recent years in}} the context of systems biology. The term ‘systems’ in systems biology comes from systems theory or dynamic systems theory: systems biology is defined through the application of systems- and signal-oriented approaches for an understanding of inter- and intra-cellular dynamic processes. The aim of the present text is to review the systems and control perspective of dynamic systems. The biologist’s conceptual framework for representing the variables of a biochemical reaction network, and for describing their relationships, are pathway maps. A principal goal of systems biology is to turn these static maps into dynamic models, which can provide insight into the temporal evolution of biochemical reaction networks. Towards this end, we review the case for differential equation models as a ‘natural’ representation of causal entailment in pathways. <b>Block-diagrams,</b> commonly used in the engineering sciences, are introduced and compared to pathway maps. The stimulus–response representation of a molecular system is a necessary condition for an understanding of dynamic interactions among the components that make up a pathway. Using simple examples, we show how biochemical reactions are modelled in the dynamic systems framework and visualized using <b>block-diagrams...</b>|$|R

This allows to generate dynamic transitions in the resulting nine-dimensional model. The output of the extended model {{can be related to}} EEG patterns observed during epileptic seizure, in particular isolated pre-ictal spikes and low-voltage fast oscillations at seizure onset. We analyse the extended model using basic tools from slow-fast dynamical systems theory and relate the main transitions towards seizure states to torus canards, a type of solutions that has been shown to explain the spiking to bursting transition in many neural models. We find that the original ten-dimensional Wendling-Chauvel model can be reduced to eight dimensions, two variables being scaled versions of two other variables of the model. We then obtain a model with four PSP blocks, which is consistent with the <b>block-diagrams</b> typically presented to describe this model.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} ten years, the family of {{synchronous}} languages (Special Section of the Proc. IEEE 79 (9) (1991)) has been very successful in offering domain-specific, formally defined languages and programming environments for safety-critical systems. Among them, Lustre is well-suited {{for the development of}} regulation systems, which are first designed by control engineers, and can then be programmed as <b>block-diagrams.</b> Automatic generation of C code provides the embedded software. The success of Lustre showed that {{it is a good idea}} to offer domain-specific languages and constructs to reduce the gap between the first design of a system (for instance a control law) and the program written for it. When the structure of the first design has to be encoded into the available constructs of a general-purpose programming language, the interesting information is likely to be lost somewhere on the way from the original design to the actual implementation. This may have consequences on the efficiency of the code produced, or even on the correctness of the design. Working with the systems Lustre is well-suited for, we observed that they are often specified informally using the notion of running modes. However, there seemed to exist no language in which the mode-structure of a complex system could be expressed directly. Following the approach of domain-specific languages, we proposed to extend Lustre with a new construct, called mode-automaton, devoted to the description of these running modes of regulation systems.

40|$|The {{parametric}} {{uncertainty is}} defined as the gap between the complete model of a dynamical process and its simplified nominal one which is normally used to investigate the properties of the system. It is because of this model mismatch that the role of sensitivity in designing control systems becomes very important. In robust control, the parametric uncertainty is taken into account in both the analysis and the synthesis phases of the closed-loop system. In this thesis, first, robustness to small parameter variation is studied using differential sensitivity functions. A combined diagram is used to generate relative sensitivity functions which can be used for improving existing controllers. Several control structures which are suitable for the design of zero-sensitivity control systems are presented. Then, as a framework for studying large parameter uncertainty, the RST controller has been chosen. Robustness criteria, based on parameter uncertainty, have been established. Two complementary ways to robustify a nominal RST controller are presented. First, the pole placement characteristic polynomial is augmented in the second approach, we try to compensate the supplementary signal due to the parametric uncertainty. This signal causes the nominal system misfunction. Instead of estimating this generalized perturbation, various <b>block-diagrams</b> are used to emulate it. As far as identification is concerned, a new method of robust identification which reinforces the tracking capability of RLS algorithm for a nonstationary system is presented. Normally, the gain matrix of RLS has to be adjusted when parameter variations are detected. In this work, an on-line estimation of the parameter covariance as an additional gain matrix is proposed for this adjustment {{on the basis of the}} prediction error. Then, the diagonal elements of this computed covariance matrix are used to calculate an on-line estimation of the parameter uncertainty...|$|R
