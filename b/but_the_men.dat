5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Munitions transported {{through the}} {{magazine}} included bombs, shells, naval mines, torpedoes, and small arms ammunition. The munitions, {{destined for the}} Pacific Theater of Operations, were delivered to the Port Chicago facility by rail then individually loaded by hand, crane and winch onto cargo ships for transport to the war zones. From the beginning, all the enlisted men employed as loaders at Port Chicago were African-American; all their commanding officers were white. All of the enlisted men had been specifically trained {{for one of the}} naval ratings during his stay at Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were instead put to work as stevedores.

5|$|Finally, on 20 August 1462, Enrique's son Juan Alonso de Guzmán, 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia {{succeeded in}} {{capturing}} Gibraltar after launching a surprise attack. His {{success in the}} brief Eighth Siege of Gibraltar {{was due to the}} garrison being greatly depleted after its men of rank had left for Granada, with their retinues, to pay homage to the newly enthroned sultan Abu l-Hasan Ali. An initial assault by the Count of Arcos was beaten back with many casualties on both sides, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of the garrison realised that in their depleted state they could not withstand a second assault. They offered to surrender on condition that the garrison and inhabitants of Gibraltar would be allowed to leave with their wives, children and movable goods, with compensation to be paid for the property that they left behind. Although the proposal was welcomed, it fell through due to rivalry between the Christian commanders. The Moorish inhabitants of Gibraltar retreated to the castle and surrendered after a few days to Medina Sidonia. They were expelled along with the city's Jewish population, to be replaced by Spanish Christians.|$|E
25|$|The Taíno {{women were}} highly skilled in agriculture. The people {{depended}} on it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> also fished and hunted.

An average-sized canoe would hold about 15–20 people. They used bows and arrows for hunting, and developed the use of poisons on their arrowheads.|$|E
25|$|Sauron {{intended}} the rings to subvert these races of Middle-earth to his power, since the One Ring controlled the others.

25|$|The Royal Burmese Army was {{organized}} into three general tiers: the Palace Guards, the Capital Defense Corps, {{and the field}} levies. Only the first two were the standing military. They protected the sovereign and the capital region, and formed {{the nucleus of the}} armed forces in wartime. The third, the field levies or conscripts, were usually raised just prior to or during wartime, and provided manpower to resist attacks and project power beyond the boundaries of the empire. Most of the field levy served in the infantry <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> for the elephantry, cavalry, artillery and naval corps were drawn from specific hereditary villages that specialized in respective military skills.|$|E

25|$|A rift {{developed}} between Tupper and Macdonald in 1879 over Sandford Fleming, whom Tupper supported but whom Macdonald wanted removed as Chief Engineer of the CPR. This rift was partially healed and Tupper and Macdonald managed {{to work together}} during the negotiations with George Stephen's syndicate in 1880, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were no longer close, and Tupper no longer seemed to be Macdonald's heir apparent. By early 1881 Tupper had determined that he should leave the cabinet. In March 1881 he asked Macdonald to appoint him as Canada's High Commissioner in London. Macdonald initially refused, and Alexander Tilloch Galt retained the High Commissioner's post.|$|E
25|$|Several months later, in 1128, {{inspired}} by the shortcomings of Afonso Henriques, the Galician and Portuguese troops of Theresa and Fernando Perez de Trava entered Portugal, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of Afonso scored a decisive victory at the Battle of São Mamede. The later death of Theresa, and Afonso's success against the Moors at the Battle of Ourique, led to him being proclaimed King of the Portuguese in 1139, this independence being recognized by the king of León in 1143. Still, the statute of frontier lands such as Toroño and Limia in southern Galicia led to frequent border conflicts {{during most of the}} Lower Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|From {{this time}} on, Sauron {{became known as}} the Dark Lord of Mordor. Sauron {{fortified}} Mordor and completed the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr, already centuries in the building. He distributed the remaining rings of the Seven and the Nine to lords of Dwarves and Men. Dwarves proved too resilient to bend to his will, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Men</b> were enslaved by Sauron as the Nazgûl, his most feared servants. Well aware of the strength of the Númenóreans after his earlier defeat, Sauron withdrew from the coasts {{and for a long time}} avoided directly challenging them, although he managed to use some of the Nine rings to snare three of their great lords.|$|E

25|$|After {{the battles}} on the 14th, {{a large number}} of {{refugees}} appeared at Erfurt. At first they were refused entrance, but later the gates were opened and soon the city thronged with at least 12,000 demoralized soldiers. Attempts were made by some officers to return the troops to their regiments, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> refused to cooperate. By noon on the 15th, Murat was near Erfurt with the leading elements of his cavalry. General-Major von Jung-Larisch stood in battle line in front of the city. His position was poor, with the Gera River at his back, so he ordered his infantry to retreat into the city. Murat's horsemen charged and drove Jung-Larisch's cavalry back across the river, capturing an artillery battery. Losses for this action are not given.|$|E
25|$|The Commissioners had {{employed}} {{teams of}} gaulters throughout the 19th and early 20th century, who got their {{name from the}} use of an impervious type of clay called gault, which was obtained from Roswell Pits at Ely, and used to repair the banks of the rivers and the cross dyke. The teams consisted of three men, who managed a train of five boats between them, each capable of holding 8 tons of gault. The boats were owned by the Commissioners, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were responsible for the provision of a horse, shovels and barrows. In 1886, new terms of employment were negotiated by the Commissioners, as they felt that the wages earned by the men were excessive. In 1920, the Ouse Drainage Board was established, and responsibility for the maintenance of the river banks passed to them, so the Commissioners laid off the men and sold the boats.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the division arrived at Bombay on 27 December. However, the 53rd Infantry Brigade stopped for a week at Mombasa, Kenya and was diverted on 23 December for Malaya. The brigade, travelling on the USS Mount Vernon with the 135th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery and the 287th Field Company, Royal Engineers, arrived at Singapore on 13 January 1941 albeit without artillery pieces or transport. While {{the rest of the}} division was under direct War Office control, the 53rd Brigade was temporarily detached and assigned to Malaya Command. Their equipment, scheduled to arrive on a later convoy, was made up from local sources. It was hoped that the brigade could be immediately put on the line and relieve the Australian 22nd Brigade <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of the brigade were considered not fit for immediate action following 11 weeks at sea. By the time the brigade arrived, the Japanese had forced Allied forces south through Malaya. On 11 January, Kuala Lumpur had fallen and soon after Japanese forces had reached Johor, the southern-most state of Malaya.|$|E
25|$|Ghazi sent an {{envoy to}} Éxarchos {{saying that he}} wanted to negotiate. The men met in Tripoli, Ghazi's capitol, but once Éxarchos arrived, Ghazi had him seized and hanged. When Éxarchos' mother heard the news she was infuriated. On Easter Sunday when {{everyone}} in Skoutari was at church she started calling the men women for not avenging her son's death. So the men of Skoutari under the command of Zanet dressed up as priests went to the Ottoman castle of Passavas, and asked the commander if they could come in and bless the castle. The commander agreed, and once all the men were inside, they took out their hidden weapons and slaughtered everyone inside the walls. None of the Ottomans made it out alive. After the massacre, Passavas was abandoned and never inhabited again. The Ottomans then tried to destroy Zanet in 1803 and 1807. The Ottomans tried to subdue Mani again in 1815 by capturing Skoutari <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of Skoutari beat back the attack and in 1821 the rest of Greece declared their independence from the Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|In 200, {{when the}} forces of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were locked in a {{stalemate}} at the Battle of Guandu, Yuan sent Liu Bei with an army to support the rebellions against Cao Cao in Yinjiang (氵隱疆; southwest of present-day Xuchang, Henan), roughly 8.3km south of the capital. Cao Cao became worried about such developments in the territories under his control, so he sent Cao Ren to suppress the uprisings. Cao Ren observed that the rebels dared to create trouble because they had Liu Bei's support, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> under Liu were newly recruited and inexperienced, {{so it was not}} difficult to defeat them. Cao Ren targeted the rebel chief Liu Pi and killed him in battle, and subsequently defeated Liu Bei as well. Yuan Shao attempted to cut off Cao Cao's route to the west by sending Han Meng (韓猛) southwest. Cao Ren responded to the threat by defeating Han Meng at Jiluo Hill (雞洛山; located 50 li northeast of present-day Xinmi, Henan). Yuan Shao became afraid and did not dare to send out his troops. Cao Ren and Shi Huan (史渙) later led a force to attack a convoy transporting supplies to Yuan Shao's camp and destroyed the food supplies.|$|E
