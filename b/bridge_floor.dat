5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy loads and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point above the river means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E

2500|$|The covered bridges in Lancaster County are all {{built of}} similar {{construction}} and appearance. [...] Some {{of this is}} {{because many of the}} existing bridges were built by the same man, Elias McMellen, who built 12 of the existing bridges. [...] The most common construction method used was that of the Burr arch truss. [...] It is found in its single and double span forms in almost all of the covered bridges in the county, except for the Landis Mill Covered Bridge, a multiple kingpost design. [...] The Pine Grove Covered Bridge and Herr's Mill Covered Bridge are the county's only double span covered bridges. [...] While most of the bridges are situated in remote locations where there is limited traffic, a number of the bridges, such as Jackson's Sawmill Covered Bridge, were later reinforced with steel beams underneath the <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> and steel hanger rods on the sides to support heavier traffic or give the bridge additional support.|$|E

50|$|Jet bridges provide {{all-weather}} dry {{access to}} aircraft {{and enhance the}} security of terminal operations. They are often permanently attached at one end by a pivot (or rotunda) to the terminal building and {{have the ability to}} swing left or right. The cabin, {{at the end of the}} loading bridge, may be raised or lowered, extended or retracted, and may pivot, to accommodate aircraft of different sizes. These motions are controlled by an operator's station in the cab. The cab is provided with an accordion-like canopy, which allows the bridge to dock with aircraft with differing shapes, and provide a nearly weather-proof seal. Additionally, many models offer leveling devices for the portion of the floor that makes contact with the aircraft; this allows passengers to slowly transition from level aircraft floor to sloping jet <b>bridge</b> <b>floor.</b> As such, jet bridges provide enhanced access to aircraft for passengers with many types of disabilities and mobility impairments, as they may board and disembark without climbing stairs or using a specialized wheelchair lift.|$|E

50|$|Shapoori Bridge {{is located}} in {{southern}} KhorramAbad. It {{has been used to}} connect the western part of Lorestan (Tarhan) to the east, and then on to Khoozestan province and Taysafun, the capital city of the Sassanian. The bridge is 312 meters long and 10.75 meters high. It has 28 arches and 27 piles. The area of each pile is 61 square meters, and the distance between the two piles is 7.5 meters. Five of its arches are intact; the others have been destroyed by natural factors. The arches of the bridge are made {{in the form of a}} wishbone. The piles and breakwaters of the bridge are in the form of six lateral lozenges made of stone. Probably the bridge also was used to distribute water. Materials of the bridge are river stones and stone chips in the arches and truncated stones in the piles. The <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> is paved in red block stones that have lost their square shape due to erosion. This attractive, huge bridge belongs to Sassanian era, and it is registered as number 1058 in the list of Iranian national monuments.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the mass}} of bodies were thrown into the river, several {{citizens}} quickly brought ropes, planks, and boats to rescue the living and recover the dead.

When the bridge collapsed, long wooden planks that made up the <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> were released into the water, becoming life rafts for those who grabbed one. Others used the planks to extend a lifeline to those in the water. William Dailey was reported to have saved 16 victims using one of these planks. Several men worked tirelessly with rescue efforts, while many homes along the river were opened up to the dead and the wounded. As reported by the Dixon Sun, many citizens “did not spare their substance during our trouble. Blankets, shawls, clothing, sheets, quilts, cloths, cotton, woolen goods, and materials of every description were demanded and were freely given and without a question. The houses were filled with the dead, the dying, and with a thousand anxious enquirers. Carpets and beds were given up freely, and services rendered that ought to give us a nobler estimate of humanity than has ever entered our conceptions.” ...|$|E
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the U. S. Department of Transportation This report documents the results of a study of on-system historic metal truss bridges in Texas. On-system bridges are those located on the state highway system, and the surviving on-system historic trusses in Texas were typically constructed in the 1920 s and 1930 s. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} investigate methods that can be used to develop an accurate and realistic load rating for an older on-system truss bridge. In order to examine issues involved in the structural evaluation of older on-system truss bridges, two case study bridges were investigated in detail. In addition, a full-scale laboratory experimental investigation was conducted on a single bay of a typical truss <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> system. Evaluation of the case study bridges indicated that the primary structural deficiency in these bridges was inadequate capacity of the steel floor beams and stringers, based on conventional load rating techniques. The analysis and field load testing conducted on the case study bridges and the laboratory investigation therefore focused primarily on the <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> systems. The results of this study indicate that the use of standard AASHTO load rating techniques can substantially underestimate the strength of the floor beams and stringers. A significantly more accurate prediction of the structural response of the floor members to truck live loads can be achieved by conducting an elastic finite element analysis of the <b>bridge</b> <b>floor</b> system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the trunk and lower {{extremity}} muscle activity induced by six different conditions floor, intensity 0, 1, 3, 5 of whole body vibration (WBV), and Swiss ball during bridging exercise. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure trunk and lower extremity muscles activity. Ten elderly women were recruited from Hong-sung Senior Citizen Welfare Center. The collected EMG data were normalized using reference contraction (during <b>floor</b> <b>bridging)</b> and expressed as a percentage of reference voluntary contraction (%RVC). To analyze the differences in EMG data, the re-peated one-way analysis of variance was used. A Bonferroni’s correction was used for multiple comparisons. The study showed that EMG activity of the rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal ob-lique, erector spinae and rectus abdominis muscles were not significantly different between six different conditions of during bridging exercise (p>. 05).
