5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> (if {{currently}} infrequent) part {{of the evolution of}} the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Aztecs are a {{small group}} of seven adult meerkats that was formed by Maybelline in the final episode of the third series when she broke away from the Whiskers.

In the second episode, Zaphod and a band of roving males join the Aztecs, with Zaphod {{becoming}} the group's new dominant male. Right now, the Aztecs are left without a dominant male, since Zaphod has died.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, Sukhoi had been demonstrating the Su-27M to senior defence and government officials. With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35. The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with Dubai, where Viktor Pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators. The aircraft thereafter flew in Berlin and Paris, and would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> feature at Moscow's MAKS Air Show. The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>A</b> ring R <b>is</b> called <b>a</b> (von Neumann) <b>regular</b> ring if {{for every}} x 2 R; x = xyx for some y 2 R. It is {{well-known}} that for any ring R and any positive integer n, the full matrix ring Mn(R) is regular if {{and only if}} R <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> ring. This paper examines this property on any additively commutative semiring S with zero. The regularity of S is dened analogously. We show that for a positive integer n, if Mn(S) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> semiring, then S <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> semiring but the converse need not be true for n = 2. And for n 3, Mn(S) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> semiring {{if and only if}} S <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> ring...|$|R

30|$|Since d_μ(u_i)= 1.5  and  d_ν(u_i)= 2 for all u_i ∈ V, where i= 1,..., 6. Hence, G <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> Pythagorean fuzzy graph {{of degree}} (1.5,  2). Also, G <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> graph as {{the degree of}} each vertex is equal. Thus, G <b>is</b> <b>a</b> full <b>regular</b> Pythagorean fuzzy graph.|$|R
5|$|In February 2010, Müller {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Bayern Munich through 2013. During {{the second half of}} the season, Müller continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> first-team starter, usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04, and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career, in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern. The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC, a match which Müller started.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was decided}} that the battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, {{it was decided}} that the battalion's first commanding officer would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.|$|E
5|$|Young's {{first full}} season {{was not a}} {{successful}} one for Manchester City; the team struggled to find form throughout. A four match unbeaten run in April, in which Young scored a winning goal against Bolton Wanderers, gave hope, but {{on the final day}} of the season Manchester City were relegated to the Second Division. For the following two seasons Young continued to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> first team player, though he missed the first two months of the 1964–65 season. Manchester City did not come close to promotion, and their 11th-place finish in 1965 was at that point the lowest in the club's history. Manager George Poyser departed in April 1965, and in July 1965 his replacement, Joe Mercer, joined the club, along with coach Malcolm Allison.|$|E
