WC particles were injected into the molten surface layer using Nd:YAG high power laser beam. As a result the microstructure characterized by bard ceramic particles distributed in a metal matrix with the strong <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> is formed in the surface layer of the treated metal. Dry sliding wear properties of these metal matrix composites layers were measured and compared with the wear properties of the substrate and with surfaces simply remelted by the laser beam. The observed wear mechanisms are summarized and related to detailed microstructural observations. The layers {{have been found to}} show excellent interfacial bonding, coupled with substantially improved tribological properties expressed through the wear resistance increase of 8 times. The amount of WC particles was sufficient to reinforce the matrix and the particles have shown a good bonding to the matrix to support the contact stress in the layer. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Three {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for handling data from enzyme kinetics studies. The first method, which involves the use of Simpson's rule, is applicable when Michaelis-Menten (21) kinetics obtain and has the advantage of a short calculation time. The second method, which involves approximation of the data by a set of orthogonal polynomials, is applicable when the reaction mechanism is either unknown or so complicated that the mathematical formulation is intractable. The third method applies when the Michaelis-Menten mechanism holds but the steady state approximation is invalid. Use is made of Simpson's rule and of numerical differentiation. The effect of enzyme concentration in the alpha-chymotrypsin catalyzed hydrolysis of L-tryptophanhydroxamide has been studied. All the work was done at 25 [degrees]C. at an ionic strength of either 0. 15 M. or 0. 30 M. The experiments covered the pH range of 6 to 8. The buffer from pH 6 to pH 7 was cacodylic acid. The buffer used at pH 8 was tris-(hydroxymethyl) -aminomethane. It is shown that the effect of changing enzyme concentration is understandable in terms of a reversible dimerization of the enzyme which makes one active site of the two enzyme molecules involved unavailable for <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrate.</b> This effect decreases with increasing pH, becoming negligible at pH 8...|$|E

(some col.) Nicotine is the addictive agent in tobacco {{and differences in}} nicotine metabolism may affect tobacco use, and consequently exposure to tobacco carcinogens. A lung procarcinogen in tobacco is 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK) and its carcinogenic effect is dependent on metabolic activation and is counter-balanced by metabolic detoxification. Nicotine and NNK are structurally related and both are metabolized by cytochrome P 450 (P 450), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), and flavin-monoxygenase (FMO) enzymes. The goal of this thesis research was to explore variation in nicotine metabolism in vivo and to probe specific enzyme-catalyzed reactions of NNK in vitro. Low nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation were observed among African Americans compared to Europeans, and among individuals with a variant UGT 2 B 10 genotype. In a controlled dose study of ethnic differences in nicotine metabolism (n= 93 smokers), African Americans excreted 30 - 40 % less nicotine and cotinine as their glucuronide conjugates than European Americans. This difference in glucuronidation explained the higher free cotinine concentrations observed in African Americans compared to European Americans. The most efficient in vitro catalyst of nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation is UGT 2 B 10. We demonstrated that UGT 2 B 10 contributes to in vivo nicotine metabolism in a genotype-phenotype analysis of 325 smokers. Individuals who were heterozygous for the UGT 2 B 10 Asp 67 Tyr allele excreted less nicotine or cotinine as their glucuronide conjugates than wild-type; the ratio of cotinine glucuronide:cotinine was decreased by 60 %, while increases in urinary and plasma cotinine and trans- 3 '-hydroxycotinine were observed. Strikingly, a robust biomarker of nicotine intake, nicotine equivalents, were lower among Asp 67 Tyr heterozygotes compared to individuals without this allele; 58. 2 nmol/ml (95 % CI, 48. 9 - 68. 2) versus 69. 2 nmol/ml (95 % CI, 64. 3 - 74. 5). Individuals with low activity UGT 2 B 10 may smoke less intensely, as reported for individuals with CYP 2 A 6 polymorphisms that cause decreased nicotine C-oxidation. In contrast to nicotine, NNK is a carcinogen. It is metabolized to reactive intermediates that can form DNA and protein adducts, or it is detoxified by glucuronidation. P 450 2 A 13 is the most efficient catalyst of NNK oxidation. We explored the effect of an active site mutant, Asn 297 Ala, on enzyme function and found that loss of hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> in the active site affected substrate orientation and product formation. The orphan P 450 2 A 7 was considered as a potential catalyst for NNK oxidation, but expression of wild-type or two naturally-occurring variants failed to yield protein with a P 450 spectra and no appreciable activity towards P 450 2 A substrates was observed. Preliminary experiments were conducted {{to search for the}} glucuronide conjugate formed from the unstable oxidation product alpha-hydroxymethyl NNK, which has not been identified in any human system. The extent to which variation in metabolism mediates smoking behavior and cancer risk warrants consideration. The enzymes involved are potential drug targets for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy and cancer chemoprevention...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{stability}} of two interacting (for example, by van der Waals forces) incompressible thin films, one <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> a <b>substrate</b> {{and the other}} to a contactor, is studied extending the work of Shenoy and Sharma, Physical Review Letters 18, 119 – 122 (2001). The analysis indicates that the wavelength of the instability depends strongly on the shear moduli and thicknesses of the films but not on the nature and magnitude of the interaction. When the films have equal shear moduli, the wavelength of the instability has an intermediate value between the wavelengths of the instabilities had each of the films been interacting with rigid contactors. On the other hand, if the films have different shear moduli but equal thicknesses, then the wavelength of the instability is identical to that had the films been interacting with rigid contactors. In the more general case when the two films have different shear moduli and thicknesses, the nature of the critical wavelength is more complex. When ratio of the shear moduli of the contacting film to that of the film <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> the <b>substrate</b> exceeds 5. 32, the wavelength of the of the instability jumps from the value close to that determined by the thickness of the film <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> the <b>substrate</b> <b>to</b> that of the contacting film, as the thickness of the contacting film is increased. ...|$|R
