40|$|Abstract: Based on a reduced-form {{equation}} {{derived from}} a simultaneous model of <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> demand and supply, this study finds that the equilibrium <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> has a negative relationship with the discount rate and the 10 -year U. S. government bond yield; it has a positive relationship with bank deposits, industrial production, appreciation of the yuan, and the inflation rate. A lower discount rate or more bank deposits will increase <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> supply. Conversely, a higher discount rate or less bank deposits will reduce <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> supply. Hence, the bank lending channel is confirmed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a widely}} held belief that banks may be discriminating against female {{business}} owners. This {{study was designed to}} explore the perceptions held by <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> officers of male and female business owners, using Bourdieu's theory of practice and Kelly's personal construct methodology. The research literature might lead to an expectation that the characteristics of the business owners would be relatively homogenous but that men and women business owners would be construed differently (for example women might be seen to lack drive). However, the results demonstrate heterogeneity in the constructs held by <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> officers, and a particular concern with the character of the business owner. Significant gender differences were observed in only 20 of the 325 constructs elicited from 35 <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> officers. Female <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> officers were as likely as male <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> officers to draw gender distinctions between business owners. Detailed multivariate analyses confirmed no evidence of systematic gender differences in the constructs held by <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> officers of business owners. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> in 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term failures of strategy.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 THSRC {{put through}} a new {{syndicate}} loan, which alleviated the company’s imminent financial burden. THSRC signed a NT$382 billion refinancing contract with a consortium of 8 domestic banks led by Bank of Taiwan in January, 2010; and utilized the new loan {{to pay off the}} previous syndicated loan which with higher interest. As of 30 June 2011, the long-term debts totaling NT$385 billion include NT$26 billion corporate bonds and NT$359 billion <b>bank</b> <b>loans.</b> In comparison with the terms and conditions of previous loans, the newly signed refinancing debts carried lower interest rates and longer tenors up to 22 years. The Company’s financial burden is therefore largely reduced.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} SME’s financing decision between formal bank financing and alternative financing trade credit. To do so, relevant firm-specific factors including firm size, age, profitability, financial transparency and financial obstacle will be studied. Furthermore, the effects of institutional environments on SME’ financing decision will be studied as well. This is done by considering country-specific factors such as credit availability, {{rule of law and}} GDP growth. This study focuses on 30, 247 sample SMEs from 133 countries. The datasets are obtained from BEEPS. The results indicate that firm size, age, profitability, financial obstacle and rule of law are significant variables in determining SMEs’ financing with <b>bank</b> <b>loan.</b> Meanwhile, firm size, age, financial obstacle and GDP growth are significant variables in determining SMEs’ financing with trade credit. The result shows a positive relationship between rule of law and <b>bank</b> <b>loan.</b> This indicates that a country with higher rule of law can significantly increase the SMEs to finance with <b>bank</b> <b>loan.</b> Whereas, countries without efficient rule of law will significantly decrease SMEs’ financing from <b>bank</b> <b>loan.</b> Besides, the result indicates a negative relationship between GDP growth and trade credit. This implies that during economic recession, SMEs avoid formal bank financing and increase the use of trade credit. Nevertheless, this study finds no evidence to show the significance of credit availability in determining SMEs’ financing decision between <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> and trade credit. However, the relationships of <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> and credit availability as well as trade credit and credit availability are consistent with the prior studies. On the other hand, the additional investigations strongly support the existence of non-linear relationships between firm size and <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> as well as firm age and <b>bank</b> <b>loan.</b> This implies that if firm size and firm age are increasing, they will increase SMEs’ financing with <b>bank</b> <b>loan.</b> However, after reaching its maximum point when firm size or age increases by one additional unit, the marginal effect in <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> starts to decline...|$|R

5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned <b>bank</b> <b>loans</b> to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E
5|$|In October 1999, Chakrapong founded Royal Phnom Penh Airways. Chakrapong raised US$2 {{million from}} {{personal}} savings and <b>bank</b> <b>loans,</b> {{which he used}} to acquire one 52-seater Antonov-24 and another 100-seater Yakovlev Yak-42 airplanes. The airlines flew domestic routes within {{the first year of}} operations and most of its customers were Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese tourists. By May 2001, Royal Phnom Penh Airways secured three authorizations to fly between Phnom PenhBangkok, Phnom PenhHo Chi Minh City as well as Ho Chi Minh CitySiem Reap. The airlines attempted to secure two additional routes from the Cambodian government—Bangkok-Siem Reap in August 2001 and Siem Reap-Bangkok in August 2002—but lost both bids to other airlines. Chakrapong accused the government political bias in awarding the deals due to his political affiliations. In October 2003, the director of Battambang Airport, Prum Chantha, reported that Royal Phnom Penh Airways had accumulated $1million in unpaid taxes. Chakrapong suspended domestic flights between Phnom Penh and Battambang as foreign tourists opted for land transport options to provincial capitals which were cheaper than air transport. Royal Phnom Penh Airways had already become bankrupt by March 2006 when the government presented Chakrapong a bill of $1.36 million in unpaid taxes, navigation, and landing fees. When Chakrapong failed to repay the taxes to the government, Hun Sen issued a lawsuit in March 2007 against him.|$|E

40|$|Under an enriched {{notion of}} “inside debt”, the unique {{benefits}} of bank financing from screening and monitoring processes {{have been well}} documented in {{a large number of}} studies investigating the information content of <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements. Thus, <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements convey positive signals to the market, and the market response should be positive. However, previous studies were conducted extensively in the non-government-controlled banking systems, such as the U. S., the U. K., Canada and Australia. It is unclear whether the traditional predictions on the functions of banks for non-government-controlled banking systems also hold for government-controlled banking systems. This study examines the market reaction to <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements in the Chinese financial market, where the banking system is highly controlled by the Chinese government. The study also investigates the possible characteristics of lending <b>banks,</b> borrowers and <b>loans</b> that may influence share price reaction to <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements in the Chinese financial market. Standard event study methodology is employed to test the share price returns of the borrowing firms in response to the <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements. The event window comprises of 21 trading days from the period beginning 10 days before the event date (day 0) and ending 10 days before the event date (day − 10 to day 10). Data used in this study are collected from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research Database and China Financial Newspaper Database. This study samples all <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements from companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) between 1996 and 2009. The share-split reform started in 2005 which affected the stock price of listed Chinese companies considerably. In order to avoid the influence of the share-split reform, this study divides the sample period into two sub-samples, namely, 1996 to 2004 and 2005 - 2009. A total of 501 <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements are collected in the final sample for period 1996 to 2004 and 106 <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements for the period 2005 to 2009. Contrary to what previous studies have found for <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements in non-government-controlled banking systems, this study finds significant declines in stock values of Chinese borrowing firms during <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements for the sample period 1996 to 2004. The result implies that both positive and negative <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcement effects are possible, depending on whether the banking system is run on purely commercial goals in non-government-controlled banking systems or is subject to political intervention in government-controlled banking systems. Banks controlled by the government may have to lend to bail out poorly performing firms for political reasons. If these weak borrowing firms are prevalent, the direction of the market response to <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcement should be negative, and vice versa. The results show that the negative effect is particularly significant for loans from Big Four state banks, state owned or controlled banks, banks with lower ranking and banks in provinces with lower marketization in credit allocation. The negative effect is also particularly significant for problematic borrowing firms including firms that are opaque, have a higher possibility of expropriation or tunnelling, have ineffective expropriation-reduction mechanisms, and are controlled by the state. The results also show that the negative effect is particularly significant for loans with greater amount, shorter term, with covenants/collateral, and less syndication. There is {{a significant difference in the}} market response to <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements among different <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> purposes and among different industries. This study finds no significant market response to <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements in the Chinese financial market for the sample period 2005 to 2009. However, the result shows that there is a significantly negative market response to <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements in the Chinese financial market for the sample period 1996 to 2004. This implies that the Chinese stock market does not view <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> announcements unfavourably any longer after a series of reforms in the Chinese banking system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{whether the}} total debt ratios and <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> ratios of Chinese listed {{companies}} had {{any impact on}} their fixed investment in 2001 - 2006, and whether this impact, if it existed, differed among companies with differing investment opportunities. Our results are as follows. First, our analysis reveals that the total debt ratio (<b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> ratio) did {{have a negative impact}} on fixed investment among Chinese listed companies. Secondly, the total debt ratio (<b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> ratio) had a stronger negative impact on low-growth companies than on high-growth companies, implying that the total debt ratio (<b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> ratio) actually restrained companies from overinvestment. Finally, the analysis led to the interesting result that the <b>bank</b> <b>loan</b> ratio had a stronger impact on fixed investment than the total debt ratio, and actually had the strong effect of restraining investment particularly by low-growth companies, implying that in China, banks supervise the investment activities of companies more strongly than other creditors. ...|$|R
