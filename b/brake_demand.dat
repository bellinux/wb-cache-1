Such a braking system converts, transfers, stores and reuses kinetic energy which would otherwise be dissipated as heat through friction brakes to the environment. This research investigates the control of braking for a mixed-mode braking system in a these vehicles based on the proportion of braking energy that can be stored. Achieving mixed-mode braking requires the ‘blending’ of the two systems (regenerative and friction), and in brake blending, the electric motor/generator (M/G) and the hydraulic actuation pressure are controlled together to meet the driver’s <b>braking</b> <b>demand.</b> The research presented here has established a new robust dynamic modelling procedure {{for the design of}} combined regenerative and hydraulic braking systems.

40|$|Investigates the braking {{performance}} {{requirements of the}} UltraCommuter, a lightweight series hybrid electric vehicle currently under development at the University of Queensland. With a predicted vehicle mass of 600 kg and two in-wheel motors each capable of 500 Nm of peak torque, decelerations up to 0. 46 g are theoretically possible using purely regenerative braking. With 99 % of <b>braking</b> <b>demands</b> less than 0. 35 g, essentially all braking can be regenerative. The wheel motors have sufficient peak torque capability to lock the rear wheels in combination with front axle braking, {{eliminating the need for}} friction braking at the rear. Emergency braking levels approaching 1 g are achieved by supplementation with front disk brakes. This paper presents equations describing the peak front and rear axle braking forces which occur under straight line braking, including gradients. Conventionally, to guarantee stability, mechanical front/rear proportioning of braking effort ensures that the front axle locks first. In this application, all braking is initially regenerative at the rear, and an adaptive ''by-wire'' proportioning system presented ensures this stability requirement is still satisfied.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{adaptive}} regenerative braking control concept for electric vehicles {{with an electric}} motor at the front axle is presented. It is well known that the "phased" type regenerative braking systems of category B maximize the amount of regenerative energy during braking. However, there is an increased risk of maneuvering capability loss especially during cornering. An integrated braking controller which determines - in a single step - the desired yaw moment and allocates the <b>braking</b> <b>demand</b> between hydraulic <b>brakes</b> and electric motor during cornering is designed using the State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) method. A unique method for deriving the State Dependent Coefficient (SDC) formulation of the system dynamics is proposed. Soft constraints are included in the state dynamics while an augmented penalty approach is followed to handle hard constraints. The performance of the controller has been evaluated for different combined cornering-braking scenarios using simulations in a Matlab/Simulink environment. For this an eight degrees of freedom (DOF) nonlinear vehicle model has been utilized. The numerical results show that the controller is able to optimize (locally) the amount of regenerative braking energy while respecting system's constraints such as tire force saturation, vehicle yaw rate and slip angle errors...|$|R

40|$|Technological {{developments}} in road vehicles {{over the last}} two decades have received considerable attention towards pushing the safe performance limits to their ultimate levels. Towards this goal, Active Front Steering (AFS) and Direct Yaw-moment Control (DYC) systems have been widely investigated. AFS systems introduce corrective steering angles to the conventional system in order to realize a target handling response for a given speed and steering input. An AFS system, however, may yield limited performance under severe steering maneuvers involving substantial lateral load shift and saturation of the inside tire-road adhesion. The adhesion available at the outer tire, on the other hand, would remain under-utilized. This dissertation explores effectiveness of an Active Independent Front Steering (AIFS) system that could introduce a corrective measure at each wheel in an independent manner. The effectiveness of the AIFS system was investigated firstly through simulation of a yaw-plane model of a passenger car. The preliminary simulation results with AIFS system revealed superior potential compared to the AFS particularly in the presence of greater lateral load shift during a high-g maneuver. The proposed concept was thus expected to be far more beneficial for enhancement of handling properties of heavy vehicles, which invariably undergo large lateral load shift due to their high center of mass and roll motion. A nonlinear yaw-plane model of a two-axle single-unit truck, fully and partially loaded with solid and liquid cargo, with limited roll degree-of-freedom (DOF) was thus developed to study the performance potentials of AIFS under a range of steering maneuvers. A simple PI controller was synthesized to track the reference yaw rate response of a neutral steer vehicle. The steering corrections, however, were limited such that none of the tires approach saturation. For this purpose, a tire saturation zone was identified considering the normalized cornering stiffness property of the tire. The controller strategy was formulated so as to limit the work-load magnitude at a pre-determined level to ensure sufficient tire-road adhesion reserve to meet the <b>braking</b> <b>demand,</b> when exists. Simulation results were obtained for a truck model integrating AFS and AIFS systems subjected to a range of steering maneuvers, namely: a J-turn maneuver on uniform as well as split-μ road conditions, and path change and obstacle avoidance maneuvers. The simulation results showed that both AFS and AIFS can effectively track the target yaw rate of the vehicle, while the AIFS helped limit saturation of the inside tire and permitted maximum utilization of the available tire-road adhesion of the outside tire. The results thus suggested that the performance of an AIFS system would be promising under severe maneuvers involving simultaneous braking and steering, since it permitted a desired adhesion reserve at each wheel to meet a <b>braking</b> <b>demand</b> during the steering maneuver. Accordingly, the vehicle model was extended to study the dynamic braking characteristics under braking-in-turn maneuvers. The simulation results revealed the most meritorious feature of the AIFS in enhancing the braking characteristics of the vehicle and reducing the stopping time during such maneuvers. The robustness of the proposed control synthesis was subsequently studied with respect to parameter variations and external disturbance. This investigation also explores designs of fail-safe independently controllable front wheels steering system for implementation of the AIFS concept. ...|$|R

Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for friction braking. Tread brake systems are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread <b>brakes</b> <b>demands</b> knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended braking, braking temperatures, brake block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of wheels due to tread braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale brake rig tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the braked wheel. The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material. The developed methodology is employed in parametric studies. These consist of braking load cases characterised by operational parameters such as axle load, maximum vehicle speed, deceleration, block material, and initial wheel temperature. Damage evolution in the wheel tread is studied. A strong infuence of high temperatures on rolling contact fatigue formation in the wheel tread was observed. In particular, braking temperatures over 450 °C can result in a very short life up to crack initiation.

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} {{goal in the}} field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) is to provide driving aids aimed at preventing accidents and reducing the number of traffic victims. The commonest traffic accidents in urban areas are due to sudden <b>braking</b> that <b>demands</b> a very fast response on the part of drivers.

40|$|As {{people have}} begun to pay more {{attention}} to energy conservation and emission reduction in recent years, anti-idling has become a growing concern for automobile engineers due to the low efficiency and high emissions caused by engine idling, i. e., the engine is running when the vehicle is not moving. Currently, different technologies and products have emerged in an effort to minimize engine idling. By studying and comparing most of these methods, the conclusion can be drawn that there is still much room to improve existing anti-idling technologies and products. As a result, the optimized Regenerative Auxiliary Power System (RAPS) is proposed. Service vehicles usually refer to a class of vehicles that are used for special purposes, such as public buses, delivery trucks, and long-haul trucks. Among them, there are vehicles with auxiliary devices such as air conditioning or refrigeration (A/C-R) systems that are essential to be kept running regardless of the vehicle motion. In addition, such auxiliary systems usually account for a large portion of fuel from the tank. Food delivery trucks, tourist buses, and cement trucks are examples of such service vehicles. As a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, these vehicles sometimes have to frequently idle to for example keep people comfortable, and keep food fresh on loading and unloading stops. This research is intended to develop and implement a novel RAPS for such service vehicles with the A/C-R system as the main auxiliary device. The proposed RAPS can not only electrify the auxiliary systems to achieve anti-idling but also use regenerative braking energy to power them. As the main power consuming device, the A/C-R system should be treated carefully in terms of its efficiency and performance. Thus, the developments of an advanced controller for A/C-R system to minimize energy consumption and an optimum power management system to maximize the overall efficiency of the RAPS are the primary objectives of this thesis. In this thesis, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed based on a new A/C-R simplified model to minimize the power consumption while meeting the temperature requirements. The controller is extensively validated under both common and frosting conditions. Meanwhile, after integrating the RAPS into a service vehicle, its powertrain turns into a parallel hybrid system due to the addition of an energy storage system (ESS). For the sake of maximizing the overall efficiency, RAPS requires a power management controller to determine the power flow between different energy sources. As a result, a predictive power management controller is developed to achieve this objective, where a regenerative iv braking control strategy is developed to meet the driver’s <b>braking</b> <b>demand</b> while recovering the maximum braking energy when vehicles brake. For the implementation of the above controllers, a holistic controller of the RAPS is designed to deal with the auxiliary power minimization and power management simultaneously so as to maximize the overall energy efficiency and meet the high nonlinearities and wide operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|The brake {{architecture}} of hybrid and full electric vehicle includes the distinctive function of brake blending. Known approaches {{draw upon the}} maximum energy recuperation strategy and neglect the operation mode of friction brakes. Within this framework, an efficient control of the blending functions is demanded to compensate external disturbances induced by unpredictable variations of the pad disc friction coefficient. In addition, the control demand distribution between the conventional frictional brake system and the electric motors can incur failures that compromise the frictional braking performance and safety. However, deviation of friction coefficient value given in controller from actual one can induce undesirable deterioration of brake control functions. The main objective of the presented study is to propose a method to compensate disturbances induced by variations of brake linings friction coefficient through modifications of the <b>brake</b> torque <b>demand</b> for the enhancement of both brake performance and active safety.

In contrast, the magnetostrictive brake, which would have about the same dimensions and the same torque rating {{as those of the}} magnetic fail-safe <b>brake,</b> would <b>demand</b> only about 2 W of power for disengagement. The brake (see figure) would include a stationary base plate and a hub mounted on the base plate. Two solenoid assemblies would be mounted in diametrically opposed recesses in the hub. The cores of the solenoids would be made of the magnetostrictive alloy Terfenol-D or equivalent. The rotating part of the brake would be a ring-and spring- disk subassembly. By means of leaf springs not shown in the figure, this subassembly would be coupled with the shaft that the brake is meant to restrain. With no power supplied to the solenoids, a permanent magnet would pull axially on a stepped disk and on a shelf in the hub, causing the ring to be squeezed axially between the stepped disk and the hub. The friction associated with this axial squeeze would effect the braking action. Supplying electric power to the solenoids would cause the magnetostrictive cylinders to push radially inward against a set of wedges that would be in axial contact with the stepped disk. The wedges would convert the radial magnetostrictive strain to a multiplied axial displacement of the stepped disk. This axial displacement would be just large enough to lift the stepped disk, against the permanent magnetic force, out of contact with the ring. The ring would then be free to turn because it would no longer be squeezed axially between the stepped disk and the hub...|$|R

Within the organization the project is known as ‘EVBB project’ which stands for; ‘Electric Vehicle Blended Braking’. A blended brake control merges a regenerative brake system with a friction brake system. The aim is to get a better understanding regarding to what extent a regenerative brake system is capable of recovering energy and how it will affect vehicle stability and maneuverability. The variable torque and power limitations of the electric motor require a brake-by-wire system that can apply the remaining brake torque to fulfill the total <b>brake</b> torque <b>demanded</b> by the driver. Proper brake torque proportioning and the working area of the electric motor are visualized by means of brake force distribution plots. Simulations are performed for a mild parallel hybrid electric vehicle with a separate axle drive train. The drive train has a 30 [kW] electric motor mounted on the rear axle. A two track model with electric power train has been developed. The simulation results are based on this 7 DOF planar vehicle model, meaning that any pitch and roll motion of the vehicle body is excluded. The vehicle model has a closed-loop torque control, enabling velocity tracking of driving cycles. The control of lateral dynamics by means of the steering input is open-loop. A method of ‘non-linear tyre force estimation’ by means of look-up tables, based upon Pacejka’s Magic Formulas, has been used. Simulation results of two proposed control strategies show that rear wheel regenerative braking is effective. A control that initially biases the brake torque to the rear axle is able to recuperate 90 % of the brake energy on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Controlling the 30 [kW] regenerative brake system conforming to the ideal brake force distribution diminishes the power limitations of the electric motor.

Alloy is an excellent conductor of heat, improving heat dissipation from the brakes, reducing the risk of <b>brake</b> failure under <b>demanding</b> driving conditions. At present four wheeler wheels are made of Aluminum Alloys. In this project, Aluminum alloy are comparing with other Alloy. In this project a parametric model is designed for Alloy wheel used in four wheeler by collecting data from reverse engineering process from existing model. Design is evaluated by analyzing the model by taking the constraints as ultimate stresses and variables as two different alloy materials and different loads and goals as maximum outer diameter of the wheel and fitting accessories areas like shaft of the axle and bolts PCD of the car.

5000|$|Having conquered Formula 1, Mercedes-Benz had {{now turned}} its {{attention}} to sports-car racing. Their cars, designated W196S although they were commonly called 300SLRs, rated by many experts as the best sports cars in the world, were an adaptation of the design that had brought them dominance in Grand Prix racing. The fuel-injected, desmodronic valve 3-litre straight-8 engine was the most advanced of the entire field, sharing many details with the F1 car. It produced a 300 bhp and was mounted at an angle of 33°. The inboard drum brakes, however, were only questionably adequate for the heavier chassis, facing the tough <b>braking</b> and endurance <b>demands</b> of Le Mans. To compensate, a hand-operated air brake {{was added to the}} rear deck for high speed braking. Team manager Alfred Neubauer, in a remarkably diplomatic move (recalling that the war had only ended a bare 10 years earlier), assembled a multi-national team for the race: pairing his two best drivers Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss in the lead car, 1952 race-winner Karl Kling with Frenchman André Simon (both also in the current F1 team) and American John Fitch with one of the elder statesmen of French motor-racing Pierre Levegh. It had been [...] "Levegh's" [...] epic solo drive in the 1952 race which failed in the last hour, which gave Mercedes-Benz their fortuitous first victory. (Belgian racing-journalist Paul Frère had originally been approached but he had signed to drive for Aston Martin this year) ...|$|R
5000|$|Larry Perkins, who had {{continued}} to race the well developed VK rather than upgrade to the VL (which both Brock and Allan Grice reported small teething problems throughout the 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship), was forced to replace his VK when it was badly damaged on just the second lap at Bathurst with a HDT VL, debuting VL in the Bob Jane T-Marts 500 WTCC round at Calder Park Raceway a week after Bathurst. He later qualified his new car on pole and led the early laps of the Group A support race for the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide before tyre wear and failing <b>brakes</b> on the <b>demanding</b> Adelaide Street Circuit forced him to drop back to 3rd at the finish. In the 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship Perkins ran the VL as the official factory team backed by the then new Holden Special Vehicles (later {{to be replaced by}} the Holden Racing Team). Against the lighter (by approximately 225 kg) and more powerful (by up to [...] ) Ford Sierras, as well of the introduction of the new Nissan Skyline GTS-R turbo, Perkins and the VL simply didn't have the speed to successfully compete for wins in the ATCC's shorter sprint races, while the weight of the car (1325 kg) usually saw heavy tyre wear. His best result being 3rd in Round 7 at Sandown after some of the faster Sierras had struck mechanical trouble. Perkins would go on to finish 7th overall in the championship.|$|R
40|$|For {{construction}} equipment in general fuel efficiency {{is one of}} the most critical product attributes. Pure fuel economy improvements from the engines are extremely expensive to develop. This creates an incitement for development of hybrid technology. This thesis was done in corporation with CPAC Systems in Gothenburg, Sweden. With regenerative braking, the energy that is normally transferred into heat during braking can be stored in a battery or a super capacitor and the stored energy can later be used for propulsion. However the regenerative braking also affects the vehicle dynamics and the driver’s interpretation of the <b>brake</b> pedal which <b>demands</b> for a physical test platform for testing. In this thesis a test platform for testing of concepts was developed and built and a brake blending system was developed and tested on the test platform. The test platform was built in small scale compared to a full wheel loader with an articulated rideable lawn mower as base. A small scale test platform has the benefits of fast and easy testing and much lower cost compared to a full scale wheel loader. The test platform is equipped with individual wheel motors and a mechanical brake system based on brakes from a motorcycle. The first step in the development of the control system for the test platform was to make Simulink models for the components in the test platform. Models for the overall vehicle, the brakes and the electrical motors were developed. From the models a control strategy was developed to control the requested torque to the electric motors and the requested brake pressure to the brakes from the driver’s inputs. The control strategy was developed in Simulink and from Simulink C-code was automatically generated by the code generation tool TargetLink. All testing including testing of the brake blending system was performed on the test platform. The result of this thesis is a test platform that is built to emulate a small scale hybrid wheel loader. The test platform is expandable and can be used to test other concepts, for example steer-by-wire. The other result of the thesis is a brake blending system that is combining electrical and mechanical braking with good pedal feeling, no wheel lock and high energy regeneration...|$|R
5000|$|Due to misting and exhaust obstructing the driver's {{view through}} the window, the driver drove leaning {{out of the}} cab for much of the time. A side effect of this was that it made hearing the AWS sounder harder, as well as {{observation}} of a flashing light fitted in the cab to remind a driver of an AWS warning. Approaching signal SN43, there was a temporary speed restriction of 85 mph, which was warned of by a temporary AWS magnet in advance of the restriction, and indicated by a sign {{at the start of the}} temporary speed restriction. The train approached signal SN43 at 59 mph and passed over the temporary AWS magnet. The driver failed to react to the warning given within the time allowed and the brakes were applied. Because the AWS isolating cock was out of reach of the driver, he instructed the fireman to open it for him. The train's speed had reduced by about 8 mph when the brakes were released. The rules require that the train is brought to a stand and the signaller contacted in the event of an AWS brake application. Additionally the driver must inform the signaller whenever the AWS is isolated;"Driver: If it becomes necessary to isolate the AWS, you must:* stop your train immediately* tell the signaller* not move the train until instructed to do so* carry out the instructions given." [...] The train then passed signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. The driver acknowledged the AWS warning, but did not reduce speed.In the twelve seconds between brake application and brake release, the train passed over the fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. This warning was cancelled in time. The train then passed over the TPWS+ overspeed sensor for signal SN45, which was displaying a red (danger) aspect. As the train was travelling more slowly than the trigger speed, no <b>brake</b> action was <b>demanded</b> from the train. The train then passed over the second TPWS overspeed sensor for signal SN45, this time at 53 mph, which was in excess of the 45 mph trigger speed. Consequently, a TPWS intervention occurred, but as the AWS isolating cock was open the brakes did not apply. When the driver saw that signal SN45 was at danger, he applied the brakes on the train. Due to there being insufficient distance to stop, the train overran the signal by 550 m and came to a stand across Wootton Basset Junction.|$|R
