50|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the bank was looking for {{opportunities}} outside Chile.

The Bank of Tarapacá and Argentina carved out a niche in business with Belgium, cooperating with <b>Belgian</b> <b>banks</b> and securing <b>accounts</b> from <b>Belgian</b> firms.

40|$|Abstract. The {{services}} offered by Internet Data Centers involve {{the provision of}} storage, bandwidth and computational resources. A common business model is to charge consumers on a pay-per-use basis where they periodically pay for the resources they have consumed (as opposed to a fixed charge for service provision). The pay-per-use model {{raises the question of}} how to measure resource consumption. Currently, a widely used accounting mechanism is provider-side accounting where the provider unilaterally measures the consumer’s resource consumption and presents the latter with a bill. A serious limitation of this approach is that it does not offer the consumer sufficient means of performing reasonableness checks to verify that the provider is not accidentally or maliciously overcharging. To address the problem the paper develops <b>bilateral</b> <b>accounting</b> models where both consumer and provider independently measure resource consumption, verify the equity of the accounting process and try to resolve potential conflicts emerging from the independently produced results. The paper discusses the technical issues involved in <b>bilateral</b> <b>accounting...</b>|$|R
