5|$|Sinoceratops {{is known}} from the Xingezhuang Formation of {{southern}} China. It is known from skull material. Alongside it, in the formation, lived Shantungosaurus, a very common hadrosaurid to {{which most of the}} material has <b>been</b> <b>assigned,</b> Zhuchengtyrannus, an Asian tyrannosaurid related to Tarbosaurus, Zhuchengceratops, an Asian leptoceratopsid, and Huaxiaosaurus, a possible older individual of Shantungosaurus.

5|$|Ampelosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae were examined.

All the material has <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E

3000|$|The {{first step}} in the test {{assembly}} is to determine the number of blocks and the assignment of items to those blocks. The function block_design facilitates this process with two required arguments and one optional argument. The n_blocks argument specifies the number of blocks while the item_parameters argument takes a data frame of item parameters. The default allocation of items to blocks is a spiraling design. For 1, 2, [...]..., H item blocks, the first item <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 1, item 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to the block 2, and item H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block H. The process is continued such that item H+ 1 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 1, item H+ 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 2 and item H+H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block H until all items <b>are</b> <b>assigned</b> to a block.|$|R

5|$|P. gobiensis {{is named}} for the region it was found in 2001, and first {{described}} by Sereno, Zhao and Lin in 2010. It is known from a skull and partial articulated skeleton with gastroliths. Many other specimens either cannot be determined to belong to any particular species, or have not yet <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to one. These specimens are generally all referred to as Psittacosaurus sp., {{although it is not}} assumed that they belong to the same species. More than 200 specimens of Psittacosaurus have been found in the Yixian Formation, which is famous for its fossils of feathered dinosaurs. The vast majority of these have not <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to any published species, although many are very well preserved and some have already been partially described. Nearly 100 Psittacosaurus skeletons were excavated in Mongolia during the summers of 2005 and 2006 by a team led by Mongolian paleontologist Bolortsetseg Minjin and American Jack Horner from the Museum of the Rockies in Montana. Although only P. mongoliensis has been described from Mongolia so far, these specimens are still in preparation and have not yet <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to a species.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the Sangam age Tamil {{country were}} ruled over by several {{independent}} chieftains, alongside the three crowned monarchs.

Based on the legends some of these coins have <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the obverse have <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the obverse. Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE and 100 CE.|$|E
