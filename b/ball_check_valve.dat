50|$|If the {{wireline}} were {{to become}} severed from the tool, a <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> can seal the well off from the surface. During wireline operations, a steel ball sits {{to the side of}} a confined area within the grease head while the cable runs {{in and out of the}} hole. If the wireline exits that confined area under pressure, the pressure will force the steel ball up towards the hole where the wireline had been. The ball's diameter is larger than that of the hole, so the ball effectively seals off pressure to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{check valve}} in which the closing member, the movable part to block the flow, is a ball. In some ball check valves, the ball is {{spring-loaded}} to help keep it shut. For those designs without a spring, reverse flow is required to move the ball toward the seat and create a seal. The interior surface of the main seats of ball check valves {{are more or less}} conically-tapered to guide the ball into the seat and form a positive seal when stopping reverse flow.|$|E
50|$|There are {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using bailers for groundwater sampling. Bailers are simple devices to use and are relatively inexpensive. Disposable bailers are usually cleaned to United States Environmental Protection Agency specifications and individually packaged to protect sample integrity. In addition, bailers can be lowered to any depth while pumps have sharp limitations on {{the depth of the}} well. The main drawback of using bailers is aeration of the water as the sample is obtained, which could release volatile organic compounds that need to be tested. Also, if there is a high amount of sediment or turbidity, this may interfere with the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> seating correctly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> such as <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent back-flow.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic jacks use <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> {{to build}} {{pressure}} on the lifting side of the jack.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are similar}} <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> where the disc {{is not a}} ball, but some other shape, such as a poppet {{energized}} by a spring. <b>Ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> {{should not be confused}} with ball valves, which is a different type of valve in which a ball acts as a controllable rotor to stop or direct flow.|$|R
50|$|A bailer in {{hydrogeology}} is {{a hollow}} tube used to retrieve groundwater samples from monitoring wells. Groundwater monitoring wells are drilled {{in areas where}} there are underground storage tanks or where there is environmental remediation occurring. The wells are typically built out of PVC casing which is slotted to allow groundwater to flow freely through the well. Bailers are tied {{to a piece of}} rope (usually made from nylon or polypropylene) or a piece of wire (composed of Teflon or stainless steel) and lowered into the water column. Once lowered, the bailer uses a simple <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> to seal at the bottom in order to pull up a sample of the groundwater table. Bailers can be disposable or reusable, and they are made out of polyethylene, PVC, FEP or stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|A disc or {{valve member}} is a movable {{obstruction}} inside the stationary body that adjustably restricts {{flow through the}} valve. Although traditionally disc-shaped, discs come in various shapes. Depending {{on the type of}} valve, a disc can move linearly inside a valve, or rotate on the stem (as in a butterfly valve), or rotate on a hinge or trunnion (as in a check valve). A ball is a round valve member with one or more paths between ports passing through it. By rotating the ball, flow can be directed between different ports. Ball valves use spherical rotors with a cylindrical hole drilled as a fluid passage. Plug valves use cylindrical or conically tapered rotors called plugs. Other round shapes for rotors are possible as well in rotor valves, as long as the rotor can be turned inside the valve body. However, not all round or spherical discs are rotors; for example, a <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> uses the ball to block reverse flow, but is not a rotor because operating the valve does not involve rotation of the ball.|$|E
40|$|In a water {{distribution}} system, Flow Control Valve {{is used to}} control the flow rate in the pipeline connections. In this thesis, a fixed flow control valve is investigated to reduce the flow rate and set to deliver the pre-set flow of 5 - 6 LPM (litre per minute). Which helps to distribute the water for a maximum period and maintains the usage only for the drinking purpose. A geometry of FCV with a <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is implemented, where the ball check helps to stop the back flow of the fluid from the valve. Detailed inspection of dynamic changes in pressure and flow velocity in the valve are conducted through simulation. The study of fluid properties describes the expected design and specifies the flow structure in the valve. The results of this project demonstrate a good performance of the design-build and influence the requirements. The obtained values in the simulation, analytical and experimental results are compatible, which concludes the survey of FCV is equipped to custom...|$|E
50|$|Multiple <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> can be {{connected}} in series. For example, a double <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{is often used}} as a backflow prevention device to keep potentially contaminated water from siphoning back into municipal water supply lines. There are also double <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> {{in which there are}} two ball/seat combinations sequentially in the same body to ensure positive leak-tight shutoff when blocking reverse flow; and piston <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> wafer <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> and ball-and-cone <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> {{are often}} very small, simple, and cheap. They are {{commonly}} used in liquid or gel minipump dispenser spigots, spray devices, some rubber bulbs for pumping air, etc., manual air pumps and some other pumps, and refillable dispensing syringes. Although the balls are most often made of metal, they can be made of other materials; in some specialized cases out of highly durable or inert materials, such as sapphire. High pressure HPLC pumps and similar applications commonly use small inlet and outlet <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> with both <b>balls</b> and seats made of artificial ruby, for both hardness and chemical resistance. After prolonged use, such <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> can eventually wear out or the seat can develop a crack, requiring replacement. Therefore, such valves are made to be replaceable, sometimes placed in a small plastic body tightly-fitted inside a metal fitting which can withstand high pressure and which is screwed into the pump head.|$|R

50|$|Pumps used in {{high-pressure}} chromatography such as HPLC and {{ion chromatography}} are much like small piston metering pumps. For wear resistance and chemical resistance to solvents, etc., typically the pistons {{are made of}} artificial sapphire and the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> have ruby <b>balls</b> and sapphire seats. To produce good chromatograms, it is desirable to have a pumping flow rate as constant as possible. Either a single piston pump with a quick refill is used or a double pump head with coordinated piston strokes is used to provide as constant a pumping rate as possible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{patent for}} the Zerk fitting was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the {{assignee}} was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation (thus the eponymous {{names for the}} fittings). Alemite was already marketing <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for OEM installations and for aftermarket upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock grease cups. But Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these grease fittings.|$|R
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> often <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{due to the}} ageing in Japanese {{society and}} the {{decreasing}} birthrate, an important problem of providing nursing care for the elderly has occurred. As a result, {{it is necessary to}} develop wearable systems to aid in nursing care. To realize the system, we require not only wearable soft actuators, but also compact and flexible control valve that can drive the soft actuator such as a pneumatic artificial muscle. The purpose of our study is to develop a flexible, lightweight and compact control valve which can be safe enough to be attached to the human body. In this study, we proposed and tested a new type of control valve. The valve consists of a vibration motor and a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> that made of a steel ball and an orifice in flexible tube. The operating principle of the valve is as follows. The valve is normally closed as a function of <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> When the vibration is applied, the inner <b>ball</b> in the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> moves and the valve opens. By giving continuous vibration, the valve can keep open. As a result, we find that the valve can control the relatively larger flow rate compared to their weight and size...|$|R

40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valve</b> in a {{pipeline}} {{is supposed to}} prevent the reverse flow and to allow the flow in the positive direction.

40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> for <b>checking</b> reverse {{water flows}} in {{drainage}} systems sometimes make large impacts through their sudden closure caused by accidental cutoff of drain pumps.
