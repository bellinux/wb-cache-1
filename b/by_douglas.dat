5|$|Another major {{influence}} {{in his work}} was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T.A.Richardson and James Harrison and {{it came to be}} developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and <b>by</b> <b>Douglas.</b> Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use <b>by</b> <b>Douglas</b> of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.|$|E

5|$|Around May 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that Stone had {{turned down the}} opportunity to direct the film, even after months of being pressured to do so <b>by</b> <b>Douglas,</b> among others.

Bryan Burrough received credit as a consultant, and may have done uncredited work on the story.|$|E

5|$|Shada was a six-part serial written <b>by</b> <b>Douglas</b> Adams {{that was}} to have {{concluded}} Series 17 in 1980.
