5|$|A Canonical Coronation (Latin: Coronatam Canonicus): is a pious {{institutional}} {{act of the}} Pope, {{on behalf}} of a devotion. This tradition still stands in 2015, in 2014 Pope Francis crowned Our Lady of Immaculate Conception of Juquila.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the major tests, {{a large number of}} minor trials were also carried out, from June 1955 and extended through to April 1963.

These minor tests left a dangerous legacy of radioactive contamination at Maralinga.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} {{removal of the}} parathyroid may have <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 1928 by medical doctor Isaac Y Olch, whose intern had noticed elevated calcium levels in an elderly patient with muscle weakness.

5|$|All {{specimens}} of Ocepeia {{come from the}} Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a phosphate basin. Research on Ocepeia has <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by French and Moroccan researchers led by Dr. Emmanuel Gheerbrant of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Ocepeia fossils have been recovered from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens. Some of the original material was collected on-site as early as 1997, while other material was obtained from fossil dealers.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{maintenance program}} intended {{to extend the}} service lives of M249s has <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> to refurbish rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models {{and is no longer}} present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{the church}} on this site {{was used as a}} chapel of ease to Llantrisant church. In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built to serve as a chapel of ease for St Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted that St Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration work had <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by local people. St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E

5|$|Before his {{execution}} {{a convicted felon}} was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods. After the sentence had <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light.

Studies have <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work had <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and there may have been some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E
50|$|A {{third wave}} of surveys <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 1995-97, {{this time in}} 55 {{societies}} and with increased attention being given to analysing the cultural conditions for democracy. A fourth wave of surveys <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 1999-2001 in 65 societies. A key goal was to obtain better coverage of African and Islamic societies, which had been under-represented in previous surveys. A fifth wave <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 2005-07 and a sixth wave <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> during 2011-12.|$|R

5|$|First {{described}} in 1829, the species {{has long been}} prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both recreational and commercial fishermen in New South Wales and Queensland. The sand whiting fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research has <b>been</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on the species, especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture.|$|E
