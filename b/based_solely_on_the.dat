5|$|This classically {{designed}} wing {{has been}} attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d'Evercy, also in Somerset, it seems to be <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> alternating segmental and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and ignoring the irregularities in their spacings and placings, which Jones is unlikely to have countenanced.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's judiciary, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, {{includes}} the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts. Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence. This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.|$|E
5|$|Oneworld {{has three}} premium status levels—Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald—based on the customer's tier {{status in the}} member airline's frequent-flyer program. Emerald status is the highest level in each member's programme, {{and all of the}} statuses are {{recognised}} by each of the member airlines. The premium statuses have no specific requirements of their own; membership is <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frequent-flyer programs of the individual member airline. Alliance benefits are only available to passengers on scheduled flights that are both operated and marketed by a member airline.|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} semidefinite rank of a nonnegative (m× n) -matrix S is {{the minimum}} number q such that there exist positive semidefinite (q× q) -matrices A_ 1, [...] .,A_m, B_ 1, [...] .,B_n such that S(k,ℓ) = tr(A_k^* B_ℓ). The most important, lower bound technique for nonnegative rank is <b>solely</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{support of the}} matrix S, i. e., its zero/non-zero pattern.

5|$|Tintin memorabilia and {{merchandise}} {{has allowed}} {{a chain of}} stores <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character to become viable. The first shop was launched in 1984 in Covent Garden, London. Tintin shops have also opened in both Bruges and Brussels in Belgium, and in Montpellier, France. In 2014, a Tintin shop opened in Taguig, the Philippines, only the second {{of its kind in}} Southeast Asia. The first Tintin shop in Southeast Asia opened in Singapore in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the two {{previous}} Transformers installments, which were <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> script writers' endemic story, Transformers: Dark of the Moon {{was based on a}} novel called , written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel is a prequel to the 2007 film Transformers. It follows the same story structure as Dark of the Moon, being set in 1969, the year of Apollo 11. The story structure differs slightly, though, because the novel was written merely as prequel to the first film.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E
50|$|Like in many {{previous}} {{editions of}} EMA, the public televote {{and the jury}} awarded conflicting scores. This caused some controversy, because the strongest televote favorite Natalija Verboten, received 0 points from the jury. Similarly, Bepop in 2003, Karmen Stavec in 2002, and Tinkara Kovač in 1999 were also televote favorites. These entries usually came 2nd, or failed {{to qualify for the}} semifinals, because the points awarded by the jury outweighed the points they received from the televotes.The controversy resulted in the 2005 EMA scores <b>basing</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> results of the televote.|$|R

5|$|Players {{are first}} {{brought to the}} options screen, where the {{starting}} level, game speed, and music can be chosen. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three-game speed options change how fast the capsules fall within the bottle. The player's score is <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elimination of viruses and the chosen game speed, with bonus points for clearing more than 1 in a single line. After level 20 you can still accumulate points {{but the number of}} viruses to clear remains the same.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{itself is}} composed of two rounds. In round one, all 40 qualified athletes complete a single jump in the aforementioned World Cup order. After points for distance and style are achieved, only the top 30 scorers from the first round proceed to the second, while the rest are eliminated from the event. In round two, the starting order is instead <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> points gained in the first round: the lowest scoring athlete jumps first, while the leader has the very last jump of the competition. The athlete with the most points from both rounds wins that competition. For the second competition, the starting order for round one uses {{the results from the}} first competition – no longer based on World Cup ranking – with athletes again jumping in ascending order of points. After the second (and final) round, the athlete with the most points accumulated from both competitions is declared the Ski Flying World Champion.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but {{he was unable to}} act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her {{a false sense of security}} while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
50|$|The year 1835 {{is usually}} {{regarded}} as founding {{year of the}} Squire Corps.

5|$|The multi-genus {{approach}} is <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{structure of the}} male flowers; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another. Four of the genera—Attalea (in a narrow sense), Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea—correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus. However, a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types, including A.colenda (which Glassman placed in its own genus, Ynesa) {{and this has been}} used as an argument for the single-genus approach. In addition, there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under Glassman's five-genus system, which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus. In 2009 Alan Meerow and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subtribe which found that some species placed in Orbignya were actually more closely related to species placed in Scheelea than they were to other members of that genus (if the five-genus approach was used), while A.crassispatha, placed in Orbignya by Glassman, was actually a sister to both Scheelea and Orbignya.|$|E

Hornblower was made a captain in 1805; thus, seniority should not have brought promotion to Hornblower until the mid-1830s or later.|$|R

25|$|In 1981, {{zoologist}} Walter Ferguson {{argued in}} favour of lupaster being a subspecies of grey wolf based on cranial measurements, stating that the classing of the animal as a jackal was <b>based</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> animal's small size, and predated the discovery of C. l. arabs, which is intermediate in size between C. l. lupus and lupaster.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{completely}} automated optimization strategy which combines the classical Markowitz mean-variance portfolio theory with a recently proposed test for structural breaks in co- variance matrices. With respect to equity portfolios, global minimum-variance optimizations, which <b>base</b> <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> covariance matrix, yield considerable results in previous studies. However, nancial assets cannot {{be assumed to}} have a constant covariance matrix over longer periods of time. Hence, we estimate the covariance matrix of the assets by respecting potential change points. The resulting approach resolves issues like timing or determining a sample for parameter estimation. Moreover, we apply the approach to two datasets and compare the results to relevant benchmark techniques {{by means of an}} out-of-sample study. It is shown that the new approach outperforms equally weighted portfolios and plain minimum-variance portfolios on average...|$|R
