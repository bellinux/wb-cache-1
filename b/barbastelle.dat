50|$|Ebernoe Common is a {{national}} nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest. Managed by the Sussex Wildlife Trust, it includes ancient woodland, glades and ponds, and supports a diversity of plants and animals, including 14 out of 16 species of bat which occur in the UK, including the rare Bechstein's and <b>Barbastelle</b> bats. Adjoining farmland has been purchased with a grant from Restore UK which {{will be allowed to}} revert to pasture woodland over a long period with managed grazing by cattle. The <b>Barbastelle</b> bats need old dying trees with loose bark for their roosts and travel great distances along traditional flight lines to feed over damp meadows, which may be as much as 20 kilometres from the roost, in the Arun and Rother valleys. Local landowners are being encouraged to maintain and enhance continuous tree cover along these routes so that the bats can travel out on summer evenings, avoiding predation by sparrow hawks.|$|E
