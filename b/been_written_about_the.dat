When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp {{to keep it from}} floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

25|$|Much {{has been}} written in books about the first two of the {{preceding}} branches of the Forcade family.

Much less has <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> third of the preceding branches, or about the Forcades of Orthez themselves. Whereas the first two branches were required at various times throughout history to prove their lineage from the family in Orthez, many generations or several hundred years earlier, the third branch and {{the core of the}} family, who are essentially one and the same, had little difficulty proving their lineage. During the 17th century, the third branch and the core of the family were still geographically situated in or near Orthez and Pau.|$|E
