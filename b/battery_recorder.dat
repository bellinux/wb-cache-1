50|$|In 1988 Kurt Smith founded KH Smith Co and {{developed}} and had manufactured several electronic controls for {{material handling equipment}} many that are still in use today. Products include a CC-1292 a charger retrofit control for single phase chargers, the first charger monitoring system to indicate the next battery to put in service based upon state of charge known as the Multiple Charger Monitoring system MCM100 developed in 1990. Other products include {{one of the first}} <b>battery</b> data <b>recorders</b> developed in 1988 and used to record cycles and events on forklift batteries, the distribution was later sold to Anderson Power Products a leading international supplier of battery connectors. A Charge Discharge Controller CDC-886 was developed in 1986 and is used on industrial vehicles to extend the life of batteries by better controlling the charging and discharge of the batteries. KH Smith Co became part of Energy Products in 1991.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} noise wave {{is the key to}} effective noise control in a tunnel. In this paper, an IP based audio test network is presented. This network includes 100 <b>battery</b> powered <b>recorders</b> and a WIFI network. Each recorder can acquire 2 channels of audio waves and be triggered by external signals of infrared or electrical synchronic pulse. A main control computer connects these recorders to setup parameters and collect data via the WIFI network. Sensors are reassembled to be compatible with the interface of standard sound source. Meanwhile each sensor is fixed in a sensor holder, which can be placed to any position on a plane and can be used to adjust its sensor to 0 - 180 degrees in both of X-Y direction. The sound source generates various signals, such as clicks, tones, and tone bursts, to help understand how the sound propagates in tunnels. This designed network is capable of acquiring multipoint sound waves synchronously...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} very costly to perform in-space and atmospheric entry experiments. This paper presents a new platform - the Pico Reentry Probe (PREP) - {{that we believe}} will make targeted flight-tests and planetary atmospheric probe science missions considerably more affordable. Small, lightweight, self-contained, it is designed as a "launch and forget" system, suitable for experiments that require no ongoing communication with the ground. It contains a data <b>recorder,</b> <b>battery,</b> transmitter, and user-customized instrumentation. Data recorded during reentry or space operations is returned at end-of-mission via transmission to Iridium satellites (in the case of earth-based operations) or a similar orbiting communication system for planetary missions. This paper discusses possible applications of this concept for Earth and Martian atmospheric entry science. Two well-known heritage aerodynamic shapes are considered as candidates for PREP: the shape developed for the Planetary Atmospheric Experiment Test (PAET) and that for the Deep Space II Mars Probe...|$|R
40|$|The Viking Mars landers to be {{launched}} in 1975 will carry experiments in biology, planetology, and atmospheric physics. A terminal dry-heat sterilization process using an inert gas was chosen to meet planetary quarantine requirements and preclude contamination of the biology experiment by terrestrial organisms. Deep sterilization is performed at the component level and terminal surface sterilization at the system level. Solutions to certain component problems relating to sterilization are discussed, involving the gyroscope, tape <b>recorder,</b> <b>battery,</b> electronic circuitry, and outgassing. Heat treatment placed special requirements on electronic packaging, including fastener preload monitoring and solder joints. Chemical and physical testing of nonmetallic materials was performed to establish data on their behavior in heat-treatment and vacuum environments. A Thermal Effects Test Model and a Proof Test Capsule were used. It is concluded that a space vehicle can be designed and fabricated to withstand heat sterilization requirements...|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} {{back in the}} summer of 1991. Skipper Hartley moved from the Computer Science and {{mathematics}} program at Emory University to a short-term position in a research laboratory in Naples, Italy. In Atlanta, Hartley and fellow guitarist Richie Edelson had planted the seeds of the 'Nut in the moist confines of a rehearsal cubicle. By the following January, they were working Atlanta clubs with a slow-morphing line-up that included Katie Walters singing timidly offstage and the notorious Elephants Gerald tweaking a <b>battery</b> of tape <b>recorders</b> and Dictaphones, a bricolage of gear that hardly suggested the sampler stylings that would become the band's trademark. Hartley's old bandmate Chris Collins was shipped in from Columbia, South Carolina, to play bass, and several drummers came and went. Toenut broke onto the Atlanta music scene and college radio rotations, and established a reputation of interesting and innovative music-making. The Point, a small music venue in Little Five Points, became their main stamping ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} was 3-axis stabilized with {{a momentum}} wheel {{that was used}} to establish stability about the nominal rotation, or z-axis. The orientation of the z-axis could be altered over a period of hours using magnetic torque coils that interacted with the Earth's magnetic field. Solar panels charged batteries during the daylight portion of each orbit, so that SAS 3 had essentially no expendables to limit its lifetime beyond the life of the tape <b>recorders,</b> <b>batteries,</b> and orbital drag. The spacecraft typically operated in a rotating mode, spinning at one revolution per 95-min orbit, so that the LEDs, tube and slat collimator experiments, which looked out along the y-axis, could view and scan the sky almost continuously. The rotation could also be stopped, allowing extended (up to 30 min) pointed observations of selected sources by the y-axis instruments. Data were recorded on board by magnetic tape recorders, and played back during station passes every orbit.|$|R
40|$|Just {{over two}} years ago, I began to {{document}} {{what life was like}} for my foremothers. My plan was to speak with as many women as I could, and to tape record our conversations. Before beginning my research, I read books about tape-recorded interviews, books about the history of Creoles in Louisiana, books about genealogy, and how to trace a family tree. I remember how organized I was; I read all the right books and knew all the right questions to ask. I bought just the right notepads and pens, and made sure I had extra <b>batteries</b> for my <b>recorder,</b> extra film for my camera. It was helpful to read books before beginning my research; but, when I look back on the past two years - on the long drives to Mississippi and Louisiana, the late-night, sometimes tearful interviews, the funny group interviews, the hotels, the uncomfortable questions I had to ask, and the candid answers I received - I realize that no book could ever have prepared me for this life-changing journey...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a Super-deep-sea self-popup Ocean Bottom Seismometer (SDOBS) that can be deployed to the ocean floor up to 9, 000 m depth. Because the maximum applicable water depth of a conventional self-popup Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) is 6, 000 m, some areas have remained inaccessible to seismic surveys, such as the deep part of Japan Trench, where the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in 2011. Using a ceramic pressure-tight sphere, {{we were able to}} develop a SDOBS that has almost identical size, weight, and buoyancy to those of a conventional self-popup OBS using a glass sphere. Regarding the acoustic transponder, which is a key device for the development of SDOBSes. We heighten the transmitting acoustic level of an existing acoustic transponder to raise the positioning accuracy. Detailed results of sea tests conducted to evaluate the acoustic transponder performance are described herein. We used the same built-in seismometers, <b>recorders,</b> <b>batteries,</b> and other equipment as those used for conventional OBSes. We also report that by improving the test procedures, we were able to heighten the measurement accuracy of the uniaxial compressive strength of ceramics, which are important parameters to determine the applicable hydraulic pressure. We {{have developed}} seven SDOBSes to date, and have deployed 18 SDOBSes cumulatively for seismic surveys in the Japan Trench and Ryukyu Trench...|$|R
40|$|Device {{therapy for}} {{conduction}} abnormalities, heart failure, primary or secondary SCD preventions is under delivered to requiring patients. Most {{of these devices}} are implanted at tertiary care centers in major cities of most countries. This makes the availability of these guideline guided therapies to {{a very small percentage}} of needy patients. Implant of such devices at a secondary hospital (without a cardiac cath lab) with training of previously novice hospital staff and available resources as well as support of the industry is an alternative and very viable option to have such important therapy delivered to requiring patients. The usage of simple-readily available-C-arm in operating theatre (OR) or the interventional radiology suite can be utilized for this purpose. OR nursing staff and radiology technicians can be trained –with help of nursing education department– to help in such procedures over a relatively short period. Technical support utilized from the vendors representatives is an alternative to face the lack of EP technicians in local or international market. The follow up of these patients in OPD can be organized with help of the vendors on regular basis under supervision of trained cardiologist/s. This model can help establish device therapy service at a secondary hospital without huge expenditure on infrastructure or facing the lack of recruitment of specialized technical support that is difficult to find –especially for smaller cities–. We present our experience at a 250 bed secondary hospital, with a relatively small cardiac unit (3 consultants, 5 hospitalists, 10 cardiac ECG/Echo techs) and no cath lab of introduction of this service with the help of nursing education department and vendors supplying these devices as well as OR and radiology departments. Training of radiology technicians and OR nursing staff on the basic procedural support with few in-service demonstration helped prepare adequate staff helping during implant procedures. Requirement of technical support from the vendor –as a condition for purchase of devices– during the implant and follow up clinics helped overcome the lack of EP technicians. After implant of more than 100 different devices (pacemakers, AICD and BiV-AICD) the process became much smoother and easier. A total of 106 procedures (including insertion of PPM, AICD, BiV-AICD and loop <b>recorders,</b> <b>battery</b> change, etc.) were carried out from the start of the program. The immediate complication rate was 6. 6 % (2 pneumothorax, 1 CS dissection, 1 hematoma, 1 lead dislodgement, 1 lidocaine toxicity, 1 PEA) with no mortality. 1. 8 % (2 patients) required intubation during the procedure (lidocaine toxicity, PEA). No device infection related to procedure (upto 6 months) was noticed. Device implant programs can be established with relatively low cost for institutions without cardiac cath lab. In an era of controlling the spiraling costs of medical care, cutting the cost while delivering the guideline guided therapy to needy patients is possible. Our experience can be replicated with success at other smaller centers facing similar challenges...|$|R
40|$|The {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) is {{a technique}} commonly used for detecting symptoms of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, anxiety and learning disabilities that are quite diffused and with {{a great impact on}} people common life. Most of the mentioned mental disorders require long term EEG monitoring, possibly during daily life activities, to follow the course of the disease and sometimes to prevent further degradations of the patient condition. Generally, the longer the EEG measurement period isthe higher is the probability of a successful event detection. Allowing only few hours of observation time with high costs and resource overheads, traditional inpatient ambulatory EEG systems don’t satisfy these requirements. It is only recently that technology innovations have led to new outpatient EEG systems. They are mobile solutions that overcome some of these limitations reducing the overall patient monitoring costs and increasing the effectiveness of the measurements [1]. Despite their benefits, such systems are still cumbersome with some problems related to the electrode-skin adherence, to the data storage capability and to the battery life time. Wearable EEG such as those presented in [2] and [3], are aimed to overcome these issues, allowing the recording of a longer temporal window that includes all stages of sleep and wakefulness and increasing the likelihood of recording typical symptoms. The wearable EEG system proposed in this paper is based on a custom PCB with off-the-shelf components. Being a wearable device, special efforts were made in reducing its power consumption and in device miniaturization. As a result, only the essential components were included in the project: an amplyfing/filtering block, an analog todigital converter, a micro-controller, a bluetooth transceiver and a power management module. The designed system, depicted in Fig. 1, contains a differential 8 channel recording unit. The EEG signals detected with a standard EEG cap are first amplified and then converted into a 24 -bit digital signals by an ADS 1299 from Texas Instrument. Once acquired, digital signals are transmitted to a remote backend by means of a Microchip Bluetooth RN- 42 module. Moreover, a USB connection was introduced to charge the EEG <b>recorder</b> <b>battery</b> and as additional channel for data transfer. A custom firmware was written for a Microchip PIC 18 F 46 J 50 to coordinate data exchange between ADCand Bluetooth or USB external controller. The main constraint was the real time data exchange at sampling frequency up to 2000 SPS. In addition a power management unit generates all digital and analog voltage supplies from a 3. 7 V- 950 mAh LiPo battery. Even the battery charging circuit was implemented on the board. The EEG recorder was realized on the 5. 5 cm X 3. 5 cm double face board depicted in Fig. 2. Possible remote controllers for wearable EEG recording applicationsare the nowadays widely diffused smartphone or tablet. So that an open source and user-friendly software application based, for example, on Android operative system, can be a target solution to interface our EEG recorder. At this first stage of the system development a Visual C++ application was written for the EEG recorder testing purpose. The small dimensions of the realized system and its maximum 270 mW of power consumption make it suitable for up to 13 hours of continuous EEG recording without encumbering any daily life activity. As depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, some in-vivo measurements were performed comparing our device with a standard laboratory equipment...|$|R
