In it, he noted the historic and special significance of Obama becoming the nation's first African American president. In the end, McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama's 365; McCain failed to win most of the <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> and lost some traditionally Republican ones. McCain gained 46percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama's 53percent.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races. Voters living outside the swing {{states have a}} greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E

25|$|Romney spent a {{considerable}} amount of time giving political speeches in key primary <b>battleground</b> <b>states.</b> Romney traveled the country during the 2006 election cycle to campaign for gubernatorial candidates as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, spending over 200 days outside Massachusetts. While he did not run for reelection as governor, in 2004 Romney set up a federal political action committee (PAC) called the Commonwealth PAC, which raised USD$2.71 million during the 2006 election cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 4, and Barack Obama was projected the winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST). McCain delivered his concession speech at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona at about 11:20 pm EST. In the end, McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama's 365, reflecting McCain's failure to win the key <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> of Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and the Democratic Party's upset victories in traditional Republican strongholds such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana. McCain gained 46percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama's 53percent.|$|E

25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in {{the waning days of}} the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time in uncontested states such as New York and California. These states – where liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of the}} campaign on a whirlwind tour of <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose to go where the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E
25|$|A McCain victory {{quickly became}} {{improbable}} as Obama amassed early wins {{in his home}} state of Illinois, the Northeast, and the critical <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> of Ohio (which no Republican has ever been elected President without winning) and Pennsylvania by 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the Great Lakes states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota by double digits. McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and his home state of Arizona. McCain, unlike Bush in 2000 and 2004, failed to win all the southern states: Obama won Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia. Obama also won the hotly contested states of Iowa and New Mexico, which Al Gore had won in 2000 and George W. Bush in 2004. Also, for only the second time since 1940 (1964 being the other), Indiana went Democratic, giving Obama all eight Great Lakes states, the first time a presidential candidate had won all of them since Richard Nixon in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods were}} used to {{forecast}} {{the outcome of the}} 2016 election. For the 2016 election, there were many competing election forecast approaches including Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot at The New York Times, Daily Kos, Princeton Election Consortium, Cook Political Report, Rothenberg and Gonzales, PollyVote, Sabato's Crystal Ball and Electoral-Vote. These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at The New York Times, and Larry Sabato from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> around the country. The near-unanimity of forecasters in predicting a Clinton victory may have been the result of groupthink. However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.|$|E

500|$|Enemies such as {{publisher}} and former Seward ally Horace Greeley cast doubts as to Seward's electability in the <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> of Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. [...] Lincoln {{had worked hard}} to gain {{a reputation as a}} moderate in the party and hoped {{to be seen as a}} consensus second choice, who might be successful in those critical states, of which the Republicans had to win three to secure the election. Lincoln's men, led by his friend David Davis, were active on his behalf. As Lincoln had not been seen as a major candidate, his supporters had been able to influence the decision to hold the convention in his home state, and surrounded the New York delegation, pro-Seward, with Lincoln loyalists. [...] They eventually were successful in gaining the support of the delegations from the other <b>battleground</b> <b>states,</b> boosting delegates' perceptions of Lincoln's electability. Although Lincoln and Seward shared many views, Lincoln, out of office since 1849, had not excited opposition as Seward had in the South and among Know Nothings. Lincoln's views on nativism, which he opposed, were not public.|$|E

[...] During the final days of the campaign, Biden focused on less-populated, older, less well-off areas of <b>battleground</b> <b>states,</b> especially in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, where polling indicated he was popular and where Obama had not campaigned or performed well in the Democratic primaries. [...] He also campaigned in some normally Republican states, as well as in areas with large Catholic populations.|$|E

500|$|Greeley {{attended}} the convention {{as a substitute}} for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial <b>battleground</b> <b>states</b> such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. [...] On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. [...] After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a broad smile on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, [...] "it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did".|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 6, and Obama was projected the winner at about 11:14 pm Eastern Standard Time. [...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine <b>battleground</b> <b>states,</b> and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had {{thought they were going to}} win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign. I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E

Indeed, Sam Brownback, a lower-tier candidate had more staff in Iowa than Giuliani did. Some political analysts called it a risky strategy {{that had never been}} attempted before by a Republican presidential candidate.

2500|$|The {{news media}} and {{election}} experts were surprised twice, at Trump's winning the GOP nomination and in winning the electoral college. English political scientist Lloyd Gruber says, [...] "One of the major casualties of the 2016 election season has been the reputation of political science, a discipline whose practitioners had largely dismissed Donald Trump’s chances of gaining the Republican nomination.". The final polls showed a lead by Clinton—and indeed she did win more popular votes. Trump himself expected to lose the election based on polling, and rented a small hotel ballroom to make a brief concession speech; [...] "I said if we're going to lose I don't want a big ballroom", he said. The Republican candidate performed surprisingly well in all <b>battleground</b> <b>states,</b> especially Florida, Iowa, Ohio and North Carolina. Even Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, states that had been predicted to vote Democratic, were won by Trump. Cindy Adams, present at Trump Tower, reported that [...] "Trumptown knew they'd won by 5:30. Math, calculations, candidate dislike causing voter abstention begat the numbers".
