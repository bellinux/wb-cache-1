5|$|First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the}} Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase {{of his career}} with a steady season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to Sid Barnes in the run-scoring aggregates. His <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland lost more than they won, with two {{victories}} and three losses. At {{the end of the}} season, Brown captained an Australian side on a tour of New Zealand, and all five matches resulted in convincing victories.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist was {{moderately}} {{successful in}} the following ODIs, the Carlton & United Series; Australia defeated Pakistan 2–0 in a best-of-three final. Gilchrist scored 272 runs at 27.20; his <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> was 92 in a 152-run victory over India on Australia Day. Gilchrist then scored 251 runs at 41.66 in the ODIs during a tour of New Zealand. The highlight was a 128 in Christchurch that propelled Australia to a score of 6/349. Gilchrist was named man of the match {{in two of the}} games.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} for the underpricing of <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> new issues and demonstrates that <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> contracts allow issuers to use information from the market. If investors obtain information that indicates that a project will not be profitable, their demand will be low and the offering will be withdrawn. If this information is costly, investors will have to be compensated for its purchase through a lower offering price, which means that issuers will have to underprice. The result is consistent with the empirical observation that underpricing is considerably greater for <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> than for firm commitment contracts.

5|$|Rebel Heart {{received}} predominantly positive {{reviews from}} music critics; multiple reviewers called it her <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> in a decade. They found that unlike her two previous studio efforts, Hard Candy (2008) and MDNA (2012), the album's sound was progressive. It peaked at number {{two on the}} Billboard 200 chart in the United States and the UK Albums Chart. Rebel Heart also peaked at number one in various countries across the world, including major music markets such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, while reaching the top ten on charts in France, Ireland, Mexico, Japan, New Zealand, and Sweden, and attaining Gold certifications {{in some of the}} regions.|$|E
5|$|Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka {{flew from}} Tokyo on 5 April to Tokuyama {{in a final}} attempt to {{convince}} the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet—including Admiral Itō—to accept the plan. Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it had been kept secret from most of them), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral Itō in rejecting it {{for the same reasons}} that he had expressed. Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan's national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> to support the defense of Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Loxton had a torrid {{time with the}} bat in the 1954–55 season, scoring only 126 runs at 14.00 and failing to pass 30 in his six matches. He took 12 wickets at 32.41 for the season, the least number of wickets in any of his first-class seasons. The all-rounder’s <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> was a 4/31 against New South Wales in a match that Victoria lost by nine wickets. Loxton had a more productive summer in 1955–56. In seven matches, he scored 286 runs at 40.85 including an unbeaten century against South Australia, and took 14 wickets at 20.07; his best was a 4/35 in the return match against South Australia. The Sheffield Shield was won by Victoria’s bitter rivals New South Wales in both seasons.|$|E

5|$|Poulton had {{a modest}} WNCL in 2009–10, scoring 215 runs at 21.50. She reached double figures in nine of 11 innings, {{but was unable}} to convert the starts into large scores. Her highest score for the season was 42 against the Australian Capital Territory. She made 31, her second <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> of the competition, in the final, as New South Wales {{defeated}} Victoria by 59 runs to take their fifth WNCL title in a row. She had more success in the new T20 domestic competition, scoring 201 runs at 28.71. She top-scored with 58 in a seven-run defeat at the hands of Victoria and then made 38 in a nine-wicket win over South Australia. However, she made only six in the final as Victoria dismissed New South Wales for 75 to win by 52 runs.|$|E
5|$|In WSC's debut {{season of}} 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and {{finished}} fifth in overall averages. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling {{and a serious}} injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell {{was one of the}} many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests. During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica, Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide, both Lindwall and Miller {{broke down}} in the middle of match, leaving Australia two bowlers short. In their absence, Johnston took 5/110 and 2/67 but Australia were unable to force a win. He sent down 587 balls for the entire match. Lindwall and Miller were unable to play in the Fifth Test, and in their absence, the South Africans were able to score heavily. Johnston had a large workload, taking 6/152 and 1/114 as the {{tourists}} won by six wickets to level the series 2–2. On this occasion, Johnston sent down 662 balls for the match. In the last two Tests, Johnston conceded more than 100 runs in three of the four innings with the increased burden in his colleagues' absence; the only previous occasion when he had conceded a century of runs in an innings was in the First Test against England in 1948 when Lindwall broke down mid-match. Johnston was again Australia's leading wicket-taker with 21 wickets, but his average of 35.10 was substantially higher than in previous seasons, as Australia struggled to a 2–2 series result. It was the first time Australia had not won a Test series since the 1938 Ashes tour. Yet, he remained the top ranked ICC Test Bowler for three consecutive years from 1950. His <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> against the South Africans was in the second tour match between Victoria and the tourists, in which he totalled 7/122. Aided by his two ten-wicket match hauls against Queensland, Johnston totalled 59 wickets at 26.47 for the season.|$|E

25|$|Davie Grant, Sr. (16 July 1860 – 24 June 1903) was a Scottish {{professional}} golfer {{who played}} in the late 19th century.

Before this innings, Dravid had five test {{hundreds}} to his name from 29 tests, all of which came in away tests, this being his first test hundred on Indian soil. Except for this inning, he had a quiet time throughout the series.|$|E

Furthermore, the Elway-led Broncos had already lost two Super Bowls. On the other hand, the Montana-led 49ers, with their powerful offense, had already won three Super Bowls.|$|E
