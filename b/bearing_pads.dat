5|$|In the 1990s, MDSHA {{discovered}} the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> and aluminum girder structure. Because repairing the structure {{would have been}} extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately {{to the west of}} the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD32 on both sides of the bridge. The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was left in place as a historic landmark after MD32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{numerical}} simulation {{to study the}} influences of viscosity ratio on the static characteristics of hydrostatic thrust bearing compensated by various restrictors. The design parameters of open type hydrostatic bearing include: effective area, supply pressure, restriction constants of restrictor and <b>bearing</b> <b>pad,</b> and specific value of average viscosity of the lubricant passing through restrictor and <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> film. The optimal design requirements of restrictors and hydrostatic bearing and the corresponding range of design parameters for excellent bearing characteristics {{can be obtained from}} the relationships between these design parameters together with their composed parameters and ratios, and the static load capacity and film stiffness and worktable displacement of hydrostatic bearing. Fixing the other design parameters and changing viscosity ratio, the simulation results depict that the lubricant viscosity during restrictor being greater than that in <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> film will make the load capacity decrease, but will improve the film static stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{detailing}} of {{the position}} of <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> over reinforced concrete (RC) corbel may lead to premature failure, which is undesired and structurally vulnerable. An appropriate retrofitting solution is necessary to ensure the functionality of such RC corbels. Considering the growing popularity of external carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) in retrofitting, this research examines the effectiveness of an externally wrapped unidirectional CFRP sheet and compares its performance against traditional retrofitting methods. Moreover, it is intended to fulfill the lack of extensive research on external CFRP application for corbel strengthening. A total of eight medium-scale corbel specimens were tested on vertical load. Observed premature failure due to placing the <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> near the edge of corbel was verified and the effectiveness of the proposed structural strengthening solutions was studied. Experimental results show that although the loading capacity of the damaged corbel due to the poor detailing of <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> position could not be fully recovered, the external CFRP wrapping method demonstrated superior performance over RC jacketing and was able to prevent localized failure. Further study based on non-linear 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to identify the governing parameters of each retrofitting solution. Numerical studies suggested important parameters of various retrofitting alternatives for higher capacity assurance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} the compressive stress transfer between precast concrete elements using cement mortar pads modified with polypropylene fibers, styrene-butadiene latex and heat-expanded vermiculite. The stress transfer analyses are performed interleaving a cementbearing pad between two concrete blocks, subjecting the entire specimen to different compressive load tests. The parameters analyzed in the tests are: surface roughness (using bosses on the bonded phase of different thicknesses), compressive strength with monotonic and cyclic loadings. The main results obtained in this study are: a) the presence of pad increased the strength in 24 % for thicknesses of imperfections of 0. 5 mm and approximately 12 % for smooth faces blocks; b) gain of effectiveness of the <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> when the concrete strength was reduced; c) for cyclic loading, the <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> increased in 48 % the connections strength...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 39 - 48 The {{appearance}} of a strong subsynchronous instability in an overhung compressor highlights the fact that rotordynamic instabilities are not restricted to high-pressure multistage between bearing compressors with overhung rotors. Another {{important point is that}} many users mistakenly believe that tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> eliminate all cross-coupling forces that cause subsynchronous instability. While this is true of the cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross, coupling force from labyrinth seals can overcome the beneficial characteristics of tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings.</b> This paper describes the installation of an integrally geared compressor that initially had problems with high <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperatures. The manufacturer attempted to modify the bearings to reduce the pad temperatures but this was unsuccessful due to unacceptable high vibration amplitudes caused by rotordynamic instability. The rotordynamic instability was caused by a strong subsynchronous excitation of a cantilevered rotor natural frequency located at 47 percent of running speed. The subsynchronous excitation was due to labyrinth seal cross coupling effects. Based on the recommendation of the authors, the manufacturer installed swirl brakes to decrease the subsynchronous vibration excitation, which eliminated the rotordynamic instability and allowed the bearings to be modified in order to reduce <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperatures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{critical}} {{components in the}} oilfield and aerospace industries are made of Inconel 718 alloy. Thus far, the precision of high aspect hole making operation in these has been the bottleneck. This article explores the usability of single lip deep hole drilling tools for such high aspect drilling applications. The unique construction of this tool, with integrated cutting and burnishing elements aids in producing straight and true holes. However, the process is incapacitated by the high hot hardness and abrasive nature of 718 alloy, which leads to poor surface quality. Thus, the limitations in the current process indicate the breakdown in <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> functionality.

40|$|The {{solution}} of the energy equation of thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic analysis for bearings by the finite element method usually leads to convergence difficulties due {{to the presence of}} convection terms inherited from the Navier–Stokes equations. In this work, the numerical analysis is performed with finite element method universally by adopting the characteristic-based split method to solve the energy equation. Five case studies of fixed <b>pad</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> have been set up with different geometries, loads, and lubricants. The two-dimensional film pressure is obtained by solving the Reynolds equation with pre-defined axial load on the pad. The energy equation of the lubricant film and the heat transfer equation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> are handled by characteristic-based split method and conventional finite element method in three-dimensional space, respectively. Hot oil carry-over effect and variable lubricant viscosity are considered in the simulations.

50|$|All bridges {{consist of}} two main parts: the substructure, and the {{superstructure}}. The superstructure is {{everything from the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>pads,</b> up - it is what supports the loads and is the most visible part of the bridge.

50|$|The {{job of the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> is {{to allow}} the {{superstructure}} to move somewhat independently of the substructure. All materials naturally expand and contract with temperature - if a bridge were completely rigid, this would cause unnecessary stress on the structure and could lead to failure or damage.
