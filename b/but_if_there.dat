5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended.

25|$|Monitoring {{involves}} {{the provision of}} outpatient colonoscopy, and occasionally upper gastric tract esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD, to search for premalignant gastric or duodenal tumors), typically once every 1–3 years, and/or a genetic blood test to definitively confirm or deny susceptibility.

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{or perhaps}} complementary proposal {{is that the}} right anterior insular regulates {{the interaction between the}} salience of the selective attention created to achieve a task (the dorsal attention system) and the salience of arousal created to keep focused upon the relevant part of the environment (ventral attention system). This regulation of salience might be particularly important during challenging tasks where attention might fatigue and so cause careless mistakes <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is too much arousal it risks creating poor performance by turning into anxiety.|$|E

25|$|Ankle weights {{provide a}} large lever arm {{for a small}} amount of weight and are very {{effective}} at correcting head-down trim problems, but the addition of mass to the feet increases the work of propulsion significantly.

To see this, note that if spin A has only a small correlation ε with spin B, and B is only weakly correlated with C, but C is otherwise independent of A, the amount of correlation of A and C goes like ε2.

25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E
25|$|Classically, Fermat's {{principle}} can {{be considered}} as a mathematical consequence of Huygens' principle. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extrema (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes ABj, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths ABj will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a shortest route AB0, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB0 will have optical paths differing from AB0 by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB0 will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{improvements}} The Book of Air has over its predecessors is a system of hints for locating difficult items. Although {{it is still possible}} to get hung up on some of the game's more taxing brainteasers, players will no longer find themselves stuck trying to find items thanks to a recharging magnifying glass 'hint power' {{that can be used to}} reveal an object's location. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are not any, the power of hints is not used. There are two difficulty modes to play, Casual and Challenge. Each mode has the same puzzles but their complexities are different. At the beginning, the game offers players the option to play in either Casual or Challenge Mode, and if they want the game to offer the slightest bit of resistance they would pick the former. While Casual Mode offers simpler puzzles and the ability to skip them if players get stuck long enough, Challenge Mode offers slightly harder puzzles, but will not let players skip any. Players cannot change the difficulty once they have chosen it.|$|E
25|$|At common law, as for {{all forms}} of misrepresentation, {{innocent}} misrepresentation {{gave rise to the}} right to rescind a contract. It was not possible to get damages, but so long as one was not confronted by a bar to rescission, the misrepresentee had a right to escape the contract. When the Misrepresentation Act 1967 was passed, it was decided that this right to rescission could be used {{in a way that was}} unfair on a misrepresentor. So section 2(2) gives the court a discretion about whether it will allow rescission of a contract, or substitute an appropriate award of damages in lieu (instead). In William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC William Sindall plc claimed rescission of a land purchase from Cambridgeshire County Council on the ground that the council falsely (but innocently) stated there were no sewage pipes on the property. This would have cost £18,000 to remove, and the land had been bought for £5m. The real reason that William Sindall wanted to escape from the contract was that land prices had just crashed. The court held that in fact the contract had made the buyer assume any risk of such representations and there was no right to rescind. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> had been, it would have exercised its discretion under s 2(2) to award a small sum of damages.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{suppose that}} a {{container}} ship comes into port in Miami, Florida, United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in Denmark. Made {{aware of the}} ship's presence, a local lawyer moves to impose a lien which involves a form of arrest by means of de novo proceedings in rem. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an agent to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are English). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court {{is not in a}} good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in demurrage to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of enforcement, the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the forum conveniens because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.|$|E
