6000|$|Under {{the eastern}} shore, our schooner, now bereft of any breeze, {{continued}} to creep in: the smart creature, when once under way, appearing motive in herself. From close aboard arose the bleating of young lambs; a bird {{sang in the}} hillside; {{the scent of the}} land and of a hundred fruits or flowers flowed forth to meet us; and, presently, a house or two appeared, standing high upon the ankles of the hills, and one of these surrounded with what seemed a garden. These conspicuous habitations, that patch of culture, had we but known it, were a mark of the passage of whites; and we might have approached a hundred islands and not found their parallel. It was longer ere we spied the native village, standing (in the universal fashion) close upon a curve of beach, close under a grove of palms; the sea in front growling and whitening on a concave arc of reef. For the coco-tree and the island man are both lovers and neighbours of the surf. [...] "The coral waxes, the palm grows, but man departs," [...] says the sad Tahitian proverb; but they are all three, so long as they endure, co-haunters of the beach. The mark of anchorage was a <b>blow-hole</b> in the rocks, near the south-easterly corner of the bay. Punctually to our use, the <b>blow-hole</b> spouted; the schooner turned upon her heel; the anchor plunged. It was a small sound, a great event; my soul went down with these moorings whence no windlass may extract nor any diver fish it up; and I, and some part of my ship's company, were from that hour the bondslaves of the isles of Vivien.|$|E

When the whale again came to the surface, a third harpoon was cleverly struck into it, and a spout of blood from its <b>blow-hole</b> showed that it was mortally wounded. In {{throwing}} the harpoon, Tim Rokens slipped his foot, and went down like a stone head-foremost into the sea. He came up again like a cork, and just as the boat flew past fortunately caught hold of Glynn Proctor's hand. It was well that the grasp was a firm one, for the strain on their two arms was awful. In another minute Tim was in his place, ready with his lance to finish off the whale at its next rise.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are various}} kinds of whales, but the two sorts that are most sought after are the common whale of the Greenland Seas, which is called the [...] "right whale," [...] and the sperm whale of the South Sea.

Both kinds grow to an {{enormous}} size--sometimes to seventy feet in length, but there is considerable difference in their appearance, especially about the head. In a former chapter I have partly described the head of a right whale, which has whalebone instead of teeth, with its blow-holes {{on the back of the}} head. The sperm whale has large white teeth in its lower-jaw and none at all in the upper. It has only one <b>blow-hole,</b> and that a little one, much farther forward on its head, so that sailors can tell, at a great distance, what kind of whales they see, simply by their manner of spouting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recently, open-type {{push-pull}} {{ventilation systems}} have been widely employed as effective substitutes for the conventional local exhaust ventilation system, and have prevailed at many welding workshops in Japan. In this study, {{the effect of the}} uniform velocity on carbon dioxide (CO 2) shielding arc welding was examined by laboratory experiments. The ventilation system examined in the experiments successfully fulfilled the requirement for open-type push-pull ventilators prescribed in Japanese regulations (ordinances). It was proved that the velocity at any points in the capture zone fell in the range of 50 to 150 % of the average capture zone velocity. Welding defects could be avoided by controlling the flow rate of shielding gas. Unless the capture velocity exceeded a 0. 8 m/ s, the formation of <b>blow-holes</b> in the welded metal could be prevented at the shielding gas flow rate of 20 L/min. If the flow rate was provided at 30 L/min and 40 L/min, <b>blow-holes</b> didn’t form at the capture velocity of 1. 2 m/s and 1. 6 m/s, respectively. At a capture velocity of faster than 0. 3 m/s, the fume concentration at welder’s breathing zone was reduced to a level below the limit values: ACGIH (TLV) and Japan Welding Engineering Society (CLV #). These data are important for designing open-type push-pull ventilation in the welding workshop.

60|$|The wisdom {{as well as}} the {{necessity}} of this arrangement is very plain. Of course, while dashing through the sea in this fashion, with his mouth agape, the whale must keep his throat closed, else the water would rush down it and choke him.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) and RPA with modified <b>blow-hole</b> colostomy for sigmoid volvulus. METHODS: From March 2000 to September 2007, 77 patients with acute sigmoid volvulus were treated. A total of 47 patients underwent RPA or RPA with modified <b>blow-hole</b> colostomy. Twenty-five patients received RPA (Group A), and the remaining 22 patients had RPA with modified <b>blow-hole</b> colostomy (Group B). The clinical course and postoperative complications {{of the two groups}} were compared. RESULTS: The mean hospital stay, wound infection and mortality did not differ significantly between the groups. Superficial wound infection rate was higher in group A (32 % vs 9. 1 %).

The present paper in this connection show the result of the field test of the above-mentioned case with the direction-finding operation of the ultrasonic anemometer instead of the hot-wire anemometer. Comprehending those results of the tests, it is safely argued that except at the entrance, the 'train-wind' is in the regular direction, that is, in the direction of the advancing train, by the time when the train arrives at the position of the test; on the other hand, when it arrives at the position of the test the 'train-wind' runs in the opposite direction on the instant, but reverses itself in the regular direction afterwards. The time required for the 'train-wind' to return from the opposite direction to the regular one is affected by the velocity and the length of the train as well as the lengh of the tunnel. The result of the test alters in each case of the tunnels where the field tests were made, the 'Sonoyama-tunnel' has a <b>blow-hole,</b> but in the present test its influence will be regarded as little.

40|$|Abstract- The {{automobile}} engine {{connecting rod}} {{is a high}} volume production, critical component. It connects reciprocating piston to rotating crankshaft, transmitting {{the thrust of the}} piston to the crankshaft. Every vehicle that uses an internal combustion engine requires at least one connecting rod depending upon the number of cylinders in the engine. As the purpose of the connecting rod is to transfer the reciprocating motion of the piston into rotary motion of the crankshaft. Connecting rods for automotive applications are typically manufactured by forging from either wrought steel or powdered metal. They could also be cast. However, castings could have <b>blow-holes</b> which are detrimental from durability and fatigue points of view. The fact that forgings produce blow-hole-free and better rods gives them an advantage over cast rods (Gupta, 1993). Various designs of connecting rod have been analysed in this report and finally an optimal design has been selected for Finite Element Analysis. Using ANSYS- 12. 0 Workbench and CATIA V 5 R 19, Various results are found out and compared with the existing results.

Though self-limiting, it should be treated when it causes palpebral closure, dyspnea, dysphagia or undue disfigurement resulting in anxiety and distress to the patient. Presentation of case: A 72  year old man who was a known case of COPD on bronchodilators developed a large pneumothorax and respiratory distress after a CT guided transthoracic lung biopsy done for a lung opacity (approx. 3  ×  3  cm) at the right hilar region on Chest X-ray. Within 24  h of an urgent tube thoracostomy, patient developed intractable subcutaneous emphysema with closure of palpebral fissure and dyspnea unresponsive to increasing suction on chest tube. A subcutaneous fenestrated drain was placed mid-way between the nipple and clavicle in the mid-clavicular line bilaterally. Continuous negative suction (- 150  mmHg) resulted in immediate, sustained relief and complete resolution within 5  days. Discussion: Extensive and debilitating SE (subcutaneous emphysema) has to be treated promptly to relieve patient discomfort, dysphagia or imminent respiratory compromise. A variety of treatment have been tried including infraclavicular <b>blow-hole</b> incisions, subcutaneous drains[*]+/− negative pressure suction, fenestrated angiocatheters, Vacuum assisted dressings and increasing suction on a pre-existing chest tube.

Here, we describe a technique for assessing health based on evaluation of selected physical parameters from archived photographs of right whales. A scoring system was developed to assess body and skin condition, <b>blow-hole</b> cyamids, and rake marks in over 200 000 photographs. Comparison of body condition scores of females during calving and noncalving years found that females were significantly thinner in calving years and in the year after calv-ing compared with the year before calving, showing that changes in body condition known to occur during the repro-ductive cycle can be successfully evaluated from photographs. Comparison of scores for all parameters between living whales and whales {{with more than a}} 5 -year gap in sighting history (“presumed dead”) found that presumed dead whales received health assessment scores indicating compromised health with body condition emerging as a key visual indicator. This health assessment method provides a new tool to monitor health trends in right whales at individual and population levels and may provide a model for assessments of other well-photographed cetaceans.

40|$|The hole defects {{can easily}} occur in {{magnesium}} alloy castings that are prepared by low pressure lost foam casting (LP-LFC) process when the process parameters such as vacuum, pouring temperature and filling velocity are not properly selected. In this study, the forming {{mechanism of the}} hole defects in AZ 91 D magnesium castings by LP-LFC process was investigated. The shape, location and surface appearance of the hole defects were observed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the chemical composition {{on the surface of}} the holes was analyzed using energy spectrometer. The result indicates that there are two types of hole defects, i. e., the pyrolysis products related hole defects, including concentrative hole and blow hole defects, and slag related hole defects. The concentrative hole and the <b>blow-hole</b> defects were formed either by the liquid-EPS degradation products entrapped in the molten metal under the condition that the pouring temperature is equal to or lower than 730 ℃, or by the hindered transport of EPS pyrolysis products. Some irregular shape hole defects were caused by slag or by coating slough entrapment when the pouring temperature is equal to 750 ℃ and the filling velocity is equal to or greater than 100 mm·s- 1. To reduce or eliminate the hole defects, the vacuum and filling velocity must be properly chosen to ensure that the metal front profile exhibits convex shape and in laminar current state, and the pouring temperature should be just high enough to ensure that the molten melt has adequate heat energy to complete the foam pyrolysis and to fully occupy the mould.

All the luxuries that the Tununirmiut knew came from the south--driftwood for sleigh-runners, rod-iron for harpoon-tips, steel knives, tin kettles that cooked food much better than the old soap-stone affairs, flint and steel, and even matches, as well as coloured ribbons for the women's hair, little cheap mirrors, and red cloth for the edging of deerskin dress-jackets. Kadlu traded the rich, creamy, twisted narwhal horn and musk-ox teeth (these are just as valuable as pearls) to the Southern Inuit, and they, in turn, traded with the whalers and the missionary-posts of Exeter and Cumberland Sounds; and so the chain went on, till a kettle picked up by a ship's cook in the Bhendy Bazaar might end its days over a blubber-lamp somewhere on the cool side of the Arctic Circle.|$|R
