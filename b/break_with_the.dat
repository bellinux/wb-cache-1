He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound.

He got his television <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett.

5|$|Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther {{proposed}} {{reform to}} the Church, {{often based on}} humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517 Luther published the 95 Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, {{particularly with regard to}} instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.|$|E

5|$|During {{the general}} election, Humphrey faced former Vice President Richard Nixon of New York, the Republican Party nominee. Nixon led in most polls {{throughout}} the campaign, and successfully criticized Humphrey's role in Vietnam, connecting {{him to the}} unpopular president and the general disorder in the nation. Humphrey experienced a surge in the polls in the days prior to the election, largely due to incremental progress {{in the peace process}} in Vietnam and a <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Johnson war policy, but was defeated by Nixon on Election Day.|$|E
5|$|Progressive pop {{is a form}} of {{pop music}} which {{attempts}} to <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> genre's standard formula. Originally termed for early progressive rock music, some stylistic features of progressive pop include changes in key and rhythm, experiments with larger forms, and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions. Performers commonly produce their own material while opposing the influence of managers, agents, or record companies.|$|E

After graduating, Taylor began working in musical theater, {{appearing}} in The Wiz (1977), before getting his <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1982 off-Broadway production Little Shop of Horrors.

The paper on the magical number seven continues to be cited by both the popular press to explain the liking for seven-digit phone numbers and to argue against nine-digit zip codes, and by academia, especially modern psychology, to highlight its <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> behaviorist paradigm.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define {{what he described as}} a <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{approved}} the general secretary's Political Report, Report on Orientations and Tasks for Socio-Economic Development for the 2006–10 Period, and the Report on Party building and amendments {{made to the}} party statute. These reports' main objectives were to accelerate the reform process and strengthen the socialist-oriented market economy. The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> theory of exploitation of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in state-owned enterprises which have been privatized.|$|E

5|$|Unas {{had several}} daughters and {{possibly}} {{one or two}} sons who {{are believed to have}} predeceased him. Manetho, an Egyptian priest of the Ptolemaic period and author of the first history of Egypt, claims that with Unas' death the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. Unas was succeeded by Teti, the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, possibly after a short crisis. However, the archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians at the time made no conscious <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> preceding dynasty and the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth dynasties might be illusory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), barely 10% of the Roman Empire's {{population}} were Christians, with most of them being urban population and generally found {{in the eastern part}} of the Roman Empire. The majority of people still honoured the old gods in the public Roman way of religio. As Christianity became a complete philosophical system, whose theory and apologetics were heavily indebted to the Classic word, this changed. In addition, Constantine, as Pontifex Maximus, was responsible for the correct cultus or veneratio of the deity which was in accordance with former Roman practice. The move from the old religion to the new entailed some elements of continuity as well as <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> past, though the artistic heritage of paganism was literally broken by Christian zeal.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper house would be the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E

5|$|Early worship {{took place}} at the parish church of Manchester, however a small chantry chapel existed in 1368 on the only bridge linking the two settlements. In the 16th century, it was {{converted}} into a dungeon, and was later demolished in 1779. In 1634–35, Humphrey Booth, a wealthy local merchant, opened a chapel of ease, which a year later was consecrated as the Chapel of Sacred Trinity (the parish of Sacred Trinity was created in 1650). John Wesley preached in the building, before his <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Anglican Church. Upon his return in 1747 however he preached in the open, at Salford Cross. The chapel was rebuilt in about 1752–53, although the tower probably belonged to the original building. It was restored in 1871–74 by the architect J. P. Holden and a chapel was added to the south-east in 1934. It is now a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|He became pope in 1534 {{when he was}} 66 years old, and {{immediately}} appointed {{members of his family}} to key positions. He anointed his eldest grandson Alessandro, the eldest child of his illegitimate son Pier Luigi, cardinal at the age of 14, marking a <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Farnese tradition of marrying off the first-born to carry on the family name. This move was considered necessary because the next oldest grandson, Ottavio, was then just 10 years old; such a young cardinal would have been politically unacceptable. Paul's advanced years meant that the family could ill afford to wait until the younger brother was of age. Thus Alessandro became a cardinal deacon; this appointment did not necessitate taking major orders, but it compelled him to celibacy and to forgo the rights of primogeniture, which instead went to Ottavio. Alessandro was to bitterly regret the obligations. Paul appointed Ottavio as Duke of Camerino in 1538, and in the same year married him to Charles V's daughter, Margaret, later Margaret of Parma. Both of Paul's grandsons' advancements were widely criticised as evidence of nepotism.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Barker got his <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> satirical sketch series The Frost Report, {{having been}} {{recommended}} {{for the show}} by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, {{while many of the}} other Frost Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on. Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in The Frost Reports best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} over after the lunch <b>break,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> score at 87, Bradman was caught {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} time in the series by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg. Hutton had dropped Bradman in the same position when he was on 13. Including a county match against Yorkshire, it was the fourth time Hutton had caught Bradman in the leg trap from a glance. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said {{this was the first time}} Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession.|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled a <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters {{than that of the}} presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system {{similar to that of the}} Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|The PZPR Secretariat {{decided that}} Khrushchev's speech should have wide {{circulation}} in Poland, a unique {{decision in the}} Eastern Bloc. Bierut's successors seized on Khrushchev's condemnation of Stalinist policy as a perfect opportunity to prove their reformist, democratic credentials and their willingness to <b>break</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Stalinist legacy. In late March and early April, thousands of Party meetings were held all over Poland, with Politburo and Secretariat blessing. Tens of thousands took part in such meetings. The Secretariat's plan succeeded beyond what they expected. During this period, the political atmosphere in Poland shifted as questions were increasingly asked about taboo subjects like the Polish Communists' legitimacy, responsibility for Stalin's crimes, the arrest of the increasingly popular Gomułka, and issues in Soviet–Polish relations, such as the continued Soviet military presence in Poland, the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact, the Katyn massacre, and the Soviet failure to support the Warsaw Uprising. A new Party Congress was demanded, as was a greater role for the Sejm and a guarantee of personal liberties. Alarmed by the process, the Party Secretariat decided to withhold the speech from the general public.|$|E
