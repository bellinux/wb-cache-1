5|$|On 22 September the German battle {{group in}} Norway was {{attacked}} by several British midget submarines. This raid inflicted significant damage on Tirpitz, leaving the battleship unable to proceed to sea until repairs were complete. Once this was known to the Allies, {{the commander of the}} Home Fleet, Admiral Bruce Fraser, judged that the changed <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> would allow his force to assume a more offensive role by attacking German shipping off Norway and restarting the Arctic Convoys to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Many {{casualties}} were suffered {{by both sides}} but unlike General Bernard Montgomery, the Allied commander in Normandy, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel was unable to withdraw units into reserve after the battle, as they were needed to hold the front line. The British retained the initiative, attacked several more times over the following two weeks and captured Caen in Operation Charnwood in mid-July. Interpretations of the intention and conduct of Operation Epsom differ widely but there is general agreement concerning {{its effect on the}} <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> in Normandy. The Germans contained the offensive but only by committing all their strength, including two panzer divisions newly arrived in Normandy, which had been intended for an offensive against British and American positions around Bayeux.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E

25|$|The Thirteenth World Congress, in February 1991, {{was one of}} {{the most}} ambitious, {{addressing}} a systematic change in the global <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces.</b> Its resolutions spanned the 'New World Order', European integration, feminism and the crisis of the Latin American left. The resolutions discussed a fundamental reversal of fortune for the anti-capitalist struggle, reflected by defeats in Central America, the 1989 revolutions in the Eastern Bloc, and the weakening of the workers' movement. The congress rejected a counter-resolution on the world situation from a tendency supported by members of the International Socialist Group and the Revolutionary Communist League: the tendency was supported by six of the 100 delegates to the congress. In the opinion of the tendency, the crisis of imperialism was set to accelerate.|$|E
25|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{is the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the geostrophic wind due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind is an idealized wind that results from a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational force, hydrostatic balance occurs.|$|E

25|$|GÃ¶rgei {{planned to}} {{attack in the}} next day to advance with the III. corps towards GalÃ¡nta via VÃ¡gsellye, while the II. corps protects its side by moving towards AlsÃ³szeli and DeÃ¡ki. But already in the night of 20 June he learned that the enemy troops {{commanded}} by Wohlgemuth will attack, and the Panyutyin-division was also sent to help the IV. and the II. corps. So he understood that the relative <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> between the two armies (20,000 Hungarians with 80 cannons against 25,000 Austrians with 96 cannons) was about to be upset by the arrival of 12,000 Russians. So GÃ¶rgei ordered Klapka to hold with any costs the bridge from AszÃ³dpuszta, and JÃ³zsef NagysÃ¡ndor to force the crossing, with his troops, of the VÃ¡g river at Szered. The II. and III. corps had to wait the Austro-Russian attack and to repel it. The key of the Hungarian success was the arrival in time of the I. corps of NagysÃ¡ndor, after accomplishing his initial tasks, to help the other two corps. GÃ¶rgei believed that if NagysÃ¡ndor's I. corps would make a successful attack, pushing the enemy back and cross the VÃ¡g river at Sempte, this would enable the counterattack of the II. and III. Hungarian corps, and the enemy instead of concentrating to capture the bridges from AszÃ³dpuszta and Negyed to cut the retreat root of the Hungarians, will have to fight against the Hungarian attack from front, which with the help of NagysÃ¡ndor's arriving troops, can threaten to encircle the main Austro-Russian troops north from Pered. So the only choice of Wohlgemuth would be the retreat, which would lead to the accomplishment of the Hungarian plans and to the victory. GÃ¶rgei found also useful that his troops {{in the next day}} had to fight with Russian troops too, because they could so measure the tsarists real battle value.|$|E

40|$|Continuum {{thermodynamic}} constitutive phase field {{models are}} developed {{to simulate the}} rate dependent, thermomechanical response and precipitate formation in shape memory alloys (SMAs). The two models {{are based on the}} application <b>of</b> the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> configurational <b>forces,</b> a scalar order parameter (a phase field) and atomic concentration to extend standard continuum thermodynamics approach. Constitutive field equations that capture the kinetics of solid-solid martensitic phase transition in SMA and the diffusion mediated precipitate formation in an elastic solid are developed. The coupled set of thermodynamically consistent field equations results from <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> configuration <b>forces,</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> linear momentum, <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> energy and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> atomic species mass. The field equations capture the kinetics of phase transition, deformation and elastic wave, heat transfer and atomic diffusion respectively. The first model is thermomechanical and is used to simulate the macroscopic response of SMA such as pseudoelasticity; transformation induced pseudo-creep, stress relaxation as well as the effect of cooling rate on mechanical and thermally induced phase transformation of SMA. The second model couples diffusion with elasticity to simulate growth and coarsening of precipitate and experimentally observed concentration depletion near the precipitates Results of the simulations of the macroscopic SMA response are in very good agreement with experimental observation. Simulations suggest that rate dependent and complex thermomechanical response of SMA are due to the interaction of an inherent time scale (as well as length scale) of phase transformation, introduced through the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> configurational <b>forces,</b> with other time scales.
