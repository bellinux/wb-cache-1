40|$|The {{tropical}} forage legume Clitoria ternatea (L.) {{has important}} agronomic traits such as adaptation {{to a wide}} range of soil conditions and resistance to drought. It is resistant to a number of pathogens and pests. These important traits gave us reasons to look more closely at the plant. A highly basic small protein was purified from seeds of C. ternatea to homogeneity by using ultrafiltration with Centricon- 3 membrane tubes and preparative granulated-bed isoelectric focusing (IEF). A single protein band was obtained on both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and IEF gels. The protein, designated ‘finotin’, has broad and potent inhibitory effect on the growth of various important fungal pathogens of plants, namely Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pyricularia grisea, Bipolaris oryzae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It also inhibits the common <b>bean</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli. Moreover, finotin has powerful inhibitory properties against the bean bruchids Zabrotes subfasciatus and Acanthoscelides obtectus...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the survival of a strain of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xap), resistant to streptomycin sulphate, in common bean leaflets placed on the soil surface and buried at a depth of 10 and 15 cm. Four assays were carried out from November 1998 to December 2000 in Bandeirantes (Paraná, Brazil). The leaflets were collect-ed every 15 days, crushed and the dilution-plated on a semi-selective medium. Under mild temperatures and low rainfall, Xap survived for 65 to 180 days in the leaflets on the soil surface, and for 30 to 120 days in those incorporated in the soil, regardless of the depth. When higher rainfall and temperatures occurred, the survival was from 45 to 60 days in the leaflets on the soil surface and from 30 to 45 days in those buried 10 or 15 cm deep.

30|$|In recent years, <b>bean</b> common <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> (CBB) {{caused by}} Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xap) has caused serious yield losses in several countries. CBB is {{considered}} mainly a foliar disease in which symptoms initially appear as small water-soaked spots that then enlarge and become necrotic and usually bordered by a chlorotic zone. Xap epiphytic population community has {{a critical role}} in the development of the disease and subsequent epidemics. The epiphytic population of Xap in the field has two major parts; solitary cells (potentially planktonic) and biofilms which are sources for providing and refreshing the solitary cell components. Irrigation type has a significant effect on epiphytic population of Xap. The mean epiphytic population size in the field with an overhead sprinkler irrigation system is significantly higher than populations under furrow irrigation. A significant positive correlation between the epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity has been reported in both the overhead irrigated (r= 0.64) and the furrow irrigated (r= 0.44) fields.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of relative humidity rate, host genotype, inoculation method and growth stage in epidemiology of bean common blight, two greenhouse experiments were carried out monitoring epiphytic population size of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Xap) and disease severity. The result showed significant differences among genotypes, inoculation methods and growth stages for epiphytic population size and sam effects except genotypes for disease severity. The epiphytic population size was significantly higher on spray inoculated Khomein cultivar of bean during flowering (R 6). However, the relative humidity rates did not significantly affect population dynamics of epiphytic Xap and the disease severity. Two field experiments were also carried out {{to determine the effects}} of irrigation systems (furrow irrigation and overhead sprinkler irrigation), inoculation method, growth stage and their interactions on epiphytic population size of Xap and disease severity. The result showed that the epiphytic population size and disease severity were higher on spray inoculated plants irrigated with overhead sprinkler system during pods filling (R 8).

40|$|Head lettuce, Lactuta sativa var. capitata, is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} economically important diseases, the most frequent being russet spot, rib discoloration, and vascular browning (28), which have been shown by Ceponis and Friedman (7) to be caused by Pseudomonas marginalis. Pseudomonads are common plant pathogens and cause such diseases as halo <b>blight</b> in <b>beans</b> (20), <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> in soybeans (20), and bacterial wilt of the bird-of-paradise (27) and tobacco (24). Plants that develop symptoms similar to russet of lettuce are oats, infected by Pseudomonas cichorii, and tobacco infected with Pseudomonas tobaci (34). In general, russet symptoms include few to numerous yellow, pink, brown, olive brown or dark brown irregular specks ranging in diameter from 1 / 16 to 1 / 8 inch (28). In tobacco these lesions are thought to result from a necrotizing toxin, diamino-dicarboxylic acid, beta-hydroxy-alpha, epsilon-aminopimelic acid, produced by the bacteria (34). In lettuce these lesions result from the bacterial enzymes, protopectinase and pectin depolymerase (7). The red discoloration of lettuce often encountered in grocery stores and home refrigerators has been given the name russet spot, rib discoloration, and tipburn, depending upon where the discoloration occurs (26). These terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature.

Common <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli, {{is one of}} the most serious bacterial diseases in dry bean and snap bean that cause crop losses. Since there is no satisfactory chemical control, the use of resistant cultivars is an important control measure. Genetic studies of resistance are important for choosing appropriate breeding methods. Combining ability was determined for disease resistance in three snap bean genotypes (Alessa, Hab 52 and Hab 198) and two dry bean genotypes (Bac- 6 and A- 794). Plants were inoculated with highly pathogenic isolate CNF 15, using a razor blade procedure in leaves and needle punctures in pods. They were evaluated 7 days after inoculation. Leaves were evaluated on a 1 to 5 scale and pods by lesion diameter. Diallel analysis was conducted using Griffing's model. General combining ability (GCA) was significant for both leaf and pod infection, whereas specific combining ability (SCA) was significant for disease reaction in pods. Bac- 6 and A- 794 were considered superior genotypes for leaf resistance. Nonadditive effects were predominant in pod reactions, and Alessa x Bac- 6, Alessa x A- 794 and Hab 52 x Bac- 6 were the best combinations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>blight,</b> {{which is}} caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), {{is one of the}} most devastating rice {{diseases}} worldwide. The development and use of disease-resistant cultivars have been the most effective strategy to control <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight.</b> Identifying the genes mediating <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> resistance is a prerequisite for breeding cultivars with broad-spectrum and durable resistance. We herein describe a genome-wide association study involving 172 diverse Oryza sativa ssp. indica accessions to identify loci influencing the resistance to representative strains of six Xoo races. Twelve resistance loci containing 121 significantly associated signals were identified using 317, 894 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which explained 13. 3 – 59. 9 % of the variability in lesion length caused by Xoo races P 1, P 6, and P 9 a. Two hotspot regions (L 11 and L 12) were located within or nearby two cloned R genes (xa 25 and Xa 26) and one fine-mapped R gene (Xa 4). Our results confirmed the relatively high resolution of genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we detected novel significant associations on chromosomes 2, 3, and 6 – 10. Haplotype analyses of xa 25, the Xa 26 paralog (MRKc; LOC_Os 11 g 47290), and a Xa 4 candidate gene (LOC_ 11 g 46870) revealed differences in <b>bacterial</b> <b>blight</b> resistance among indica subgroups. These differences were responsible for the observed variations in lesion lengths resulting from infections by Xoo races P 1 and P 9 a.
