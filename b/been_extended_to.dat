5|$|Although Jevons {{originally}} {{focused on}} the issue of coal, the concept has since <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> the use of any resource, including, for example, water usage and interpersonal contact. It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics.|$|E
5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using {{a set of}} standards called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> support flash drives. It has also <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> support {{a wide variety of}} novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.|$|E

During the 1930s, US395 was extended from Spokane to San Diego, over the Camino Sierra, using several existing state routes. The extension first appeared on the Official Nevada Highway map in 1935. By 1937, US6 had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> California, concurrent with US395 between Bishop and Inyokern.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the DR had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross Gate in the east. The southern section of the Inner Circle was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations the DR was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the peak periods.|$|E

5|$|Worth was {{originally}} a village {{with its own}} civil parish, lying just beyond {{the eastern edge of}} the Crawley urban area and borough boundary; but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary has <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> include the whole of the village. The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, as part of the Mid Sussex district.|$|E
5|$|A copy of The Times {{informed}} von Reuter {{that the}} Armistice was to expire {{at noon on}} 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. Unaware that the deadline had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiser sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.|$|E

5|$|After the Stoke line opened, {{the station}} was rebuilt {{north-east}} at the junction so it could serve both lines. The new station opened on 9June 1845; at first, southbound services ran to Crewe and Poynton. By November the line had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Macclesfield, and by 1849, when the original station closed, it had reached Stoke-on-Trent. The new station had four platforms, and was served by trains running between Manchester and Crewe or Stoke-on-Trent. It was renamed Cheadle Hulme in 1866, to avoid confusion with Cheadle LNW railway station which opened the same year.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, the High Seas Fleet, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. It became apparent to Reuter that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> the 23rd, Reuter ordered his ships be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 10:00 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{the town}} was served by two {{electric}} tram routes operated by Oldham Corporation. The first ran from Higginshaw and opened on 15 November 1904 it was almost immediately extended to Chadderton Road, Oldham. The second line from Royton opened on 13 April 1905. By January 1921 both lines shared a terminus at Wrens Nest and the Royton line had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Hollinwood. In the same year, the routes were assigned numbers; Hollinwood to Shaw route was No.8 and the route to Chadderton Road was No.9. There were plans to extend the lines to the railway station and High Crompton but these never materialised. Route 9 was closed on 11 June 1935 and route 8 was closed on 2 December 1939, both were replaced by buses.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{work had}} progressed on {{extending}} Berwick Street eastwards, {{and it had}} <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Alday Street by November 1938. A new causeway to extend Berwick Street north over the Swan River, {{and make it a}} truck route, was considered by the state government in 1940. The existing Causeway, from which Albany Road commenced, had experienced almost a doubling of traffic volume between 1930 and 1939. However, the new Causeway was eventually constructed adjacent to old Causeway, which was then demolished.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{campaign}} began {{to register the}} Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme. This {{would have resulted in}} only Glamorgan sausages that were made in Glamorgan being labelled as such. The move was led by Greta Watts-Jones, who runs the Cwrt Newydd company in Cowbridge, which was the only major manufacturer in the area. Her main competitor, Cauldron Foods, is based in Bristol, England. This protection had previously <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Welsh lamb and beef. The vote to gain this status, alongside Caerphilly cheese, was held in March 2006 at the European Parliament, but was not passed into law.|$|E

The law took effect on January 1, 2013 after 52.4% of voters approved a statewide referendum held on November 6, 2012. The vote was hailed as a watershed moment by gay rights activists and marked the first time marriage rights in the United States have <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> same-sex couples by popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Western Canal was {{conceived}} {{as one of}} several competing schemes to alleviate the hazards and delays of coastal sailing ships making a passage around Land's End to get between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. A canal {{from the mouth of}} the River Exe to Exeter had been opened in 1566; and eight miles of the River Tone had been made navigable in 1638. Navigation of the River Tone had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Taunton in 1717, by the construction of locks on the upper section.|$|E
