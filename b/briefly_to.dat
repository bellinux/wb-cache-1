5|$|Henry II was {{successful}} in quelling the Great Revolt, imprisoning William the Lion until a peace treaty was agreed, extending Henry's authority north into Scotland. In the subsequent years the security situation {{in the north of}} England improved significantly. King John gave control of Bowes Castle to Robert de Vieuxpont, an important administrator in the north, in 1203 and he retained control of the fortification until 1228. John stayed there himself in 1206 and in 1212, and the castle was also used <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> hold John's niece Eleanor of Brittany, who had been placed under the custody of Vieuxpont. Henry III granted it <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> William de Blockley and Gilbert de Kirketon, until it was given to Duke Peter of Brittany in 1232, and then to William de Valence.

5|$|With {{the army}} revitalized, Saint-Just {{returned}} <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> Paris where his success was applauded. However, {{there was little}} time to celebrate.

5|$|According to a People {{magazine}} {{profile of}} McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from {{the owners of}} 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The Sands Directory indicates that she moved her operation <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College.

5|$|After Margaret's death, {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634, when it passed <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> the Crown. By 1675 the castle had become derelict and was restored by the then Lord Dacre, Thomas Lennard. A new entrance to the castle was constructed and square, 17th-century windows installed. After Thomas's death in 1715 the castle was sold to Edward Hassell. The condition of the castle deteriorated again in the 18th century, becoming overgrown and dilapidated, and by the 19th century the Hassell family were {{using it as a}} farmhouse.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E

5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 217, Caracalla was at Edessa with a large army preparing {{to start a new}} invasion of Parthia.

After stopping <b>briefly</b> <b>to</b> urinate, Caracalla was approached by a soldier, Justin Martialis, and stabbed to death. Martialis had been incensed by Caracalla's refusal to grant him the position of centurion, and the Praetorian Guard Prefect Macrinus, Caracalla's successor, saw the opportunity to use Martialis to end Caracalla's reign. In the immediate aftermath of Caracalla's death, his murderer, Martialis, was killed as well. Three days later, Macrinus declared himself emperor with the support of the Roman army.|$|E

Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse {{was used as a}} depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship. After the war, the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920.|$|E
