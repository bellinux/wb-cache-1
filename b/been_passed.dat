Administration was organized under the French model, with meritocratic selection. Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced.|$|E

5|$|If the PCMR submits {{an adverse}} report, Parliament can either make {{amendments}} to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> by at least two-thirds of all MPs. The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it {{was set up in}} 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{voters in}} Maricopa County voted against Proposition 400, {{which would have}} {{extended}} the half-cent sales tax extension from 2006 through 2016 had it <b>been</b> <b>passed.</b> Half of this additional funding would {{have been used for}} improvements in mass transit as well as new freeways. But because of the defeat, there was no funding beyond fiscal year 2006, regardless of if the Regional Transportation Plan was completed or not.|$|E
5000|$|As with split, merge {{also uses}} a local {{function}} loop for efficiency. The inner [...] {{is defined in}} terms of cases: when two non-empty lists <b>are</b> <b>passed,</b> when one non-empty list <b>is</b> <b>passed,</b> and when two empty lists <b>are</b> <b>passed.</b> Note the use of the underscore (...) as a wildcard pattern.|$|R
50|$|BRNN can {{be trained}} using similar {{algorithms}} compared to RNN, because the two directional neurons {{do not have any}} interactions. However, when back-propagation is applied, additional processes are needed because updating input and output layers cannot be done at once. General procedures for training are as follows: For forward pass, forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed.</b> For backward <b>pass,</b> output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> next. After forward and backward <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> done, the weights are updated.|$|R

A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> in 2012. Normally, the bill would become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E
5|$|Many Māori {{place names}} possess either {{historical}} or mythological significance.

Before European arrival, place names commemorated notable or historical incidents, described features of the location or were derived from traditional Hawaiki names or myths. After European arrival many locations became known as Māori versions of European words or poorly pronounced contractions of the original Māori names.|$|E

5|$|The professions of architect, master craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer {{did not have}} the high status of the Confucian scholar-officials during the dynastic era. Architectural knowledge had <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> down orally for thousands of years, usually from craftsman fathers to their sons. There were also government agencies and schools for construction, building, and engineering. The Song dynasty's building manuals aided not only the various private workshops, but also the craftsmen employed by the central government.|$|E
5|$|The professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer were {{not seen as}} professionally {{equal to that of}} a Confucian scholar-official. Architectural knowledge had <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> down orally for thousands of years in China, in many cases from a father craftsman to his son. Structural engineering and architecture schools were known to have existed during the Song period; one prestigious engineering school was headed by the renowned bridge-builder Cai Xiang (1012–1067) in medieval Fujian province.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a senator, Hugo L Black would give speeches based on his belief in the {{ultimate}} power of the Constitution.

5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s that might have <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> by the General Assembly {{and sent to the}} voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Andorra {{has been}} a co-principality since the signing of a paréage in 1278, when the count of Foix and the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell agreed to share {{sovereignty}} over the landlocked country. After {{the title of the}} count of Foix had <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> to the kings of Navarre, and after Henry of Navarre had become Henry IV of France, an edict was issued in 1607 which established the French head of state as the legal successor to the count of Foix in regard to the paréage. Andorra was annexed by the First French Empire together with Catalonia in 1812–1813. After the Empire's demise, Andorra became independent again. The current joint monarchs are Bishop Joan Enric Vives Sicília and President Emmanuel Macron of France.|$|E
5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have <b>been</b> <b>passed</b> on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
