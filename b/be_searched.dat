5|$|A {{binary search}} tree is a binary tree data {{structure}} that works {{based on the principle}} of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in {{binary search tree}}s. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E
5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to <b>be</b> <b>searched.</b> Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no evidence to suggest the two incidents were related.|$|E

5|$|In December 2006 it was {{announced}} that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place. The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses.

5|$|The {{family was}} arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would <b>be</b> <b>searched.</b>|$|E
5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were clutching to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> – caused the driver not to allow them back on the coach. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E

5|$|In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{searches}} {{in public schools}} do not require warrants, {{as long as the}} searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity. However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student. Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> and the persons or things to be seized. It {{is part of the}} Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E
30|$|PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar <b>were</b> <b>searched</b> up to January 2017. Google scholar <b>was</b> <b>searched</b> for gray literature.

5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 2007, NASA and Nature {{released}} {{news that}} HD 209458 b {{was one of}} the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed, the other one being HD 189733 b. This was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient life forms could <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> for, by way of influence on a planet's atmosphere. A group of investigators led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center spectrally measured HD 209458 b's atmosphere in the range of 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results defied theoretical expectations in several ways. The spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere, but such a peak was absent, indicating no detectable water vapor. Another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust, a phenomenon not previously observed. Another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78 micrometres, for which the investigators did not have an explanation. A separate team led by Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed the Richardson et al. data, and had not yet published their results when the Richardson et al. article came out, but made similar findings.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. also {{increased}} the installation {{and use of}} full-body scanners in many of its major airports {{as a result of}} the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following fiscal year, starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> with hand-held detectors. Under new rules prompted by the incident, airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening: Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The inclusion of non-Muslim Cuba on the list was criticized.|$|E
