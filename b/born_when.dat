Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was <b>born</b> <b>when</b> the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus.

5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal genetic disease foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a recessive disease; affected foals are <b>born</b> <b>when</b> they inherit the gene from both parents. Foals with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised immune system and anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death within three months. Following the development of a genetic test in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of genetic testing has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in foals.|$|E

Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany.

After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended Germantown Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In March 1940, {{two months}} before the start of World War II in Belgium, Bob, his second child, was <b>born.</b> <b>When</b> the first tribulations of the war were over, Vandersteen could restart his work at L'Innovation. From November 1940 until August 1942, he created his first {{published}} comic, Kitty Inno, for the company, consisting of short, simple gags. When the German occupier forbade the publication of American and British comics in the Belgian newspapers and magazines, opportunies arose for local people. On 19 March 1941, the first comic strip of Tor de holbewoner (Tor the troglodyte) appeared in the newspaper De Dag. It continued until January 1942. Already on 26 March 1941 it was joined by De lollige avonturen van Pudifar (The funny adventures of Pudifar), a weekly comic strip about a cat. This was in May of the same year replaced by Barabitje, another comic about a cat, which ended in October 1941.|$|E
