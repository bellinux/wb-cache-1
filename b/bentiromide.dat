40|$|The <b>bentiromide</b> {{test was}} {{evaluated}} using plasma p-aminobenzoic acid as an indirect test of pancreatic insufficiency {{in young children}} between 2 months and 4 years of age. To determine the optimal test method, the following were examined: (a) the best dose of <b>bentiromide</b> (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg); (b) the optimal sampling time for plasma p-aminobenzoic acid, and; (c) the effect of coadministration of a liquid meal. Sixty-nine children (1. 6 ± 1. 0 years) were studied, including 34 controls with normal fat absorption and 35 patients (34 with cystic fibrosis) with fat maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency. Control and pancreatic insufficient subjects were studied in three age-matched groups: (a) low-dose <b>bentiromide</b> (15 mg/kg) with clear fluids; (b) high-dose <b>bentiromide</b> (30 mg/kg) with clear fluids, and; (c) high-dose <b>bentiromide</b> with a liquid meal. Plasma p-aminobenzoic acid was determined at 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes then hourly for 6 hours. The dose effect of <b>bentiromide</b> with clear liquids was evaluated. High-dose <b>bentiromide</b> best discriminated control and pancreatic insufficient subjects, due to a higher peak plasma p-aminobenzoic acid level in controls, but poor sensitivity and specificity remained. High-dose <b>bentiromide</b> with a liquid meal produced a delayed increase in plasma p-aminobenzoic acid in the control subjects probably caused by retarded gastric emptying. However, in the pancreatic insufficient subjects, use of a liquid meal resulted in significantly lower plasma p-aminobenzoic acid levels at all time points; plasma p-aminobenzoic acid at 2 and 3 hours completely discriminated between control and pancreatic insufficient patients. Evaluation of the data by area under the time-concentration curve failed to improve test results. In conclusion, the <b>bentiromide</b> test is a simple, clinically useful means of detecting pancreatic insufficiency in young children, but a higher dose administered with a liquid meal is recommended...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to the <b>bentiromide</b> test of exocrine pancreatic function. p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS), a compound closely related to the <b>bentiromide</b> fragment p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), is used as a marker of the pharmacokinetic behavior of PABA to derive a PABA excre-tion index. This index is identical to that derived with [14 C]-PABA. Concentrations of both PABA and PAS are measured in urine by “high-performance ” liquid chromatography, which avoids the drug interferences encountered with established assays of PABA. We discuss the practical and diagnostic advantages of this new approach to the <b>bentiromide</b> test.

40|$|The {{standard}} <b>Bentiromide</b> {{test and}} a new modified test using p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) as a pharmacokinetic marker for p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) have been evaluated in the detection of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in children. The conventional two day test using a colorimetric assay for urinary PABA discriminated poorly between five children with pancreatic insufficiency and 13 others with normal pancreatic function. Two further groups of patients, comprising 28 with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and 20 with normal pancreatic function underwent the modified test, and urine samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed a complete separation between groups. The use of PAS eliminates {{a number of sources}} of error inherent in a two day <b>Bentiromide</b> test and provides a simplified and accurate diagnostic test for pancreatic insufficiency.

40|$|In 30 {{patients}} a reconstructive technique was used after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy {{in which the}} anastomoses were constructed in the sequence: duodenojejunal, hepaticojejunal (8 - 10 cm distal) and finally duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunal to a separate Roux loop. Indications for surgery included periampullary tumours, (n = 13), carcinoma {{of the head of}} the pancreas (n = 10) and chronic pancreatitis (n = 4). No patient required prolonged (> 7 days) nasogastric intubation for primary gastroparesis in the early postoperative period. Postoperative morbidity (17 % overall) delayed recovery and return of gastrointestinal function in one patient with a minor biliary leak (closed with 5 days' somatostatin treatment). Other morbidity included gastrointestinal haemorrhage (n = 1), wound infection (n = 2) and respiratory infection (n = 2). There were no pancreatic leaks. One patient died from a subhepatic abscess (mortality 3 %). Retrospective investigations, at 3 - 18 months postoperatively, included endoscopy (normal in 20 patients, none taking anti-ulcer therapy), gastric emptying studies in the first 10 patients (no delay) and <b>bentiromide</b> test in 12 patients considered to have normal pancreatic remnants (all patients > 24 % PABA excretion index).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a balanced {{assessment of the}} various pancreatic function tests and imaging techniques used in the differential diagnosis of chronic pancreatic disease. Function tests that study the digestive capacity of the pancreas (fat absorption of dietary lipids, fluorescein- or radiolabelled fats, <b>bentiromide</b> test, etc) have high specificity, but very low sensitivity. This is because 90 % of pancreas has to be destroyed before steatorrhea or creatorrhea occurs. Tests that directly measure pancreatic bicarbonate and protein secretion (secretin test, etc) are more accurate and may detect pancreatic dysfunction even before anatomical changes occur. Measurement of pancreatic enzymes in serum or urine, or the decreased decline of serum amino acids during their incorporation into pancreatic enzymes, are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to help diagnose pancreatic disease. Sensitive and specific tumour markers are not yet available. Thus screening tests are not cost-effective - if they are negative, they do not exclude pancreatic disease; and if positive, {{they have to be}} confirmed by more specific tests. Imaging techniques are the most commonly used methods of investigation. The usefulness of abdominal survey films, barium studies, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), ultrasonography, computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasonography is critically reviewed. Most of the radiological methods can be combined with cytology or biopsy. Histology demonstrating malignancy establishes this diagnosis, but negative biopsies do not exclude malignant tumours. Presently only ERCP and endoscopic ultrasound can diagnose cancers sufficiently early to allow for possible `curative' surgery, and only endoscopic ultrasound is capable to stage tumours for the assessment of resectability...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} operative drainage of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) on functional derangements associated with chronic pancreatitis (CP). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The author previously reported delayed functional impairment in {{an evaluation of the}} impact of operative drainage in patients with CP. The author now reports on a prospective study of 143 patients with this diagnosis. METHODS: Each patient underwent 1) ERCP, 2) the <b>Bentiromide</b> PABA, 3) 72 -hour fecal fat test, 4) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 5) fat meal (LIPOMUL) [...] stimulated pancreatic polypeptide release (PP). All patients were stratified as mild/moderate (M/M) or severe CP {{on the basis of a}} 5 -point system that was developed by the author. Patients were studied at 16 -month intervals. RESULTS: All 143 patients underwent initial and follow-up evaluations in a mean follow-up of 47. 3 months; 83 of 143 patients had M/M grade at initial evaluation. Eighty-seven patients underwent (MPD) decompression to relieve abdominal pain. In a separate prospective 17 patients with a diagnosis of CP, a grade of M/M and non-disabling abdominal pain were randomized to operative or non-operative treatment; 9 of these randomized patients were operated upon and 8 were not. No patient improved their grade during follow-up; 47 of 83 M/M patients had operative drainage and 36 did not. This grade was preserved in 41 of 47 (87 %) operated patients but in only 8 of the 36 non-operated patients (22 %). In the randomized trial, seven of nine operated patients retained their functional status in follow-up, whereas only two of eight patients (25 %) randomized to non-operation preserved their functional grade. CONCLUSIONS: These data in this large study as well as among a previous randomized sample, support a policy of early operative drainage before the development of irreversible functional impairment in patients with chronic pancreatitis and associated dilation of the main pancreatic duct...|$|E
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study, 85 {{patients with chronic}} pancreatitis {{have been subjected to}} evaluation by morphologic analysis (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography), by exocrine function tests (<b>bentiromide</b> PABA and 72 -hour fecal fat testing), and by endocrine function tests (oral glucose tolerance test and fat-stimulated release of pancreatic polypeptide). All patients were graded on a five-point system, with 1 point assessed for an abnormal result in each of the five tests performed. Zero score denoted mild disease; 1 - 2 points signaled moderate disease; and 3 - 5 points indicated severe disease. In 68 patients, both an initial and late (mean follow-up period of 14 months) evaluation were performed. Forty-one patients underwent modified Puestow side-to-side Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy. The Puestow procedure alone was performed in 18 patients. Eight patients also had drainage of pseudocysts, seven also had a biliary bypass, and eight had pseudocyst drainage plus bypass, in addition to the Puestow. There were no deaths. Of the 68 patients who were studied twice, 30 had operations and 38 did not. None of the patients with severe disease improved their grade during follow-up. Of 24 patients who did not undergo operation, 17 (71 %) who were graded mild/moderate progressed to a severe grade at follow-up. By contrast, only three of the 19 patients operated on (16 %) and who were initially graded as mild/moderate progressed to severe disease at follow-up testing. More than 75 % of all of the patients had a history of weight loss. Twenty-six of 30 patients operated on (87 %) (all of whom had lost weight before surgery) gained a mean 4. 2 kg (range 1. 4 - 2. 7 kg) after surgery, compared with no significant weight change (range - 3. 6 - 2. 7 kg) among patients not operated on. These findings support a policy of early operation for chronic pancreatitis, perhaps {{even in the absence of}} disabling abdominal pain...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-three {{patients}} with chronic pancreatitis were studied {{in an effort to}} correlate release of gastrointestinal hormones (GIH) with the degree of pancreatic insufficiency. A prospective examination was conducted of fat-stimulated release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP), cholecystokinin (CCK), and neurotensin. Seventy-two-hour fecal fat determination, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP), and the bentiromide-PABA test were used to correlate the clinical stage of disease. The ERP was classified as positive only if the changes were advanced (or "marked") according to the Cambridge Classification. Five patients were defined to have mild disease, 13 moderate, and 15 severe. Any patient with clinical evidence of chronic pancreatitis and ERP changes that were less than advanced and had normal fecal fat and <b>bentiromide</b> tests received a grade of mild. Patients with one abnormal test were graded moderate, and those with two or three abnormal results were graded severe. In the 33 patients, the integrated 60 -minute release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) was 37. 4 +/- 6. 1 ng- 60 min/ml in those five {{patients with}} mild disease, 102. 3 +/- 10. 3 ng- 60 min/ml in the 13 patients with moderate disease, and 7. 6 +/- 2. 2 ng- 60 min/ml in the 15 patients with severe disease. The integrated 60 -minute release of neurotensin was 3. 8 +/- 0. 4 ng- 60 min/ml in mild disease, 2. 0 +/- 0. 3 ng- 60 min/ml in moderate disease, and 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 ng- 60 min/ml in severe disease. CCK release did not correlate with the severity of disease. Enhanced release of PP appeared to correlate well with moderate stage of chronic pancreatitis, and depressed PP release with severe disease. Stimulated levels of PP and neurotensin appear to be useful in the diagnosis and staging of chronic pancreatitis. It is concluded that measurement of fat-stimulated release of PP and neurotensin may be useful to assess severity of disease in {{patients with chronic}} pancreatitis...|$|E
