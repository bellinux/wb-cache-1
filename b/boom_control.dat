40|$|The use of {{precision}} agriculture {{technologies such as}} automatic boom section control allows producers to reduce off-target application when applying herbicides. While automatic boom section control provides benefits, pressure differences across the spray boom resulting from boom section actuation may lead to off-rate application errors. Off-rate errors may also result from spray rate controller compensation for ground speed changes or velocity variation across the spray boom during turning movements. This project focused on characterizing application rate variation for three fields located in central Kentucky. GPS coordinates, <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> status, and nozzle pressure data (at 15 nozzle locations) were recorded as the sprayer traversed the study fields. Control section coverage areas and nozzle flow rates (calculated from the nozzle pressure with manufacturer calibration data) were used to estimate application rates. Results indicated the majority of each field received application rates at or below the target rate, as only 25 % to 36 % of {{the area in the}} study fields received application rates within the target rate ± 10 %. Spray rate controller lag time appeared to contribute to lower application rates as the sprayer accelerated and higher application rates as the sprayer decelerated as the controller attempted to compensate for changes in sprayer velocity. In addition, as <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> sections were turned off, pressure increases in the remaining sections resulted in higher application rates. Conversely, as boom sections were turned on, spray rate controller lag time may have contributed to lower application rates.

40|$|To stay {{competitive}} internationally, the Swedish forestry sector must {{increase its}} productivity by 2 to 3 % annually. There {{are a variety}} of ways in which productivity can be increased. One option is to develop remote-controlled or unmanned machines, thus reducing the need for operator intervention. Another option—and one that could be achieved sooner than full automation—would be to make some functions semi-automatic. Semi-automatic operation of the knuckle boom and felling head in particular would create “mini-breaks” for the operators, thereby reducing mental and physiological stress. It would also reduce training time and increase the productivity of a large proportion of operators. The objective of this thesis work has been to develop and evaluate algorithms for simplified <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> on forest machines. Algorithms for so called boom tip control, as well as automatic boom functions have been introduced. The algorithms solve the inverse kinematics of kinematically redundant knuckle booms while maximizing lifting capacity. The boom tip control was evaluated – first by means of a kinematic simulation and then in a dynamic forest machine simulator. The results show that boom tip control is an easier system to learn in comparison to conventional control, leading to savings in production due to shorter learning times and operators being able to reach full production sooner. Boom tip control also creates less mental strain than conventional control, which in the long run will reduce mental stress on operators of forest machines. The maximum lifting capacity algorithm was then developed further to enable TCP path-tracking, which was also implemented and evaluated in the simulator. An evaluation of the fidelity of the dynamic forest machine simulator was performed to ensure validity of the results achieved with the simplified <b>boom</b> <b>control.</b> The results from the study show that there is good fidelity between the forest machine simulator and a real forest machine, and that the results from simulations are reliable. It is also concluded that the simulator was a useful research tool for the studies performed {{in the context of this}} thesis work. The thesis had two overall objectives. The first was to provide the industry and forestry sector with usable and verified ideas and results in the area of automation. This has been accomplished with the implementation of a simplified <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> and semi-automation on a forwarder in a recently started joint venture between a hydraulic manufacturer, a forest machine manufacturer and a forest enterprise. The second objective was to strengthen the research and development links between the forestry sector and technical university research. This has been accomplished through the thesis work itself and by a number of courses, projects and Masters theses over the last three years. About 150 students in total have been studying forest machine technology in one way or the other. QC 2010072...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aimed at the {{variable}} speed and real-time problems in stage boom machinery control, the practical problems of great error, bad real-time, difficult zero speed park in fixed speed control has been solved effectively by adaptive fuzzy PID control. Based {{on the characteristics}} of the stage boom operation, a combined configuration of lower acquisition module and upper controller are applied to the control system, the upper controller sends the running parameters to the lower controller through the industrial Ethernet. The lower controller calculates output by adaptive fuzzy PID and communicate with inverter through CAN bus, then variable speed control in stage <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> can ben achieved by variable frequency. Unique degree value encoder is used to feedback the real-time information to the lower controller. System testing results showed that the method could improve the control performance and realize {{the variable}} speed control and zero speed park of the stage boom machinery. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{application}} of laser range-finder sensing to agricultural spraying vehicles. The current generation of spraying vehicles use automatic controllers to maintain {{the height of the}} sprayer booms above the crop. However, these control systems are typically based on ultrasonic sensors mounted on the booms, which limits the accuracy of the measurements and the response of the controller to changes in the terrain, resulting in a sub-optimal spraying process. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use a laser scanner, attached {{to the front of the}} sprayer’s cabin, to scan the ground surface in front of the vehicle and to build a scrolling 3 d map of the terrain. We evaluate the proposed solution in a series of field tests, demonstrating that the approach provides a more detailed and accurate representation of the environment than the current sonar-based solution, and which can lead to the development of more efficient <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of pre-emergence, post-emergence, and burn-down herbicides (i. e., glyphosate) {{continues to increase}} as producers attempt to reduce both negative environmental impacts from tillage and input costs from labor, machinery and materials. The use of precision agriculture technologies such as automatic <b>boom</b> section <b>control</b> allows producers to reduce off-target application when applying herbicides. While automatic <b>boom</b> section <b>control</b> provides benefits, pressure differences across the spray boom resulting from boom section actuation can lead to off-rate application errors. Off-rate errors may also result from spray rate controller compensation for ground speed changes and velocity variation across the spray boom during turning movements. This project focuses on quantifying accumulated pesticide application for three fields located in Central Kentucky. GPS coordinates were collected along with nozzle pressure data (at 13 nozzle locations) at one second intervals as the sprayer traversed the study fields. The method previously developed by Luck et al. (2009) was used to calculate coverage areas for the control sections along the spray boom in MS Excel. Nozzle discharge flow rates were estimated from the nozzle pressure data (based on manufacturer calibration information) which was then incorporated into MS Excel to determine the rate of pesticide applied to the fields. Results indicate the majority of each field received application rates at or below the target rate. Only 34. 2 %, 33. 9 %, and 22. 9 % of Fields 1, 2, and 4, respectively, received application rates at the target rate +/- 10 % during these postemergence treatments. The goal of this project was develop distribution maps {{to better understand the}} effects of <b>boom</b> section <b>control</b> and turning movements on herbicide accumulation...|$|R
30|$|Despite some {{adjustment}} in lending {{conditions in the}} good times depending on household risk, the results suggest too soft lending standards (excessive bank pro-cyclically/risk-taking) in some loan margins in the <b>boom.</b> <b>Controlling</b> for other key borrower variables such as income, workers with temporal contracts get in the boom the same LTVs (both statistically and economically speaking) as workers with permanent contracts in the crisis, instead, temporal workers obtain less LTVs and pay substantially more spreads. As temporal workers {{are the ones that}} mainly went unemployed in the crisis period, these results suggest not only ex-ante high risk, but also ex-post. Even more important for credit supply and excessive bank risk-taking, we find that borrowers who are not employed pay identical loan spreads than employed ones in the boom. However, in the crisis period, the difference in spreads is substantially different. Furthermore, we also find that higher LTV did not impact higher loan spreads (and the same for spreads on LTVs) in the boom. 4 All in all, the results in Spain suggest too soft lending standards and excessive risk-taking in the boom.|$|R
40|$|While we {{will never}} know the true costs of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, past {{experience}} in assessing these kinds of damages provides both a framework for assessing the nature of damages as well as information on the potential magnitude of costs. From society’s perspective, the cost of an oil spill consists of both “private ” costs to the oil rig operator(s) and “external ” or third-party costs to the government, victims, and natural resources. While many of these external costs will ultimately be borne by the legally responsible parties (subject to any liability caps), it is useful to start from this categorization: Private Costs Damage to the oil rig and related equipment Containment costs to stop or reduce further oil spillage (e. g., efforts to cap wells, <b>booms,</b> dispersants, <b>controlled</b> burning) Cleanup costs incurred by responsible parties Lost oil Cost of litigation (including punitive damages or other penalties not directly related to above) External Costs Loss of life and injury to workers Containment costs to stop or reduce further oil spillage (e. g., <b>booms,</b> dispersants, <b>controlled</b> burning) Cleanup costs incurred by government agencie...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide {{application}} {{is an essential}} practice on farms in Kentucky where glyphosate resistant crops and no-till farming strategies are becoming more popular. Off-rate pesticide application errors {{are the result of}} incorrect concentrations applied to an area of the field and may result from velocity changes along the spray boom while the sprayer is turning, pressure changes across the width of the spray boom, and changes in effective boom height due to undulating terrain. In an attempt to estimate potential errors resulting from sprayer turning movements, a method was developed to compare the differences in application areas between control sections across the spray boom. The area covered by the two center <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> section positions was considered the “target rate” and the difference in these areas and the remaining control sections were compared to determine errors in coverage areas. The results of the analysis conducted on three irregular shaped fields (containing impassable grassed waterways) indicated that {{a substantial portion of the}} fields (14 - 24 %) could have been applied well above or below the target application rate +/- 10 %. The implication of this is that producers may be under and over applying chemicals to fields where excessive amounts of turning are required during application...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{spray rate}} {{controllers}} along with {{technologies such as}} automatic section control (ASC) provide benefits such as overlap reduction on agricultural sprayers. However, product (liquid) dynamics within the boom plumbing affect off-rate errors and application uniformity during rate changes and ASC actuation. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare nozzle flow stability and uniformity across the boom when using two different boom shut-off valves (2 -way and metered 3 -way) on an 18. 3 -m sprayer boom. Pressure transducers were mounted at 1) the boom manifold, 2) randomly at 12 nozzle bodies across the spray boom, and 3) upstream and downstream of the flow regulating valve. Effective system flow rate was measured using two flow meter(s), one located upstream of the <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> valves (2 -way or metered 3 -way) and another mounted to measure the tank return flow for the metered 3 -way boom valve. Measured nozzle pressure was converted to nozzle flow using the manufacturer’s pressure-flow data. Results indicated that the 2 -way boom versus metered 3 -way valve response was significantly different. Significant differences in damping ratios were found when exiting (under-damped) and reentering (over-damped) of spray zones. For the metered 3 -way boom valve configuration, nozzle flow settled faster (0. 1 to 4. 2 s) virtually eliminating off-rate errors whereas the 2 -way boom valve configuration took up to 34. 3 s to settle with off-rate errors ranging from 3. 3 % to 11. 5 %. The delayed nozzle flow settling times were associated with pressure settling (0. 7 to 31. 4 s) downstream of the regulating valve for the 2 -way configuration. Ground speed and point row angle impacted nozzle flow settling times and off-rate errors. The increase in ground speed and point row angle increased nozzle flow settling time for the 2 -way valve setup, except that acceleration decreased settling times when exiting spray zones. The delayed response contributed to off-rate time which decreased as the sprayer accelerated and point row angle decreased for both the 2 -way (1. 7 to 19. 3 s) and metered 3 -way (2. 1 to 4. 4 s) boom shut-off valve setups...|$|E
40|$|Use of non-sprayed buffer zones is {{a widely}} used method to protect {{sensitive}} objects within or adjacent to fields treated with pesticides. These buffer zones should protect the objects from pesticide residues caused by spray drift and leakage. The use of untreated buffer zones has been mandatory for Swedish farmers since 1997. E. g. recommended minimum safe distances to sensitive areas for spray situations are 12 m to wells, 6 m to streams, ponds or lakes, and 1 m to ditches and drainage wells. Studies have shown that buffer zones are not always respected {{and that there is}} a need to improve the protection of sensitive objects. On a typical sprayer, all nozzles on a section of the boom are either on or off. A higher resolution in sprayer control would reduce the untreated area but still be able to respect the buffer zones. German and Dutch research have shown how GNSS-controlled (Global Navigation Satellite System) application of pesticides can be targeted to defined areas in the field. GIS (Geographic Information System) was used to define the areas to be sprayed. The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate a system that automatically could shut off single nozzles along the spray boom to avoid pre-defined areas in the field. Such a system could improve management of buffer zones, reduce the risk for mistakes and improve record keeping from spraying activities. At the time of project start, there were commercial controllers that could fulfil parts of the requirements involved in the project. A commercial spray controller, Legacy 6000 (Teejet), could consider pre-defined areas by using the field boundary features. During 2006 and 2007, the system was used in practice on a conventional trailed sprayer with a 24 m boom and 7 boom sections. Experiences from mapping and spraying were documented. Also accuracy of the system was studied in an experiment using video recorder and analysis of the video frame by frame. Results were communicated with several manufacturers of sprayer controllers to improve development of coming products. The following season, 2008, a small sprayer with a 6 m boom and individual nozzle control was constructed. This year, the study of accuracy focused on small circular buffer zones, e. g. close to drainage wells. Spraying was done on an asphalt surface during a sunny day, leaving wet and dark marks when nozzles were activated. The whole buffer zone was photographed directly after spraying, and the pictures were later analysed manually to determine the accuracy of the sprayer. Different controller settings, spray nozzles and GPS receivers were used. The accuracy of a conventional sprayer with DGPS was found to be about +/- 1 m. Accuracy of the sprayer with solenoid valves and RTK GPS was about half of this, i. e. +/- 0, 5 m. This is probably better than the possibilities with manual control. Different methods for mapping fields and creation of boundary files were evaluated and compared. Mapping could be done through digitalisation of an aerial photograph or when spraying the field for the first time. Best accuracy is achieved if mapping could be done with a RTK GPS on e. g. an ATV. A method for calculation of double-sprayed area has been developed in the project. The mapped fields in the project have served as a base for a simplified tool that can be used by farmers and advisors to determine the advantages with more accurate sprayer control. In general terms, a farmer can save 1 - 5 % of the pesticide cost if a GNSS-controlled sprayer with individual nozzle control is used, instead of a conventional sprayer. The project sprayers have been demonstrated on several field shows and other activities with farmers. The number of controllers for automatic <b>boom</b> <b>control</b> on the Swedish market has increased during the project time...|$|E
