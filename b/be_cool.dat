5|$|Although Milian is {{best known}} for her singing career, she {{originally}} wanted to be an actress. Her first lead role was in the 2003 film Love Don't Cost a Thing, and she subsequently had lead roles in <b>Be</b> <b>Cool</b> and the 2006 horror film Pulse. Milian had a minor role in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, and starred as the lead role in the straight-to-DVD film , training with former Cleveland Cavaliers dancer Kelly Wilson. Milian has since been cast in the 2010 ABC Family Original Movie Christmas Cupid, alongside Ashley Benson and Chad Michael Murray.|$|E
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed to <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key to the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E

5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots who seek to kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to <b>be</b> <b>cool,</b> however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E

50|$|Porphyritic {{rocks are}} formed when {{a column of}} rising magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> in two stages. In the first stage, the magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> slowly deep in the crust, {{creating}} the large crystal grains, with a diameter of 2 mm or more. In the final stage, the magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a volcano, creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye.|$|R

25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness {{is in the}} eye of the beholder. People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) to <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something is perceived to <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E
50|$|Water {{and food}} can <b>be</b> <b>cooled</b> in snow. Evaporation causes <b>cooling</b> and <b>is</b> {{used in the}} pot-in-pot refrigerator. Placing green grass or a sponge into a hat and soaking it with water is another technique. Bottled water can <b>be</b> <b>cooled</b> in a stream.|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} can {{be adapted}} to provide longitudinal as well as transverse cooling by using a dipole magnet as a dispersive prism to divide the particles by energy, and then passing the resultant [...] "rainbow" [...] beam though a tapered wedge of cooling material. Thus, faster particles <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> more and slower particles <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> less. A simple way is to fill the dipole itself with cooling material, so that more energetic particles following a larger orbit pass <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> more.|$|R

25|$|The seeds {{should be}} sown {{early in the}} spring time. Put the {{seedlings}} into separate pots, and it is recommended to let them winter in the greenhouse for their first winter season. To clean them rub the capsules through a screen. It's advised to plant them in the late spring or early summer because division {{takes place in the}} spring. They should be grown in well-drained soil with full sun. The climate can <b>be</b> <b>cool.</b>|$|E
25|$|São Paulo {{is known}} for its rapidly {{changing}} weather. Locals say that all four seasons can be experienced in one day. In the morning, when winds blow from the ocean, the weather can <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> or sometimes even cold. When the sun hits its peak, the weather can be extremely dry and hot. When the sun sets, the cold wind comes back bringing cool temperatures. This phenomenon happens usually in the winter.|$|E
25|$|To <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> or hip meant hanging out, {{pursuing}} sexual liaisons, {{displaying the}} appropriate attitude of narcissistic self-absorption, and expressing {{a desire to}} escape the mental straitjacket of all ideological causes. From the late 1940s onward, this popular culture influenced young {{people all over the}} world, to the great dismay of the paternalistic elites who still ruled the official culture. The French intelligentsia were outraged, while the British educated classes displayed a haughty indifference that smacked of an older aristocratic cool.|$|E

25|$|Class II Hemorrhage {{involves}} 15-30% {{of total}} blood volume. A patient is often tachycardic (rapid heart beat) with a narrowing {{of the difference}} between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The body attempts to compensate with peripheral vasoconstriction. Skin may start to look pale and <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> to the touch. The patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids (Saline solution or Lactated Ringer's solution) is all that is typically required. Blood transfusion is not typically required.|$|E
25|$|Taro can {{be grown}} in paddy fields where water is {{abundant}} or in upland situations where water is supplied by rainfall or supplemental irrigation. Taro {{is one of the}} few crops (along with rice and lotus) that {{can be grown}} under flooded conditions. This is due to air spaces in the petiole, which permit underwater gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. For a maximum dissolved oxygen supply, the water should <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> and flowing. Warm, stagnant water causes basal rotting. For maximum yields, the water level should be controlled so that the base of the plant is always under water.|$|E
25|$|In {{distinction}} to {{the emotional}} energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, the Color Field painters initially appeared to <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists {{considered to be the}} essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s Frank Stella in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural Abstract expressionism.|$|E

Other acting credits in the decade include <b>Be</b> <b>Cool</b> (2005), The Producers (2005), and My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006). She received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her five-episode role in Smash (2012), and garnered critical praise for her supporting performance in the Volume I of Lars von Trier's two-part art drama Nymphomaniac (2013).|$|E
25|$|Scooby-Doo was {{originally}} broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1975, when it moved to ABC.

25|$|All {{the shelters}} are adapted {{to suit the}} local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are {{versatile}} enough to <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A berber tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – {{and because of the}} climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.|$|E
