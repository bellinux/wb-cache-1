500|$|According to {{the most}} popular version of the story, Pipp showed up at Yankee Stadium that day with a severe headache, and asked the team's trainer for two aspirin. Miller Huggins, the Yankees' manager, noticed this, and said [...] "Wally, take the day off. We'll try that kid Gehrig at first today and get you <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> tomorrow." [...] Gehrig played well and became the Yankees' new {{starting}} first baseman. This story first appeared in a 1939 New York World-Telegram on Gehrig's career, in which Pipp was interviewed. Pipp was later quoted to have said, [...] "I took the two most expensive aspirin in history." ...|$|E
500|$|Being an entomologist, {{he has a}} {{wide and}} varied {{knowledge}} of insects, which he applies to his investigations. This has led to his nickname, [...] "The Bug Man". In {{the beginning of the}} show, he was referred as [...] "Gruesome Grissom" [...] for his sometimes morbid fascination with the more bizarre aspects of man and nature. Grissom keeps a variety of specimens in his office, including a radiated fetal pig, a tarantula, and a two-headed scorpion. He also has a bulletin board that looks like a fish on which unsolved cases go: [...] "the ones that got away". Occasionally, he keeps evidence from closed cases (such as the models created by [...] "The Miniature Killer"). In , CSI newcomer Michael Keppler takes a look around Grissom's office and observes that he must be quite a freak. In [...] "The Grave Shift", even after his office has been cleared out (and later reclaimed by a somewhat-reluctant Nick Stokes after Catherine Willows passed on the offer), the fetal pig in a jar was placed <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> by Hodges, who stated simply that [...] " [...] belongs here." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 Entertainment Weekly interview, Ward, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a medical show before, stated {{that when she was}} young, her mother was sick for over nine years and she {{spent a lot of time}} in hospitals. This being the reason that, on the set of House, she felt [...] "at home, in a strange way". While she was initially hired to appear only in [...] "Three Stories" [...] and [...] "Honeymoon", the chemistry between Ward and House lead actor Hugh Laurie was strong enough for Ward to return for a multiple-episode story arc in the second season of the show. On working with Ward, Laurie commented [...] "We're professionals who were lucky enough to be extremely well-equipped with a very sound, true script, the fact that Sela is immensely attractive and we got on well certainly is not an impediment." [...] Though Ward has expressed that she would like to return to the show, Shore told USA Today in 2006 that, although he was eager to write her <b>back</b> <b>in,</b> <b>there</b> were [...] "no specific plans" [...] to have the character return.|$|E

500|$|After McCoy led the Longhorns to {{a victory}} over rival, unranked Texas A (a team he had lost to twice in the past), Sports Illustrated analyst Stewart Mandel said the quarterback took a big step towards {{claiming}} the Heisman Trophy. Mandel wrote, [...] "From the Longhorns' opening touchdown drive, in which he accounted for 67 of Texas' 80 yards, McCoy was very much the one-man wrecking crew he's been all season long...His final numbers in just over three quarters of work Thursday night: 23-of-28 passing for 311 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and 11 rushes for 49 yards, with touchdown runs of 16 and 14 yards. For the season, McCoy now has a 77.6 completion percentage (soon to be a new NCAA record) for 3,445 yards, 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions, plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running" [...] Comparing McCoy to fellow Big 12 South quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell, Mandel said, [...] "But here's where McCoy stands out to me. Bradford, as talented as he is, is helped by the fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1,000-yard rushers behind him. Harrell has Michael Crabtree. Daniel has Jeremy Maclin. With all due respect to Jordan Shipley and Quan Cosby, McCoy is Texas' offense. Much like Tim Tebow last season, he's both his team's leading passer and rusher. Also like Tebow—you have to wonder sometimes how he's still standing. McCoy was sacked three times Thursday night and endured several brutal hits. Following his third-quarter touchdown run, trainers attended to his shoulder on the sideline. But he was right <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> the next series." [...] Bradford and Harrell each had one regular-season game left, against Oklahoma State and Baylor, respectively. Tebow had games remaining against Florida State and Alabama.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Jackson {{released}} her eighth studio album, Damita Jo. The album debuted at number two on Billboard 200, was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and sold over three million copies worldwide. However, its singles received minimal airplay {{due to a}} blacklist of Jackson's music and videos on many music channels and radio formats caused by legalities surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Jackson then decided to start {{to work on a}} new project in the coming year, involving her then-fiancé, record producer Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned to executive produce the project, in addition to a number of other producers. She decided to create a modern record, while returning to dance music, in the vein of her hit album, Control (1986). Producer Jimmy Jam revealed that while recording the album, Janet became more confident with her writing ability, doing the bulk of the writing. He also commented, [...] "We're all kind of <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> doing it again together, which I really enjoy." [...] It's the physical nature of sitting in the same room and really hashing it out. It's like, 'You're not going to leave until we have a lyric,' so it's fun." [...] Jackson and Jimmy both agreed that Dupri molded well into their tri due to him being a fan of Jam and Lewis' work and vice versa.|$|E

[...] According to Bellamy, the remark was ad libbed by Grant. Columbia studio head Harry Cohn thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other [...] "inside" [...] remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for a kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant's birth name). Another line that people think is an inside remark is when Earl Williams attempts {{to get out of}} the rolltop desk he's been hiding in, Grant says, [...] "Get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> you Mock Turtle." [...] The line is a [...] "cleaned-up" [...] version of a line from the stage version of The Front Page ("Get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> you God damned turtle!") and Grant also played [...] "The Mock Turtle" [...] in the 1933 film version of Alice in Wonderland. In fact, this line is the same in the 1931 movie of [...] "The Front Page." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{escaping}} breakaway formed after 10 kilometers, involving Sébastien Hinault, Sandy Casar, and Manuel Quinziato. As the breakaway formed, Tinkoff {{tried to}} place a rider in it, but was unsuccessful. The main field was paced alternately by Caisse d'Epargne, Quick Step, and Lampre, and their pace combined with the cold and rainy weather of the day proved a tough test for many riders, dropping back from the field. An unexpected rider to crack, {{toward the end of}} the stage, was Alejandro Valverde, who finished more than 3 minutes behind the stage winner and fell out of the top ten in the GC. The rest of his Caisse d'Epargne team went back with him to try to pace him back into the front group, but they were not successful. Ezequiel Mosquera also fell out of the front group briefly, but his Xacobeo-Galicia teammates were able to get him <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

Jermaine would run into the studio and talk about the songs Jimmy and Terry had done on someone's album. Then Jimmy would start playing the song, and Jermaine would say, 'You know what? Let's do something kind of along those lines as a base.' He understood them, he understood me and vice versa." ...|$|E

And I thought, God, you know, if we get to 21 and theres nothing after that, thats a pretty bleak future, so I wrote a song for him, and for myself just to give me some hope.
