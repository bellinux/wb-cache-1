2500|$|On August 8, 1905, Cobb's mother {{fatally shot}} his father {{with a pistol}} {{that his father had}} {{purchased}} for her. Court records indicate that Mr. Cobb had suspected his wife of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, [...] "I did it for my father. He never got to see me play... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was watching me, and I never let him down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. Remembering Jake's theory, I {{saw it was}} {{possible}} {{he had come to}} push me off, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> hadn't. That's why I gave him my hand afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{perfectly}} wonderful!" [...] murmured Ruth. [...] "He just {{opens his}} mouth and the words come out. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was somebody, directly I saw him, by his forehead. Like a dome!" [...] Bailey mopped the dome.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{comes from}} Daddy--only <b>he</b> doesn't <b>know,</b> because <b>he's</b> a perfect saint; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> had a devil somewhere, or he couldn't be the saint he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I say that? I don't {{remember}} now what <b>I</b> said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> made me angry. Come, let us trot on. They {{can take the}} hounds home without us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Steve {{has been}} very good, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> had rather be with Kitty Van, so of course I feel like a marplot, though he is too polite to hint it." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Rosa was not there. She {{was a very}} regular attendant, but {{for some}} reason she was absent on this momentous afternoon. I did not say {{anything}} to him on the subject, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> felt this absence deeply.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I knew it! I couldn't {{hear what}} he said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> spoke to you! Do you know who it was? It was Lord C., and he is Master of the Buckhounds! Tell me--what {{do you think of}} him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} forget it," [...] Lucy {{said with a}} shudder. [...] "While I waited and {{wondered}} why he didn't come I thought the anxiety intolerable, but it was worse after we met Walters and the drunken guide. He wanted to join us, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was somehow to blame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Oh yes,’ replied Julia; ‘good, {{punctual}} creature! I {{have not}} seen it more than once or twice, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> writes very badly and very large. These dear, wild young noblemen, you know, Overton—’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} safe," [...] said the princess, [...] "not that I count {{much on his}} fear, for he is as brave as a she-wolf with whelps, and fears nothing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> likes me." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{blame me}} for writing his name at length: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is {{not ashamed of}} his name: and for you, though at the remotest rate, to insinuate it, must needs be damage to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Balls,' said master, `show him out, and--' {{he pulled}} up short, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> meant to say have {{an eye on the}} great-coats and umbrellas, so I showed the boy out, an' he went down-stairs, quite quiet, but the last thing I saw of him was performin' a sort of {{minstrel}} dance {{at the end of the}} street just before he turned the corner and disappeared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe he}} was, really. At least, he laughed {{when he read}} the thing. But he hauled me up after school {{and gave me a}} long jaw, and made me take all the lines I'd got to his house. He burnt them. I had it out with Merrett just now. He swears he didn't mean to get the thing spotted, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> did." ...|$|E
6000|$|While I {{was doing}} this {{the two men had}} talked to each other aside. [...] "He's alive, all right," [...] says I. [...] "That's a good job," [...] one of 'em said; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> didn't think so. [...] "We'll carry him up to our cottage. You'll be all the better for a sleep; it must be past two o'clock by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Snipper the Crossbill," [...] replied Jumper promptly. [...] "I haven't {{seen him}} yet this winter, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is here because only this morning I found some pine seeds {{on the snow}} under a certain tree." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> {{is a man}} of wit and parts; {{which if}} applied {{properly}} to the business of his function, instead of poetry, (wherein it must be owned he sometimes excels,) might be of great use and service to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{go to her}} {{as soon as he}} {{will let}} me. I don't think he will forbid my going to her, perhaps, after a day or two; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> would not let me go on purpose to meet her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Glad you saw {{and liked}} Lysaght. He has left {{in our house}} a most cheerful and {{pleasing}} memory, as a good, pleasant, brisk fellow with good health and brains, and who enjoys himself and makes other people happy. I am glad he gave you a good report of our surroundings and way of life; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would, for I believe he had a glorious time--and gave one.[78] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{person who}} first {{suggested}} this travelling plan was our old physician, Dr. Mathews. I don't {{know exactly what}} he said about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> thought I had been studying too hard, and needed to [...] "let up" [...] for a while. And I'm sure, too, that he was quite positive that I would have no let up as long as I staid in the same town with the professor.|$|E
60|$|She {{walked up}} and down the room, and her face was full of anxiety. I watched intently. At last a light knock was heard; she opened the door and a man came in. A small, slight, thin man, with a {{quantity}} of corn-coloured hair falling over his shoulders, and a pale, fair skin. He had blue eyes, and a little golden moustache. He looked hardly twenty, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was older.|$|E
6000|$|... "There must be {{some good}} in him," [...] she continued, [...] "even if {{he is such a}} desperate character; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> not The Oskaloosa Kid. Do you really suppose he robbed a house last night and then tried to kill that Dopey person?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father is not there; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> wants you, dear, and I am sure {{he would}} rather {{see you in a}} home like this than in the place you came from. Now go and dress; but, tell me first, has it been a happy birthday?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{so fond of}} {{the captain}} and yet you don't seem to care what you say about him. I haven't been with him for seven years, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> isn't {{the sort of man}} that takes to drink. And then--why the devil should he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn’t answer ’im a word. I might ha’ told ’im {{that there}} was plenty of people arter me ready to give me double the money, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could never get anybody to do their dooty by the wharf like I ’ad done, so I kept quiet. It’s the way I treat my missis nowadays, and it pays; in the old days I used to waste my breath {{answering}} ’er back.|$|E
6000|$|Densher, {{from whom}} an impatience had escaped, had already caught himself up. [...] "Pardon my brutality. Of course I know what you're talking about. I saw him, toward the evening," [...] he further explained, [...] "in the Piazza; only just saw him--through the glass at Florian's--without any words. In fact I {{scarcely}} know him--there wouldn't have been occasion. It was but once, moreover--he {{must have gone}} that night. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't have come for nothing, and I turned it over--what he would have come for." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dan and {{the girls}} and I were sitting in a row on Aunt Olivia's garden fence, {{watching}} Felix weed. Felix worked well, {{although he did not}} like weeding--"fat boys never do," [...] Felicity informed him. Felix pretended not to hear her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> did, because his ears grew red. Felix's face never blushed, but his ears always gave him away. As for Felicity, she did not say things like that out of malice prepense. It never occurred to her that Felix did not like to be called fat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear sir, {{you have}} so many {{advantages}} over poor Mr. Oldbuck, that no wonder it should put him a little out of humour; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> has much respect for your person and your conversation;--nothing would give him more pain than to be wanting in any real attention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> has come, {{and have}} heard of his narrow escape. I {{should have been in}} that train, if I had not been delayed by the indisposition which <b>I</b> then cursed, <b>but</b> now bless. Are you ready, Jean? Do you repent your choice, my child?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} stupid," [...] said Bessie, [...] "of {{none of those}} girls to have Uncle George to marry them. My aunt fancied he would be nervous, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> did marry a couple when Mr. Lifford was away; I mean him to marry me, as I told them all." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor was}} the first friend I thought of; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was always out seeing his {{patients}} of an afternoon. The beadle was the next person who came into my head. He {{had the look of}} being a very dignified, unapproachable kind of man when he came about the inquest; but he talked to me a little then, and said I was a good girl, and seemed, I really thought, to pity me. So to him I determined to apply in my great danger and distress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl with the first trace of {{animation}} in her face. [...] "It was four or five months ago when we were visiting the Briones at Monterey. We had ridden out to the old Mission by moonlight. There were some Mexicans lounging around the posada, and one of them attracted my attention by the way he seemed to watch me, without revealing any more of his face than I could see between his serape and the black silk handkerchief that was tied around his head under his sombrero. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was an American--and his eyes were familiar. I believe it was he." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd {{thought that}} I'd {{naturally}} have chuckled mightily at giving Mr. Towser the slip so neatly; but it's {{a fact that}} I felt really ashamed, for it did seem ridiculous {{that one of my}} family would fall into a hole while running. Where was I? Well, if you'll believe it, I'd struck Grandfather Fox's hole, and he wasn't at home on account of having his hide nailed up on Mr. Man's barn, so there I was all by my lonesome, with Mr. Towser scratching gravel at a great rate; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could wear his claws way down to the flesh before getting in, for Grandfather Fox knew how to dig a house that would protect him from dogs.|$|E
6000|$|... "A buck {{will fight}} {{sometimes}} {{and when he}} does he's as ugly as any critter on four legs," [...] said Jed Sanborn. [...] "I might have fixed him with my first shot only Shep bumped into me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> didn't mean to do it," [...] added the old hunter hastily.|$|R
6000|$|... "I met George Morton at the door, and {{chatted with}} him for several minutes. He appears quite ill, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> has gone two miles {{in the country for}} his mother this raw day; unless he is more careful of himself, he will ruin his constitution, which is none of the best now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Queen Dido for that. How the clergyman {{came into}} the secret I cannot tell--he is a very close man. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> will not hear of Miss Mowbray being married to any one, unquestionably because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that, in doing so, she would {{introduce}} disgrace into some honest family--and, truly, I am much of his mind, my lord." ...|$|R
