5|$|The {{mineral springs}} of the Borjomi valley were {{discovered}} over one thousand years ago.

The springs were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century.

5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group dates <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Cottage School.|$|E

5|$|Ever 17 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the game's story. At certain points, they get to make a choice, which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings. The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so {{that they do not have}} to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the game for each playthrough.|$|E
5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, {{the team}} became {{the second in}} school in history (1985–86 went 16–0) to reach 12–0 when it beat Eastern Michigan. After {{recording}} his first career double-double in the game with only 18 minutes of play, McGary was recognized as Big Ten Freshman of the Week. Hardaway suffered an ankle injury that caused him to miss the December 29 game against Central Michigan and that broke his 81 consecutive games played streak that went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> his Michigan career. The game also marked the team's second game without Jon Horford, who dislocated his knee during the West Virginia game. In Hardaway's absence, Burke posted his second career double-double with 22 points and a career-high tying 11 assists and Robinson posted his second career 20-point game. Stauskas added career highs with 5 three-pointers and 7 rebounds and earned his third Big Ten Freshman of the Week award on December 31. The thirteenth win clinched Michigan's ninth perfect non-conference regular season record. The team never trailed in the contest.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the third-person {{perspective}} in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore {{in the home}} consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase {{which leads to the}} room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the current loop.|$|E

25|$|Western {{cultural}} theorists often trace {{performance art}} activity <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, to the Russian constructivists, Futurists and Dada. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, {{often at the}} Cabaret Voltaire, {{by the likes of}} Richard Huelsenbeck and Tristan Tzara. Russian Futurist artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as David Burliuk, who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and Alexander Rodchenko and his wife Varvara Stepanova.|$|E

25|$|Writing {{systems were}} preceded by proto-writing, which used pictograms, ideograms and other {{mnemonic}} symbols.

The invention of writing systems, which dates <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic Era of the late 4th millennium BC, enabled the accurate durable recording of human history in a manner that was not prone to the same types of error to which oral history is vulnerable.
