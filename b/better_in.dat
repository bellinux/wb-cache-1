While the Republicans did {{slightly}} <b>better</b> <b>in</b> the 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic {{candidate in the}} 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won {{more than two-thirds of}} the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is <b>better</b> <b>in</b> Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly <b>better</b> <b>in</b> Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E

5|$|Announcing {{that this}} would be his final season before retirement, Shearer's form in the 2004–05 season was patchy; {{alongside}} new signing Patrick Kluivert, he scored only sevengoals in his 28games as the club finished the season in 14th place. The club fared <b>better</b> <b>in</b> the cup competitions, however, eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. Shearer scored a hat-trick in the first round win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals, in addition to his one goal in domestic cups.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform <b>better</b> <b>in</b> big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E

He was eliminated, having been 2.9s slower than the last-placed {{qualifier}} for the final. The eventual winner posted a time 0.9s slower than that of O'Brien four years earlier. O'Brien did <b>better</b> <b>in</b> the newly introduced 100m event, winning his heat in a time of 1min 8.9s to qualify second-fastest for the semifinals. O'Brien scraped into the final after coming second in his semifinal in a time of 1min 9.0s. It was the barest of margins; O'Brien was the slowest qualifier and could not be electronically separated from the ninth-fastest semifinalist, with judges being used to decide the placings. O'Brien went on to finish sixth in a time of 1min 8.6s.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work <b>better</b> <b>in</b> animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function <b>better</b> <b>in</b> school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared <b>better</b> <b>in</b> other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E

5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed <b>better</b> <b>in</b> the French and West German markets, {{largely due to}} the presence of Trintignant and Kinski.

5|$|Even in {{reporting}} the election result, newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker would soon call another election and seek a majority. Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton (who would soon become Postmaster General under Diefenbaker) predicted {{on the evening}} of June 10 that there would soon be another election, in which the Tories would do much <b>better</b> <b>in</b> Quebec. The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and Diefenbaker called a snap election. On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{entered the}} Senate in 1974 and was reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992. In the 1980 primary, Ford {{received}} only token opposition from attorney Flora Stuart. He was unopposed in the 1986 and 1992 Democratic primaries. Republicans failed {{to put forward}} a viable challenger during any of Ford's re-election bids. In 1980, he defeated septuagenarian former state auditor Mary Louise Foust by 334,862 votes. Ford's 720,891 votes represented 65 {{percent of the total}} votes cast in the election, a record for a statewide race in Kentucky. Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986, Ford shattered that record, securing 74 percent of the votes cast and carrying all 120 Kentucky counties. State senator David L. Williams fared little <b>better</b> <b>in</b> 1992, surrendering 477,002 votes to Ford (63 percent).|$|E

5|$|French ornithologist Émile Oustalet {{described}} a specimen from Branco {{as a separate}} species Passer brancoensis in 1883, which was recognised as the subspecies Passer iagoensis brancoensis by W. R. P. Bourne, who claimed to observe differences between Iago sparrows from different islands. According to Bourne, birds of Passer iagoensis iagoensis on more wooded islands in the south are darker and larger, and also behave more like house or Spanish sparrows, competing with them <b>better</b> <b>in</b> human-altered habitats. He later wrote that the variations he saw comprised two clinal trends, of increasing darkness towards the south, and of smaller size further from the continental coast. Charles Vaurie, examining differences in plumage and measurements of specimens in major museums, {{did not find any}} significant variation, and neither Vaurie nor Summers-Smith recognised any subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation.

P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, {{and is expected to}} fare <b>better</b> <b>in</b> a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.|$|E
