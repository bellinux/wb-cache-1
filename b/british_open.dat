5|$|Looking Glass' {{products}} were praised for innovations in video game technology and design. Several of their successes, such as Flight Unlimited and , sold {{over half a}} million copies each. Poor sales of their final two self-published games— (1996) and <b>British</b> <b>Open</b> Championship Golf (1997)—left the company in financial turmoil, however.
