The World Bank Group has supported Cambodia since the October the 26th, 1993, with the Emergency Rehabilitation Project. From 1993 to 2017, World Bank projects in Cambodia have focused on economic rehabilitation, agriculture, disease control, and health and child welfare. During these years, Cambodia has seen a rise in World Bank projects related to children's welfare and the educational system for children. There is a Total Project <b>Budget</b> <b>Commitment,</b> where the World Bank decides how much will be given for each country, with $243.1 million being committed to Cambodia. Among the $243.1 million committed, $173.2 million is for funding projects from the World Bank and IDA (International Development Association), and the other $69.9 million is for the development partner funding via the Trust Fund which was put in place for Cambodia. Within the $243.1 million that is designated for the development and structural reform of Cambodia, there are 12 active projects that are designed to improve health, poverty, education, maternal welfare, child care, and rural improvement.|$|E

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{delivery of}} provincial budgets in Ontario and Quebec this spring provided a useful {{chance to see}} how governments of two key provinces faced with similar challenges are responding. The focus of budgets, and commentary on them, tends to be forward-looking. But before putting faith in the forward-looking elements, budget-watchers should ask what this year's numbers reveal about the reliability of <b>budget</b> <b>commitments</b> in the past. The short answer is that, in recent years, one-year-ahead budgetary spending forecasts {{have been much more}} reliable in Quebec than in Ontario. Over the past decade, both provinces have tended to spend more than projected. While Quebec’s record has improved to the point where its citizens can have some confidence that this year’s <b>budget</b> <b>commitments</b> are serious, Ontario continues to overrun its commitments by large margins.

This paper explores the context in which Assembly health policy making has taken place, looking at economic, administrative and political dimensions, identifying elements of continuity and change in the Assembly Government's approach to health matters. The paper argues that while policy making has been far-reaching, the implementation of that policy agenda has proved problematic.

40|$|Contemporary {{theories}} of the policy process typically assume that policy responses tend to go through long periods of stasis alternated with occasional bursts of intense activity. The concept of policy punctuations has been put forward to denote large-scale changes in public policies {{that take place in}} crisis moments. However, research on the dynamics of policy overreaction and underreaction is still in its infancy. It has mostly focused on either small-n cross-sectional analysis of government spending or case studies of single events. A comparative assessment of the extent of disproportionate responses in a crisis is still lacking. To fill this gap, in this paper we develop a framework to conceptualize, operationalize and ultimately assess disproportionate policy responses systematically from a cross-sectional perspective. We create a series of indexes to measure policy over- and underreactions among the EU member states that experienced the 2007 – 8 banking crisis. We found that a large majority of EU countries overreacted through public liability guarantee and <b>budget</b> <b>commitment.</b> On the other hand, regulatory responses are characterized by a greater variation...|$|E
40|$|The Medicaid program, which {{provides}} {{health insurance to}} some of the nation’s more vulnerable citizens, is a major <b>budget</b> <b>commitment</b> for federal and state governments. In 2004, spending on Medicaid totaled $ 293 billion, of which $ 170 billion was the federal share and $ 120 billion the state share (Borger et al. 2006). Program costs are projected to reach $ 320 billion (federal and state) in 2006 (Borger et al. 2006). Concern with the cost of Medicaid unquestionably has become a central issue in the debate on the program’s future. Cost concerns also have driven many of the latest Medicaid policy and programmatic changes, which are fundamentally reshaping this important public health program. The recently enacted Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, for example, includes a series of Medicaid cost-savings provisions, such as allowing states to raise co-payments and charge premiums on certain program beneficiaries. Further, under the new law, states can end Medicaid coverage for people who fail to pay premiums and providers can deny services for program beneficiaries who do not make the required co-payments. The new provisions also permit states to scale back Medicaid benefits for selected groups. States themselves also have brought about major changes to Medicaid, largely throug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the author {{considers}} whether central authorities should regulate local sector borrowing. Local government's debt policy is modeled as {{the outcome of}} a two-period game between three agents: central government, local government, and a bureau which produces services on behalf of local government. A key assumption of the model is that neither central nor local government is able to undertake long-term <b>budget</b> <b>commitments.</b> Two rationales are found for central regulations. First, local government is prevented from using deficits strategically to extract higher grants from central authorities. Second, the debt limit gives credibility to local government's budget policy towards the bureau. ...|$|R

30|$|Many commercially {{successful}} innovations are now {{arising from}} basic research {{carried out at}} universities. A university is the natural seedbed for inventions and groundbreaking ideas. Professors explore novel areas and generate new ideas. These ideas can be developed, applied and transformed into something that has never existed before. The boundary between pure science and applied research is blurred (Etzkowitz et al. 1998; Slaughter and Leslie 1997; Tudiver 1999), and a growing awareness {{of the potential for}} partnership has led to changes in the perceived role and importance of academic research in the society. These changes have given rise to a transformation in institutional practices and inter-organizational communication strategies within the academic community (Owen-Smith 2003; Packer and Webster 1996) and also in the role played by universities in global, national and local economies as a whole (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1998; Feller 1990; Slaughter and Rhoades 1996). In this context, governments worldwide have been promoting the concept of synergy between basic research carried out in academic institutions and applied research in the commercial sector. By applying different models, they are trying to establish the most efficient way of facilitating this relationship with funding from the private sector (Biegelbauer and Borrás 2003). The equation is straightforward in its logic; industry funds a proposed research project, for which universities provide the supporting groundwork, so that the society gets new products and technologies; and government gets to reduce its <b>budget</b> <b>commitment</b> to academic institutions. Nevertheless, all too often, tripartite relationships between the government, industry, and academia will unavoidably be fraught with uncertainty and projects are liable to fall short or fail (Zomer et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|As {{management}} {{priorities for}} federal forest lands have shifted, {{it has become}} clear that different strategies for harvest and forest regeneration are needed. The DEMO experiment arose in response to this need, with leadership provided by a consortium of university and Forest Service scientists and federal forest managers. With specific congressional direction (included in federal appropriations for the Forest Service), the initial planning for an experiment in retention harvest strategies began in 1992. Initial planning efforts were hampered by competing research objectives and disagreements over experimental design, shifts in program leadership, difficulties in transferring funds to the appropriate entities, and conflicts related to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. In 1994, once these challenges were overcome, the experiment began. DEMO is not only an experiment in retention harvesting, but also in collaboration between research and management, as well as federal and state governments and the university community. The scope and intensity of collaboration have been demanding, requiring effective communication and coordination across institutional lines. The early history of DEMO has taught us that experiments of this kind require: (1) a coordinated legislative package and multi-year <b>budget</b> <b>commitment,</b> (2) a well-developed management structure, (3) an efficient process for planning, (4) commitment of lead scientists to the coordination and planning of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research activities, (5) effective collaboration between research and management, and (6) a well-developed outreach program. Other large-scale silvicultural/ecological experiments with characteristics similar to DEMO are underway at several locations around the world. These will offer additional learning opportunities for large-scale, interdisciplinary researchFranklin et al "The history of DEMO: An experiment in regeneration harvest of northwestern forest ecosystems.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} budgetary participation on departmental performance via <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity. The responses of 108 budget preparers and budget users drawn from a cross-section of Malaysian local authorities, to a questionnaire survey were analysed by using mediation analysis, path analysis and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation technique. The results suggest that <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> and role ambiguity are important links in the process. The {{results of this study}} suggest that the relationship between budget participation and departmental performance is statistically, significantly, positively and marginally correlated. Of more interest was the finding that <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> and role ambiguity are important intervening variables in the relationship between budget participation and departmental performance. The test for mediation effect, demonstrated that <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> and role ambiguity had partially mediated the relationship of budget participation and departmental performance. These three variables act as partial mediators when they significantly reduced or decreased the path coefficient of budget participation and departmental performance rather than eliminating the relationship. Furthermore, the test for direct and indirect effect of budget participation on departmental performance, suggests that budget participation predicted or affected departmental performance more strongly in the indirect way than it did in a direct way. This suggests that, even though the correlation between budget participation and departmental performance was significant, the path interpretation suggests that the correlation arose because budget participation was correlated with other variables that have direct effect upon departmental performance not budget participation itself directly predicted departmental performance. Therefore, there is enough evidence to suggest that budget participation of budget preparers and budget users affects departmental performance of Malaysian local authorities indirectly via <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity. Among the indirect effects, the link between budget participation, <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> role ambiguity and departmental performance may be the most important in term of this study’s contribution. The decomposition of the observed correlation between budget participation, <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity showed that budget 3 participation of budget preparers and budget users of Malaysian local authorities in the budget setting has direct effect on <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity. Budget adequacy and organisational commitment was directly related. However, the relationship of role ambiguity and organisational commitment in this study was indirectly related. This suggests that participation of budget preparers and budget users in the budget setting of Malaysian local authorities lead to decrease role ambiguity that provide adequate budgetary supports, which lead to increase organisational commitment and thus enhance departmental performance. In relation to the strength of the relationships of the variables undertaken for the study, the overall relationships between variables are significant and positively related except that of role ambiguity relationship. The relationships of role ambiguity with budget participation, budget adequacy, organisational performance and departmental performance are negatively related.
