6000|$|LIEUTENANT (drawing himself upright). I say it again, {{just wait}} until I catch him. Just wait: that's all. (He folds his arms resolutely, and <b>breathes</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> {{compressed}} lips.) ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few seconds}} later he was waist-deep in the swift icy current, savagely endeavoring to drag the animal toward the bank, while Lisle stood near him, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> a red hunting-knife in his hand.|$|R
60|$|The {{anger that}} Jean {{anticipated}} failed to materialize. He stood, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> a hand held out in unconscious appeal. By the same magic, perhaps, that had transfigured {{her a moment}} past, she was now invested again by the older character.|$|R
6000|$|Winchell, {{dressed in}} a new suit of clothes, darted from the {{sidewalk}} to the carriage, his face shining. [...] "Say, folks, I'm called East. Old man died yesterday, and I've got to go home." [...] He was <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> excitement.|$|R
60|$|They {{went downstairs}} in single file, the builder {{of the house}} having left no option in the matter, while the small Wheelers, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> excitement, watched them over the balusters. Outside the house the two ladies paired off, leaving the two men to follow behind.|$|R
60|$|He stopped short, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> {{a sudden}} spark {{in his black}} eyes and a nervous {{clenching}} of the strong hands that made Letty shrink; for he seemed to speak in spite of himself, as if {{the memory of that}} time had left its impress on his life.|$|R
60|$|She rose flushed, wide-eyed, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> {{the emotion}} his vibrant voice called up, {{but she could}} not speak. He put his hand gently upon her shoulder, and she sank down again. And he went on with hi~s appeal. There was {{something}} hypnotic, dominating in his voice and eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{no getting}} around proof like that. I do believe it's {{the most amazing}} thing I ever heard of." [...] She sat silent a moment or two and <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> excitement, then she looked up and {{surveyed}} the strangers steadfastly a little while, and added: [...] "Well, it does beat me, but I would have took you for twins anywhere." ...|$|R
60|$|We had all {{risen to}} our feet, our {{prisoner}} <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> a stalwart constable {{on each side}} of him. Already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced two candles, and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner.|$|R
60|$|Stapleton had {{abandoned}} the chase {{and came back to}} us <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> and flushed <b>with</b> his exertions.|$|R
60|$|Quick as thought, Florence glided out and hastened downstairs, where Mr Toots, in {{the most}} splendid vestments, was <b>breathing</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> doubt and {{agitation}} {{on the subject of}} her coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "And wherein is {{that power}} contained? What view do {{you hold on}} the subject?" [...] Doctor Winchester's voice vibrated with the {{intensity}} of his excitement as he leaned forward, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> and <b>with</b> eyes staring. Mr. Trelawny said solemnly: ...|$|R
60|$|This {{appeared}} to galvanize the cowboy into action. He grasped the padre {{and led him}} toward the door, cursing and threatening, no doubt enjoining secrecy. Then he pushed him across the threshold and stood there <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> and wrestling <b>with</b> himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 145-163. These lines {{describe}} the different figures {{painted on the}} wall by Fra Lippo when the prior bade him [...] "daub away." [...] The monks dressed in black or white according to the garb of their orders; the old women waiting to confess small thefts; the row of admiring little children gazing at a bearded fellow, a murderer who, still <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> the run that has brought him in safety to the altar steps, defies the [...] "white anger" [...] of his victim's son, who has {{followed him into the}} church; the girl who loves the brute of a murderer, and brings him flowers, food, and her earrings to aid him when he shall escape--all these are painted on the wall. Then the young artist took down the ladder by means of which he had reached the bit of cloister-wall where he had been recording his observations of life, and called the monks to see.|$|R
60|$|Tucking {{his hands}} under his blue blouse, Wan Lee {{suddenly}} produced from some mysterious recess of his clothing {{a quantity of}} red paper slips which he scattered {{at the entrance of}} the cavern. Then drawing from the same inexhaustible receptacle certain squibs or fireworks, he let them off and threw them into the opening. There they went off with a slight fizz and splutter, a momentary glittering of small points in the darkness, and a strong smell of gunpowder. Polly gazed at the spectacle with undisguised awe and fascination. Hickory and Patsey <b>breathed</b> <b>hard</b> <b>with</b> satisfaction: it was beyond their wildest dreams of mystery and romance. Even Wan Lee appeared transfigured into a superior being by the potency of his own spells. But an unaccountable disturbance of some kind in the dim interior of the tunnel quickly drew the blood from their blanched cheeks again. It was a sound like coughing, followed by something like an oath.|$|R
60|$|It was done. Hetty {{was active}} and slender, the man muscular, and both had been taught, {{not only to}} ride, but master the half-wild broncho by a {{superior}} daring and an equal agility, in a land where the horse is not infrequently roped and thrown before it is mounted. But Larry <b>breathed</b> <b>hard</b> as, <b>with</b> his arm about her waist, he held the girl in front of him, and felt her cheek hot against his lips. The next moment he pressed his heels home and the big horse swung forward under its double burden.|$|R
60|$|The Captain {{remembered to}} have seen this young gentleman at the wedding, and made him a bow. Mr Toots replied with a chuckle; and being embarrassed, as he {{generally}} was, <b>breathed</b> <b>hard,</b> shook hands <b>with</b> the Captain for a long time, and then falling on Rob the Grinder, {{in the absence of}} any other resource, shook hands with him in a most affectionate and cordial manner.|$|R
60|$|Getting their poles {{beneath it}} they forced it upward, little by little. When they got half-way, a pole slipped, {{and for a}} few anxious moments the men {{strained}} every muscle to prevent the mass from rolling back, while their companion found a fresh rest for his pole. The log must be held: they could not jump clear in time. <b>Breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> the sweat dripping from them, they raised it a foot or two, until it seemed possible to lift it on to the lower logs by a strenuous effort. They made the attempt; and one of the skids broke. Laying their shoulders beneath the mass, they struggled with it for their lives. If it overpowered them, they would be borne backward and crushed. With one support gone, it seemed impossible that they could lift it into place. For a few moments they held it, but did no more, though Jimmy felt the veins swell on his forehead and heard a strange buzzing in his ears. His mouth was dry, his heart beat painfully, and he knew he could not stand the cruel strain much longer. But there was no help available. They must conquer or be maimed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was soon}} at some {{distance}} from me, still <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> and again <b>with</b> the air, though now without anger for it, of being confined against his will. Once more, {{as he had done}} before, {{he looked up at the}} dim day as if, of what had hitherto sustained him, nothing was left but an unspeakable anxiety. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] he nevertheless replied--"they must have repeated them. To those THEY liked," [...] he added.|$|R
60|$|It {{scarcely}} {{seemed to}} grow any nearer, and an hour had passed before it assumed any regularity of outline. When it had grown into shape, George stopped and looked about. It was fiercely hot, the grass was dazzlingly bright, there was no house or sign of cultivation {{as far as his}} sight ranged; but on glancing back he started as he saw three small mounted figures on the plain. They had not been there when he last turned around, and they were moving, spread out about a mile apart. It was obvious that the rustlers were on his trail. For another moment he looked at the bluff, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>with</b> his lips tight set. If he could reach the wood before he was overtaken, it would offer him cover from a bullet, and if he could not evade his enemies, he might make a stand with the ax among the thicker trees. It was an irrational idea, as he half recognized; but he had grown savage with fatigue, and he had already suffered as much as he was capable of bearing {{at the hands of the}} cattle thieves. Now he meant to turn on them; but he would be at their mercy in the open.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pancks the gipsy,' he {{observed}} out of breath, 'fortune-telling.' He stood dingily smiling, and <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> at them, <b>with</b> a most curious air; as if, {{instead of being}} his proprietor's grubber, he were the triumphant proprietor of the Marshalsea, the Marshal, all the turnkeys, and all the Collegians. In his great self-satisfaction he put his cigar to his lips (being evidently no smoker), and took such a pull at it, with his right eye shut up tight for the purpose, that he underwent a convulsion of shuddering and choking. But {{even in the midst}} of that paroxysm, he still essayed to repeat his favourite introduction of himself, 'Pa-ancks the gi-ipsy, fortune-telling.' ...|$|R
60|$|A {{dark red}} flush swelled Brandt's face and neck; his gray eyes gleamed balefully with wolfish glare; {{his teeth were}} clenched. He <b>breathed</b> <b>hard</b> and trembled <b>with</b> anger. Then, by a {{powerful}} effort, he conquered himself; the villainous expression left his face; the storm of rage subsided. Great incentive {{there must have been}} for him thus to repress his emotions so quickly. He looked long at her with sinister, intent regard; then, with the laugh of a desperado, a laugh which might have indicated contempt for the failure of his suit, and which was fraught with a world of meaning, of menace, he left her {{without so much as a}} salute.|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor said}} nothing, but <b>breathed</b> <b>hard</b> and smoked vigorously.|$|R
60|$|The men pulled with set {{lips and}} dilated nostrils, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R
60|$|Having {{disposed}} of these preliminary compliments, the speakers paused, glared, and <b>breathed</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R
60|$|Benton seemed <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> laboring {{under its}} load of evil, dancing toward its close.|$|R
60|$|Whitney heard Andrew <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> and {{imagined}} that his injured leg {{was giving him}} trouble.|$|R
60|$|Mr Tappertit looked immensely big at a quartern loaf on the table, and <b>breathed</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this test is to see how your {{breathing}} feels and how your legs feel during exercise. There is no right or wrong answer. The pictures {{in front of you}} show how your breathing might feel, from no difficulty at all, to the most difficulty you can imagine. You might feel this difficulty breathing in your chest or in your throat. Another scale simply asks you to tell us {{how hard it is to}} breathe – from nothing at all, to the <b>hardest</b> <b>breathing</b> imaginable. <b>With</b> the final set of pictures, tell us how your legs feel – from nothing at all, to the hardest imaginable. We will ask you the same using this other scale (pointing to the Borg CR- 10).|$|R
60|$|Pete {{leaned against}} the back of the car, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard</b> and holding a piece of torn silk.|$|R
60|$|We {{stood at}} gaze, {{the length of}} the little low-ceilinged chamber between us, both of us <b>breathing</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was Herr Paul, {{holding a}} cigar in one hand, his {{hat in the}} other, and <b>breathing</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilks {{eyed him}} stupidly and, {{releasing}} his hand, coyly {{placed it in}} his trouser-pocket and <b>breathed</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} {{a look of}} bitter hatred crossed Dan Baxter's face. He clenched his fists and <b>breathed</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|R
60|$|Samoval stepped back, <b>breathing</b> <b>hard,</b> one cheek red, {{the other}} white. Yet by a miracle he still {{preserved}} his self-control.|$|R
60|$|When {{this had}} been done, those who demanded war breathed easier, but those who must direct the war <b>breathed</b> <b>harder.</b>|$|R
