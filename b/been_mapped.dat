The total size of Motul de San José is estimated at , with {{only about a third}} of this having <b>been</b> <b>mapped.</b> The ceremonial centre of the city covers an area of , an area which encompasses more than 144 structures including a sizeable palace, 6 stelae, 33 plazas of widely differing sizes, and various temples and elite residential areas. Further residential areas of the city cover an additional , which includes both elite and commoner residences, with outlying settlements located for several kilometers to the north and east, with one residential group associated with agricultural terraces being situated 2km {{to the north of the}} site. In total, 33 plaza groups have <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> at Motul de San José.|$|E
5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount {{is named after}} the ship that hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 and 16million years ago, in the Middle Miocene, eruptions of Columbia River basalts from {{volcanic}} vents {{in eastern}} Oregon and Washington flowed {{across much of}} northern Oregon, sometimes reaching the Pacific Ocean. Although these basalts have <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> in the West Hills under Marquam Hill, Hoyt Arboretum, and the steepest slopes of Forest Park, they flowed around but did not completely cover the Waverly Hills Formation in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E
30|$|We first {{discuss the}} strong {{relationship}} between RDR and default theories. We also characterised default theories that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to RDR trees. We then discuss the relationship between default theories and NRDR. We discuss how the policies presented {{in the previous section}} translate to constraints on default theories that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to NRDR. We will show how default theories, that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to NRDR, <b>are</b> less constrained than theories which can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to RDR. That is, the set of default theories that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to NRDR <b>is</b> larger than the set of those that can <b>be</b> <b>mapped</b> to RDR.|$|R

5|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{a history}} of alpine {{glaciation}} that is most obvious in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while none have <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> elsewhere on the forest, some may still exist in the Boulder, Pioneer, and White Cloud Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) has <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and {{is expressed}} {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% have only one abnormal copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E
5|$|Eight sacbe (causeways) {{have been}} located around Calakmul. Two {{of these have}} <b>been</b> <b>mapped,</b> three have been {{identified}} visually {{on the ground and}} three more identified with remote sensing. They have been numbered as Sacbe 1 through to Sacbe 7. The causeway network not only linked Calakmul with local satellite sites but also with more distant allies and rivals, such as the great cities of El Mirador, El Tintal and Nakbe. Those causeways that cross swampy land are elevated above the surrounding wetland and they now tend to support denser vegetation than the surrounding forest.|$|E

5|$|In 1533 Henry {{broke with}} Pope Paul III {{in order to}} annul the long-standing {{marriage}} to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of King Charles V of Spain, who took the annulment as a personal insult. As a consequence, France and the Empire declared an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraged the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England now appeared certain; that summer Henry made a personal inspection {{of some of his}} coastal defences, which had recently <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> and surveyed: he appeared determined to make substantial, urgent improvements.|$|E
5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} have <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> at Iximche. The {{structures were}} faced with stone blocks that were coated in lime plaster, which in some cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of the murals survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.|$|E
5|$|Amongst the line's 27 {{substantial}} structures, {{the greatest}} engineering challenge was {{posed by the}} point where the track met the Edinburgh City Bypass. At that point, a tunnel had to be constructed under the A720 road while it had been temporarily diverted; in total, the project incorporated five new associated road schemes. Major challenges were also posed by abandoned mine shafts {{to the north of the}} route, some of which dated to the 16th century and had not <b>been</b> <b>mapped.</b> More than 200 bridges were involved in the scheme, as the route crosses the Gala Water and River Tweed nineteen times. One of the most vital bridges on the line carries the track over Hardengreen roundabout on the A7, and required extensive works throughout 2013. Other works included digging out an infilled cutting on the outskirts of Galashiels and reconstructing a nearby bridge to allow the line to pass under power lines.|$|E

5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{plants such}} as Crofton weed and Formosa lily occur in {{inaccessible}} areas and probably cannot be eradicated but others are currently being managed. In 1995 the first action was taken to control the spread of introduced plants of the island, chiefly ground asparagus and bridal creeper, but also cherry guava, Madeira vine, Cotoneaster, Ochna and Cestrum. This has been followed by weeding tours {{and the formation of}} the Friends of Lord Howe Island group in 2000. Programs have also been started to remove weeds from private properties and revegetate some formerly cultivated areas. An Environmental Unit was created by the Board and it includes a Flora Management Officer and a permanent Weed Officer. Weeds have <b>been</b> <b>mapped</b> and an eradication program is in place, supported by improved education and quarantine procedures.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have <b>been</b> <b>mapped.</b> Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse. A grandson of Old King, Snow King, {{was at the center}} of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell. They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. Other factors, such as variations in expressivity and the influence of multiple genes, may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed. The white coat of the American White Horse has not yet <b>been</b> <b>mapped.</b>|$|E
