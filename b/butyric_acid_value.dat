40|$|Aims: Inhibition {{behavior}} of {{two types of}} antibiotics including Ampicillin and Gentamicin on specific methanogenic activity of anaerobic biomass has been investigated. Materials and Methods: A total of 18 Specific Methanogenic Activity (SMA) tests were conducted in 120 -ml vials containing 40 v/v% substrate, 37 v/v% biomass and 23 v/v% biogas in batch mode for 20 - 25 days.

Baled silage composition frequently {{differs from that}} of comparable conventional precision-chop silage. The lower final concentration of fermentation products in baled silage makes it more conducive to the activities of undesirable microorganisms. Silage additives can be used to encourage beneficial microbial activity and/or inhibit detrimental microbial activity. The experiment was organised in a 2 (chop treatments) × 6 (additive treatments) × 2 (stages of ensilage) factorial arrangement of treatments (n = 3 silos/treatment) to suggest additive treatments for use in baled silage production that would help create conditions more inhibitory to the activities of undesirable microorganisms and realise an outcome comparable to precision-chop silage. Chopping the herbage prior to ensiling, {{in the absence of an}} additive treatment, improved the silage fermentation. In the unchopped herbage, where the fermentation was poorer, the lactic acid bacterial inoculant resulted in an immediate increase (P < 0. 001) in lactic acid concentration and a faster decline (P < 0. 001) in pH with a subsequent reduction in <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> (P < 0. 001) and ammonia-N (P < 0. 01) concentrations.

The effect of glucose and xylose on the yield of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> produced by C. tyrobutyricum was investigated, separately. Cell growth of C. tyrobutyricum increased with increasing initial glucose or xylose concentration, but was not affected significantly when the concentration was above 55 g/l for glucose or 35 g/l for xylose. <b>Butyric</b> <b>acid</b> yield increased as the initial sugar concentration increased in both xylose and glucose, but the conversion rate from xylose or glucose to <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> decreased as the sugar concentration increased.

In this study, a simple in situ detoxification method using a surfactant {{was developed for}} <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production by Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755. Tween 80, a non-ionic surfactant, was chosen to sequester inhibitors by forming micelles, consequently preventing direct contact of inhibitors with cell membranes. When Tween 80 was added during fermentation, <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production was significantly enhanced {{in the presence of}} hydrophobic phenolics such as p-coumaric acid (0 vs. 3. 1 g/L <b>butyric</b> <b>acid)</b> and ferulic acid (2. 2 vs. 4. 6 g/L <b>butyric</b> <b>acid)</b> even at 0. 016 g/L of Tween 80 (corresponding to the critical micelle concentration). Lignin, a polyphenol compound in lignocellulose, was also detoxified by Tween 80.

50|$|<b>Butyric</b> <b>acid</b> {{was first}} {{observed}} in impure form in 1814 by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. By 1818, he had purified it sufficiently to characterize it. However, Chevreul did not publish his early research on butyric acid; instead, he deposited his findings in manuscript form {{with the secretary}} of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, France. Henri Braconnot, a French chemist, was also researching the composition of butter and was publishing his findings, and this led to disputes about priority. As early as 1815, Chevreul claimed that he had found the substance responsible for the smell of butter. By 1817, he published some of his findings regarding the properties of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> and named it. However, it was not until 1823 that he presented the properties of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> in detail. The name of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> comes from the Latin word for butter, butyrum (or buturum), the substance in which <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> was first found.|$|R
40|$|<b>Butyric</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} the subject of much {{attention}} last years due to its bioactivity. However, the potential advantages of butyrate are limited by the problem to reach enough plasma concentrations; therefore, pro-drugs have been proposed as an alternative to natural butyrate. A comparative study on in vitro intestinal digestion of 2, 3 -dibutyroil- 1 -O-octadecyl glycerol (D-SCAKG) and tributyrin (TB), as potential pro-drugs of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> was performed. Aliquots were taken at different times of digestion for studying the extent and rate of hydrolysis of both substrates. The micellar phase (MP) and oily phase (OP) formed in the digestion media were separated and their composition in lipid products was analyzed. Initially, it was confirmed that the in vitro model reproduced physiological results by testing against olive oil as a standard lipid. The progress of in vitro intestinal digestion of D-SCAKG was slower than that of TB. TB hydrolyzed completely to <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> whereas D-SCAKG mainly yielded 2 -butyroil- 1 -O-octadecyl glycerol (M-SCAKG), followed by <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> and 1 -O-octadecyl glycerol (AKG). The MP from both substrates mainly consisted of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid.</b> Minor levels of M-SCAKG and AKG were also found in the MP after hydrolysis of D-SCAKG, the M-SCAKG being mainly distributed in the OP. Therefore, D-SCAKG produced a stable form of esterified <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> as M-SCAKG after in vitro intestinal digestion, unlike TB. Additionally, such a product would integrate both bioactive compounds, <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> and alkylglycerol, within the same molecule. Free <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> and AKG would be also released, which are lipid products of interest as well. © AOCS 2011. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

3000|$|... pH {{control has}} been {{essential}} for butanol production with Clostridium acetobutylicum. However, {{it is not}} very clear at what pH level the acid crash will occur, at what pH level butanol production will be dominant, and at what pH level <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production will be prevailing. Furthermore, contradictory results have been reported about required acidic conditions for initiation of solventogenesis. In this study, {{with the aim of}} further understanding the role of undissociated <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> in butanol production, we investigated the correlation between undissociated <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and specific butanol production rate in batch fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum by comparing three pH control approaches: NaOH neutralization (at 12, 24 or 36 h), CaCO 3 supplementation (2, 5, or 8 g/l) and NaOAc buffering (pH 4.6, 5.0 or 5.6). By neutralizing the fermentation pH to ~ 5.0 at different time, we observed that neutralization should take place at the beginning of exponential phase (12 h), and otherwise resulting in lower concentrations of undissociated <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> cell biomass and final butanol. CaCO 3 supplementation extended cell growth to 36 h and resulted in higher butyrate yield under 8 g/L of CaCO 3. In the NaOAc buffering, the highest specific butanol rate (0.58 h− 1) was associated with the highest undissociated <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> (1.92 g/L). The linear correlation of the undissociated <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> with the specific butanol production rates suggested the undissociated <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> could be the major driving force for butanol production.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Butyric</b> <b>acid</b> is {{detected}} in periodontal pockets and {{is thought to}} be involved in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. We examined the effects of sodium bicarbonate on the butyric acid-induced epithelial cell damage. The human gingival carcinoma cell line Ca 9 - 22 was cultured in medium that contained <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> with or without sodium bicarbonate. The viability of cells treated with sodium bicarbonate was significantly higher than that of cells treated with <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> alone. The effects of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> on ICAM- 1 expression were significantly improved by sodium bicarbonate. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, sodium bicarbonate was indicated to be a useful therapeutic agent to reduce the butyric acid-induced periodontal tissue damage. (J.
