We focus on a study of the expected user performance through the CATALYST network based upon mathematical and simulation models. We investigate the performance of a mix of client/server architectures using Novell NetWare and Network File System protocols, which are supported by either the IEEE 802. 3 /Ethernet LANs, linked via LAN/ATM/satellite interface units.

40|$|The use of {{communication}} satellites {{as a possible}} way of offering <b>broadband</b> <b>island</b> interconnectivity {{appears to be a}} very attractive option, as it will enable the provision of an all-digital, transparent service to a number of ATM islands spanning a wide area, accommodating efficiently a variety of traffic demands. The CATALYST Project (RACE II/R 2074) is an attempt to demonstrate the applicability and compatibility of satellite technology with the terrestrial BISDN. In this paper we present an overview of the project and focus on an initial study of the expected user performance through the CATALYST network. Our analysis is based upon mathematical and simulation models and describes the end-system to end-system transfer delay for given message lengths. The protocol profiles assume a mix of Novell NetWare and Network File System client/server architectures, which are supported by either the IEEE 802. 3 /Ethernet or fibre distributed data interface LANs, which are themselves linked via LAN/ATM/satellite interface units. Areas of further investigation, and the implication of our analysis on the actual network architecture, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance studies of ATM via satellite based on experiments {{implemented by the}} RACE II CATALYST project R 2074. The purpose {{of the project was}} to develop an ATM satellite link for the future B-ISDN services, particularly for the interconnections of the ATM testbeds which are in the form of <b>broadband</b> <b>islands.</b> Then initial ATM based B-ISDN can be introduced by interconnections of these <b>broadband</b> <b>islands.</b> The CATALYST project has developed the equipment to be able to interconnect newly developed ATM testbeds as well as the existing networks such as DQDB, FDDI and Ethernet. Experiments carried out, demonstrated the capability of the satellite ATM connections to support data, voice, video and multimedia applications. These experiments provided a real system demonstration of ATM via satellite. In the light of the experiment, this paper evaluates the performance model and the capacity of the ATM satellite equipment, and studies the relevant issues and the impact of AT [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Access to {{high speed}} {{communication}} networks is {{taken for granted}} by many people in developed parts of the world. Broadband is becoming an integrated part of the modern infrastructure and Internet access is considered a human right {{in some of the}} most developed countries. Access to broadband communication networks has a lot of potential for undeveloped areas but is very rare in these locations. In places with poor transportation and bad roads efficient ways to communicate could make a great difference. In places where a national broadband network is missing dependency on national coordination can be circumvented by the creation of broadband islands with limited or no access to the Internet but high speed links locally. If relevant services are available locally this can drastically improve local communication. The ICT for rural development program (ICT 4 RD) aims to introduce sustainable broadband services in the Bunda and Serengeti districts in rural Tanzania through the creation of such a <b>broadband</b> <b>island.</b> For this purpose the two district capitals Bunda and Mugumu have been connected with a fiber optical line and a number of users have been connected in each town.   They also share a narrowband Internet link in Bunda with a capacity of 128 / 64 kbps that offers the users narrowband access to the internet.  A number of services have also been installed on the servers in Bunda and Mugumu. The primary goals for this thesis is to improve the relevance of the current network for the local users through means of bandwidth optimization, improving the local content, implementing local services and identifying critical aspects to ensure long term sustainability. To achieve these goals a field study was performed at the pilot site in Tanzania and information gathered through interviews, observations and external research. Services and systems were prepared in Sweden and tested, implemented or demonstrated on site. Important activities performed on site included gathering of requirements for bandwidth optimization using a caching and proxy server, testing of a videoconferencing system for the healthcare sector and demonstration of a recently developed reporting system for the local governments. A great demand for local content especially for the educational and healthcare sectors was also identified. There are however problems and room for improvements in several areas to ensure the sustainability of the network. More users need to be connected for the network to have a potential of becoming financially sustainable in the long run. To achieve this, content and services offered should be relevant to potential users, issues with the stability and availability of the network need to be resolved, communication between different stakeholders need to be improved and efforts should be put on teaching local people how to use computers by educating them and offering free of charge or very cheap introductory access to computers courses...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that satellites can play {{very important role}} in supporting B-ISDN services based on ATM technology. There have been several projects to exploit ATM over satellite for broadband services since 1992. These include the European RACE II CATALYST project which developed a satellite ATM demonstrator and the EPSRC project which studied the interconnection of <b>Broadband</b> ATM <b>Islands</b> via satellite. In a broadband network environment, ATM over satellite {{can be used for}} inter-network connections as transit link and for terminal access as access link. For transit link a small number of earth stations require a high bit rate link. Static bandwidth reservation based on estimated fixed rates provide a simple solution. However for terminal access a large number of terminals require low bit rate links. Since the traffic is expected to have large fluctuations, a dynamic reservation system is a more efficient but complex solution. Dynamic reservation Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) appears to be the best solutions, as it takes advantage of the flexibility and statistical multiplexing capabilities of ATM and supports all traffic classes. The paper shows that ATM over satellite can implement a flexible and efficient bandwidth resource management mechanisms which allows the satellite link to be configured to meet the requirements of broadband services from low bit rate to high bit rate. © 1996 The Institution of Electrical Engineers.
