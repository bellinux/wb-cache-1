And when we turn to the Chronicle itself the fact seems to <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> well borne out by what the author himself says in the record of that year.|$|E

Rhode Island {{is the only}} state where Dominicans are the largest Hispanic group. Dominicans are the most dominant Hispanic group in most of southeastern New England (Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts). Dominicans are also starting to <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> dominant in many areas in North Jersey and the Lower Hudson Valley. In New York City, the borough of Manhattan (New York County) is the only county in the country where Dominicans are the largest ancestral group and its Washington Heights neighborhood has long been considered the center of the Dominican American community. The 2010 Census estimated the nationwide Dominican American population at 1,414,703.|$|E

Medrano also said that they knew Pandora had to be young and reminiscent of Kratos' daughter, Calliope, and that [...] " [...] had to <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> without being sexy and spunky without being saucy." [...] Medrano said the character's final attire was a [...] "Greek Punk" [...] fashion style.|$|E
500|$|He {{made some}} changes in his {{delivery}} in September. [...] Instead of throwing sidearm, he raised his arm angle and threw from a three-quarters delivery, which pitching coach Mark Connor observed gave him more sink on his fastball and downward movement on his breaking ball. [...] "This {{has a chance to}} <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> good", Connor said. [...] "He was busting his fastball 94–95, the ball was sinking, and his four-seamer was cutting." ...|$|E
5000|$|On August 9, 2011 two-time Indy 500 winner Dan Wheldon {{signed on}} to the Simraceway team to help design the {{gameplay}} experience.

500|$|Many {{critics were}} {{extremely}} {{pleased with the}} call back to the teapot and Jim's note from [...] "Christmas Party". Adams felt that the scene, before the reveal of the note, was properly executed, and that the note made it even better. Sepinwall called it [...] "a fabulous payoff for longtime fans". Cornet called the sequence [...] "effective". Rick Porter of Zap2it wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "nice move" [...] {{on the part of the}} writers for [...] "not letting us know what Jim wrote on the card from 'Christmas Party' [...] it has to <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> epic." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1975 interview, Dufek noted {{his love}} of both sports: [...] "There are times when I've thought of {{dropping}} one or the other, but heck, I've been doing this since high school and it would <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> tough to quit them both now." [...] Dufek added: [...] "Hockey is a more relaxed thing. [...] It's a smaller atmosphere {{and you have to}} deal with only one or two coaches. [...] You can be more individual and flashy. [...] Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself." [...] In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL. [...] He explained: [...] "I've decided to pursue professional football because I would probably have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don't want that." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{high level}} of {{anticipation}} surrounded Summer Wars before its release, due to the critical and popular success of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. Kadokawa Shoten promoted the film online through their official YouTube channel, aiming at international as well as domestic fans. On April 8, 2009, a one-minute high-definition (HD) trailer was released followed by a longer trailer on June 16. On July 29, the Japanese website of Yahoo! Movies streamed the first five minutes of the film and Kadokawa offered the footage on their YouTube channel several days later to allow for international viewing. It also offered two of the film's 15-second television adverts online. Before its release Masao Maruyama believed that [...] "the film should <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> popular, since the pre-sales for the tickets are very high".|$|E
500|$|Michael Stipe {{sings in}} what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley {{described}} as [...] "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures". Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; {{in the chorus}} for [...] "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as [...] "mumbling" [...] by The Washington Post), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Creem writer John Morthland wrote in his review of Murmur, [...] "I still {{have no idea what}} these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [...] Stipe commented in 1984, [...] "It's just the way I sing. If I tried to control it, it would <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> false." [...] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of Fables of the Reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, Sacramone briefly stayed in Los Angeles and {{designed}} for Tank Farm, a men's fashion company.

[...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years, and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I think that would <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> much ideal." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Stone {{starred in}} the comedy The Rocker (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the [...] "straight face" [...] bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role. The actress, who describes herself as [...] "a big smiler and laugher", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure. Her next release, the romantic comedy The House Bunny, performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success. The film sees her play {{the president of a}} sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses' 1982 song [...] "I Know What Boys Like". Reviews for the film were generally negative, though she was praised for her supporting role, and TV Guide Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: [...] "She's positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that would <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> dim without her." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Cashmore of NME {{stated that}} it [...] "is a glorious snail’s-pace gush of braggadocio. In fact, if the album had wrapped up after [...] "Sanctified", rather than {{dribbling}} to a close with the weedy [...] "Walkin’ On Air" [...] and [...] "Thug Cry", then Mastermind would <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> much wall-to-wall bangers." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media gave this song the tag of [...] "Best New Track" [...] and stated, [...] "'Sanctified' is an outstanding entry into Ross and Kanye’s catalogue of stunners, but it never feels like Ross' song." [...] Christopher Weingarten of Rolling Stone said, the song [...] "shines with guest singer Betty Wright's powerful gospel rasp and Kanye West confessing his sins on a featured verse. Ross, meanwhile, ends up talking designer clothes and fellatio." [...] Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe said that [...] "Kanye West turns his host into an afterthought on the fine, gospel-influenced [...] "Sanctified".|$|E
500|$|... "Cruci-Fiction in Space" [...] further {{explores the}} Kennedy assassination, {{concluding}} {{that human beings}} have evolved from monkeys to men to guns. [...] "A Place in the Dirt" [...] is another personal song, characterized by Adam's self-analysis of his place in Holy Wood. [...] "The Nobodies" [...] is a mournful, elegiac dirge with a harpsichord and synthesized-drum introduction. The verse [...] "Today I am dirty and I want to <b>be</b> <b>pretty,</b> tomorrow I'll know that I'm just dirt" [...] has an Iggy Pop-style vocal delivery, building to the adrenaline-fueled chorus. CMJ noted that the song {{could be interpreted as}} a tribute to the Columbine shooters, but its point was not to glorify violence; rather, it was to depict a society drenched in its children's blood. [...] "The Death Song" [...] is the turning point for Adam; he no longer cares. Manson described it as sarcastic and nihilistic: [...] "it's like 'We have no future and we don't give a fuck'." [...] Kerrang! described it as one of the album's heaviest songs.|$|E

500|$|Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. James Griffiths of The Guardian commented: [...] "Here comes the Queen of Pop {{in a box}} so shiny you can see your face in it. Spears is described on the cover as 'the ultimate video performer', and watching the 20 promos contained within, it's difficult to argue. [...] Relentlessly thrusting herself at the camera, compulsively preening amid special FX galas, Britney is the MTV video age in human form." [...] He also complimented the innovations of the menu, but added that [...] "it's not particularly impressive" [...] and [...] "you need to <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> nifty with your handset to find them." [...] Music Week said: [...] "The DVD version of Spears' high-flying 'best of' set adds bells and whistles to the audio version at only a slight premium pricewise. Twenty promo videos are included, all with top-notch sound and vision". AllMusic gave the video {{four and a half}} stars out of five. Rolling Stone graded it with three out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|The {{multiplayer}} {{aspect of}} Red Dead Redemption received mixed commentary from critics. GamePros Will Herring praised {{the variety of}} multiplayer modes and the open gameplay, but noted that it put more responsibility on the players for keeping the game interesting. Justin Calvert of GameSpot also gave high marks for the game's variety of multiplayer modes, but {{felt that there was}} a lack in customization options for players. In a more critical view of multiplayer, Scott Sharkey of 1UP.com noted that games can suffer from griefing due to the open nature of multiplayer gameplay. He also criticized the leveling and unlocking aspects, noting that [...] "The first few minutes spent as a toothless miner riding a balky mule can <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> humiliating". G4TV's Jake Gaskill echoed this sentiment. He noted that the game often respawns players in a similar location to their death, which allows the killing player to repeatedly grief the other player. Rockstar has since added a feature which allows for players being griefed to transport to another area upon respawn.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} Benioff {{said about}} Daenerys Targaryen's transformation during the series, [...] "I think Dany's been becoming a Targaryen {{ever since the}} beginning of Season 1". According to Weiss, [...] "She's not her father and she's not insane and she's not a sadist, but there's a Targaryen ruthlessness that comes with even the good Targaryens". Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to <b>be</b> <b>pretty</b> nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown. So if she can {{make it all the way}} across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who's going to stand in her way?" ...|$|E
