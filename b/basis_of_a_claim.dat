5000|$|To further bolster his speeches, Cicero {{claimed that}} the Publius Rullus would sell Alexandria and Egypt. In 65 BC there was a {{proposal}} to annex Egypt.

Plutarch wrote his biographies more than 160 years after these events and Suetonius wrote his about 280 years later. The proposal was made on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> that Ptolemy Alexander I of Egypt bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Cicero said: [...] "I {{know that there is a}} resolution of the senate extant to the effect that it accepted the inheritance … Servilius Rullus will also, in accordance with his own law, sell Alexandria, and sell Egypt. He will be found to be the judge, the arbiter, the master, of a most wealthy city, and of a most beautiful country; yes, he will be found to be the king of a most opulent kingdom. Will he abstain from taking all this? from desiring all this? He will decide that Alexandria belongs to the king; he will by his sentence deprive the Roman people of it." [...] In the last part of the sentence Cicero implied that, should Egypt be annexed, the plebeian tribune and the other decemviri would use the sale of Alexandria and Egypt for their own profit.|$|E

40|$|Most {{standard}} forms of building contracts {{provide for the}} use of arbitration as a means of dispute resolution, failing which, the parties have to settle their disputes in court. Each dispute is resolved by examining whether the party who makes a contractual claim is able to discharge his burden of proof in both the liability issue and the quantum issue. The scope of proof is usually prescribed by the building contract. Evidence of information, facts and opinions may be adduced in support of a claim. Most project information may be stored in a web-based information management system. In existence are also some IT applications which may assist in providing facts and opinions that may support a claim. 4 D Modelling may be used to simulate critical paths for the evaluation of an extension of time claim. GPS may provide the tracking of the use of resources to help attribute the cost of their use to the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> The latest technology of LADAR may assist by recording through time, the as-built status of the project at any one time thereby determining the real-time progress of work. The use of computer-generated evidence is provided for by legislation and case law. This paves the way to use web-based tools to support a contractual claim in arbitration or litigation by linking the whole system to a claims service that monitors the situations where a claim may be made and trigger off a warning so that the procedure of claim may be pursued by a party if he chooses to do so. The claims service should then extract the necessary data from the other services in the project web to build up a claim...|$|E

Besides this security/insecurity dichotomy, security articulations are usually supported by {{the construction of an}} identity community, defined in opposition to an extreme Outside, or Other. In the human security discourse, however, such a clear identity construction cannot be found. With humanity as a whole as reference object, there is no clear Outside and no Other. Instead, human security articulates binary oppositions between a complex security understanding and a simple one. The logic builds on an opposition between the much broader categories of pluralism, humanism, solidarity and universalism on one side and realism and nationalism on the other. Instead of a fear of an extreme other, it is the fear of complex and global threats that unite this identity community. Human security, thus, rests on both a logical imperative for a global and broad-based response and a much more complex moral imperative of our common humanity and shared responsibility...|$|E
40|$|In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{unexpectedly}} {{announced that}} it was calling off the maternal-child HIV transmission clinical trials in developing countries, stating that it was satisfied with the results from the drug trial in Thailand. The announcement brought to an abrupt end a clinical trial that was ongoing in eleven countries but had been surrounded by controversy since its inception. The clinical trial had sparked numerous ethical debates, as some of the pregnant women who served as research subjects received a placebo in order to test the efficacy of a short course of AZT (also called zidovudine) in preventing perinatal transmission of HIV. Proponents of the study said that the research was necessary and was responsive to the existing economic and health conditions in developing countries. Critics countered that the use of placebos was unethical when a known effective treatment was available. This Article does not focus on the ethical debate, rather it aims to examine the legal question: can a woman who served as a research subject and whose child is now HIV-positive bring a lawsuit on behalf of the child against the physician-investigators? The author examines the prospects for bringing such a lawsuit against the researchers using the framework of the Alien Tort Claims Act. In doing so, the author demonstrates that the major principles of medical experimentation involving human subjects, particularly the requirement of the informed consent of research subjects, have risen to the level of international customary law and therefore could provide the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> The author states that, while such a claim does not mean an end to all clinical trials using placebos, it does suggest that the medical research community needs to develop stronger and clearer guidelines and more strictly enforce these standards. In the absence of this, the author notes, human rights law can provide an alternative means of protecting the most vulnerable of populations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a right of a third party to prevent {{enforcement}} on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> and evidence that rights or assets seized in enforcement proceeding belong to him (third party) {{and not to the}} enforcement debtor. In most of jurisdictions that were subject of analysis of this paper, this right of a third party is exercised by filing an objection to the court conducting enforcement proceedings. The claim of the third party is directed towards the enforcement creditor as well as against the enforcement debtor. In the event the claim of the third party is being contested, the court instructs the third party to initiate litigation proceedings for determining whether the third party is entitled to exclusion of such rights or assets from enforcement, especially if such third party holds property rights or some other rights over the assets that are being subject to enforcement proceedings. In majority of analyzed jurisdictions, enforcement proceedings are being suspended provided the third party, in the objection being filed makes prima facie likely, on the basis of credible evidence, that his assets were seized in the enforcement proceedings. However, according to the law of the Republic of Serbia, a credible objection of a third party does not result in suspension of enforcement proceedings, something that is being criticized in this paper. As a result of this provision of the law, a bona fide third party is forced to endure the enforcement although his claim has been made likely and subsequently confirmed in the litigation proceedings. The author, in particular, points to the legal consequences of mala fide enforcement creditor that knew that the assets that are being subject of the enforcement proceedings do not belong to the enforcement debtor. The author is of the opinion that, in such cases, the enforcement creditor should be obliged to pay to the third party damages that such party suffered as a result of enforcement proceedings being instigated against his assets...|$|E

40|$|The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) {{provides}} {{that the district}} courts shall have original jurisdiction over any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed {{in violation of the}} law of nations or a treaty of the United States. Several decisions have rejected environmental claims under the ATS because they read the ATS narrowly to protect only the most fundamental international human rights such as those prohibiting torture or war crimes and have been unwilling to accept broader claims to a right to life or a healthy environment. In 2002, in Sarei v. Rio Tinto PLC, the District Court for the Central District of California concluded that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which prohibits marine pollution affecting international waters, codified customary international law that may provide the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> under the ATS even though the United States has never ratified UNCLOS. The court, however, dismissed all of the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 claims as presenting nonjusticiable political questions and alternatively dismissed the UNCLOS claim under the act of state doctrine and the doctrine of international comity. Even though it ultimately dismissed the case, the district court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Sarei that UNCLOS constitutes customary international law cognizable under the ATS could enable plaintiffs to bring customary international law claims based on several MEAs that the United States has never ratified provided that a sufficiently large number of other nations have recognized that the agreement at issue implicates specific, universal and obligatory norms of international law. In 2004, the Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain held that federal courts should allow ATS suits based on principles of contemporary international law only if those norms have both wide acceptance and definite content comparable to those recognized as causes of action in 1789, especially piracy. In 2006, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court 2 ̆ 7 s decision that UNCLOS constitutes customary international law that is cognizable under the ATS because the Convention has been widely adopted. On April 12, 2007, however, in response to the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s petition for rehearing and for rehearing en banc, the three-judge panel withdrew its 2006 opinion and issued a superseding opinion. The majority did not decide whether the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 substantive claims were valid, but did conclude that the allegations were sufficiently serious to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court 2 ̆ 7 s dismissal of all claims as nonjusticiable political questions and vacated the district court 2 ̆ 7 s dismissal of the UNCLOS claims on act of state and comity grounds, for reconsideration in light of its opinion. On August 20, 2007, the Ninth Circuit ordered that the case be reheard by the en banc court. The order stated, 2 ̆ 2 The three judge panel opinion shall not be cited as precedent by or to this court or any district court of the Ninth Circuit, except to the extent adopted by the en banc court. 2 ̆ 2 The Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision to grant a rehearing by the en banc court may reflect its concern about an overly broad interpretation by the three-judge panel opinion, although {{it is impossible to know}} until the Circuit issues its opinion in the case. On rehearing en banc, the Ninth Circuit should hold that the UNCLOS claim is not cognizable under the ATS because the content of UNCLOS is not as definite as the norms recognized in 1789. Even under a broad interpretation of Sosa, most principles in international environmental agreements such as sustainable development are simply too vague to be enforceable. Courts should generally reject ATS suits based on general language or principles in MEAs because they do not possess a definite content comparable to those recognized in 1789 and thus fail to meet the Sosa standard. International courts and arbitration procedures are better suited to addressing transboundary pollution issues than American courts. Following Sosa, courts in ATS suits should usually recognize only serious human rights abuses such as torture as comparable to those recognized in 1789...|$|E

5000|$|With the {{invention}} of radiocarbon dating archaeologists immediately scoured the islands {{in search of the}} earliest possible samples. One of the very first samples from the Pu‘u Ali‘i sand dune came suggested as early as 124±60 AD. Over the next ten years the early radiocarbon dating of Hawaiian samples started to return dates suggesting sometime first humans arrived sometime between 300 AD to 800 AD casting doubt on Pu‘u Ali‘i sand dune sample. Accordingly, it was retested with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second lab and to their dismay could not be replicated and was instead revised to roughly 1000 to 1350 AD. However a sample from Waiahukini was interpreted as beginning around AD 750 which now formed the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claimed</b> first discovery. Testing continued at sites around Hawaii to find the earliest dates. At the same time of the research done by the Honolulu Museum, the University of Honolulu excavated several sites in O'ahu which would suggest dates of AD 600 to 1100. However these results did not match the archaeological results obtained from examining the spread of Polynesians from their homeland in Tahiti. Regardless by the close <b>of</b> the 1970s <b>a</b> model <b>of</b> Polynesian settlement chronology emerged suggesting multiple contacts with the island relying on the Pu‘u Ali‘i sand dune sample posited (although revised in 1969 as actually sometime between 1000 and 1350 AD) as supporting a possible earlier wave of settlement in 124 AD, with a long pause in between.
