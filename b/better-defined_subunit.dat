40|$|Anaplasma marginale is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} tick-borne livestock pathogen and poses a significant threat to cattle industry. In contrast to currently available live blood-derived vaccines against A. marginale, alternative safer and <b>better-defined</b> <b>subunit</b> vaccines will be of great significance. Two proteins (VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 9 - 2) from the Type IV secretion system of A. marginale {{have been shown to}} induce humoral and cellular immunity. In this study, Escherichia coli were used to express VirB 9 - 1 and VirB 9 - 2 proteins. Silica vesicles having a thin wall of 6 nm and pore size of 5. 8 nm were used as the carrier and adjuvant to deliver these two antigens both as individual or mixed nano-formulations. High loading capacity was achieved for both proteins, and the mouse immunisation trial with individual as well as mixed nano-formulations showed high levels of antibody titres over 107 and strong T-cell responses. The mixed nano-formulation also stimulated high-level recall responses in bovine T-cell proliferation assays. These results open a promising path towards the development of efficient A. marginale vaccines and provide better understanding on the role of silica vesicles to deliver multivalent vaccines as mixed nano-formulations able to activate both B-cell and T-cell immunity, for improved animal health...|$|E
