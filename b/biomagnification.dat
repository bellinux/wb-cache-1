Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through <b>biomagnification)</b> than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood.

5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called <b>biomagnification.</b> Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

As MeHg is found to accumulate in the carnivore fish sample in higher level than that in control, the methylation of inorganic Hg occurs in the marine environment of BB.

With thinner shells, fewer falcon eggs survived to hatching. In several parts of the world, such as the eastern United States and Belgium, this species became extirpated (locally extinct) as a result. An alternate point of view is that populations in the eastern North America had vanished due to hunting and egg collection.

30|$|Heavy metals are {{naturally}} occurring elements {{that have a}} relatively high atomic weight and density compared to water. Their multiple applications have resulted in wide distribution in the environment; raising concerns over their potential effects on {{human health and the}} environment. Heavy metal contamination now a day {{is one of the major}} global environmental concern and the main sources of heavy metal contamination are either natural or anthropogenic. Depending on soil pH and their specification these heavy metals can become mobile in soils and in this way, a small part of the total mass can leach to aquifer or can become bioavailable to living organisms (Hookoom and Puchooa 2013). Industrial wastewater is commonly used for irrigation in most of the developing third world countries (Bouwer 2002). Without proper treatment, release of heavy metals in effluent waste poses a menace to public health because of its persistence, <b>biomagnifications</b> and accumulation in food chain (Issazadeh et al. 2014). As the number of industries is being increased day by day in the modern world, with this the concentration of heavy metals is also being increased.

These fields are characterized by different depths, geological context and chemical composition of the hydrothermal fluid, particularly the metal content, which is reflected by the metal concentrations in the organisms. Indeed, our results show that organisms from Menez Gwen presented the highest Hg concentrations, while those from Lucky Strike and Rainbow were richer in Cu and Zn. The potential transfer of these metals through two trophic links are also evaluated and include (1) the mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus and the commensal worm Branchipolynoe seepensis, and (2) three different species of shrimps and the crab Segonzacia mesatlantica. No evidence of Hg <b>biomagnifications</b> in either of the vent food chains is clearly observed but an increase in Hg accumulation from prey to predator in the crustacean food chain.

2500|$|Bioaccumulation is {{the process}} by which an {{organism}} takes in chemicals through ingestion, exposure, and inhalation. Bioaccumulation is broken down into bioconcentration (uptake of chemicals from just water) and <b>biomagnification</b> (uptake of chemicals from a food source). Certain species of aquatic organisms are affected differently from the chemicals released from creosote preservatives. One of the more studied organisms is a mollusk. Mollusks attach to the wooden, marine pilings and are in direct contact with the creosote preservatives. Many studies have been conducted using Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are low molecular hydrocarbons found in some creosote-based preservatives. In a study conducted from Pensacola, Florida, a group of native mollusks were kept in a controlled environment, and a different group of native mollusks were kept in an environment contaminated with creosote preservatives. The mollusks in the contaminated environment were shown to have a bioaccumulation of up to ten times the concentration of PAH than the control species. The intake of organisms is dependent on whether the compound is in an ionized or an un-ionized form. To determine whether the compound is ionized or un-ionized, the pH of the surrounding environment must be compared to the pKa or acidity constant of the compound. If the pH of the environment is lower than the pKa, then the compound is un-ionized which means that the compound will behave as if it is non-polar. Bioaccumulation for un-ionized compounds comes from partitioning equilibrium between the aqueous phase and the lipids in the organism. If the pH is higher than the pKa, then the compound is considered to be in the ionized form. The un-ionized form is favored because the bioaccumulation is easier for the organism to intake through partitioning equilibrium. The table below shows a list of pKas from compounds found in creosote preservatives and compares them to the average pH of seawater (reported to be 8.1).|$|E

Catla catla showed significantly (P Ni>As. Among exposed fish species, Cirrhina mrigala exhibited significantly higher ability to amass Ni (146. 8 ± 149. 1 μg g- 1) and Zn (243. 0 ± 190. 5 μg g- 1), followed by Ctenopharyngodon idella, Labeo rohita and Catla catla at 96 -h LC 50. Liver showed higher tendency to accumulate Ni, followed by gills and kidney with significant differences while kidney showed higher tendency to accumulate As, followed by liver. Fins and scales exhibited significantly (P< 0. 05) least tendency to accumulate all the three metals.

In course of the different industrial and agricultural processes, the heavy metals are released and eventually contaminate the aquatic ecosystems. For instance, cadmium, considered as one of the important heavy metal pollutant, is added to the aquatic ecosystems through activities in mining, electroplating, battery, paint and ceramic industries, in addition to the natural deposits. The disposal of heavy metals in aquatic systems concentrates as a cascading effect in the trophic levels, frequently recognized in the form of bioaccumulation and <b>biomagnifications</b> (Brooks et al. 2004; Tao et al. 2012).

Levels of toxic metals (Cd, Pb and Hg) and metalloid (As) in hippopotami liver from the South Luangwa National Park in Zambia were far lower compared to the established values of toxic levels in cattle.

More than 99 % of heavy metals entering into a river can be stored in river sediments in various ways (Salomons and Stigliani 1995). Heavy metals can fix in sediment for short periods. Physico-chemical characteristics of water conditions vary season to season. A small amount of these fixed heavy metals will re-enter the overlying water body and uptake by the aquatic biota. Rivers receive sediment from various points and diffused sources which deposited at the bottom of the river and acts as both carriers and potential sources of metal accumulation in aquatic food chain by the process of <b>biomagnifications</b> (Theofanis et al. 2001).
