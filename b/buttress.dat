5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area for winter {{climbing}} in the Lake District. The steep headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped <b>buttress</b> {{on the right-hand side}} of the face, known to climbers as Viking <b>Buttress,</b> and in a couple of gullies which lead to the summit.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{was erected}} around 1895 {{on the front}} <b>buttress</b> of St David's Church on Ingram Street in Glasgow next to the Ramshorn Cemetery, near his birthplace in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|There are {{symmetrical}} {{differences between}} the left- and right-hand sides of the painting. This is most noticeable with the <b>buttress,</b> where the receding edges are over half again the size {{of those on the}} front sides. In addition, the breadth of the <b>buttress</b> contradicts the spatial depth of the much tighter space inhabited by the Virgin and Child. This is a technical issue with foreshortening Campin also struggled with, but which van der Weyden resolves in his mature work.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{the flying}} <b>buttresses</b> had been destroyed, {{and the walls}} and <b>buttresses</b> had many breaches.|$|R
25|$|The {{exterior}} has perforated gables {{with sharp}} points, narrow <b>buttresses</b> with many pinnacles, and openwork flying <b>buttresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Seen {{from the}} place du Martray, the nave part of the cathedral's {{exterior}} displays massive <b>buttresses</b> and large flying <b>buttresses.</b> The central <b>buttresses</b> of the choir have pilasters some having 4 statues at their base depicting Breton saints and legendary figures. Here are some images of the cathedral exterior.|$|R
5|$|Zion is {{a center}} for rock climbing, with short walls like Touchstone, Moonlight <b>Buttress,</b> Spaceshot, and Prodigal Son being very popular.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{argued for}} {{stronger}} basic legal (constitutional) protection of economic {{rights and freedoms}} to further promote industrial-commercial growth and prosperity and <b>buttress</b> democracy and freedom {{and the rule of}} law generally in society.|$|E
5|$|Over ten Han-era {{underground}} tombs {{have been}} found, {{many of them}} featuring archways, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require <b>buttress</b> supports since they were {{held in place by}} earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} a large Gothic Revival style {{building}} made of [...] "rock-faced red Albion sandstone". It sports <b>buttresses</b> and flying <b>buttresses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|John Stacpoole, an {{architectural}} historian, {{in discussing the}} many wooden ecclesiastical buildings designed by Christian Julius Toxward, has stated that [...] "St Mary's was the most interesting, being quite {{different from any other}} interpretation of the Gothic style so far seen in New Zealand." [...] This style was especially noted for his false <b>buttresses</b> [...] "in all directions." [...] Clasping <b>buttresses</b> were topped with spirelets, and nave <b>buttresses</b> were carried above the eaves lines and joined by pierced parapets. [...] "St Mary's - a church with a clerestory - had flying <b>buttresses</b> as well. Great play was made with valances and gable crestings ... while even the undersides of the flying <b>buttresses</b> were deeply toothed. It was all very un-English." ...|$|R
6000|$|... § II. <b>Buttresses</b> are of many kinds, {{according}} to the character {{and direction of the}} lateral forces they are intended to resist. But their first broad division is into <b>buttresses</b> which meet and break the force before it arrives at the wall, and <b>buttresses</b> which stand on the lee side of the wall, and prop it against the force.|$|R
5|$|The two-storey Master's Tower was the {{original}} access to the College from the river. A single-storey structure {{is attached to the}} south side. The ruined gateway stands to the south separated from the other structures by the almshouses. Poste records that in 1847 it stood between two barns, neither of which now remain. It consists of a pointed arch for carriages in a roughly coursed rag-stone wall flanked by <b>buttress</b> walls on each side.|$|E
5|$|St Edern's {{is built}} in the Perpendicular style using local stone, with blocks of cut {{sandstone}} as the external face. The roof is made from slate with stone copings and has a bellcote at the west end, with one bell (dating probably from the 17th century). There is one external <b>buttress</b> to the south-east of the nave to help support {{the weight of the}} building, and there are crosses {{on the roof of the}} porch and at the east end of the nave and chancel roofs.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} Saint Mary the Virgin and {{was built in}} the mid-12th century. The Norman {{building}} was altered throughout the following millennium, particularly in 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th centuries. The 12th-century building now comprises the current nave, with additions seen in the Forster Chapel and chancel (13th century), the steeple (14th century), and vestry (17th century). The 17th-century Jacobean pulpit is an unusual heptagonal design. Various additions were made to the structure in the 14th and 15th centuries, primarily to the walls and ogee windows. A scratch dial was added to the south-west <b>buttress</b> in the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|In the {{northern}} and southern sides of the bridge there are brick <b>buttresses</b> on some break waters, and between every two <b>buttresses</b> on the supports there is a nine-meter vestibule with a ribbed arch extending nine meters. These vestibules and circular <b>buttresses</b> {{on both sides of the}} bridge have made the bridge one of the most beautiful bridges of the Safavid Period.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} {{columns of}} the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying <b>buttresses,</b> with their associated vertical <b>buttresses</b> jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, {{the walls and}} the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow <b>buttresses,</b> the walls could be opened up into large windows.|$|R
40|$|As {{the stress}} {{is one of}} the main factors {{affecting}} the safe operation of the pipeline in the gas pipeline tunnel crossing project, in order to ensure the safe operation of the pipeline, it is necessary to research the stress conditions of the gas pipelines in the deviated well. In this study, we discuss on these two aspects of the gas pipelines in the deviated well: the necessity of adding <b>buttresses</b> and the distance between <b>buttresses.</b> We do the numerical simulation of China Shaanxi-Beijing III gas pipeline in the Eighth Fort Yellow River tunnel areas using stress analysis software CAESAR II; exploring its secure and economical <b>buttresses</b> distance. Our research shows that the pipeline can be safely run after adding <b>buttresses</b> and it is more reasonable to set <b>buttresses</b> distance of 20 m for the numerical example. Our research provides a reference for the design of the <b>buttresses</b> distance of gas pipelines in the deviated well and has some engineering value...|$|R
5|$|The Pensacola Dam, {{also known}} as the Grand River Dam, is a multiple-arch <b>buttress</b> dam on the Grand River {{in-between}} Disney and Langley in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The dam is operated by the Grand River Dam Authority and creates Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. After decades of vision and planning, it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation, flood control and recreation. It is Oklahoma's first hydroelectric power plant and {{is referred to as the}} longest multiple-arch dam in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (<b>buttress)</b> or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
5|$|The west {{tower is}} surmounted with crenellations and pinnacles and is {{supported}} by stepped buttresses at each corner. The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest on stone plinths, each bearing carved shields, that on the north <b>buttress</b> with an inaccurate rendering of {{the arms of the}} see, and the other with a cross and a dolphin. The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the belfry and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E
50|$|The most {{striking}} feature of Paoay Church is the 24 huge <b>buttresses</b> of about 1.67 m thick {{at the sides}} and {{back of the church}} building. Extending from the exterior walls, it was conceived to a solution to possible destruction of the building due to earthquakes. Its stair-like <b>buttresses</b> (known as step <b>buttresses)</b> at the sides of the church is possibly for easy access of the roof.|$|R
5000|$|Seven <b>Buttresses</b> (...) is {{a series}} of seven rock <b>buttresses,</b> 150 m high, which are {{separated}} by narrow icefalls and extend for 4 nautical miles (7 km) along the west side of Tabarin Peninsula, the east extremity of Trinity Peninsula. Probably first sighted by a party under J. Gunnar Andersson of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1901-04. The Seven <b>Buttresses</b> were surveyed and named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), 1946.|$|R
50|$|The side façade has {{prominent}} <b>buttresses</b> {{that support}} {{the weight of the}} arches and vault of the nave. Between each pair of <b>buttresses</b> is a lancet window. In the centre of this façade is the Door of Avemaria.|$|R
5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch <b>buttress</b> dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to <b>buttress</b> the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century it was rented by a farmer for storage. Because of its poor {{condition}} it was recommended for demolition in both 1896 and 1901. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a public appeal {{to raise money}} for repairs to which Jane Morris, Thomas Hardy and George Bernard Shaw contributed. As the funding for the restoration was no longer an issue the building was acquired, in 1911, by the National Trust who employed Ernest Barnsley of the Barnsley brothers, the Arts and Crafts movement master builders, to design and the work. It was carried out by Norman Jewson and William Weir. The work left in place and strengthened earlier structures where possible but added new aspects including a stone <b>buttress</b> and a kitchen range.|$|E
50|$|The dam {{has four}} {{distinct}} sections of <b>buttressed</b> spillways {{and a solid}} spillway. A concrete walkway extends across the dam over the <b>buttresses</b> until {{it comes to the}} larger spillway, where it is carried by a Pratt through truss.|$|R
50|$|The side {{elevations}} feature large Tudor {{stained glass}} windows delineated by <b>buttresses.</b> The transepts are <b>buttressed</b> and include each a pair of tall Tudor windows and large stained glass window above. There is a copper cross atop each transept.|$|R
25|$|Three <b>buttresses</b> {{with three}} ramps each support {{the north and}} south sides of the church, {{separating}} the walls into three bays and a chancel, each of which contains a Y-tracery window. The bevels of the <b>buttresses</b> follow the water table in height, each being nine bricks tall. The church is singular among standing churches in having buttresses: the only other documented <b>buttresses</b> are at the Jamestown Church of 1639 to 1647 and the second Bruton Parish Church of 1680.|$|R
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to <b>buttress</b> the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{north face}} {{is also one}} of Scotland's {{foremost}} venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing, and holds snow until quite late in the year; in a good year, routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring. Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs, including the four main ridges; Tower Ridge, for example, is grade IV on the Scottish winter grading system, having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team, there being numerous benightments and incidents every winter season. Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis is The Curtain (IV,5) {{on the left side of}} the Càrn Dearg <b>Buttress.</b> At the top end of the scale, Centurion in winter is a grade VIII,8 face climb.|$|E
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have <b>buttress</b> roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
25|$|The Warrant Design showed {{external}} <b>buttresses</b> on {{the ground}} floor level.These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external <b>buttresses</b> altogether. The clerestorey and vault are reinforced with flying <b>buttresses,</b> which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength. These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper storey which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters the thrust of the <b>buttresses</b> on the lower walls.|$|R
50|$|Alley Callejón de las Monjas, In 1699 {{are built}} the flying <b>buttresses</b> {{crossing}} this alley for holding {{the walls of}} the church that began to bend {{under the weight of the}} vaults. These <b>buttresses</b> join Santa María and the Convento de la Encarnación.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} frontage to College Road {{has three}} double-storeyed projecting bays with parapeted gables and corner <b>buttresses</b> to the Great Hall and end classrooms. The {{eastern and western}} frontages have single, central double-storeyed projecting bays, also with corner <b>buttresses</b> and parapeted gables.|$|R
