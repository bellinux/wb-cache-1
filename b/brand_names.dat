40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the value to consumers of the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element for established brands, given that the focus in the literature has been on new brands. To accomplish this, conceptual development was initially undertaken to illuminate the links between the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element and the brand entity and to provide a theoretical framework for looking at changes in value of the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element to consumers over time. Design/methodology/approach – A conjoint analysis experimental approach was used. This involved consumers making trade-off decisions between changes in <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> and changes in price for established brands, where they were active purchasers. This approach enabled isolation of the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element and obtained the relative value of the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element for each participant. Findings – The mean value obtained for the importance of the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element for established products appeared to show substantial importance to consumers. However, further analysis identified a position where the majority of participants placed little value on the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element and a smaller but material group perceived its value as of overwhelming importance. Originality/value – This paper advances branding theory through clarification of the relationship between the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element and the brand entity. It provides theoretical argument and empirical data for the value of the <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> element to the consumer differing between established and new brand...|$|R

Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide, but still has industrial applications.

5|$|Having recovered, {{the company}} worked to expand {{geographically}} into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., {{and by the}} end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla-brand juice.|$|E
5|$|In {{controlled}} {{studies in}} the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did likeHondamore than non-matching brands).They speculated that <b>brand</b> <b>names</b> {{are more likely to}} communicate identity to others than other everyday things.Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.The effect mainly occurred for big brands.

5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse <b>brand</b> <b>names,</b> among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E

40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value from an external {{point of view of}} perception of the Slovenian consumers. Based on the stratified survey and quantitative research we note the relationship between the origin of the product, marketing mix elements, and the perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value. Emphasis is placed on establishing how the origin of the product impacts on the perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value and what its impact is on the perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value in comparison with selected marketing mix elements. The article presents the model of conceptual relationships between the origin of the product and perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value, which was tested with a structural model of relationships between the origin of the product and perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value. We developed a measuring instrument and procedures for checking {{the reliability and validity of}} the structural model of perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value of the product. The conceptual model and the relationships within the model were evaluated by means of the modelling with linear structural equations on a selected sample of respondents, which enabled verification of the conceptual model with empirical data. It has been found that the origin of the product has at least such a statistically significant influence on the perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value as the selected marketing mix elements (advertising, product, distribution, and price). marketing mix, country of origin, <b>brand,</b> perceived <b>brand</b> <b>name</b> value...|$|R
