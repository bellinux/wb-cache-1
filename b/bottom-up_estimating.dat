50|$|Project cost {{management}} is traditionally a weak area of IT projects. IT project managers must acknowledge {{the importance of}} {{cost management}} and take responsibility for understanding basic cost concepts, cost estimating, budgeting, and cost control.Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management {{to be effective in}} managing project cost. Important concepts include profits and profit margins, life cycle costing, cash flow analysis, sunk cost, and learning curve theory.Planning cost management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost. The main output of this process is a cost management plan.Estimating costs is {{a very important part of}} project cost management. There are several types of cost estimates, including rough order of magnitude (ROM), budgetary, and definitive. Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle, and each has a different level of accuracy. Several tool and techniques can help you develop cost estimates, including analogous estimating, <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimating,</b> parametric estimating, and computerized tools.Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time. It is important to understand how particular organizations prepare budgets so estimates are made accordingly.Controlling cost includes monitoring cost performance, reviewing changes, and notifying project stakeholders of changes related to cost. Many basic accounting and finance principles relate to cost project management. Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance. Earned value management integrates scope, cost, and schedule information. Project portfolio management allows organization to collect and control an entire suite of projects or investments as one set of interrelated activities.Several software products can assists with project cost management. Enterprise project management software and portfolio management software can help managers evaluate data on multiple projects.|$|E

Current inversions indicate a net terrestrial CO 2 sink in China between 0. 16 and 0. 35 [*]PgC/yr. The uncertainty of these estimates is {{as large as}} the mean because the atmospheric network historically contained only one high altitude station in China. Here, we revisit the calculation of the terrestrial CO 2 flux in China, excluding emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production, by using two inversions with three new CO 2 monitoring stations in China as well as aircraft observations over Asia. We estimate a net terrestrial CO 2 uptake of 0. 39 - 0. 51 [*]PgC/yr with a mean of 0. 45 [*]PgC/yr in 2006 - 2009. After considering the lateral transport of carbon in air and water and international trade, the annual mean carbon sink is adjusted to 0. 35 [*]PgC/yr. To evaluate this top-down estimate, we constructed an independent <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimate</b> based on ecosystem data, and giving a net land sink of 0. 33 [*]PgC/yr. This demonstrates closure between the top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates.</b> Both top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> give a higher carbon sink than previous estimates made for the 1980 s and 1990 s, suggesting a trend towards increased uptake by land ecosystems in China...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn 2013, we {{proposed}} a novel bottom-up approach to bounding low-dose cancer risks that may result from small exogenous exposures to chemicals that are always present in the body {{as a result of}} normal biological processes. The approach utilizes the background cancer risk and the background (endogenous) concentration of a cancer-related exposure biomarker in specific target tissues. After allowing for statistical uncertainty in these two parameters, the ratio of the background risk to background exposure provides a conservative slope factor estimate that can be utilized to bound the added risk that may be associated with incremental exogenous exposures. Our original <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> were markedly smaller than those obtained previously by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) with a conventional top-down approach to modeling nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia mortality data from a US worker cohort.

40|$|The {{trend and}} interannual {{variability}} of methane sources {{are derived from}} multi-annual simulations of tropospheric photochemistry using a 3 D global chemistry-transport model. Our semi-inverse analysis uses the fifteen years (1979 - 1993) re-analysis of ECMWF meteorological data and annually varying including photo-chemistry, in conjunction with observed CH 4 concentration distributions and trends derived from the NOAA-CMDL surface stations. Dividing the world in four zonal regions, (45 - 90 N, 0 - 45 N, 0 - 45 S; 45 - 90 S) we find good agreement in each region between (top-down) calculated emission trends from model simulations and (<b>bottom-up)</b> <b>estimated</b> anthropogenic emission trends based on the EDGAR global anthropogenic emission database, which amounts for the period 1979 - 1993 2. 7 Tg CH 4 yr - 1 . Also the top-down determined total global methane emission compares well with the total of the <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates.</b> We use {{the difference between the}} bottom-up and top-down determined emission trends to calculate residual emissions. These residual emissions represent the inter-annual variability of the methane emissions. Simulations have been performed in which the year-to-year meteorology, the emissions of ozone precursor gases, and the stratospheric ozone column distribution are either varied, or kept constant. The analyses reveals that the variability of the emissions is of the order of 8 Tg CH 4 yr - 1 , and most likely related to mid- and low-latitude wetland emissions and/or biomass burning.

40|$|Abstract. Methane has {{exhibited}} significant interannual variability with {{a slowdown in}} its growth rate beginning in the 1980 s. We use a 3 -D chemical transport model accounting for interannually varying emissions, transport, and sinks to analyze trends in CH 4 from 1988 to 1997. Variations in CH 4 sources were based on meteorological and country-level socioeconomic data. An inverse method was used to optimize the strengths of sources and sinks for a base year, 1994. We present a best-guess budget along with sensitivity tests. The analysis suggests that the sum of emissions from animals, fossil fuels, landfills, and waste water estimated using the IPCC default methodology is too high. Recent <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> of the source from rice paddies appear to be too low. Previous top-down estimates of emissions from wetlands may be a factor of two higher than <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> because of possible overestimates of OH. The model captures the general decrease in the CH 4 growth rate observed from 1988 to 1997 and the anomalously low growth rates during 1992 - 1993. The slowdown in the growth rate is attributed {{to a combination of}} slower growth of sources and increases in OH. The economic downturn in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe made a significant contribution to the decrease in the growth rate of emissions. The 1992 - 1993 anomaly can be explained by fluctuations in wetland emissions and OH after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. The results suggest that the recent slowdown of CH 4 may be temporary. 1 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction [2] Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is {{an important}} component of the atmospheric chemical system and has both natural and anthropogenic sources [Logan et al., 1981]. Three-dimensional atmospheric chemical model (CTM) simulations using inventory-based <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> of CO sources have shown that human activities contribute substantially to CO concentrations on regional and global scales [e. g., Kanakidou and Crutzen, 1999; Granier et al., 1999; Holloway et al., 2000; Bey et al., 2001]. However, significant uncertainties persist in regional estimates of anthropogenic CO sources derived using bottom-up approaches, leading to corresponding uncertainties in the predicted human impacts on the atmospheric CO distribution. In a different approach, Bergamaschi et al.

40|$|Quantification of {{the present}} and future {{contribution}} to atmospheric methane (CH 4) from lakes, wetlands, fluvial systems, and, potentially, coastal waters remains an important unfinished task for balancing the global CH 4 budget. Discriminating between these sources is crucial, especially across climate-sensitive Arctic and subarctic landscapes and waters. Yet basic underlying uncertainties remain, in such areas as total wetland area and definitions of wetlands, which can lead to conflation of wetlands and small ponds in regional studies.

40|$|Abstract Background Livestock play an {{important}} role in carbon cycling through consumption of biomass and emissions of methane. Recent research suggests that existing bottom-up inventories of livestock methane emissions in the US, such as those made using 2006 IPCC Tier 1 livestock emissions factors, are too low. This may be due to outdated information used to develop these emissions factors. In this study, we update information for cattle and swine by region, based on reported recent changes in animal body mass, feed quality and quantity, milk productivity, and management of animals and manure. We then use this updated information to calculate new livestock methane emissions factors for enteric fermentation in cattle, and for manure management in cattle and swine. Results Using the new emissions factors, we estimate global livestock emissions of 119. 1  ±  18. 2  Tg methane in 2011; this quantity is 11 % greater than that obtained using the IPCC 2006 emissions factors, encompassing an 8. 4 % increase in enteric fermentation methane, a 36. 7 % increase in manure management methane, and notable variability among regions and sources. For example, revised manure management methane emissions for 2011 in the US increased by 71. 8 %. For years through 2013, we present (a) annual livestock methane emissions, (b) complete annual livestock carbon budgets, including carbon dioxide emissions, and (c) spatial distributions of livestock methane and other carbon fluxes, downscaled to 0. 05  ×  0. 05 degree resolution. Conclusions Our revised <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> of global livestock methane emissions are comparable to recently reported top-down global estimates for recent years, and account for a significant part of the increase in annual methane emissions since 2007. Our results suggest that livestock methane emissions, while not the dominant overall source of global methane emissions, may be a major contributor to the observed annual emissions increases over the 2000 s to 2010 s. Differences at regional and local scales may help distinguish livestock methane emissions from those of other sectors in future top-down studies. The revised estimates allow improved reconciliation of top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> of methane emissions, will facilitate the development and evaluation of Earth system models, and provide consistent regional and global Tier 1 estimates for environmental assessments...|$|R

The IPCC Expert Meeting in November 1997 in the Netherlands concluded that an assessment of inventory data quality was strongly supported by independent checks and additional analysis of uncertainties in the emissions inventories. In this study, {{carried out in the}} frame of the Dutch National Research Programme on Global Air Pollution and Climate Change three connected validation procedures have been applied for a methane emission inventory, namely (i) the comparison of emission inventories, (ii) the comparison of modelled with observed methane concentrations, and (iii) the comparison of <b>bottom-up</b> emission <b>estimates</b> with inversely modelled emission estimates. There is a good overall correspondence between the consistent bottom-up METDAT emission inventory and the National Communication data. However, on a country level and on a source category level large discrepancies could been found.

Results do not imply {{that there is an}} obvious need for revision {{of emissions}} report-ed to the UNFCCC. Fishing, CRF 1 A 4 c The current model used produces slightly higher estimates than if using fuel data for 2007 from Swedish Board of Fisheries. Compared to <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> using Shipair, the current model gives much higher estimates, estimates from Shipair being approximately one third. Since smaller fishing vessels are not obliged by law to have AIS transponders, one should expect the coverage of Shipair to be some-what limited. To give an estimate of how much the emissions are underestimated due to this fact, one would need to study the ship population more closely. It is also possible that the estimates for fishing based on fuel statistics are overestimated by the current model. However, since the only time series available is data on installed power for the Swedish fishing fleet used in the current model, we do not have enough information to judge whether the current time series is wrong. A revision of the time series is not possible with the current data situation. It is however clear that data should be updated and evaluated again coming years. Also, the <b>estimates</b> by the <b>bottom-up</b> approach will improve as the AIS-usage becomes more and more wide-spread, in time making it possible to perform a more complete independent validation. International bunkers, CRF 1 C 1 b Data on international bunker fuel in the Monthly fuel, gas and inventory statistics {{has been found to be}} of excellent quality. As a consequence of that VAT is applied on national fuel consumption but not on international bunkers, all respondents to the survey are able to separate these fuel amounts with high accuracy. Fuels used for domestic and international navigation have been separated correctly and in line with IPCC Guidelines. Fluctuations in time series are to a large extent due to "spot sales". Occasional fluctuations in time series for international maritime bunkers 2 should be expected. The increasing trend is, in addition to driving forces such as amount of goods or tonnage of the fleet, due to acquired international customers and an expansion in the fleet of lighters. Various data from energy statistics, transport statistics, trade statistics and fuel price statistics have been found and could be used further if additional analysis is wanted. Recommendations National navigation, CRF 1 A 3 d The current methodology should be used for reporting to the UNFCCC also in the future. Estimates using Shipair should preferably be updated for 2008 - 2010 and also for coming years, thus producing a time series that in due time will provide more information and verification of emissions reported to the UNFCCC. Fishing, CRF 1 A 4 c The current methodology should be used for reporting to the UNFCCC also in submission 2012. Estimates using Shipair should preferably be updated for 2008 - 2010 and also for coming years, thus producing a time series that in due time will provide more information and verification of emissions reported to the UNFCCC. The current methodology should be evaluated again when the next update of the national statistics on fishing is available. International bunkers, CRF 1 C 1 b Current data is found to be of excellent quality and should be used also in the fu-ture for reporting to the UNFCCC...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} budget of formic and acetic acids, {{two of the}} most abundant trace gases in the atmosphere. Our <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimate</b> of the global source of formic and acetic acids are ~ 1200 and ~ 1400 Gmol yr − 1, dominated by photochemical oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds, in particular isoprene. Their sinks are dominated by wet and dry deposition. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate this budget against an extensive suite of measurements from ground, ship and satellite-based Fourier transform spectrometers, as well as from several aircraft campaigns over North America. The model captures the seasonality of formic and acetic acids well but generally underestimates their concentration, particularly in the Northern midlatitudes. We infer that the source of both carboxylic acids may be up to 50 % greater than our estimate and report evidence for a long-lived missing secondary source of carboxylic acids that may be associated with the aging of organic aerosols. Vertical profiles of formic acid in the upper troposphere support a negative temperature dependence of the reaction between formic acid and the hydroxyl radical as suggested by several theoretical studies...|$|R
40|$|We report 65 {{individual}} {{measurements of}} methane emissions from 24 oil & gas facilities across California. Methane emission rates were estimated using in-situ methane and wind velocity measurements {{from a small}} aircraft by a novel Gauss' Theorem flux integral approach. The estimates are compared with annual mean emissions reported to the US-EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) through their respective greenhouse gas reporting programs. The average emissions from 36 measurements of 10 gas storage facilities were within a factor of 2 of emissions reported to US-EPA or CARB, though large variance was observed and the reporting database did not contain all of the facilities. In contrast, average emissions from 15 measurements of the three refineries were roughly {{an order of magnitude}} more than reported to the US-EPA or CARB. The remaining measurements suggest compressor emissions are variable and perhaps slightly larger than reported, and emissions from one oil production facility were roughly concordant with a separate (not GHG reporting) <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimate</b> from other work. Together, these results provide an initial facility-specific survey of methane emissions from California oil and natural gas infrastructure with observed variability suggesting the need for expanded measurements in the future...|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{negotiations}} aim {{to reduce}} net greenhouse-gas emissions by encouraging direct reductions of emissions and crediting countries for their terrestrial greenhouse-gas sinks. Ecosystem carbon dioxide uptake has offset nearly 10 % of Europe’s fossil fuel emissions, {{but not all}} of this may be creditable under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol. Although this treaty recognizes the importance of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, scientific research has largely focused on carbon dioxide. Here we review recent estimates of European carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide fluxes between 2000  and 2005, using both top-down estimates based on atmospheric observations and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>estimates</b> derived from ground-based measurements. Both methods yield similar fluxes of greenhouse gases, suggesting that methane emissions from feedstock and nitrous oxide emissions from arable agriculture are fully compensated for by the carbon dioxide sink provided by forests and grasslands. As a result, the balance for all greenhouse gases across Europe’s terrestrial biosphere is near neutral, despite carbon sequestration in forests and grasslands. The trend towards more intensive agriculture and logging is likely to make Europe’s land surface a significant source of greenhouse gases. The development of land management policies which aim to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions should be a priority...|$|R
