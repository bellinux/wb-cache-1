40|$|The {{variability}} {{of the raw}} materials, {{the diversity of the}} chemical compositions and the heterogeneity of structures are believed to contribute to the complexity in the physicochemical behaviours of dairy powders. Post-dehydration technology is widely used as an effective method to modify the structural properties and potentially improve the functionalities of dairy powder. In the present study, the dairy powders were firstly agglomerated <b>by</b> <b>fluidised</b> bed (FB) to investigate the effects on their rehydration processes. Then milk protein isolate powder (MPI) was used as the model system, which was agglomerated <b>by</b> <b>fluidised</b> bed and high shear mix (HS) granulators, using different liquid binders and comparing different granule sizes. The impact of both agglomeration methods on powder structures, as well as the consequent effects on the rehydration abilities, flowability and water adsorption are investigated. MPI agglomerated by FB had the more irregular shapes and porous structures. However, densely packed structures of HS granules caused the higher bulk density and lower porosity. Their shapes were more like spheres with smoother surfaces. FB agglomeration significantly improved the dynamic wetting of MPI and micellar casein powders, by requiring shorter wetting time, being more quickly penetrated by water droplets and absorbing more water by capillary force. But the influences on whey protein were limited, only if using lecithin as a liquid binder. Agglomeration exhibited no advantageous effects on the solubilisation of milk protein powders. The HS granules even delayed the release of materials. The denselypacked structures made MPI adsorbed least moisture and showed the slowest adsorption kinetics. Meanwhile, these MPI granules have significantly better powder flow behaviours. The study provided information about the post-dehydration process as a useful technique to modify the structures of dairy powders, which could be helpful to enhance the wetting process, control the water adsorption and improve the powder flowability...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{treatment}} {{is the most}} often method used in water treatment in the Czech republic. It is based on dosage of destabilisation reagent into raw water, formation of separable aggregates and their separation by sand filtration. Waterworks optimalisation is predominantly carried out by change of the chemical parameters, typically by change of destabilisation reagent dose. Physical parameters in water treatment like {{the magnitude of the}} velocity gradient and period of its duration are undervalued commonly, although they have crucial effect on quality of the aggregates. Character of the aggregates (size, density, compactness) influence their separability. This study aims at evaluation of influence of the magnitude of the velocity gradient on quality of suspension formed. Infuence of stirring intensity was performed on the pilot plant situated in the Želivka waterworks, which is fed from Švihov reservoir. The pilot plant worked at two modes: 1) slow stirring by perforated baffles and 2) fast stirring <b>by</b> <b>fluidised</b> layer of granular material. Fast stirring was either aggregational (served only as stirring element), or separational (separation of aggregates proceed already in the fluidised layer) Infuence of the magnitude of velocity gradient was evaluated by aggregation test.

Pilot-scale purification of the enzyme L-asparaginase from unclarified Erwinia chrysanthemi disruptates exploiting this novel approach yielded an interim product which rivalled or bettered that produced by the current commercial process employing discrete operations of alkaline lysis, centrifugal clarification and batch adsorption. In addition to improved yield and quality of product, the process time during primary stages of purification was greatly diminished. Two cation exchange adsorbents, CM HyperD LS (Biosepra/Life Technologies) and SP UpFront (custom made SP form of a prototype stainless steel/agarose matrix, UpFront Chromatography) were physically and biochemically evaluated for such direct product sequestration. Differences in performance with regard to product capacity and adsorption/desorption kinetics were demonstrated and are discussed with respect to the designof adsorbents for specific applications. In any purification of L-asparaginase (pI= 8. 6), product-debris interactions commonly diminish the recovery of available product. It was demonstrated herein, that immediate disruptate exposure to a fluidised bed adsorbent promoted concomitant reduction of product in the liquid phase, which clearly counter-acted the product-debris interactions to the benefit of overall product yield...|$|R
40|$|Softening at {{drinking}} water treatment plants is often realised <b>by</b> <b>fluidised</b> bed pellet reactors. Generally, sand {{is used as}} seeding material and pellets are produced as a by-product. To improve to sustainability, research {{has been carried out}} to replace the seeding material by re-using grained and sieved calcite pellets as seeding material. An explicit fluidisation model is developed to predict the fluid bed state in fluid bed pellet softening reactors with calcite as seeding material. The fluidisation theory is extended in a model whereby soft sensors are derived and experimentally tested {{for a wide range of}} seeding material and pellets. With the soft sensors porosity, particle size and pressure drop can explicitly be calculated. Pilot research has been carried out to calibrate and full-scale experiments to validate the fluidisation models. Four different fluidisation models were reviewed from which the original Richardson-Zaki fluid bed model has been selected as the best explicit fluidisation model to predict the porosity, particle size and pressure drop. Applying a discretisation model for the fluid bed pellet reactor, the current operation of the treatment softening can be improved by estimating the fluidisation, pressure drop behaviour and particle profile.

40|$|Interconnecting {{fluidized}} beds is a {{well known}} principle, applied in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers (combustor-external cooler). The two reactors are connected <b>by</b> <b>fluidised</b> loop-seals which allow the material to circulate while the gases are kept separate (figure 1). This technique is as well the foundation for more recent developments such as, indirect gasification (IG) and chemical looping combustion (CLC) [1 - 3]. The insistence of a nitrogen free atmosphere during operation in IG and CLC, compared to CFB-boilers, puts elevated demands on tightness in loop-seals and the knowledge of fluid dynamics. A cold reactor system of interconnecting fluidised beds is built to study fluid dynamics of an equally sized hot reactor system. The hot reactor system is coupled to the raw gas line in Chalmers biomass Gasifier system [3], where the main emphasis of research is to study gas solid interactions. This hot reactor system will be taken into operation during autumn 2009. The perspex cold reactor system has been in operation during the summer 2009 with both air and helium as fluidising media. Helium {{is used as a}} complement to air, as the density and viscosity has better agreement with the gases in the hot system. Since helium is a much more expensive gas than pressurised air several experiments are performed to find a correlation between these. The research of the cold reactor system is focused on mapping pressure profiles in the system and solid rate circulation as a function of fluidisation velocity (u 0). The study shows that the Solid rate circulation can be sufficiently controlled with both u 0 in the inferior loop-seal and u 0 in the riser. It is also shown that experiments performed with air and helium can give sufficient agreement. Furthermore, the pressure signals are shown to give vital information regarding solid rate circulation and fluidisation regimes in the riser...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the characterisation and reuse of fibres recovered from end of life thermoset composites <b>by</b> <b>fluidised</b> bed thermal processing. Emphasis is placed on the properties of recovered glass fibres and their reuse in a dough moulding compound and a tissue product. The need for a recycling process is demonstrated by a survey of the market for thermoset composites with particular consideration given to the potential growth in automotive applications. A study of processes developed to recycle such materials and the effect on the structural properties of composites containing such recyclate shows that a process capable of generating recyclate of greater value is required, particularly for the case of contaminated materials. A review of investigations into the effect of prior heat treatment on the mechanical properties of glass fibres shows that their strength will be reduced by a deterioration of the fibre surface during fluidised bed thermal recovery but that their stiffness is likely to be unaffected. The implications of these effects on possible applications for the recovered fibres are described. Tests are reported on the structural properties of laminates containing heat treated glass cloth which show that there is a strength reduction which is both time and temperature dependent but that modulus is not significantly affected. Strength loss increases with up to 20 minutes heating but then remains constant. In some cases the strength loss can be reduced by resizing the cloth. Measurement of the properties of fibres recovered using the fluidised bed process shows that the recovered fibre strength decreases with increasing processing temperature. Glass and carbon fibres recovered at 450 °C retain approximately 50 % and 80 % of their virgin strengths respectively. The Young's modulus of the recovered fibres is shown to be largely unaffected by the process for both glass and carbon fibres. Investigation of the lengths of the recovered glass fibres by image analysis techniques suggests that their distribution depends on the structure of the composite and the method of size reduction. A weighted mean fibre length of 3. 5 mm to 5. 5 mm is possible with the apparatus described in this thesis. The reduced reinforcement potential of the recovered fibres is confirmed by experiment. Recovered glass fibres are used to displace virgin fibres in a dough moulding compound. At replacement levels of up to 50 % there is no significant effect on the mechanical properties of a compression moulded plate. Above this level, tensile, flexural and impact strengths are reduced and with complete replacement the reduction is by approximately 40 %, 50 % and 70 % respectively. These results are confirmed on a pilot plant scale. Recovered glass fibres can be successfully incorporated with virgin fibres into a veil. Replacement of virgin fibres reduces both wet and dry strength because the recovered fibres are both shorter and weaker. The permeability of the veil is found to depend on its porosity and not its recovered fibre content. The experimental veils can be used to protect and improve the surfaces of mouldings...|$|R

The feasibility of quantitative on-line monitoring of the drying progress and end-point determination of silica gel dried in a heated fluidised bed was investigated. Silica gel was used owing to its high water adsorption property and stability to heat. Acoustic signals were acquired using four accelerometers mounted at different locations {{on the wall of}} the fluidized bed. The accelerometer located close to the base was the best based results from this study. Prediction models validated with independent acoustic data (test set validation) were developed using Partial Least Square Regression, PLS-R. Some data pre-preprocessing techniques were applied to improve the developed prediction model. The final prediction results were satisfactory for monitoring of the drying progress and end point determination.

In this study, the effect of fluidised particles is investigated under non-fouling and fouling conditions.

40|$|Conventional solid dosage forms {{often lead}} to {{fluctuations}} which exceed the maximum safe therapeutic level and/or decline below the minimum effective level. It is recognised that many drugs for chronic administration should be administered on a schedule that maintains plasma drug concentration within the therapeutic window. Research in controlled release dosage forms aims at designing a system with a zero-order input (eg, ideally to deliver 8. 33 % of the dose per hour over a 12 hour duration), producing steady state plasma drug levels. Oral dministration of drugs prepared as a controlled release formulation is extremely popular, and has {{attracted the attention of}} pharmaceutical scientists during the last decade. This has been due to the simultaneous convergence of various factors (eg, discovery of novel polymers and devices, better understanding of formulation and physiological constraints, expiration of existing patents, prohibitive cost of developing new drug entities), involved in the development of these delivery systems. Controlled release oral products can be formulated as single or multiple unit dosage forms and the relative merits of multiple unit forms with their own rate controlling systems are well established. This work describes the development of a relatively inexpensive multiple-unit capsule dosage form of theophylline containing coated mini-tablets for drug delivery throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Preformulation studies on theophylline anhydrous included solubility and dissolution rate determinations. Techniques including X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning colorimetry and infrared spectroscopy provided no evidence of true polymorphism after recrystallisation from various solvents. However, scanning electron micrographs showed the effects of solvent polarity and cooling rate on {{the size and shape of}} recrystallised particles. Theophylline granules were manufactured by using various binders and were film coated <b>by</b> <b>fluidised</b> bed technology with various proportions of ethylcellulose, containing varying amounts of PEG 1540. In vitro release rates were dependent upon coating thickness and the proportion of PEG, which, being water soluble, created pores in the coating during dissolution studies as observed by a scanning electron microscope. However, substantial proportions of the drug remained unreleased from the granules. In order to overcome the problems of drug retention, plain granules were used and theophylline mini-tablets (3 mm diameter, weighing 15 - 20 mg) were manufactured and film coated with various Eudragits ® and other polymeric mixtures (soluble and insoluble). In vitro dissolution profiles from samples enclosed in hard gelatin capsules were determined using the USPXXI paddle apparatus in test media at pH 1. 2 (HCI), pH 5. 4 and 7. 4 (phosphate buffers) at 37 'C. Monitoring of in vitro theophylline release over 12 h, under identical hydrodynamic conditions, showed that the dissolution rate at pH 1. 2 is substantially greater (95 % of total drug content released in < 10 h) than that in phosphate buffers. The maximum release after 12 h was approximately 20 and 30 % of total drug content of the tablet at pH 5. 4 and 7. 4, respectively. However, in vivo bioavailability after oral administration of tablets to rabbits corresponded to over 95 % of total drug, compared with the same dose administered intravenously. The retarded drug release during in vitro dissolution in phosphate buffer was attributed to a possible interaction of phosphate ions with theophylline molecules at the tablet core-coat interface. These findings indicate that both rate and extent of theophylline release from the slow release coated mini-tablets are highly sensitive to phosphate buffers. The data also emphasise the usefulness of an animal model for assessment of in vivo drug release and subsequent absorption during the development of modified release dosage forms. Mini-tablets were subjected to isothermal and cyclic stresses to reach conditions for up to 6 months at different temperatures and relative humidity. The film integrity was maintained but ageing of the coating occurred which impeded dissolution. Reduced drug release was temperature related while the effect of relative humidi% was insignific~t. Encapsulated mini-tablets (uncoated and coated with Eudragit RL and RS 2 % w/w) equivalent to a 300 mg dose, were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using beagle dogs. The pharmacokinetic parameters from single and multiple dose studies showed several advantages over Theo-Dur® 300 mg tablets. Precise dosage titration is possible by careful adjustment of the number of encapsulated mini-tablets. This multiple unit mini-tablet delivery system will allow for greater flexibility in dosage adjustment compared to the currently available preparations, allowing individualised fine dose titration in those patients requiring therapeutic drug monitoring. The developmentof the multiple unit mini-tablet formulation appears to provide an optimal dosage form with maximum flexibility in respect of dose, duration range and ease of production. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of HSPs {{have been shown to}} be up-regulated in a wide range of human cancers, the full {{significance}} of this remains to be determined. The localisation of HSPs seems to be critical in determining their role in cancer cell survival; High intracellular levels (iHsp) appear to be advantageous to the tumour cell, inhibiting key steps in apoptosis, while in some circumstances, surface expression (sHsp) appears to be detrimental to the cell, aiding immune recognition by various effector cells. Consequently, clarifying the importance of HSP cellular location in the cancer setting may lead to the development of novel therapies based upon manipulation of HSP localisation. This thesis had two major aims; (1) to investigate the cellular localisation of HSPs in leukocytes from patients with both myelocytic and lymphocytic malignancies in order to establish relationships between apoptosis and stage of disease (2) to study the synergistic effect of four chemotherapeutic drugs with membrane fluidising agents, compounds which have the potential to modulate HSP localisation. Hsp 90 and Hsp 27 expression was shown to be restricted to the inside of peripheral blood leukocytes, while Hsp 72 was localised both intracellularly and on the cell surface. In CLL, iHsp 90 and iHsp 27 levels were found to be significantly higher than in control subjects, while surface and intracellular Hsp 72 was shown to be expressed either at very high levels or at very low levels. Furthermore, iHsp 90 levels were found to be associated with stage of disease, while iHsp 27 levels were shown to negatively correlate with levels of apoptosis. CLL patients with stable disease were found to express higher levels of iHsp 72 than patients with progressive disease. However, in AML and MDS, levels of all HSPs in peripheral blood were found to be similar to those seen in control subjects, but disease patients showed a much wider range of expression. In AML, levels of sHsp 72 positively correlated in all cell types, an observation not made in MDS patients or control subjects. HSP localisation was shown to be affected <b>by</b> membrane <b>fluidising</b> agents, with a movement of Hsp 72 and Hsp 60 to the cell surface. This effect was not due to proteotoxicity and supports data implicating the cell membrane in the regulation of HSP responses.

40|$|Cenospheres are hollow, low-density {{particles}} {{found in}} power station fly ash. They have many commercially-useful properties which {{make them a}} valuable by-product. However, recovering cenospheres from fly ash is difficult due to their low concentration and fine size. Experiments were performed to test the novel approach of using an Inverted Reflux Classifier. In this configuration, the particles are <b>fluidised</b> <b>by</b> adding wash water from above which helps to wash any entrained dense material from the overhead product. Inclined channels are mounted at the base to minimise the loss of buoyant cenospheres in the waste underflow stream. Experiments were performed at both laboratory scale (80 mm × 100 mm cross-section) and pilot scale (300 mm × 300 mm cross section) using mixtures of cenospheres and silica, all nominally less than 100 μm in size. In batch tests, the bed expansion behaviour of the positively-buoyant cenospheres in the Inverted Reflux Classifier {{was found to be}} analogous to the behaviour of negatively-buoyant particles in the standard configuration. Continuous steady-state experiments were performed using feeds with suspension solids concentration varying from 0. 3 to 9. 5 wt. % solids and a buoyant cenosphere grade of 0. 5 to 65 wt. %, with a range of fluidisation wash water rates, and degree of volume reduction (ratio of volumetric feed to product rate). Both units delivered high recoveries and product grades. An increase in volume reduction (decreasing overflow rate for a given feed rate), caused a drop in recovery and an improvement in grade. The throughput advantage compared to a conventional teetered (fluidised) bed separator was over 30 in some cases. Both laboratory and pilot-scale units displayed similar behaviour and the results were also consistent with existing correlations for negatively-buoyant particles in the standard Reflux Classifier. Hence this technology has clear potential for recovering and concentrating cenospheres from fly ash...|$|R
40|$|Two fuels {{were burned}} in {{electrically}} heated beds of alumina sand, <b>fluidised</b> <b>by</b> air. The fuels were: (i) paraffin wax, {{which is a}} solid containing 100 % volatile matter and (ii) glycerol, a liquid, whose potential as a fuel needs assessing. The bubbling fluidised beds were held in the range 400 – 900 °C. Pieces of paraffin wax burned like a plastic, so when fed {{on top of a}} bed, the wax floated and generated clouds of soot. Soon, it then sank into the bed. When the sand was below ~ 800 °C, combustion occurred noisily in exploding bubbles leaving the bed. In beds hotter than ~ 800 °C, combustion proceeded in bubbles fairly low in the bed and was controlled by the mixing of hydrocarbon vapours (from the wax) with the fluidising air. If wax were fed half way up a bed, bubbles of hydrocarbon vapours were quickly produced; they ascended and mixed with the fluidising air. In a bed below 800 °C, combustion mainly occurred noisily in bubbles just after leaving the bed, but in a hotter bed, there was quieter burning in smaller bubbles, before they {{reached the top of the}} bed. Glycerol behaved similarly, when fed into the middle of a bed. Thus bubbles of glycerol vapour were formed; they mixed with air ascending the bed as either bubbles or percolating between particles. Again bubbles exploded noisily at the top of a bed below 800 °C. With the bed above 800 °C, glycerol burned inside smaller bubbles below the bed’s upper surface. No soot was observed when burning glycerol in such a hot bed, yielding CO and CO$_ 2 $ as the only products of combustion. It appears that burning glycerol cleanly in a hot fluidised bed is a feasible proposition...|$|R
40|$|A {{financial}} support received fromDeutscher Akademischer Austauch Dienst (DAAD) {{by one of}} the authors (WS) during his stay at Addis Ababa University is gratefully acknowledged. The biological wastewater treatment was investigated in the inverse fluidised bed reactor (IFBR) in which polypropylene particles of density 910 kg/m 3 were <b>fluidised</b> <b>by</b> an upward flow of gas. Measurements of chemical oxygen demand (COD) versus residence time t were performed for various ratios of settled bed volume to reactor volume (Vb/VR) and air velocities ug. The largest COD removal was attained when the reactor was operated at the ratio (Vb/VR) m = 0. 55 and an air velocity ugm = 0. 024 m/s. Under these conditions, the value of COD was practically at steady state for times greater than 30 h. Thus, these values of (Vb/VR) m, ugm and t can be considered as the optimal operating parameters for a reactor when used in treatment of industrial wastewaters. A decrease in COD from 36, 650 to 1950 mg/l, i. e. a 95 % COD reduction, was achieved when the reactor was optimally controlled at (Vb/VR) m = 0. 55, ugm = 0. 024 m/s and t = 30 h. The pH was controlled in the range 6. 5 – 7. 0 and the temperature was maintained at 28 – 30 °C. The biomass loading was successfully controlled in an IFBR with support particles whose matrix particle density was smaller than that of liquid. The steady-state biomass loading depended on the ratio (Vb/VR) and an air velocity ug. In the culture conducted after switching from the batch to the continuous operation, the steady-state biomass loading was attained after approximately 2 -week operation. In the cultures conducted after change in (Vb/VR) at a set ug, the steady-state mass of cells grown on the particles was achieved after about 6 -day operation. For a set ratio (Vb/VR), the biomass loading depended on ug. With change in ug at a set (Vb/VR), the new steady-state biomass loading occurred after the culturing for about 2 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mineralogy}} and petrology of two kimberlites, {{a peripheral}} monticellite kimberlite, and its core of phlogopite kimberlite, from the West Auxiliary Pipe at Dutoitspan Mine are described. The mineralogy {{of the two}} kimberlites differs mainly {{in the presence of}} phlogopite macrocrysts, greater abundance of angular crustal inclusions, more heavy minerals and higher diamond grade in the phlogopite type. Microprobe analyses of olivine, phlogopite, monticellite, oxide minerals and garnet are presented. Silicate compositions are comparable in both kimberlites and zoning of olivine grains is typically towards a rim of Fo₈₉₋₉₀ʻ irrespective of whether cores are more Fe-rich or more Mg-rich. This is caused <b>by</b> re-equilibration after <b>fluidised</b> emplacement in the earth's crust of macrocryst-bearing kimberlite magma. Olivine aggregates were derived from sheared mantle lherzolite and single-crystal macrocrysts were formed at higher mantle levels from a kimberlitic crystal-mush magma. This was emplaced in the crust by rapid gas streaming. The post-fluidisation phenocrysts of olivine and phlogopite which formed then are in general more Fe-rich than macrocrysts. Re-equilibration of ilmenite results in the formation of complex perovskite and titanomagnetite mantles. Phlogopite macrocrysts are preserved in the monticellite contact rock where rapid quenching prevented their resorption and allowed separation of an immiscible carbonate melt, giving the abundant groundmass calcite. Atoll-textured spinels are found in the contact rock. Major and minor trace-element analyses of whole rock samples are presented and discussed, bringing into account the problem of contamination by crustal inclusions. Whole rock chemistry supports derivation of the kimberlites as partial melts of mantle material {{in the presence of a}} lithophile-element-enriched fluid. The monticellite contact rock is highly enriched in REE, Nb, and Sr due to rapid freezing of this perovskite-enriched phase. The monticellite type is more enriched in lithophile elements than the phlogopite type, which supports derivation of the monticellite type by a small degree of partial melting, further melting reducing the relative concentrations of lithophile elements to give the phlogopite kimberlite chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} {{arises when}} water percolates through a landfill. The degree {{and type of}} pollution {{is dependent on the}} content of the landfill but also on a range of other factors, including the age of the landfill and the landfilling technique. In recent years, concerns about potentially hazardous compounds in landfill leachate have stimulated research into on-site treatment. Examples of new techniques for treatment are the sequent batch reactor technique (SBR), wetland systems and different forms of filter solutions. Lilla Nyby landfill is the municipal landfill in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Leachate streams have been found on site that are weaker than the main stream. One of these has been investigated in the present study. It contains heavy metals, especially zinc, copper and nickel, in concentrations which require treatment. Low strength landfill leachate streams require special treatment. There are various reasons for this, but examples can be geological reasons or dilution problems in the treatment facility for the main leachate. The technique chosen for the leachate stream, reactive filters, is rather new and few pilot scale experiments have been conducted. Therefore many questions still remain concerning the applicability of the method on site, and there was a need for more experimental data. Previous research has shown that many industrial by-products may be suitable to capture metals from leachate. Among the materials previously recommended, blast furnace slag and pine bark had advantages which were well suited for the present application. They were also available in large quantities near the site. A column experiment was set up at the landfill and three filter materials were chosen; pine bark and two types of blast furnace slag. In addition, one of the columns was filled with sand as a reference. As a complement to the column study, laboratory experiments were conducted at Mälardalen University. The aim of the laboratory experiments was to investigate factors that might limit metal retention by the filter materials. Different concentrations and contact times were tested as well as the presence of other substances (i. e. metals and organic carbon). The results from the first laboratory experiments (initial metal concentration, competing metal ions and contact time) and the on-site column study were contradictory. Metal uptake in the laboratory was very efficient, as has also been found by other researchers. On-site, many factors influenced sorption and uptake was very unstable, especially for the slags. It was found that pine bark is more effective and stable than the slags with respect to metal retention, especially at low concentrations. The contact time between the substrate and metals is important for effective retention. The final experiment, showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can greatly inhibit metal retention. To further develop reactive filter technology, a method to reduce the DOC content may be necessary. In contrast to what has been previously assumed, leaching of COD from the pine bark column at Lilla Nyby landfill was negligible. Finally, some suggestions for future work on reactive filter technology are made. For instance, it could be interesting to develop an alternative technique for filtration. Packed columns have been addressed with a series of problems, related to hydraulic parameters. <b>By</b> using <b>fluidised</b> reactors, a comparison with batch experiments becomes possible...|$|R
40|$|Metallurgists {{operating}} Knelson Concentrators (KC) often rely on manufacturers {{recommendations for}} selecting operating parameters, such as fluidising {{water flow rate}} and cycle time. Recent {{studies have shown that}} these parameters are not only dependent on the machine parameters but also on the feed characteristics, such as size distribution of the gold and gangue particles and the composition of its constituent minerals. It is known that a particle entering a KC initially traverses a circular path within the bowl. For a particle to maintain a given orbit, the required centripetal force must be supplied by external means. It has been argued that this centripetal force which is dependent on the mass of the particle, its radial position and the rotational speed of the bowl, is provided by the fluid drag force created <b>by</b> inwardly moving <b>fluidising</b> water and the Bagnold's force created by the particle/particle collisions. Depending on the fluidising water flow rate, one of two situations can occur where the porosity of the bed increases or decreases which influences the amount of material retained within the bowl. The amount of material of a given size and density retained in the bowl is thus dependent on the extent of the centripetal force provided. Based on the above concept, a criterion {{that can be used to}} predict the amount of material recovered in the bowl has been derived and validated by experimental data. It may also be construed that this criterion demarcates the transition of the bed from a packed-bed state to a <b>fluidised</b> state. <b>By</b> identifying the transition values for the different constituent mineral particles in the feed, it is possible to estimate the optimal fluidising water flow rate that would maximise gold recovery while minimising gangue recovery. In addition, the kinetics of gangue displacement by incoming heavy mineral particles were also studied using synthetic mineral mixtures. The experimental data suggests that this process follows first order kinetics and that the build-up of heavy mineral reaches a maximum. A model has been proposed to predict the optimal batch cycle time for a KC in terms of the feed characteristics and machine operating parameters...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of fluisised bed granulation is presented. Preliminary experiments establish the main variables in the granulation process and enable a systematic experimental programme to be devised. In this programme, either glass powder or porous alumina are used as the bed material. The effects of the fundamental fluidised bed granulation parameters on particle growth are established {{from a series of}} batch experiments conducted in a 0. 15 m diameter, glass-walled bed. Together with measurements of the physical properties of the product granules and the binder solutions (carbowax or benzoic acid, in methanol) and with supporting studies of the bed structure (in the form of X-ray photography and measurement of temperature profiles), this information is also used to propose a mechanism of particle growth. Two types of product granule are identified, agglomerates which consist of two or more, and usually several, initial particles; and layered granules, which consist of single initial particles with dried feed material adhering to the surface. The effects of varying the excess fluidising gas velocity, the binder concentration and the initial particle size are quantified. A bed can be prevented from quenching (a defluidisation phenomenon leading to the failure of the process) <b>by</b> increasing the <b>fluidising</b> gas rate. For a given bed particle/binder combination, successively higher excess gas velocities allow an otherwise quenching bed to be operated firstly so as to produce agglomerates and subsequently layered granules. Similar effects are observed with increases in initial bed particle size and decreases in binder concentration. A particle growth mechanism is proposed in which the initial stages of both the desirable particle growth (irrespective of the type of granule) and of bed quenching, are considered to be exactly the same. Beyond the initial formation of liquid bonds between adjacent bed particles, the strength of the inter-particle bridges (which {{is a function of the}} binder material and relates to growth) and the extent of fluid drag and inertial forces on particles (which are functions of gas velocity and particle size respectively, and relate to granule breakdown) determine the equilibrium granule form and size. However, if the particles are porous the above mechanism may break down since the liquid can enter the pores and not be available for the initial formation of liquid bonds...|$|R

On {{the morning of the}} 12 th December, the captain broadcast an SOS; his vessel was breaking in two, approximately 30 nautical miles to the south of Penmarc'h Point (Finistère, France). The fore section of the vessel sank during the night of the 12 - 13 December and the aft section was taken in tow on the morning of December 13, but subsequently sank in the early afternoon. Both parts lay in 120 m of water and were located 10 km apart. Approximately, 19 000 t of heavy fuel oil were spilled into the sea. The first of the fuel oil came ashore on December 23 and the major strandings took place between December 24 and 27. The Loire Atlantique and Vendée coasts were severely contaminated and the départements of Finistère, Morbihan, and Charente Maritime in the South, were in no way spared. Violent winds blowing at right angles to the coast accompanied by extremely high tides washed the pollution high up the beach strand, reaching the tops of cliffs more than 10 m high. The struggle at sea against the pollution began on December 15 and 1 200 t of fuel were recovered within the next fortnight. Between mid May and late summer 2000, a little more than 10 000 t of heavy fuel oil were <b>fluidised</b> <b>by</b> adding colza methyl ester and pumped from the tanks of the sunken vessel, while an additional 1 200 t were pumped out during final cleaning.

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with the mathematical modelling of a bed of granular material in a gravitational field vertically <b>fluidised</b> <b>by</b> a vibrating surface. The particles are in rapid motion, and lose energy by inelastic collisions. The steady state is maintained by a balance of the rate of dissipation of energy in inelastic particle collisions and the rate of transfer of energy due to particle collisions with the vibrating surface. The limit where the energy dissipation due to inelastic collisions is small compared to the mean kinetic energy of the particles is considered. This non-equilibrium steady state is similar to a dilute gas at equilibrium with a uniform temperature and an exponentially decaying density, obtained from the ideal gas equation of state. From the analysis of this state, four non-dimensional numbers are derived which uniquely specify the state of the system. A perturbative analysis about the uniform temperature state is carried out and analytical solutions to the macroscopic variables of the system are obtained using two types of approximations. The first is a hydrodynamic model using constitutive relations from the general kinetic theory of granular media, and the second is a kinetic theory formulation derived exclusively for the vibro-fluidised bed. The latter permits an anisotropy between the horizontal and vertical directions due to the anisotropic nature of the source of energy at the bottom wall. The kinetic theory is extended to incorporate the corrections due to the high density effects, which is similar to the Enskog correction to dense gases. An event driven (ED), or hard sphere molecular dynamic (MD), simulation of the vibrated bed is carried out. The quantitative predictions of the theories are validated by the simulation. A systematic probing of the parameter space within the ED simulations revealed two new phenomena in a vibro-fluidised bed which are inhomogeneous in the horizontal direction. These are convection rolls similar to the Rayleigh-Benard instability in fluids, and a clustering instability leading to a phase separation. The instabilities are characterised using a phase diagram. The homogeneous states close to these new states are adequately described by the models developed here. An analysis of the stability of this state could have implications in understanding the instabilities in driven granular materials (such as in sheared media and fluidised beds) in general, and pattern formation in vibrated beds in particular...|$|R
