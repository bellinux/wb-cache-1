5|$|In early 1994 the WWF {{brought back}} the WWF Women's Championship, which had been {{deactivated}} in 1990, and pushed Alundra Blayze {{to win a championship}} tournament and defeat all challengers.

5|$|ATV Music Publishing {{remained}} a successful {{organization in the}} music industry throughout the 1970s. Len Beadle, the company's chief executive, signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues. The catalog acquisitions, along with the continuing royalties from Lennon and McCartney, ensured that large amounts of money were frequently coming in for ATV Music Publishing. Despite the success of the music publishing organization, other ventures formed by Grade were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> large amounts of money. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television.|$|E
5|$|After the {{suspicious}} {{death of his}} wife Drogo fled England, and the castle was reassigned by William the Conqueror to Odo, the Count of Aumale. In 1096 it passed to Arnulf de Montgomery, but returned to the Aumales in 1102, who held it until 1221. Trade initially flourished and as a result William le Gros founded the fortified town of Skipsea Brough along the ridgeway just south of the castle, probably around 1160. The town was intended to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> valuable revenue to the earls, but would also have helped to defend the castle on its most vulnerable, overlooked side. The castle-guard system lapsed, with the surrounding estates paying their rents in cash instead.|$|E
5|$|Air Chief Marshal Burnett had {{recommended}} his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> an officer senior to both men {{to head the}} RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that {{he was happy to}} serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> talent from elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Before Mega Man, Capcom {{primarily}} made arcade games, {{and their}} console releases were mostly ports of these titles. In the mid-1980s, Capcom {{made plans to}} develop Mega Man specifically for the Japanese home console market. They decided to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> fresh, young talent for the small team, including artist Keiji Inafune, a recent college graduate who started on the Street Fighter team. Inafune recalled that the Mega Man development team worked extremely hard to complete the final product, with a project supervisor and lead designer who sought perfection in every possible aspect of the game.|$|E

Allardyce was permitted to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> defensive midfielder Steven N'Zonzi from Amiens for £500,000, Croatia international forward Nikola Kalinić from Hajduk Split for £6million, and Pascal Chimbonda from Tottenham Hotspur for £2.5million.

But much to the frustration of Song Shi-Lun, the 26th Corps did not arrive before the Marines broke out of Yudam-ni. The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December, allowing UN forces to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> reinforcements and to evacuate {{the dead and the}} wounded. With the Marines at Yudam-ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December, the trapped UN forces could finally start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
