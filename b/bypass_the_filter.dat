50|$|Utilising {{a filter}} that is overly zealous at {{filtering}} content, or mislabels content {{not intended to}} be censored can result in over blocking, or over-censoring. Over blocking can filter out material that should be acceptable under the filtering policy in effect, for example health related information may unintentionally be filtered along with porn-related material because of the Scunthorpe problem. Filter administrators may prefer {{to err on the side}} of caution by accepting over blocking to prevent any risk of access to sites that they determine to be undesirable. Content-control software was mentioned as blocking access to Beaver College before its name change to Arcadia University. Another example was the filtering of Horniman Museum. As well, over-blocking may encourage users to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> entirely.|$|E
50|$|Most {{pressurized}} lubrication systems incorporate an overpressure {{relief valve}} to allow oil to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> if its flow restriction is excessive, {{to protect the}} engine from oil starvation. Filter bypass may occur if the filter is clogged or the oil is thickened by cold weather. The overpressure relief valve is frequently incorporated into the oil filter. Filters mounted such that oil tends to drain from them usually incorporate an anti-drainback valve to hold oil in the filter after the engine (or other lubrication system) is shut down. This is done to avoid a delay in oil pressure buildup once the system is restarted; without an anti-drainback valve, pressurized oil would have to fill the filter before travelling onward to the engine's working parts. This situation can cause premature wear of moving parts due to initial lack of oil.|$|E

We examine local newspaper coverage of President George W. Bush in 2003. Presumably, the president would enjoy mostly positive coverage from local newspapers. Yet, we demonstrate substantial variation in local news coverage, with community support for the president being a primary predictor of whether he will receive positive coverage. We also find that stories on the Iraq War contributed to negative coverage, even at the local level. We conclude with commentary on the utility of presidents ’ local media strategy in light of our findings. Leading the media, public, and Congress through speeches {{is at the core of}} modern presidential governance. But just as the modern political environment requires presidents to appeal for support through speeches, presidents are increasingly unable to cultivate public opinion.

40|$|Abstract:- The turbo {{equalizers}} (TEQ) {{proposed in}} literature utilize equalizers based on trellis, soft Wiener <b>filters.</b> <b>The</b> resulting complexity of these equalizers is exponential and cubic {{in terms of}} the sampled channel impulse response (CIR). The interference cancellation based decision feedback filter based equalizers requires adaptation of two filters simultaneously. In this paper, a low complexity equalizer is proposed that neither uses a trellis nor a Wiener <b>filter.</b> <b>The</b> proposed equalizer utilizes a soft interference cancellation (SIC) technique that uses the log likelihood ratio (LLR) available at <b>the</b> matched <b>filter</b> (MF) using all the coded bits in a given block of data. The MF output is justified as Gaussian distributed and the LLRs are computed accordingly. This is fed as the apriori to the decoder after suitable deinterleaving. The soft estimates for the bits are used to form an estimate of the interference with the help of perfect channel tap knowledge at the decoder output. This estimate of interference is subtracted from the MF output giving the SIC framework. We call it a soft decision feedback equalizer (SDFE). <b>The</b> SDFE <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> completely resulting in a linear complexity in CIR. Simulation results over four different channels show that the receiver performance improves with iterations and a gap of 1 - 3 dB is observed from the coded AWGN bound depending on the channel type. Two different TEQs based on namely soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) and <b>the</b> Wiener <b>filter</b> respectively are compared with the SDFE...|$|R
