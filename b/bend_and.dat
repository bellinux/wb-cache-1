40|$|Aim of {{the work}} was the {{development}} of a pair of strain gauged skis suitable for strain measurement during real courses in a snow field: this would enable to measure the distribution of <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> twisting moments acting along the ski during real events. Two racing skis were used and 11 couples of unidirectional strain gauges were symmetrically applied to the top foil of the skis, at 11 sections regularly distributed along the ski: a total number of 22 quarter bridge strain channels were eventually applied to each ski. The ski were calibrated during laboratory tests under different <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> torsion test conditions, in order to evaluate the calibration constants correlating the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> twisting applied moments and the strain signals. The stiffness properties in <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> torsion of different sections along the ski were evaluated both by optical and contact methods, in order to have all information needed to estimate the ski instantaneous deflected shape {{on the basis of the}} <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> twisting moment diagrams collected from the field data acquisitions in slalom.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to understand the mechanical response of fabrics under deformation since their aesthetic properties and performance are directly related to their mechanical properties, such as tensile, <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> shear.

The eects of several factors such as tightness factor, relaxation treatment and the direction of <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> shear on the response of fabric under deformation are discussed.

40|$|A {{new method}} to {{determine}} yarn <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> torsional rigidities was proposed in this paper. Measuring methods of yarn <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> yarn torsion were reviewed.

One major feature of this method is that <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> torsional rigidities of a naturally curved yarn, like those yarns in knitted fabrics, can be measured. With the aid of modeling, a recently developed Crimped Yarn Length Measurement Instrument (CLI) is able to measure both <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> torsional rigidities at the same time. The CLI generates a large amount of data points for the force and extension relationship during the decrimping of the curved yarn, multiple regression analysis was applied to determine <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> torsional rigidities.
