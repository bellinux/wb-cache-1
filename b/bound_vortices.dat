We consider both {{the effects of the}} amplitude fluctuations and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase fluctuations in weakly coupled layered superconductors. In the treatment of the amplitude fluctuations we employ the Gaussian approximation and evaluate the longitudinal relaxation rate 1 /T 1 for a clean s-wave superconductor, with and without pair breaking effects, using the static pair fluctuation propagator D. The increase in 1 /T 1 due to pair breaking in D is overcompensated by the decrease arising from the single particle Green's functions. The result is a strong effect on 1 /T 1 for even a small amount of pair breaking. The phase fluctuations are described in terms of dynamical BKT excitations in the form of pancake vortex-antivortex (VA) pairs. We calculate {{the effect of}} the magnetic field fluctuations caused by the translational motion of VA excitations on 1 /T 1 and on the transverse relaxation rate 1 /T 2 {{on both sides of the}} BKT transitation temperature T(BKT) <Tc.

These force formulas, which generalize the classic Kutta–Joukowski theorem (for a single bound vortex) and the recent generalized Lagally theorem (for problems without a bound vortex and vortex production) to more general cases, can be used to identify or understand the roles of outside vortices and bodies on the forces of the actual body, optimize arrangement of outside vortices and bodies for force enhancement or reduction, and derive analytical force formulas once the flow field is given or known...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{serves to}} summarize my research into wind farm and wind turbine aerodynamics. Included {{in this thesis}} is {{a summary of the}} methods I use as well as the four research problems that I investigated. Motivation is provided for my research as well as an overview of the computational methods that I use. These methods include analytical methods such as blade element momentum (BEM) theory and the vortex lattice method as well as computational fluid dynamic methods like the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and large eddy simulation (LES). These methods are used to investigate wind turbine and wind farm aerodynamics. In particular, I use these methods to confront the various forms of loss that wind turbines and wind farms experience. They include the losses that individual turbines experience due to swirl, induction, and viscosity as well as the loss that wind farms experience due to turbine-wake interaction. Horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) suffer from aerodynamic ineffciencies in the blade root region (near the hub) due to several non-aerodynamic constraints. Aerodynamic interactions between turbines in a wind farm also lead to signifcant loss of wind farm efficiency. A new dual-rotor wind turbine (DRWT) concept is proposed that aims at mitigating these two losses. A DRWT is designed that uses an existing turbine rotor for the main rotor, while the secondary rotor is designed using a high lift-to-drag ratio airfoil. Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to optimize the design. Large eddy simulations confirm the increase energy capture potential of the DRWT. Wake comparisons however do not show enhanced entrainment of axial momentum. I extend the prescribed wake vortex lattice method (VLM) to perform aerodynamic analysis and optimization of dual-rotor wind turbines. The additional vortex system introduced by the secondary rotor of a DRWT is modeled while taking into account the singularities that occur when the trailing vortices from the secondary (upstream) rotor interact with the <b>bound</b> <b>vortices</b> of the main (downstream) rotor. Pseduo-steady assumption is invoked and averaging over multiple relative rotor positions is performed to account for the primary and secondary rotors operating at different rotational velocities. This implementation of the VLM is first validated against experiments and blade element momentum theory results for a conventional, single rotor turbine. The solver is then verified against RANS CFD results for two DRWTs. Parametric sweeps are performed using the proposed VLM algorithm to optimize a DRWT design. The problem with the algorithm at high loading conditions is highlighted and a solution is proposed that uses RANS CFD results to calibrate the VLM model. In addition to wake losses, aerodynamic interaction between turbines in wind farms leads to surface flow convergence. This phenomenon has been observed in field tests with surface flux stations. A hypothesis is proposed to explain this surface flow convergence phenomenon - incomplete pressure recovery behind a turbine leading to successive pressure drops in tightly-spaced turbine arrays leads to drop in overall pressure deep inside a wind plant; this low-pressure acts as an attractor leading to flow convergence. Numerical investigations of the phenomenon of surface flow convergence are carried out that support this hypothesis. An actuator disk model to represent wind turbines in an LES CFD solver is used to simulate hypothetical wind plants. The flow convergence phenomenon reflects as change in flow velocity direction and is more prominent near the ground than at turbine hub height. Numerical simulations of wind plant aerodynamics are conducted with various approximations to investigate and explain the flow convergence phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} manifestations of acoustic combustion instability in solid propellant rocket motors is the formation of strong vortices in the combustion chamber. A single vortex filament stretching along the motor axis from the head-end has been observed in several experiments in association with gas oscillations in the frequently occurring traveling tangential mode of instability. These flows are sometimes accompanied by a quite noticeable axial torque on the motor itself, and this effect has given rise to flight performance difficulties in a number of instances. Previous theoretical studies of the vortex generation effect have been inadequate in several respects. The present work is an attempt to place the theory on a more firm base and to clarify the connection between traveling wave motions and the generation of vortices and torques. It is readily shown that traveling waves transport momentum, {{and in the case of}} traveling tangential waves in a cylindrical combustion chamber this represents a steady axial component of angular momentum in the gas. This observation gives rise to a simple conceptual model of the vortex generation effect. Thus the presence of a steady mass flux about the axis implies the existence of a layer of vorticity at the chamber walls which may be represented by a vortex sheet composed of axially oriented bound vortex filaments. In the three-dimensional case these vortices are shed either at the end of propellant grain or at the periphery of the nozzle; the other ends of the filaments traverse the fore-end closure to the center and are combined and shed in an intense vortex filament along the symmetry axis of the motor. Due to the production of gas at the chamber wall, tangential forces at the wall are produced by the interaction of this mean flow with the <b>bound</b> <b>vortices.</b> Angular momentum arguments must be used in this conceptual mechanism to estimate the strength of the axial vortex filament, and it is readily shown that the sense of the vortex must be opposite to the direction of travel of the waves. The direction and magnitude of the torque on the motor depend on the mean flow Mach number at the wall and must be established by calculation of the wall shear stresses. The detailed calculations are guided by the mechanism just outlined. All physical features of the problem which appear to be significant are simulated mathematically. In particular, the effects of the three dimensional mean flow pattern in the chamber and the pressure-sensitive combustion region at the burning surface are represented. Also considered are the effects of freedom of motion of the rocket motor in the plane normal to the symmetry axis. Both inviscid and viscous theories are developed using multi-parameter asymptotic perturbation expansion techniques. It is proved that traveling tangential waves are subject to amplification under conditions existing in typical solid propellant rockets, and that a steady transport of gas about the chamber axis accompanies this motion as a second-order perturbation. The equations of motion admit of only a vortex-like steady second-order azimuthal solution. This must be superimposed on the acoustic wave motions in such a way that angular momentum is conserved (due consideration being given to body forces on the gas and tangential forces at the wall). Thus the net pattern of steady circumfer vential mass flux at a given motor cross-section consists of a drift of fluid in the direction of the wave adjacent to the wall with a rapid transition to an oppositely spinning vortex flow as the longitudinal axis is approached. Introduction of the viscous corrections gives rise to a boundary. condition which sets the vortex strength, and a formal connection with the classical acoustic streaming effect is established. Since momentum is dissipated in the shear region at the wall, a torque appears on the chamber itself. This roll moment is opposite in sense to the wave travel during amplification of the acoustic waves, and numerical calculations give torque magnitudes which are in agreement with experimental data from several sources...|$|E

As an application of the results the downwash is calculated {{in the wake of a}} delta wing lying within the Mach cone emanating from its apex. The downwash is found to be least just aft the trailing edge and is everywhere less that the downflow at the aerofoil. It increases steadily to a limiting value which is attained virtually within two chord lengths of the trailing edge. The ratio of the downwash at any point in the wake to the downflow at the aerofoil decreases with increasing Mach number and apex angle...|$|R
