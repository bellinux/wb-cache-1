40|$|Abstract. According to {{the vehicle}} braking {{efficiency}} road test rules in GB 7258, the braking efficiency on-line monitoring index, parameter, method and threshold are studied.

Vehicle maximum deceleration is collected at the period of ABS working, which {{is to make sure that}} the road adhesion coefficient is more than 0. 7. Vehicle maximum <b>braking</b> <b>deceleration</b> is analyzed, and it is used to exclude driving on pit, decelerating band, road step, even crash and so on.
