25|$|Formaldehyde {{is used to}} {{inactivate}} bacterial products for toxoid vaccines (vaccines that use an inactive <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxin</b> to produce immunity). It {{is also used to}} kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production. Urinary tract infections are also often treated using a derivative of formaldehyde (methenamine), a method often chosen because it prevents overuse of antibiotics and the resultant development of bacterial resistance to them. In an acid environment, methenamine is converted in the kidneys to formaldehyde, which then has an antibacterial effect in the urinary tract. Some topical creams, cosmetics, and personal hygiene products contain derivatives of formaldehyde as the active ingredients that prevent the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.|$|E

Thus, we are motivated to develop a method for computational identification of <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxins</b> based on amino acid sequences and functional domain information. In this study, a nonredundant dataset of 167 <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxins</b> including 77 exotoxins and 90 endotoxins is adopted to learn the predictive model by using support vector machines (SVMs). The cross-validation evaluation shows that the SVM models trained with amino acids and dipeptides composition could yield an accuracy of 96. 07 % and 92. 50 %, respectively. For discriminating endotoxins from exotoxins, the SVM models trained with amino acids and dipeptides composition have achieved an accuracy of 95. 71 % and 92. 86 %, respectively.

2500|$|In {{the process}} of food preservation, {{potassium}} nitrate has been a common ingredient of salted meat since the Middle Ages, but its use has been mostly discontinued because of inconsistent results compared to more modern nitrate and nitrite compounds. Even so, saltpeter is still used in some food applications, such as charcuterie and the brine used to make corned beef. [...] When used as a food additive in the European Union, the compound {{is referred to as}} E252; it is also approved for use as a food additive in the USA and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed under its INS number 252). Although nitrate salts have been suspected of producing the carcinogen nitrosamine, both sodium and potassium nitrates and nitrites have been added to meats in the US since 1925, and nitrates and nitrites have not been removed from preserved meat products because nitrite and nitrate inhibits the germination of Clostridium botulinum endospores, and thus prevents botulism form <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxin</b> that may otherwise be produced in certain preserved meat products.|$|E

40|$|Autophagy is a {{physiological}} process involved in defense mechanisms for clearing intracellular bacteria.

However, further in vivo studies are required to decipher the upregulation of autophagy and potential side effects limiting such approaches. The capacity of autophagy activation strategies to improve the outcome of antibiotic treatment should be investigated in the future...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Bacterial</b> <b>toxins</b> are toxic {{compounds}} {{which are}} produced {{in order to}} present microbial pathogenicity or to combat with the host immune system response. There is a cumulating evidence indicating bacterial origin for marine toxins such as tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, neosurugatoxin, etc. The most important marine toxins produced by different marine bacteria, their origin, structure and mechanisms of action were evaluated in a systematic review. Materials & Methods: Marine bacteria, marine <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxins,</b> and their mechanisms of action and structure were keywords for a comprehensive search in online databases including Pubmed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Scirus. A total of 120 papers were evaluated, however, by omitting similar reports, 103 papers {{were included in the}} study. Results: The most of marine <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxins</b> are classified in one of the following groups: neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and cytotoxins. These toxins have distinct mechanisms of action including blocking of sodium channels in nerve cells, functioning as agonists of acetylcholine receptors, inhibiting of membrane pumps, the inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2 A types' enzyme activities and inhibiting of protein synthesis. Conclusion: The clarification of the marine <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxins</b> structures and their mechanisms of action may be helpful for novel drug design, therapeutic measures and to overcome against bacterial pathogenicity...|$|R
50|$|A subunit vaccine {{presents}} an antigen to {{the immune system}} without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium (such as a <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxin)</b> and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three-dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context, and will induce antibodies that may not recognize the infectious organism. In addition, subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines.|$|E

He claimed that the tuberculosamin was bound to the nucleotide. Ruppel also found that his new compound was the most toxic component of the bacillus, 2.5 to 6 times more potent than tuberculin, the proteinaceous toxin.|$|E

5000|$|While {{trying to}} isolate the <b>bacterial</b> <b>toxin</b> {{responsible}} for tuberculosis, W.G. Ruppel isolated a novel nucleic acid named tuberculinic acid in 1898 from Tubercle bacillus. The nucleic acid {{was found to be}} unusual, in that it contained in addition to thymine, guanine and cytosine, a methylated nucleotide. In 1925, Johnson and Coghill successfully detected a minor amount of a methylated cytosine derivative as a product of hydrolysis of tuberculinic acid with sulfuric acid. This report was severely criticized because their identification based solely on the optical properties of the crystalline picrate, and other scientists failed to reproduce the same result. [...] But its existence was ultimately proven in 1948, when Hotchkiss separated the nucleic acids of DNA from calf thymus using paper chromatography, by which he detected a unique methylated cytosine, quite distinct from conventional cytosine and uracil. After seven decades, it turned out that it is also a common feature in different RNA molecules, although the precise role is uncertain.|$|E
