2500|$|According to Philip D. Kenneson, to be [...] "religious" [...] conveys an {{institutional}} connotation, {{usually associated with}} Abrahamic traditions: to attend worship services, to say Mass, to light Hanukkah candles. To be [...] "spiritual," [...] in contrast, connotes personal practice and personal empowerment {{having to do with}} the deepest motivations of life. As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively. Abrahamic religions have been viewed as negative institutions because they propagate a certain way of believing. Abrahamic traditions emphasize that one’s best <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> look outside to a higher power that can guide and correct one's corporeal misjudgements. In these traditions, God above is the source of wisdom and illumination. Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is about much more than going to church and agreeing or disagreeing with church doctrines. Scholar Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is the shorthand term used in Western society to talk about a person's relationship with God. For many people, how they think about religion and spirituality is certainly guided by what they see and do in their congregations. At a deeper level, it involves a person's self-identity—feeling loved by God, and these feelings can wax and wane.|$|E

A rustic tree lane brings the rambler to Kruszwica, a provincial town with some interesting churches, but no clue where E11 and the Way of St. James continue.

When looking for a design away from the style seen in most animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist.

As the tornado hits the farm, the house, with Dorothy inside, is lifted right up into the air and carried for miles within the cyclone ("The Tornado"). It finally comes to rest with a bump in the middle of an emerald green field covered with flowers. There, Dorothy is met by the Munchkins, who are all dressed in blue, and Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North, who tells her that she is in the land of Oz. Furthermore, her house has fallen on Evamean, the Wicked Witch of the East, and killed her, freeing the Munchkins from her evil powers. Dorothy, distressed and confused, wants only to return to Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and Toto in Kansas. With her magic unable to take Dorothy beyond the country boundaries, Addaperle decides her best <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> follow the Yellow Brick Road to Emerald City in the centre of Oz, and see the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, or [...] "The Wiz" [...] for short ("He's the Wizard").

5000|$|The film {{starts off}} with the funeral of a man named Panos. A very rich and {{handsome}} young man called Mihalis thinks he inherits all Panos' possessions but Panos has left all his estate to someone else. Soon after the funeral, cousin Tzimis rings Steve Karamitsis to announce he has inherited a beach worth 2.5 million euros, a tavern and a small house on the Greek resort island of Mykonos from his uncle Panos {{that he had never}} met. Steve watches his friend Tony the Yugoslav as he gets arrested in his father's shop for theft and drugs, losing the shop and his Beloved 69' Valiant Pacer. Steve and his old friend Frank who has lost his wife and his mistress fly together to Mykonos. Cousin Tzimis picks up the two friends from the airport and brings Steve up to speed with local customs and habits. Tzimis and his Spartan wife Voula are managing the tavern Steve has inherited. Steve finds out that to get his inheritance, he must pay 1.1 million euros in tax because he is not an immediate descendant of Panos. Steve does not have that much money. The two friends settle in Panos' home and discover Panos' old car, a rare 1964 Pontiac Catalina and a Kri kri goat called Apollo. Later Tony shows up, having managed to escape from the Australian authorities and calling himself Tony the Cretan, thinking that Crete is not a part of Greece. Two German environmentalists, Otto and Dieter, are after the goat Apollo claiming it is a rare species. Steve falls for Zoe, a beautiful down-to-earth singer who owns half of a local night club called [...] "the Seven Sins". The other half is owned by Mihalis who is engaged to Zoe. Frank gets into a nasty bet with Pierluigi (Kevin Sorbo), who is called the King of Mykonos because he had sex with 43 women in one month, [...] "a record that will never be broken" [...] as Tzimis says. The <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> seduce Enza (Cosima Coppola), a strikingly beautiful but distant and snob Italian girl. As the story progresses, it is revealed that no one is who it seems to be. Pierluigi is not Italian but an American and has a secret agenda, Mihalis has ulterior motive for taking over the beach, Steve is not as 'wog' as he thinks he is, Frank is not as successful with women, Zoe has a tragic past and is blackmailed by Mihalis, Enza is not snob after all and Panos was actually Steve's biological father. Steve fails to find hard evidence to prove Panos is his father. Mihalis steps in and claims the inheritance for himself, declaring that he can pay up for taxes. He intends to sell the beach. Steve then enters a rally competition with Mihalis trying to take the inheritance. Tony gets the parts needed for Steve to repair the Pontiac and race against Mihalis' Porsche 997. The two Germans interrupt the rally and reveal that they have discovered an ancient coin of great archaeological significance at Steve's beach, but Apollo swallowed it. If the coin is retrieved and delivered to the authorities, the beach becomes an archaeological site and cannot be exploited or sold. Mihalis and Steve abandon the race, search for and fight over the coin. At the last moment, Zoe steps in and delivers documents proving Panos was Steve's biological father. Steve gets the inheritance and gives up the beach to become a historical site named [...] "Apollo" [...] after the goat, Zoe is finally free from Mihalis' grasp and the film ends with the people of the island singing [...] "Down Under" [...] by Men at Work.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} a novel {{challenge}} to consequentialism as a theory in normative ethics. The challenge {{is rooted in}} the ontological claim that consequences of actions do not exist at the time required to be that in virtue of which actions are right or wrong, and so consequences cannot play the role attributed to them by consequentialists. The challenge {{takes the form of a}} dilemma. The consequentialist is confronted with a set of propositions she will find individually plausible but incompossible if taken in conjunction with consequentialism. The task is to restore consistency. There are ways of maintaining the view that consequences are right-makers, but they come at the cost of endorsing highly implausible and unattractive theses. Versions of what might be called quasi-consequentialism can be rendered metaphysically coherent, but these are consequentialisms in name only, and they are best seen as components of an account of practical rationality that has strong echoes of traditional natural law theory. Since this is unlikely to appeal to contemporary consequentialists, their best <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reject consequentialism altogether...|$|E

40|$|Underestimation of {{the sample}} size needed to detect genetic {{association}} may occur {{as a result of}} deviations from the 'fundamental theorem of the HapMap'. A biologically plausible mechanism that might cause this deviation is 'cryptic' tagging of multiple susceptibility loci by the same neutral marker. For complex disorders, the existence of multiple susceptibility loci on the same chromosome is probably the rule rather than the exception. Our results show that conditional on the known haplotype structure of the genome the probability that a tagging SNP that is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a susceptibility gene is also in LD with another susceptibility gene is not negligible. Consequently, we were able to estimate the extent and the prevalence of the bias in the necessary sample size to find association induced by 'cryptic' tagging. In general, the underestimation of the necessary sample size is modest: 5 % of all association studies will underestimate the sample size by 5 - 30 %.
