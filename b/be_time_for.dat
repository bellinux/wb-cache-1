SIG meetings are held over {{one or two days}} before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> in the main conference. Notable SIG meetings include the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000 and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998. Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were held as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E

Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles.

2500|$|Following Director General George Entwistle’s {{resignation}} in November 2012, James Purnell {{argued that}} the new Director General “should learn from the Birt era” stating that it was Birt’s [...] "boldness" [...] that saved the BBC. Instead of playing it safe and avoiding mistakes, he said, Birt transformed output and embraced the internet, and rebuilt relationships with government, business and the public. Media commentator Steve Hewlett, Birt's former colleague and friend, suggested in 2012 that it might <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the BBC [...] "to bring in Birt 2.0". Hewlett acknowledged that many of Birt’s reforms were unpopular, but said that without them, [...] "it is questionable whether the BBC would exist in anything like its present capable and competitive form, or indeed would have retained the huge affection of audiences".|$|E

2500|$|By 1846 Bourget {{found that}} many of his plans for {{expansion}} and renovation of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada were being frustrated by Archbishop Signay, who disliked Bourget and was distrustful of Bourget's changes. [...] On September 25, 1846, Bourget wrote to Signay and said, “For a long time I have been thinking that Your Grace should give up the administration of your archdiocese, contenting yourself with retaining the title of metropolitan. I shall use the occasion of my journey to Rome to put before the Holy See the reasons leading me to believe that it might <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> you to relieve yourself of this burden." [...] With this in mind, Bourget travelled to Rome in late 1846 to petition the Pope for Signay's resignation. [...] He was supported in this cause by Charles-Félix Cazeau, secretary to Archbishop Signay.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Roubini {{predicted}} that the global economy would begin recovering {{near the end of}} 2009, but the U.S. economy is likely to grow only about one percent annually during the next two years, which is less than the three percent normal [...] "trend." [...] He noted that the Fed is [...] "now embarked on a policy in which they are in effect directly monetizing about half of the budget deficit," [...] but that now [...] "monetization is not inflationary," [...] as banks were holding much of the money themselves and not relending it. When these attitudes reverse {{at the end of the}} recession, that would <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> an [...] "exit strategy, of mopping up that liquidity" [...] and taking some of the money back out of circulation, [...] "so it doesn’t just bid up house prices and stock values in a new bubble.

2500|$|The {{intended}} {{audience is}} not evident. Some believe that Prufrock {{is talking to}} another person or directly to the reader, while others believe Prufrock's monologue is internal. Perrine writes [...] "The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature", while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the [...] "you and I" [...] refers {{to the relationship between}} the dilemmas of the character and the author. Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere {{during the course of the}} poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there will <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> various things before [...] "the taking of a toast and tea", and [...] "time to turn back and descend the stair." [...] This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to ask this [...] "overwhelming question". Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond rules restricting {{takeover}} defences, {{a series}} of rules are in place to partly protect, and partly impose obligations on minority shareholders. Under CA 2006 section 979 when a takeover bidder has already acquired 90 per cent of a company's shares it can [...] "squeeze out" [...] or compulsorily purchase the minority's shares at the same price per share as paid {{for the rest of}} the takeover. Only if a court determines that price is [...] "manifestly unfair" [...] (and market prices are presumed fair) can the shareholder object, or if the whole arrangement is merely a trick for incumbent shareholders to expropriate a minority they find undesirable, or it can be shown that shareholders had been given insufficient information to properly evaluate the offer. Conversely section 983 allows minority shareholders to require that their stakes are bought out. Further standards apply to listed companies under the Takeover Code. The Code contains six principles for takeover bids. Shareholders in the same class should be equally treated, there must <b>be</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them to adequate information including consequences for employees, the board must act in the company's whole interests not their own, false markets and share prices should not artificially fluctuate, bids should only be announced when bidders can follow through with money, and a bid should not distract the business longer than reasonable. Following on from these principles are 38 rules, designed to flesh out in legal terms the [...] "common sense" [...] standards embodied in the 6 principles. The Takeover Panel administers the Code, and enforces it. Originally established in 1968 as a private club that self-regulated its members' practices, was held in R (Datafin plc) v Takeover Panel to be subject to judicial review of its actions where decisions are found to be manifestly unfair. Despite a handful of challenges, this has not happened.|$|E
