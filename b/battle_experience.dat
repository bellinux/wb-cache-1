5|$|Troops {{are divided}} into five classes: Scouts, Shocktroopers, Engineers, Lancers and Armored Soldier. Troopers can switch classes by {{changing}} their assigned weapon. Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class. With victory in <b>battle,</b> <b>experience</b> points are awarded to the squad, which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad, a feature differing from early games' method of distributing to different unit types.|$|E
5|$|While Middleton {{was helping}} LSU recover from this {{traumatic}} ordeal, {{he was also}} {{keeping an eye on}} events in Europe. In July 1940 he wrote a letter to General George Marshall asking if his services were needed by the Army as the United States was making preparations for war. Marshall replied that as much as the Army would like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do would be to place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his <b>battle</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful <b>battle,</b> <b>experience</b> points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume magnetite as the player walks around. The demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{comes in}} the form of both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights where the camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired during the course of the game. At the end of each <b>battle,</b> <b>experience</b> points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
5|$|In the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga {{role-playing}} games, players {{take control}} of the characters Serph, Heat, Argilla, Gale and Cielo, with the characters Sera and Roland becoming playable in Digital Devil Saga 2. These characters are able to transform into a demon form, which is their main form in battle. Characters navigate to-scale environments, fighting enemies in both random encounters and story-focused boss battles. After each <b>battle,</b> <b>experience</b> points are awarded to characters. Character abilities are governed by Mantra Grids, a system where Mantras are bought using the in-game currency Macca, then mastering them using Atma Points gained from defeated enemies. The maximum number of abilities that a character can learn is eight. If two or more characters equip a certain ability, they can perform a stronger version of it through a combo. Each character can learn abilities from one of four categories: Physical, Magic, Shield and Auto.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Elsenborn Ridge was {{a decisive}} {{component}} of the Battle of the Bulge because the U.S. Army was able to stop and deflect the strongest armored units of the German advance. Portions of both sides' forces had little <b>battle</b> <b>experience,</b> and both employed newer, more lethal weapons and tactics. This gave the battle a brutal intensity and impact, resulting in high casualties and traumatic memories and experiences for the participants.|$|E
25|$|The prodromoi/sarissophoroi {{acted as}} scouts, reconnoitring {{in front of}} the army when it was on the march. In battle, they were used in a shock role to protect the right flank of the Companion cavalry. Persian light cavalry took over these duties when they became {{available}} to the Macedonian army following Gaugamela. The prodromoi then assumed a purely battlefield role as shock cavalry. It is possible that the prodromoi, due to their skill in wielding long lances and their extensive <b>battle</b> <b>experience,</b> were considered more valuable in the role of shock cavalry, especially after the departure of the Thessalian cavalry. Four ilai, each 150 strong, of prodromoi operated with Alexander's army in Asia.|$|E
25|$|His {{division}} {{arrived at}} Le Havre in early November, 1944. By mid-November, without any <b>battle</b> <b>experience,</b> {{they were in}} the Ardennes, where they relieved the 60th Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. For the next few weeks his reconnaissance platoon established and maintained regimental listening and observation posts and gathered information. As they were not trained for direct combat, they were kept from direct engagement with the Germans. Bouck earned the Combat Infantryman Badge during this period. The platoon consisted of two nine-man reconnaissance squads and a seven-man headquarters section who worked in the 394th regimental S2 section. Their mission was to conduct reconnaissance up to and through the German lines, including missions to capture German soldiers, to obtain intelligence about the enemy forces' disposition.|$|E

These were a battalion each from the Jind and Nabha State Forces and the First and Second Battalions of Patiala Infantry (as mentioned above). They are now designated as the 13, 14, 15 and 16 PUNJAB. Additional battalions were raised since 1963.|$|R
25|$|The {{deck and}} command crew (hypēresia) was {{headed by the}} helmsman, the kybernētēs, who was always an {{experienced}} seaman and was often the actual commander of the vessel. These experienced sailors were to {{be found on the}} upper levels of the triremes. Other officers were the bow lookout (prōreus or prōratēs), the boatswain (keleustēs), the quartermaster (pentēkontarchos), the shipwright (naupēgos), the piper (aulētēs) who gave the rowers' rhythm and two superintendents (toicharchoi), in charge of the rowers {{on each side of the}} ship. What constituted these sailors' experience was a combination of superior rowing skill (physical stamina and/or consistency in hitting with a full stroke) and previous <b>battle</b> <b>experience.</b> The sailors were likely in their thirties and forties. In addition, there were ten sailors handling the masts and the sails.|$|E
25|$|Szlachta from regions {{like the}} Commonwealth's eastern and {{southern}} borderlands, where combat was common, created fairly competent units, while those from peaceful regions of the Commonwealth lacked <b>battle</b> <b>experience</b> and training compared to regular-military troops or mercenaries. In time, pospolite ruszenie became increasingly amateurish and inefficient when compared to professional soldiers; Bardach notes that this process {{can be seen as}} early as the Thirteen Years' War (1454–66). In addition to the lack of training, discipline and unstandardized equipment, the time it took for a pospolite ruszenie to be called to arms and gathered in a designed spot (often, close to a month) was also a problem. Some attempts at reform the situation, including a mass wave of estate confiscations at 1497, and a requirement for yearly gatherings and reviews, did little to ameliorate the situation.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{suggest that}} an angakkuq could be honest in his tricks, {{believing in the}} {{phenomena}} he himself mimicked, moreover, he could consciously cheat and honestly believe at the same time. Knud Rasmussen mentioned Arnaqaoq, a young Netsilik Inuit living in King William Island. He smeared himself {{with the blood of}} a seal or reindeer, telling people that he had a battle with spirits. Rasmussen conjectured that he could honestly believe in this spirit <b>battle</b> <b>experience</b> which he mimicked with smearing blood. The personal impression of Rasmussen about this man was that he believed in the forces and spirits. As Rasmussen asked him to draw some pictures about his experiences, even his visions about spirits, Arnaqaoq was first unwilling to do so (having fear of the spirits). Later he accepted the task, and he spent hours to re-experience his visions, sometimes so lucidly that he had to stop drawing when his whole body began to quiver.|$|E

25|$|In 217, Cao Cao's rival Liu Bei, who {{had taken}} over Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in 215, {{launched}} a campaign to wrestle control of Hanzhong from Cao Cao. When Liu Bei's forces reached Yangping Pass (陽平關; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi), Xiahou Yuan led his men to resist the enemy and both sides were locked in a stalemate for nearly a year. One night in the first lunar month of 218, Liu Bei {{set fire to the}} barbed fences around Xiahou Yuan's camp, so Xiahou Yuan sent Zhang He to defend {{the eastern part of the}} camp while he personally led a lightly armed force to guard the south. Zhang He attacked Liu Bei when the latter taunted him, but he failed to overcome the enemy. Xiahou Yuan then sent a fraction of his own troops to help Zhang He. Liu Bei's general Huang Zhong launched a fierce assault on Xiahou Yuan even though his men had less <b>battle</b> <b>experience</b> than Xiahou Yuan's troops. Xiahou Yuan was killed in action.|$|E

500|$|Pat Wheeler, {{a scholar}} of literature, {{describes}} the narrative style as [...] "both naturalistic and realistic and {{very much in the}} manner of the nineteenth century writers [...] cites as literary influences"—Wheeler notes Émile Zola, Charles Dickens and George Gissing among these. Wheeler emphasizes that the naturalistic tendencies of the narrative allow treatment of the war setting without an idealization of the [...] "human" [...] parts of the narrative. Consistently, reviews emphasize the novel's imagery of the <b>battle</b> <b>experience</b> in and amongst the trenches. For Slade, the novel [...] "produces a vivid and traumatizing description of {{the sights and sounds of}} life and death in (and under the trenches)"; the principal cause of this, he says, is [...] "the pure fury and intensity of the imagery created page after page".|$|E
500|$|The {{troops of}} the 99th Infantry Division, who lacked <b>battle</b> <b>experience,</b> were {{deployed}} to the Ardennes in November 1944, with the 394th Regiment relieving the 60th Regiment of the 9th Infantry Division. Among the units was the 394th I platoon consisting of well-trained soldiers, who had been selected because they were expert marksmen and in peak physical condition. Some {{of the men were}} college-educated and were former members of the U.S. Army's abruptly terminated ASTP program. This platoon was led by 20-year-old Lt.
