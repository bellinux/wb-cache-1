50|$|Lenticular bedding {{occurs when}} sand ripples are {{deposited}} in mud {{in an isolated}} distribution pattern. Ripples in lenticular bedding are both laterally and horizontally discontinuous. Lenticular bedding can be subdivided according {{to whether or not}} they have connected lenses and the type of lenses they feature. Lenticular <b>bedding</b> <b>with</b> connected lenses can have up to 75% of discontinuous lenses. Lenticular <b>bedding</b> <b>with</b> single lenses has to have more than 75% discontinuous lenses. Lens thickness is based on a length to height ratio. Thick lenses have a length/height ratio that is <20 and flat lens ratio is >20. So the possible types of lenticular bedding are lenticular <b>bedding</b> <b>with</b> connected flat or thick lenses and lenticular <b>bedding</b> <b>with</b> single flat or thick lenses.|$|R

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} in {{its version of}} permanent raised <b>bed</b> planting <b>with</b> crop residue retention has been proposed as an alternative wheat production system of western Uttar Pradesh. Therefore the present work was undertaken during 2008 - 2011 to compare permanent and tilled raised <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> different residue management under irrigated conditions. Permanent <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> residue retention resulted in increased crop yield of 11 - 17 % in maize and 12 - 15 % in wheat over conventional practices. In permanent raised <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> retained plot over without residue plot the savings in water use were 11. 2 % to 21. 5 % in maize and 12. 3 % to 19. 7 % in wheat as compared to conventional practices of seeding. Permanent raised <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> full residue retention increased soil organic matter content 1. 6 times in the 0 â€“ 5 cm layer and had significantly higher mean weight diameter and aggregate stability compared to conventionally tilled flat beds...|$|R

From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E

The body lying on the bed was most likely that of a woman of very high-ranking noble descent, possibly royalty, as {{the quantity and quality of}} the jewellery found in the grave is indicative of a woman ranking at the top of Anglo-Saxon society.

40|$|ABSTRACT] We {{investigated}} large-scale {{distribution and}} biodiversity of seagrass beds and their temporal changes along eastern coast of Okinawa Island by an integrated approach using RS, GIS and field monitoring.

Patterns of temporal changes in distribution between 1977 and 1993 varied among different seagrass <b>beds,</b> <b>with</b> some seagrass <b>beds</b> extending its area whereas others remaining stable. Regional and local species diversity of seagrasses also varied among beds. Species diversity was low in <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> larger watershed areas behind coastline, and high in <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> smaller watershed, suggesting possible impacts of terrestrial ecosystems on seagrass beds through river discharge...|$|R
