The antibiotic consists of a polyketide-derived aglycone, which is glycosylated with four sugar components, 2 × D-olivose (first and last sugar of a C-glycosidically bound trisaccharide chain at the 9 -position), and 2 × L-rhodinose (in {{the middle of the}} trisaccharide chain and at the 12 <b>b-position).</b> Limited information is available about both the biosynthesis of D-olivose and L-rhodinose and the influence of the concentration of both sugars on urdamycin biosynthesis. Results: To further investigate urdamycin biosynthesis, a 5. 4 kb section of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster was sequenced. Five new open reading frames (ORFs) (urdZ 3, urdQ, urdR, urdS, urdT) could be identified each one showing significant homology to deoxysugar biosynthetic genes. We inactivated four of these newly allocated ORFs (urdZ 3, urdQ, urdR, urdS) as well as urdZ 1, a previously found putative deoxysugar biosynthetic gene. Inactivation of urdZ 3, urdQ and urdZ 1 prevented the mutant strains from producing L-rhodinose resulting in the accumulation of mainly urdamycinone B. Inactivation of urdR {{led to the formation of}} the novel urdamycin M, which carries a C-glycosidically attached D-rhodinose at the 9 -position. The novel urdamycins N and O were detected after overexpression of urdGT 1 c in two different chromosomal urdGT 1 c deletion mutants. The mutants lacking urdS and urdQ accumulated various known diketopiperazines. Conclusions: Analysis of deoxysugar biosynthetic genes of the urdamycin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed a widely common biosynthetic pathway leading to D-olivose and L-rhodinose. Several enzymes responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. The pathway had to be modified compared to earlier suggestions. Two glycosyltransferases normally involved in the C-glycosyltransfer of D-olivose at the 9 -position (UrdGT 2) and in conversion of 100 - 2 to urdamycin G (UrdGT 1 c) show relaxed substrate specificity for their activated deoxysugar co-substrate and their alcohol substrate, respectively.

Specifically, we prepare functionalized aminooxy compounds so that the oximation chemistry can then serve {{as a prelude to}} new synthetic or analytical methods. For example, Chapter 2 presents an improved preparation of O- (diphenylphosphinyl) hydroxylamine (DPPH), an aminooxy-containing reagent, using the classic Schotten-Baumann conditions.

Sixteen aldehydes were smoothly transformed to their in another application, we use functionalized aminooxy reagents to achieve quantitative multiplexed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Specifically, we chemoselectively derivatize carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) metabolites using the aminooxy-containing reagents. Chapter 3 presents a focused fundamental study of the propensity of oxime ethers to undergo MS-induced fragmentations, such as the McLafferty rearrangement. In particular, we studied structural factors that promoted a,ß-fragmentation in oximes of both ketones and aldehydes, as well as the derived silyl ethers of these adducts. We determined that 1) the propensity of the McLafferty rearrangement was greatly enhanced by oxygen at the <b>b-position</b> of silyl oxime ethers, 2) the McLafferty rearrangement is more prominent for E-isomers of oxime and silyl oxime ethers than for the corresponding Z-isomers, and 3) Z-isomers of silyl oxime ethers with CH 2 at the <b>b-position</b> generate nitrilium ions {{to a greater extent than}} their corresponding E-isomers. Chapter 4 describes the 3 -step synthesis of a new class of stable isotope-labeled derivatizing reagents –– aminooxyethyl propionate reagents (AEP) –– that enable multiplexed GC-MS analysis of small molecule carbonyl compounds. The AEP reagents contain 1) an aminooxy moiety, and 2) a propionate ester moiety that generates a reporter isotope-labeled mass spectral tag (MST) in the form of an ethyl carbenium ion via an ester a-cleavage. The AEP MSTs appear in an m/z zone of minimal interference (ZMI) in the range m/z 32 - 34. This is a key feature in that unobstructed observation of reporter MSTs in this zone significantly improves simultaneous quantitation of carbonyl analytes from multiple samples without recourse to MS peak deconvolution strategies. Also, and in contrast to known isotope coding reagents for GC-MS, AEP reagents are not affected by the chromatographic isotope effect. The versatility of the technology for carbonyl metabolite profiling and absolute quantification is demonstrated by an analysis of turmeric extract, serving as a representative complex biological sample. A series of analogous methyl ketones were profiled from characteristic MS fragmentations of the AEP-derived oxime ether adducts, and two members, 2 -nonanone and 2 -undecanone, were quantified using AEP-labeled external standards. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes with additional demonstrations of click chemistry. We used oximation to ligate linker molecules to fluorophores and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to generate a fluorescent nano-entity for breast cancer location and diagnosis. Five homologous linkers, each consisting of a thiol-terminated hydrophobic domain coupled to an aminooxy-terminated PEG-based domain, were prepared using a 6 -step synthesis in 7 - 25 % overall yield. The aminooxy end subsequently was reacted with an aldehyde-functionalized cypate fluorophore, and the thiol end was used for attachment to gold nanoparticles. Linker attachment to cypate in this manner was superior to previously investigated amide coupling involving linker amines and cypate carboxylic acid. Collectively, the results from these investigations demonstrates a novel strategy that employs functionalized aminooxy substrates and reagents to first exploit the high yielding and selective click coupling with carbonyl substrates to set the stage for secondary synthetic or analytical operations. Approaches developed in this multifaceted study appear to be applicable to a variety of synthetic problems ranging from those of a purely chemical nature to other impacting biological systems...|$|E
40|$|The genes ldhA and hadA, from Clostridium difficile (DSMZ 1296 T) were cloned and {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli. The obtained proteins were purified and characterised as D- 2 -hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (LdhA) and 2 -hydroxyisocaproate CoA-transferase (HadA) involved in two consecutive {{steps in the}} pathway of leucine fermentation to ammonia, CO 2, isovalerate and isocaproate. The downstream genes hadBC and hadI were also functionally expressed and shown to encode the novel 2 -hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase (HadBC) and its activator (HadI). The activated dehydratase catalyses the dehydration of (R) - 2 -hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA to isocaprenoyl-CoA, which is a chemically difficult step since the proton in the <b>b-position</b> is not activated (pK ca. 40). We postulated that {{the reduction of the}} substrate by one electron enables the elimination, whereby the pK is lowered to at least 14. After the reaction the electron is returned to the dehydratase, which may catalyse many turnovers. The extremely oxygen-sensitive homodimeric activator as well as the heterodimeric dehydratase contain iron-sulfur cluster(s); other prosthetic groups specifically molybdenum were not detected. The reduced activator transfers one electron to the dehydratase concomitant with hydrolysis of ATP, a process similar to that observed with the unrelated nitrogenase. The reduced dehydratase separated from the activator and ATP catalysed almost 104 dehydration turnovers until the electron was lost by oxidation. By adding activator and ATP the enzyme could be fully reactivated. The active tight complex of the two protein components induced by AlF 4 - and ATP underpins the postulated electron transfer from the activator to the dehydratase and demonstrates again that the electron is recycled after each turnover. In agreement with this observation, only substoichiometric amounts of activator (activator/dehydratase = 1 : 10) were required to generate full activity. An organic radical proposed to mediate the dehydration was detected by EPR spectroscopy {{for the first time in}} a 2 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase. The changes of the EPR spectra induced by the use of labelled substrates showed that the radical was substrate-derived. These results are the first clear evidence for a radical involved in a dehydration mechanism and suggest a new way to form a radical in enzymatic reactions...|$|E
