40|$|Numerous studies {{describe}} {{the presence of}} pharmaceuticals in the water cycle, while their transformation products are usually not included. In the current study 17 common pharmaceuticals and 9 transformation products were monitored in the Dutch waters, including surface waters, pre-treated surface waters, river <b>bank</b> <b>filtrates,</b> two groundwater samples affected by surface water and drinking waters. In these samples, 12 pharmaceuticals and 7 transformation products were present. Concentrations were generally highest in surface waters, intermediate in treated surface waters and river <b>bank</b> <b>filtrates</b> and lowest or not detected in produced drinking water. However, the concentrations of phenazone and its environmental transformation product AMPH were significantly higher in river <b>bank</b> <b>filtrates,</b> which is likely due to historical contamination. Fairly constant ratios were observed between concentrations of transformation products and parent pharmaceuticals. This might enable prediction of concentrations of transformation products from concentrations of parent pharmaceuticals. The toxicological relevance of the observed pharmaceuticals and transformation products was assessed by deriving (i) a substance specific provisional guideline value (pGLV) and (ii) a group pGLV for groups of related compounds were under the assumption of additivity of effects within each group. A substantial margin exists between the maximum summed concentrations of these compounds present in different water types and the derived (group) pGLVs. Based {{on the results of}} this limited screening campaign no adverse health effects of the studied compounds are expected in (sources of) drinking water in the Netherlands. The presence of transformation products with similar pharmacological activities and concentration levels as their parents illustrates the relevance of monitoring transformation products, and including these in risk assessment.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{water quality}} is often assessed by screening {{for a limited}} set of target chemicals. This ‘conventional’ target analysis approach inevitably misses chemicals present in the samples. In this study a ‘broad’ target screening approach for water quality assessment using high resolution and accurate mass spectrometry (HR MS) was applied to detect {{a wide variety of}} organic chemicals in 42 groundwater samples. In this approach, both known and unidentified chemicals observed in previous samples define the training set for the analysis of future samples and, additionally, new samples can be used to extend the training set. Nearly 400 chemicals were observed in the samples, of which 82 were known and more than 313 are of unknown identity. The obtained results were interpreted in relation to the source characteristics and land use. Groundwater that was affected by landfills showed the highest total MS response (ion counts) and most individual chemicals and was therefore considered most contaminated. Furthermore, river <b>bank</b> <b>filtrated</b> water was generally more contaminated than phreatic groundwater and groundwater from (semi) confined aquifers was most pristine. Additionally, industrial chemicals were more frequently observed in river <b>bank</b> <b>filtrated</b> water and pesticides were more frequently observed in water originating from rural areas.

In addition, studies about the determination of polar nitrogen compounds in surface waters were carried out continuing the research project WT 9356 / 7.

Based on the determined concentrations and the frequency of their occurrence in the regarded surface waters morpholine, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine and diethanolamine are to assess as relevant for the drinking water supply from <b>bank</b> <b>filtrates.</b> The technological investigations included the treatment steps microbiological degradation, flocculation, ozonation, disinfection with chlorine and chlorine dioxide as well as the combination of the treatment methods and were carried out using model and natural waters. Resulting from the technological attempts it was shown that expected diethylamine all regarded compounds were removed from the water either by microbiological degradation or by ozonation. In contrast, flocculation and disinfection with chlorine and chlorine dioxide were not suited for the elimination of the polar nitrogen compounds from the water. In further investigations with the alicyclic amines, for exmaple, a correlation between the chemical structure and the microbiological degradation was demonstrated. It was shown after that the reaction mechanism, the chemical structure as well as the degree of protonation of the alicyclic amines influence the reaction-rate of the ozonation. Methylamine was identified as an by-product of the disinfection of natural waters with chlorine and chlorine dioxide. (orig.)

40|$|Subject of this PhD-thesis are the {{analysis}} and behaviour of aromatic sulfonamides as organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment. On the grounds of their widespread application, bacteriostatics as well as benzene- and toluenesulfonamides (BTS) are investigated. Analysis of the sulfonamides consists of solid-phase extraction (LiChrolut EN) and HPLC-MS/MS. Limits of detection vary from 0. 1 - 20 ng/L. The MS/MS detection is carried out in SRM mode. Matrix effects of the investigated secondary municipal effluent and surface water result in ionisation enhancement for most sulfonamides. The quantitation is carried out by internal calibration (stable isotopically-tagged internal standard). For identification purposes, product ion scans and SRM are utilised, false positive results are thus excluded as far as possible. As physicochemical methods {{for the removal of}} sulfonamides, nanofiltration and adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC) are investigated in laboratory systems. Nanofiltration with a membrane of a molecular weight cut off of 1000 g/mol leads to rejection rates of 50 - 75 % at pH 5. 4 and of 75 - 90 % at pH 8 for the bacteriostatics. Rejection rates of BTS amount to 10 - 45 % at both pH values. In single component solution, sulfmethoxazole and N-n-butylbenzenesulfonamide are well adsorbable on PAC. In spiked microfiltered secondary effluent, their adsorbability drops markedly. Filtration of this effluent with a tight ultrafiltration membrane leads to a better adsorbability of the sulfonamides in the permeates as compared to the feed water. Biological degradation is tested in aerobic batch tests (Zahn-Wellens) as well as in aerobic and anaerobic/anoxic soil columns. In the batch tests, all bacteriostatics are degradable. Two metabolites are identified. From their structure, the structure of the degradation products of the other bacteriostatics can be deduced. Three BTS are easily degradable and another three BTS are non-degradable in this test. In the soil columns, the degradability before a background-DOC is investigated. At continuous spiking with small amounts under aerobic conditions, the twelve tested bacteriostatics are degradable. The degradation rate depends on the heteroaromatic moiety. Six examined BTS are non-degradable under these conditions. At peak spiking with high concentrations, none of the sulfonamides is degraded aerobically whereas under anaerobic/anoxic conditions, two out of nine investigated bacteriostatics and four out of eight BTS are partially eliminated. Secondary effluents, receiving waters, surface waters, <b>bank</b> <b>filtrates</b> and raw waters are analysed for sulfonamides. In the investigated Berlin area, the bacteriostatics sulfmethoxazole, sulfadiazine, and sulfamerazine and the BTS N-n-butylbenzenesulfonamide, N-ethyltoluenesulfonamide, N-(phenylsulfonyl) sarcosine, and N-methylbenzenesulfonamide are detected. Effluent concentrations of municipal waste water treatment plants amount to 1 - 2000 ng/L, depending on the sulfonamide. It is shown that sulfonamides in the other water compartments originate from these treatment plants. Concentrations here range from 0 - 250 ng/L, depending on dilution and biological degradation. Waters from other regions exhibit different sulfonamide compositions and concentrations. In bank filtration, the concentrations depend on the water carrying path of the sulfonamides through the underground with the redox milieu as the most influential parameter...|$|R

Ein effektiver Schutz der Ressource Grundwasser erfordert daher die Identifikation von Belastungsquellen und eine Erfassung der Oberflächenwasserinfiltration (Uferfiltrat). Im Rahmen dieser Dissertation wird (i) die Anwendbarkeit eines statistischen Data-Mining Verfahrens und (ii) die Eignung von zwei organischen Spurenstoffen (Acesulfam und anthropogenes Gadolinium) als Abwassertracer zur Identifikation von Belastungsquellen und zur Erfassung von Uferfiltrat in einem alluvialen Grundwasserkörper im Einzugsbereich einer Trinkwassergewinnung untersucht. Die Ergebnisse dieser Dissertation zeigen, dass anhand eines Klassifizierungsbaums basierend auf dem CHAID Algorithmus (X² {{automated}} interaction detection) Rückschlüsse auf potentielle Eintragspfade von pathogenen Keimen gezogen werden können. Kritische Bedingungen mit erhöhter Auftrittswahrscheinlichkeit von mikrobieller Belastung des Rohwassers konnten mittels routinemäßig erhobenen hydrologischen und hydraulischen Messgrößen identifiziert werden. Die durchgeführten Studien geben deutliche Hinweise auf einen natürlichen Abbau von Acesulfam innerhalb weniger Tage unter oxischen Bedingungen im Grundwasser. Acesulfam ist daher nicht unter allen natürlichen Bedingungen als verlässlicher Tracer für Uferfiltrat geeignet. Im Gegensatz dazu kann anthropogenes Gadolinium als qualitativer und quantitativer Tracer für die Infiltration von Flusswasser mit geringer Abwasserbelastung eingesetzt werden; bereits geringe Anteile an Uferfiltrat wurden identifiziert. Bei höheren Uferfiltratanteilen sind allerdings größere Unsicherheiten aufgrund der hohen zeitlichen Variabilität der Gadoliniumkonzentrationen im Flusswasser zu berücksichtigen. In many countries, shallow {{alluvial groundwater}} bodies are a preferred source {{of drinking water}} production. In order to effectively protect groundwater quality, the identification of possible contamination sources and the assessment of river water infiltration to groundwater systems are therefore key issues. The aims of this PhD thesis are to investigate (i) the potential of a multivariate statistical data mining technique and (ii) the suitability of two trace contaminants (acesulfame and anthropogenic gadolinium) as wastewater tracers to identify contamination sources and to assess the influence of infiltrated river water to alluvial groundwater in the catchment of a drinking water production facility. This PhD thesis highlights that a tree-based statistical data mining algorithm (recursive partitioning algorithm CHAID) provided valuable indications of the likely sources of pathogens. It was demonstrated that routinely monitored hydrological and hydraulic monitoring parameters {{could be used as}} proxy indicators for critical conditions with higher probability of microbial contamination of raw drinking water. The results of this PhD thesis strongly indicate that natural attenuation of acesulfame can occur within a few days in environments which are characterised by oxic conditions, moderate temperatures and high hydraulic conductivities.

40|$|In the Indian {{metropolis}} of Delhi, the Yamuna River {{is highly}} influenced by sewage water, {{which has led}} to elevated ammonium (NH 4 +) concentrations up to 20 mg/L in the river water during 2012 – 2013. Large drinking water production wells located in the alluvial aquifer draw high shares of <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate.</b> Due to the infiltrating river water, the raw water NH 4 + concentrations in some wells exceed the threshold value of 0. 5 mg/L ammonia-N of the Indian drinking water specifications, making the water unfit for human consumption without prior treatment. However, to meet the city’s growing water demand, it might be advantageous to consider the long-term use of the well field. This requires the development of an adapted post-treatment unit in concert with an adjusted well field management. To better understand the groundwater dynamics and contamination and decontamination times at the well field, a theoretical modeling study has been conducted. The results of 2 D numerical modeling reveal that the groundwater flux beneath the river is negligible because of the aquifer and river geometry, indicating that infiltrating river water is not diluted by the ambient groundwater. Increasing the water abstraction in the wells closest to the river would result in a larger share of <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> and a decreasing groundwater table decline. Simplified 1 D reactive transport models set up for a distance of 500 m (transect from the riverbank to the first production well) showed that the NH 4 + contamination will prevail for the coming decades. Different lithological units of the aquifer (sand and kankar—a sediment containing calcareous nodules) have a strong influence on the respective contamination and decontamination periods, as the retardation of NH 4 + is higher in the kankar than in the sand layer. Although this simplified approach does not allow for a quantification of processes, it can support decision-making about a possible future use of the well field and point to associated research needs...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{treatment}} {{systems such}} as bank filtration (BF) and artificial recharge (via an infiltration basin) are a robust barrier for many organic micropollutants (OMPs) and may represent a low-cost alternative compared to advanced drinking water treatment systems. This study analyzes a comprehensive database of OMPs at BF and artificial recharge (AR) sites located near Lake Tegel in Berlin (Germany). The focus {{of the study was}} on the derivation of correlations between the removal efficiencies of OMPs and key factors influencing the performance of BF and AR. At the BF site, shallow monitoring wells located close to the Lake Tegel source exhibited oxic conditions followed by prolonged anoxic conditions in deep monitoring wells and a production well. At the AR site, oxic conditions prevailed from the recharge pond along monitoring wells to the production well. Long residence times of up to 4. 5 months at the BF site reduced the temperature variation during soil passage between summer and winter. The temperature variations were greater at the AR site as a consequence of shorter residence times. Deep monitoring wells and the production well located at the BF site were under the influence of ambient groundwater and old <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> (up to several years of age). Thus, it is important to account for mixing with native groundwater and other sources (e. g., old <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate)</b> when estimating the performance of BF with respect to removal of OMPs. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate correlations between OMP removals and hydrogeochemical conditions with spatial and temporal parameters (e. g., well distance, residence time and depth) from both sites. Principal component- 1 (PC 1) embodied redox conditions (oxidation-reduction potential and dissolved oxygen), and principal component- 2 (PC 2) embodied degradation potential (e. g., total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon) with the calcium carbonate dissolution potential (Ca 2 + and HCO 3 -) for the BF site. These two PCs explained a total variance of 55 % at the BF site. At the AR site, PCA revealed redox conditions (PC 1) and degradation potential with temperature (PC 2) as principal components, which explained a total variance of 56 %. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

The rawwater of Halle-Beesen is bankfiltrate of the rivers Saale and Weisse Elster and recharged treated river water. The water quality decreased extremly during the 60 's and 70 's. Therefore the technology in the waterplant was not sufficient enough to guarantee {{drinking water}} quality. So in the 80 's plans were born for another waterplant at Beesen with an updated technology. They were realized with the financial support of the German ministry for research and technology during 1990 and 1993. The treatment technology includes the pretreatment of river Saale water before groundwater recharge and the treatment of the artifical recharged water and <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> as well. The pretreatment steps are aeration and flocculation. <b>Bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> and artifical recharged water are collectivily pumped through raw water wells in double layer filters. In this filters iron, manganese and ammonia are removed. The first filtration step is followed by ozonation and after that by a two step filtration with preactivate and activated carbon. A decisive treatment step is the ocidation of ammonia. The use of pure oxygen for the aeration makes sure that ammonia and manganese are removed in the double layer filters. Due to the relative high bromide concentration in the raw water the formation of brominated byproducts during ozonation was specially checked. The influence of ozone on the formation of bromate, brominated trihalomethases and THM's in the following chlorination step was analyzed. The ozonation leads to a decrease of the chlorine demand. However after 24 hours the THM-formation is the same with ozonation compared to the water without ozonation. The reason is the higher formation of brominated THM after the chlorination of the ozonated and carbon filtered water. As a result of the investigation and the treatment procedure in the new plant it could be shown, {{that it is possible to}} guarantee drinking water quality. However more work is necessary to protect the water resources. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Bank {{filtration}} {{has been}} of great importance to the drinking water supply in Germany for many decades. The water quality of pumped raw water from bank filtration sites depends to a high degree on the water quality of the infiltrating surface water and the landside groundwater, the mixed portion of both, {{as well as the}} flow and transport conditions in the aquifer. Following the improvement of river water quality and a drastic decrease in water demand during the last 20 years in Germany, the influence of landside groundwater quality has become more important for the raw water quality of waterworks relying on bank filtration. The hydrogeologic analysis of three bank filtration sites in Saxony and the management of abstraction rates and well operation in response to fluctuating water demand are discussed. 1 Bank filtration in Germany In Germany, only 3 % of the annually available water re-sources are needed for the public water supply.

This included (i) hydraulic simulation using MODFLOW; (ii) determination of share of <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> using NASRI BF simulator; (iii) prediction of water quality from a BF system using the water quality guidelines developed and (iv) comparison of the costs of BF systems and existing conventional surface water treatment systems for water treatment.

It was found that in most of the cities studied BF is a feasible and attractive option from hydraulic, water quality as well as operational cost considerations. Considerable operational and maintenance costs saving can be achieved and water quality can be further improved by switching from conventional chemical-based surface water treatment to BF or at least by replacing some of the treatment units with BF systems. © IWA Publishing 2012...|$|E

Furthermore, the <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> is mixed with ground water which contains a high amount of hardness and sulfate. Therefore nanofiltration and ultrafiltration was investigated as a economically competitive alternative. One of the main subjects was the investigation of the rejection of trace organics like pesticides by nanofiltration and the reduction of desinfection by-products. Because of restrictions of concentrate disposal the treatment of the NF-concentrate by activated carbon, by making use of the high concentration and the small volume flow of the concentrate, was investigated. An evaluation of economic efficiency showed that the nanofiltration process could be competitive if it is possible to substitute several conventional treatment steps like activated carbon filtration and conventional softening.

Die verwendeten Spurenstoffe sind Chlorid als natürlicher geochemischer Spurenstoff, radon- 222 als radioaktives Isotop sowie anthropogenes Gadolinium als anthropogener Spurenstoff. Die räumliche Verteilung und Quantifizierung von infiltriertem Flußwasser (Uferfiltrat) in das Grundwasser wurde durch die Berechnung der Mischungsverhältnisse mit Hilfe des anthropogenen Gadoliniums im Grundwasser bestimmt und durch den Einsatz einer GIS Software visualisiert. In Kombination mit der hydrochemischen Analyse führten die Ergebnisse zur räumlichen Aufteilung des Grundwasserleiters in drei Zonen, die unterschiedliche Eigenschaften aufweisen. Es stellte sich heraus, dass Chlorid nicht wie erhofft eingesetzt werden konnte, da sich dessen dynamische Reichweite als zu klein erwies. Die resultierenden Mischungsverhältnisse unterscheiden sich von den entsprechenden Ergebnissen mit Gadolinium in einem Bereich von minus 125 % bis plus 90 %. Die Verweilzeit des Uferfiltrats wurde durch die Analyse von radon- 222, einem radioaktiven Isotop das Teil der U- 238 Zerfallskette ist, bestimmt. Insbesondere direkt an den Fluß grenzende Zonen mit Uferfiltrat konnten datiert werden und zeigten Wasser Verweilzeiten zwischen etwa 2 und 16 Tagen. Durch die Analyse von Langzeit-probenreihen eines Flusses und eines abstromig vom Untersuchungsgebiet liegenden Beobachtungsbrunnens, konnte mittels Chlorid und Gadolinium-Konzentrationen eine Grundwasserabstandsgeschwindigkeit von ca. 81 m/d ermittelt werden. This master thesis {{addresses}} {{the investigation of}} an alluvial aquifer in a subalpine headwater catchment by utilising environmental and pollution tracers to determine the spatial distribution and portion of infiltrated surface water {{as well as its}} residence time. The tracers that have been used comprise chloride as an environmental geochemical compound tracer, radon- 222 as an environmental radioactive isotope tracer and anthropogenic gadolinium as a pollution tracer. The spatial distribution and quantification of infiltrated river water to the groundwater (<b>bank</b> <b>filtrate)</b> was determined by calculating mixing ratios from the concentration of anthropogenic Gadolinium in the groundwater and mapping them with GIS software. In combination with the hydrochemical analysis the results lead to the spatial classification of the aquifer in 3 zones that show different characteristics. Chloride proved to be not of the anticipated use as the dynamic range turned out to be too small. The resulting mixing ratios differ from the related results of gadolinium by minus 125 % to plus 90 %. The residence time of the <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> was determined by the analysis of radon- 222, a radioactive isotope {{that is part of the}} U- 238 decay chain. In particular bank filtration zones directly adjacent to the river proved to be dateable and showed ages between around 2 and 16 days. By analysing and comparing long term timelines of chloride and gadolinium concentrations in river water and a long term observation well which lies downstream to the investigated area, a groundwater distance velocity of approx. 81 m/d has been determined...|$|E
40|$|Lake Baerwalde is a {{lake that}} {{resulted}} from open pit lignite mining in the East German mining district. It has been filling with surface waters since 1997. Its current volume is approximately 100 * 106 m 3 which is about 60 % of its final volume. The pH of the lake water has remained {{at a level of}} around pH 3 {{since the beginning of the}} flooding. Nevertheless, acidity has dropped significantly from over 10 mmol/L to well below 2 mmol/L. After reaching its final level, the lake will discharge into the river Spree. Down-stream of the mining district, <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> from the river Spree is used for the water supply of the city of Berlin. The evolution of the lake water qual-ity strongly depends on the water balance of the lake. Based on monitoring results of the flooding process, the net groundwater discharge from the lake is calculated. The fluxes are calculated for a period of 5 years on a monthly basis. High infiltration rates into groundwater in combination with low exfiltration rates from groundwater lead to favorable conditions for the development of lake water quality. Existing predictions of lake wa-ter quality depend on this factor (i. e. the water balance) rather than on the degree of simplification applied to the surface water model. The response of the lake water level according to periods of high and low surface water input was used to calibrate the groundwater flow model which is based on a detailed 3 -D geological model. A large set of borehole data from the mining exploration was used to set up a 10 layer model of the geological structure to store hydraulic as well as geochemical data...|$|E
40|$|Ca. 75 % des Berliner Trinkwassers besteht aus lokal gefördertem Uferfiltrat bzw. künstlich angerei-chertem Grundwasser (Schulze 1997). Gleichzeitig leiten Berlins teilweise stromaufwärts von Uferfiltratstrecken eingeleitet. Szenarien prognostizieren zudem einen lokalen Anstieg der Abwasseranteile (Schumacher & Skripalle 1999, Heinzmann 1997). Da Kläranlageneinleitungen zu Stoffeinträgen führen, die trotz Bodenpassage und Wasseraufbereitung bis ins Trinkwasser gelangen können, wurden sowohl die Reinigungsleistung der Berliner Uferfiltration für organische Stoffe (DOC) sowie der Einfluss erhöhter Abwasseranteile untersucht. Das Hauptaugenmerk der Untersu-chungen lag auf der Selbstreinigungskraft sowie dem Regenerationsvermögen der Ressource Wasser, deren Erhalt im Sinne einer Nachhaltigen Wasserwirtschaft gefordert wird (Lehn et al. 1999). Über zwei Jahre wurden die gelösten organischen Stoffe an Uferfiltrationsstrecken an Tegeler See und Müggelsee in Berlin untersucht. Im Mittel werden ca. 20 - 45 % des DOC bei der Bodenpassage entfernt. Mit Bodensäulen gelingt eine Elimination von 30 % des DOC nach drei Metern. Vor allem höhermolekulare Anteile des DOC werden bei der Uferfiltration eliminiert, insbesondere eine den Polysacchariden zugeordnete Fraktion (®LC-OCD). Das Adsorptionsverhalten der gelösten organi-schen Stoffe (®Adsorptionsanalyse) ist sowohl vor als auch nach der Bodenpassage als schlecht ein-zuordnen. Die Reinigungsleistung der Uferfiltration für den DOC ist in Berlin-Tegel seit Jahrzehnten stabil und hängt vor allem von der Oberflächenwasserqualität ab. Kläranlageneinleitungen erhöhen den refraktären Teil organischer Verbindungen (RDOC) in den Berliner Gewässern. Sie tragen aber nicht zu einer wesentlichen Veränderung des Charakters des DOC bei in Bezug auf Molekulargewichtsverteilung, Adsorptionsverhalten oder Verteilung der funk-tionellen Gruppen (® 13 C-NMR). In Tegel trägt eine Phosphateliminierungsanlage (Fe-Flockung) zur Reduktion von ca. 25 - 30 % der zum Teil kläranlagenbürtigen organischen Stoffe bei. Entfernt wird vor allem der hochmolekulare huminstoffähnliche Anteil. Am Beispiel Berlin Tegels, wo für Berlin die höchsten Abwasseranteile im Trinkwasser von ca. 14 - 28 % vorliegen, wurden die Grenzen der indirekten Abwasserwiederverwendung untersucht. Zunächst wurden für RDOC, Chlorid und Sulfat die irreversiblen Stoffeinträge durch Wasserverbraucher sowie Kläranlagen bilanziert, indem die Stofffrachten des Berliner Trinkwassers denen der Kläranlagen-abläufe gegenübergestellt wurden. Die resultierenden Stoffeinträge (75 - 90 mg/l Chlorid, 35 - 45 mg/l Sulfat, 4 - 5 mg/l RDOC) werden in einem Modell (TegelSIM) zur Prognose der Trinkwasserkonzentra-tionen bei erhöhten Abwasseranteilen verwendet. TegelSIM zeigt, dass bei Rückführung von 60 % Trinkwasser zu der Kläranlage, deren Abwässer wieder zur Trinkwassergewinnung beitragen, bis zu Abwasseranteilen von 90 % im Trinkwasser keine problematischen Sulfat-, Chlorid- oder RDOC-Konzentrationen erreicht werden (Worst-Case: 248 mg/l SO 4, 207 mg/l Cl, 7, 7 mg/l RDOC). Für persistente Stoffe läßt sich die {{relative}} Trinkwasserkonzentration bezogen auf den Stoffeintrag je nach Abwasseranteil im Trinkwasser berechnen. Derzeit betrügen die Konzentrationen im Tegeler Trinkwasser infolge Verdünnung ca. 1 / 3 des Stoffeintrags eines persistenten bzw. refraktären Stoffes. Die Uferfiltration und künstliche Grundwasseranreicherung in Berlin tragen aufgrund ihrer langfristig fortbestehenden Reinigungsleistung und ihres geringen Energie- und Wartungsbedarfs zu einer nachhaltigen Wasserwirtschaft bei. Das Berliner System, in dem es teilweise zur indirekten Abwasser-wiederverwendung kommt, stößt allerdings mit Bezug auf die Selbstreinigungskraft insbesondere bei persistenten organischen Einzelstoffen an seine Grenzen. About 75 % of Berlin´s {{drinking water}} is <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> or artificially recharged groundwater. At the same time, Berlin´s treated wastewater is being discharged partially upstream of bank filtration sites. The surface water flow into Berlin is with about 53 m³/s relatively low. Due to lower groundwater abstraction for lignite coal mining upstream of Berlin, {{the first two}} decades of the 21 st century will see a further reduction of this surface water flow to about 30 m³/s (Finke 2000). As a consequence, the portions of treated wastewater might increase in Berlin´s surface waters used for bank filtration and groundwater recharge. To ensure a high quality of the city´s drinking water, {{more information on the}} purification potential of Berlin´s bank filtration systems is required as well as increased knowledge about the consequences of increased wastewater portions in drinking water sources. This thesis investigates the purification capacity of bank filtration and groundwater recharge for dissolved organic substances. The focus lies on two aspects of a sustainable water management: the aspect of a long-term (self-) purification capacity of water, and the potential of water to be regenerated or recycled (adapted from Lehn et al. 1999). To investigate the aspect of (self-) purification of water via bank filtration in Berlin, DOC and UV analysis was carried out for monthly sampled groundwater monitoring wells over a period of two years. The monitoring wells are located at the banks of the lakes Tegeler See and Müggelsee in Berlin. In addition, soil passage was simulated using soil columns. Molecular weight distribution of organic compounds in <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate,</b> surface waters, treated wastewater and drinking water {{as well as for the}} soil columns was determined using batch-ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography (LC-OCD). Adsorption analysis gave information about the adsorption behavior of DOC on activated carbon. DOC of effluent, lake water, and two bank filtrates was fractionated using XAD resins (8 and 4 in tandem), and functional groups of the isolated DOC were analyzed using 13 C-NMR. Lake bank filtration in Berlin eliminates about 20 - 45 % of DOC. Using soil columns, 30 % of DOC are eliminated after 3 meters. Larger molecular weight compounds are preferably removed during bank filtration, especially a fraction of polysaccharides (identified using LC-OCD). Dissolved organic substances of both Berlin´s surface waters and bank filtrates have been found to adsorb very poorly onto activated carbon. Wastewater discharges increase both DOC and the refractory part of dissolved organic compounds (RDOC) in surface waters. However, the character of DOC in surface waters is not changed significantly, namely molecular weight distribution, adsorption behavior and functional group distribution. In Berlin, the increase in RDOC due to wastewater discharges is not reflected in <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> quality, although wastewater is partly being discharged upstream of bank filtration sites. DOC concentrations of lake Tegeler See and Tegel drinking water, which contains 80 % <b>bank</b> <b>filtrate</b> and artificially recharged water, show that the purification capacity of lake bank filtration remains constant over decades, and that drinking water DOC is mainly dependent on surface water quality. In lake Tegeler See, phosphate elimination by iron flocculation and the subsequent decrease of eutrophication both led to a reduction in DOC concentrations of about 4 - 6 mg/l. This reduction is reflected in DOC concentrations of Tegel drinking water, which decreased by about 1, 5 mg/l. In a second part of the thesis, the qualitative and quantitative limits of indirect wastewater reuse were investigated. In Berlin, lake Tegeler See is a special example of indirect waste-water reuse: About 80 % of the groundwater abstracted around this lake consists of lake water. One of the largest water treatment plants of Berlin (WTP Tegel) abstracts lake water via bank filtration and artificial groundwater recharge. The portions of treated wastewater in the lake were found to be about 17 - 35 % (mean values, 1993 - 1998). In Tegel drinking water, wastewater portions were calculated to be 14 - 28 %. Berlin´s other water treatment plants have much lower portions that might reach maximum values of 11 % in times of extreme water shortage. Water users and wastewater treatment plants cause irreversible inputs of certain substances, such as RDOC, chloride, and to some extent sulfate. RDOC, chloride and sulfate inputs were quantified for Berlin by comparing the mass fluxes of Berlin´s drinking water with those of Berlin´s treated wastewater. The difference is called water use input. In Berlin, a single use cycle of water increases chloride by about 75 - 90 mg/l, sulfate by about 35 - 45 mg/l, and RDOC by about 4 - 5 mg/l. The water use input can explain the total input of DOC into Berlin´s surface waters (comparison of surface water mass fluxes into and out of Berlin). However, both chloride and sulfate fluxes increase to an extent that neither the water use input nor other material fluxes, i. e. from drainage water, can explain this increase satisfyingly. To quantify the limits of indirect wastewater reuse in partly closed water cycles with regard to drinking water concentrations of salts, RDOC, and single refractory compounds, a model was created (TegelSIM). The model was used to calculate scenarios for the Tegel water cycle. It was shown that when 60 % of wastewater at WWTP Schönerlinde originate from WTP Tegel, 90 % of this drinking water would have to consist of wastewater for salt concentrations to exceed drinking water standards. For this unlikely case, sulfate concentration in drinking water would be 248 mg/l, chloride concentration 207 mg/l, and DOC 7, 7 mg/l. Using TegelSIM, the accumulation of a persistent compound added by water users in a partly closed water cycle can be simulated. It is assumed that the compound is neither eliminated in the WWTP nor during flocculation and soil passage. To reach or surpass the concentration of the water use input in drinking water, at least 62 % of drinking water would have to consist of treated wastewater (while assuming that 60 % of wastewater consists of this same drinking water). Although added constantly, the concentration in drinking water would reach a maximum under stable conditions. Lake bank filtration and artificial groundwater recharge in Berlin play an important role in sustainable water management in the city due to their stable purification capacity and low energy and maintenance requirements. Berlin´s water system with its cases of unplanned, indirect wastewater reuse is limited in its (self-) purification capacity, especially when looking at persistent, polar organic compounds. A planned water reuse for Berlin would require an assessment and evaluation of concentrations of those persistent compounds in drinking water...|$|E
