25|$|Post this intimation, I was {{informed}} {{for the first}} time yesterday by the BCCI that the Captain had reservations with my 'style' and about my continuing as the Head Coach. I was surprised since I have always respected the role boundaries between Captain and Coach. Though the BCCI attempted to resolve the misunderstandings between the Captain and me, it was apparent that the partnership was untenable, and I therefore believe it is <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to move on.|$|E
500|$|Aaron Ramsey, {{who scored}} Arsenal's winning {{goal in the}} FA Cup final, was adamant their recent success would make his {{teammates}} determined to win more. He aimed for victory in the Community Shield, as it would provide a platform for {{what he described as}} [...] "a tough opening couple of games in the Premier League." [...] Samir Nasri, who left Arsenal to join Manchester City in 2011, in the lead-up to the match described the abuse he received from Arsenal supporters since his transfer as [...] "stupid." [...] He went on to explain: [...] "They see it as treason or that I betrayed them but it’s not like that. I just look what’s <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> ... For the fans the only reason [...] has to be for the money. But it isn’t just for the money." ...|$|E

500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice what is <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several biographers say Escrivá {{prohibited}} his devotees {{from asking}} {{for the title of}} Marquess of Peralta. They state that Escrivá accepted it due to the advice of some cardinals who told him that he had the obligation to do so {{for the sake of his}} brother, Santiago, and so as to practice what he preached about fulfilling civil duties and exercising rights. His brother Santiago said: [...] "The decision was heroic because he knew that he will be vilified as a result... Josemaría did what is <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> After the right amount of time has passed, without making use of the title (in fact he never had the intention of using it), he passed the title on to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of {{setbacks}} including further surgeries on his knees, Martínez fought again over {{a year after the}} Murray fight, losing his WBC, The Ring and lineal middleweight titles to three-division former world champion Miguel Cotto on June 7, 2014, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was evident straight away that Martinez's legs were not there, even with knee braces on and clearly visible, Cotto knocked Martínez down three times in the first round. After the first round however, he begun to make the fight competitive with Cotto. He continued to fight back until round nine when Martínez went down once again. Following the ninth round, trainer Pablo Sarmiento decided to call off the fight prior to the tenth round while still in the corner, against the urging of Martínez. According to reports, Sarmiento told Martínez [...] "Champion, your knees are not responding. Sergio, look at me ... I'm gonna stop this one. Sergio, you are the <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> You'll always be the best champion, Sergio." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{family owned}} six {{slaves in the}} late 1850s. Three (Hetty, Cyrus, and George, a mother and two teenage sons) were {{received}} as a wedding present. Another, Albert, requested that Jackson purchase him and allow him to work for his freedom; he was employed as a waiter {{in one of the}} Lexington hotels and Jackson rented him to VMI. Amy also requested that Jackson purchase her from a public slave auction and she served the family as a cook and housekeeper. The sixth, Emma, was a four-year-old orphan with a learning disability, accepted by Jackson from an aged widow and presented to his second wife, Mary Anna, as a welcome-home gift. After the American Civil War began he appears to have hired out or sold his slaves. Mary Anna Jackson, in her 1895 memoir, said, [...] "our servants ... without the firm guidance and restraint of their master, the excitement of the times proved so demoralizing to them that he deemed it <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to provide them with good homes among the permanent residents." [...] James Robertson wrote about Jackson's view on slavery: ...|$|E
2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew I did have to focus on defending myself.|$|E
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
