40|$|The {{effects of}} MHD {{generator}} length, level of oxygen enrichment, and oxygen production {{power on the}} performance of MHD/steam power plants ranging from 200 to 1000 MW in electrical output are investigated. The plants considered use oxygen enriched combustion air preheated to 1100 F. Both plants in which the MHD generator is cooled with low temperature and pressure <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> and plants in which the generator is cooled with high temperature and pressure <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> are considered. For plants using low temperature <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> for generator cooling the maximum thermodynamic efficiency is obtained with shorter generators and a lower level of oxygen enrichment compared to plants using high temperature <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> for generator cooling. The generator length at which the maximum plant efficiency occurs increases with power plant size for plants with a generator cooled by low temperature feedwater. Also shown is the relationship of the magnet stored energy requirement of the generator length and the power plant performance. Possible cost/performance tradeoffs between magnet cost and plant performance are indicated...|$|R

50|$|The typical tray-type {{deaerator}} in Figure 1 has {{a vertical}} domed deaeration section mounted above a horizontal <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> storage vessel. <b>Boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> enters the vertical deaeration section above the perforated trays and flows downward through the perforations. Low-pressure deaeration steam enters below the perforated trays and flows upward through the perforations. Some designs use {{various types of}} packed bed, rather than perforated trays, to provide good contact and mixing between the steam and the boiler feed water.|$|R
50|$|The {{spray-type}} consists only of {{a horizontal}} (or vertical) cylindrical vessel {{which serves as}} both the deaeration section and the <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> storage tank.|$|R
50|$|A common {{application}} of economizers in steam power plants is {{to capture the}} waste heat from boiler stack gases (flue gas) and transfer it to the <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater.</b> This raises {{the temperature of the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater,</b> lowering the needed energy input, in turn reducing the firing rates needed for the rated boiler output. Economizers lower stack temperatures which may cause condensation of acidic combustion gases and serious equipment corrosion damage if care is not taken in their design and material selection.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen a {{coal-fired}} unit {{operates at}} a partial load, the decrease at regenerative steam pressure {{leads to a}} decrease in <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> temperature, affecting not only the thermal economical efficiency, but also the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) denitrification effect and the boiler combustion stability. A feedwater system with the thermal vapor compressor has been studied in the present paper. The high pressure regenerative steam is injected by the live steam to heat <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> to increase its temperature. Mathematical models of the thermal vapor compressor, boiler and turbine regenerative system are established to calculate {{the performance of a}} 660 MW supercritical air cooling unit at a 60 % load. It was found that although the energy-saving effect is small, it is positive to improve the SCR denitrification effect and stabilize the boiler combustion...|$|R
50|$|Extracting type {{turbines}} {{are common}} in all applications. In an extracting type turbine, steam is released from various stages of the turbine, and used for industrial process needs or sent to <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> heaters to improve overall cycle efficiency.

50|$|However the {{contamination}} of <b>boiler</b> <b>feedwater</b> with foreign bodies was a problem. Old sources report {{erosion of the}} boiler plates which was caused by fatty acids contained in the lubricant accompanying the exhaust steam. On the other hand the formation of scale in the boiler was delayed because a proportion of the boiler scale constituents had already been {{left behind in the}} tender.|$|R

50|$|A steam generator, in {{the sense}} of an {{auxiliary}} boiler on a ship, is a form of boiler. It uses high-pressure superheated steam from the main steam supply used for propulsion, and uses this to generate low pressure saturated steam.
