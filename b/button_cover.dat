50|$|A chronic {{problem of}} the center select <b>button</b> <b>cover</b> falling off has been {{reported}} by many users, although the <b>button</b> <b>cover</b> is not necessary for the button to work. Other than that problem, the phone has received accolades for its good call quality and solid construction, despite reports of instability of the Motorola OS.|$|E
50|$|A {{buttonhole}} blocker {{holds the}} fabric {{at the two}} sides of the buttonhole together, thereby making the buttonhole too small for the button to pass through. While more secure than a <b>button</b> <b>cover,</b> it is much harder to apply, and does not have such a fashionable appearance.|$|E
50|$|A <b>button</b> <b>cover</b> is {{an object}} {{larger than the}} button that it covers, and closes over the button, thereby making the button too large to pass through its hole. These, however, have the {{weakness}} in which the button can {{be removed from the}} garment with enough force, thereby making it less effective, and damaging the garment when it is breached.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the typical shank and shankless <b>buttons,</b> <b>covered</b> <b>buttons</b> are shank buttons that have fabric completely covering the back. They are stitched on like regular shank buttons, but the sewer has to [...] "feel" [...] for the shank while they are sewing the <b>button</b> on. <b>Covered</b> <b>buttons</b> are handmade (to some degree), expensive, and are used in high-end and specialty garments.|$|R

5000|$|At this point, the {{contestant}} {{is given}} the choice of selling the case and whatever amount contained in it to the banker and taking the banker's offer (by pushing the button inside the case) or rejecting the offer and open more cases (the number of cases opened decreases as the game progresses) (by closing the <b>button</b> <b>cover),</b> but not before being tempted with the catchphrase [...] "Deal or No Deal".|$|E
50|$|After the {{selection}} of cases for each round, the banker (who is above the studio) will call down to the host using a phone on the podium, giving the contestant a bank offer. The host then opens a <b>button</b> <b>cover</b> {{at the center of}} the podium. The contestant can choose to push the metal button and take the offer or close the cover and continue the game. If the contestant takes the offer prior to the final round, the game continues to see if the contestant has a lower amount in his/her case. If the contestant rejects the final offer, the contestant will be allowed to keep their case or switch their case for the remaining case in play. The contestant then wins the amount that is in their case. The case is revealed to the audience when the amount in the case is lower than the offer or when the contestant wins any of the three top prizes, and the contestant opens the case when the case amount is higher than the bank offer, just like in the Estonian version of the show.|$|E

60|$|The candy man {{stopped his}} {{pushcart}} {{in front of}} the old Madison Avenue home. He had a holiday and festival air unusual to street peddlers. His tie was new and bright red, and a horseshoe pin, almost life-size, glittered speciously from its folds. His brown, thin face was crinkled into a semi-foolish smile. Striped cuffs with dog-head <b>buttons</b> <b>covered</b> the tan on his wrists.|$|R
