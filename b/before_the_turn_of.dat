Originally {{intended}} purely as a men's social club, lodges were soon founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, St. Louis, Missouri and Crawfordsville and Frankfort, Indiana. The early order was not prosperous. Dr. Wilson himself was dissatisfied and left the order of the Moose <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century. When Albert C. Stevens was compiling his Cyclopedia of Fraternities in the late 1890s, he was unable to ascertain whether it was still in existence.|$|E
5|$|York mostly {{occupied}} {{the bottom half}} of the table <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the year, and dropped as low as 23rd in September 2013. During February 2014 the team broke into the top half of the table and with one match left were in sixth-place. York's defensive record was the third best in League Two with 41 goals conceded, bettered only by Southend (39) and Chesterfield (40). Davies made the highest number of appearances over the season, appearing in 47 of York's 52 matches. Fletcher was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Jarvis with nine goals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} diocesan {{succession}} of Argyll is uncertain, the jurisdiction itself {{appears to have}} lain outwith the domain of Rǫgnvaldr's direct control, allowing the meic Somairle to readily act as religious patrons without his interference. Like the Kingdom of the Isles itself, the great geographic size of the Diocese of the Isles appears to {{have contributed to the}} alienation of outlying areas, and to its eventual disintegration. In fact, there is reason to suspect that portions of the new diocese were likewise detached from the Scottish dioceses of Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Moray. Although the Scottish Crown may have welcomed the formation of the new diocese, as it may have formed part of a plan to project Scottish royal authority into the region, the meic Somairle rulers of the region were in fact hostile to the Scots, and the diocese's seat on Lismorealbeit first recorded in the early fourteenth centurylay far outwith the Scottish king's sphere of influence. Whatever the case, the foundation of the Diocese of Argyll {{appears to have been a}} drawn-out and gradual process that was unlikely to have been the work of one particular mansuch as Somerled, Dubgall, or Ragnall himself. Although the early diocese suffered from prolonged vacancies, as only two bishops are recorded to have occupied the see <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the mid thirteenth century, over time it became firmly established in the region, allowing the meic Somairle to retain local control of ecclesiastical power and prestige.|$|E

50|$|About 45,000 Norwegian {{collaborators}} {{joined the}} fascist party Nasjonal Samling (National Union), about 8,500 {{of them being}} enlisted in the collaborationist paramilitary organization Hirden. In addition, Norwegian police units helped arrest many of Norway's Jews. Nasjonal Samling had very little support among {{the population at large}} and Norway was one of few countries where resistance during World War II was widespread <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war in 1942/43.

50|$|Interpol {{received}} much critical acclaim, and garnered the band a healthy {{amount of attention}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>Turn</b> on <b>the</b> Bright Lights.

50|$|Another option {{consists}} of starting off from Larraitz {{with a view}} to ascending through the northern wild valley of Muitze, unknown to most hikers. This time the same track may be followed in the beginning for a convenient and gentle stroll, until a winding slope is overcome some minutes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crest (milestone Gazteraztegi, 520 m). There a broad track sets off back in the opposite direction, going up until it gets to an aerial at Urtzabal goikoa (610 m). Alternatively, a short-cut heads up cross-country straight on to the aerial from Larraitz, so gaining height in little time but with some effort. Right <b>before</b> <b>the</b> final slope to the aerial, a narrow path bounds south-east on the left into the tough and vertical valley carved by the stream Muitze (waterfalls on the way). The trail snakes out of the forest to the right and crosses the stream {{at the point where the}} forest landscape gives way to grassland. After overcoming the rocks, the stream must be crossed again to the right. A trail on the steep slopes on the right leads to the hut Txindoki and an orchard that provided the current name to the mountain. Legend has it, close to this place the mythological character/goddess Mari dwells in a crack on the rock (Marizulo). By clinging to the steep path, the pass of Egurral is reached (1h45).|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> period both <b>before</b> {{and after}} <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century saw {{education}} reform.

Economic developments had created new social and professional classes. A middle class of employees and civil servants emerged from the growth of state services and administration. Artisanship and trade were transformed by industrial and commercial progress.|$|R

25|$|To {{understand}} the forces ranged against L.Ron Hubbard, {{in this war}} he never started, {{it is necessary to}} gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned. As an institution, it dates back to shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century; it is certainly not worthy of respect by reason of age or dignity; and it does not meet any known definition of a science, what with its hodgepodge of unproven theories that have never produced any result-except an ability to make the unmanageable and mutinous more docile and quiet, and turn the troubled into apathetic souls beyond the point of caring. That it promotes itself as a healing profession is a misrepresentation. Its mission is to control.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco's harbor {{records and}} the Russian Consular records display {{the names of}} many Finnish and Baltic Russian Alaska skippers busily plying the waters between San Francisco, Petropavlovsk, Nikolajefsk and Vladivostok... Long <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century 11% of San Francisco's seaman {{community}} were Finns. The commercial activities of these former Finnish Russian-American Company skippers and their men were impressive. At least two {{are known to have}} become multimillionaires: Gustaf Nybom (later Niebaum), the founder of Inglenook wineries, and Otto Wilhelm Lindholm of Vladivostok. Their business ventures had interests spread across the Northern Pacific.

25|$|The {{cultural}} concepts originally {{adopted from}} Beaker {{groups at the}} lower Rhine blended or integrated with local Late Neolithic Culture. For a while the region was set apart from central and eastern Denmark, that evidently related more closely to the early Únětice culture across the Baltic Sea. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the millennium the typical Beaker features had gone, their total duration being 200–300 years at the most. A similar picture of cultural integration is featured among Bell Beakers in central Europe, thus challenging previous theories of Bell Beakers as an elitist or purely super-structural phenomenon. The connection with the East Group Beakers of Únětice had intensified considerably in LN II, thus triggering a new social transformation and innovations in metallurgy that would announce the actual beginning of the Northern Bronze Age.|$|E
50|$|Melbourne's thrash {{scene was}} also {{on the rise in}} the 1980s, with bands like Renegade and Rampage {{recording}} albums. Hobbs' Angel of Death released their self-titled album in 1988 through German label Steamhammer/SPV Records. Possibly one of the heaviest Australian recordings of its time, Hobbs' Angel of Death showcased a very distinct, heavily Satanic, Slayer-influenced sound. While initially intended as a studio project, Hobbs' Angel of Death would play a few shows <b>before</b> ending at <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decade, but would reform several times over the next few years.|$|R
5000|$|Institutions {{have been}} always central to social science {{but they have}} not been {{addressed}} with the same emphasis and manner in every approach. <b>Before</b> and after <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century, several scholars were writing about institutions, but they had not developed a theory of institutions yet. Most of these approaches relied heavily on the study of formal institutions (i.e. the law) (see hermeneutics). Moreover, they were highly normative and, thus, prescriptive (i.e. Weber prescribed the professionalization of bureaucracy {{in order to have a}} modern state). This is often called [...] "old institutionalism".|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} long waves in economic time series {{has long been}} an important subject of debate for economists, statisticians and historians. Recent empirical evidence for these long-term fluctuations is found in the literature of structural time series models. One empirical method for detecting long waves which seems to be particularly compatible with their theoretical explanation is the band pass filter. Applying the band pass filter to data from six European countries demonstrates the presence of wave-like fluctuations with a length of between 30 and 50 years. Their turning points show quite strong similarities across the six countries examined. Moreover, there is evidence for a stable lead-lag structure for two countries. The dominant theoretical explanation for long waves stresses the diffusion of general-purpose technologies. The diffusion of the railway system as one example of a general-purpose technology was analysed by means of logistic regression. The results are quite striking, as there seems to be evidence for a temporal sequence, implying that <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> points <b>of</b> railway diffusion occurred <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> points <b>of</b> long waves.
