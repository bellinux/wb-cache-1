5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> of nonspinous tissue.|$|E

5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Oryzomys couesi has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) ending in three cartilaginous digits at its tip. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character Oryzomys couesi shares only with Oligoryzomys and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. In {{recent years}} many South African {{companies}} made substantial progress in penetrating the global market. This presented {{a vast array}} of opportunities, but also fierce competition. In this study it is indicated that <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> are permitting organisations to operate more effectively in the business environment. Consequently, it is the objective of this study to gain insight into <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> from the South African industrial perspective, assess the factors and propose guidelines that are needed in order for <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> to be successful. In the literature study the traditional and modern organisation structure and remuneration systems are contrasted and the importance of the change process in achieving the desired state is emphasised. It is shown that <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> aligns with the concept of the modern organisation and to arrive at this state a disciplined and logical approach must be followed. <b>Broad</b> <b>banding</b> is identified as a compensation system that not only facilitates the change process to the modern organisation, but also provides a solid foundation to build upon The second part of the literature study addresses many of the questions surrounding <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> and provides guidelines for the design and implementation of <b>broad</b> <b>banding.</b> The study presents amongst others the background of <b>broad</b> <b>banding,</b> design and implementation aspects, remuneration within bands, controlling cost, communication and training. A South African company within the industrial environment formed the basis of the practical study. The forces initiating the <b>broad</b> <b>banding</b> process are identified and discussed and the resulting remuneration strategy presented. A review of a the three-stage process follows which constitutes a pre-implementation, implementation and post-implementation phase. The above process is scrutinised and a number of learning points developed by the author. A recommended model is provided for implementation of <b>broad</b> <b>banding.</b> The findings from the literature research and the industrial company are combined to provide guidelines on what to expect and how to enhance success...|$|R

5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with Oligoryzomys among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} penis, a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except Holochilus brasiliensis. Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Malaria is {{presently}} endemic in a <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> around the equator, {{in areas of}} the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur. An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were Ivory Coast (86.15), Angola (56.93) and Burkina Faso (50.66). A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Mali. The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global endemic levels of malaria, providing a means with which to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden. This effort led to the publication of a map of P.falciparum endemicity in 2010. As of 2010, about 100 countries have endemic malaria. Every year, 125 million international travellers visit these countries, and more than 30,000 contract the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{widespread}} in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> around the equator. This includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2015, there were 296 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.|$|E

5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is found}} {{in the foothills of the}} Great Dividing Range and surrounding areas. The northern limit of its range is 26° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, Blackbutt and Chinchilla, extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. In New South Wales, it {{is found in}} a <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. In Victoria it {{is found in the}} vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota. Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot, the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Textiles dyed with royal purple, {{a symbol}} of social status, {{were found in the}} royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes {{different}} from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his shawl {{would have been in the}} shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a <b>broad</b> <b>band.</b> For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was {{a symbol of}} prestige that glorified the strength of the king.|$|E

25|$|Illumination of the {{phosphor}} {{is achieved}} using UV light. Most thermographic phosphors absorb {{light in a}} <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> in the UV and therefore can be excited using a YAG:Nd laser. Theoretically, the same light can be used both for PIV and temperature measurements, but this would mean that UV-sensitive cameras are needed.

25|$|Carmelite {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Simon Stock at Cambridge, England in 1251 in answer to his appeal for help for his oppressed order and recommended the Brown Scapular to him.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of thin films and coatings is {{directly affected by}} interference effects. Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce the reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, {{and can be used}} to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest case is a single layer with thickness one-fourth the wavelength of incident light. The reflected wave {{from the top of the}} film and the reflected wave from the film/material interface are then exactly 180° out of phase, causing destructive interference. The waves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near the centre of the visible spectrum, around 550nm. More complex designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over a <b>broad</b> <b>band,</b> or extremely low reflectivity at a single wavelength.|$|E
25|$|The steppe {{has long}} been {{depicted}} as the typical Russian landscape. It is a <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> of treeless, grassy plains, interrupted by mountain ranges, extending from Hungary across Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan before ending in Manchuria. Most of the Soviet Union's steppe zone was located in the Ukrainian and Kazakh republics; the much smaller Russian steppe is located mainly between those nations, extending southward between the Black and Caspian Seas before blending into the increasingly desiccated territory of the Republic of Kalmykia. In a country of extremes, the steppe zone provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture because of its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture. Even here, however, agricultural yields are sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts. The soil is very dry.|$|E
25|$|Now {{differences}} between the contemporary squid and octopus samples became very clear. In the octopus, <b>broad</b> <b>bands</b> of fibers passed across {{the plane of the}} tissue and were separated by equally <b>broad</b> <b>bands</b> arranged in a perpendicular direction. In the squid there were narrower but also relatively broad bundles arranged in the plane of the section, separated by thin partitions of perpendicular fibers. It seemed I had found a means to identify the mystery sample after all. I could distinguish between octopus and squid, and between them and mammals, which display a lacy network of connective tissue fibers. After 75 years, the moment of truth was at hand. Viewing section after section of the St. Augustine samples, we decided at once, and beyond any doubt, that the sample was not whale blubber. Further, the connective tissue pattern was that of <b>broad</b> <b>bands</b> in the plane of the section with equally <b>broad</b> <b>bands</b> arranged perpendicularly, a structure similar to, if not identical with, that in my octopus sample. The evidence appears unmistakable that the St. Augustine sea monster was in fact an octopus, but the implications are fantastic. Even though the sea presents us from time to time with strange and astonishing phenomena, the idea of a gigantic octopus, with arms 75 to 100 feet in length and about 18 inches in diameter at the base—a total spread of some 200 feet—is difficult to comprehend.|$|R
