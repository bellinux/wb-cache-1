50|$|Flexible {{corrugated}} {{synthetic rubber}} hoses {{are used to}} connect the mouthpiece {{to the rest of}} the breathing circuit, as these allow free movement of the diver's head. These hoses are corrugated to allow greater flexibility while retaining a high resistance to collapse. The hoses are designed to provide low resistance to flow of the breathing gas. A single <b>breathing</b> <b>hose</b> is used for pendulum (push-pull) configuration, and two hoses for a one-way loop configuration.|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{permeation}} {{of breathing}} hoses used with supplied air respirators {{has largely been}} neglected. This study investigates the long-term permeation of methylethyl ketone (MEK), Turco paint stripper, aviation fuel and diesel through the wall of Arbin Rinba brand <b>breathing</b> <b>hose.</b> The testing used a new, simple test method that involves filling a short length of <b>breathing</b> <b>hose</b> with the chemical. While the MEK and components of the MEK permeated in a few hours, it took several weeks for significant permeation of the aviation fuel and diesel. The main implication of this work is that hoses need to be kept clean, as chemicals like MEK and Turco that permeate easily can contaminate the breathing air, while chemicals that permeate more slowly, like aviation fuel and diesel, show a potential for significant permeation if the <b>breathing</b> <b>hose</b> is stored contaminated. These findings affect the selection, service life and maintenance of breathing hosesNo Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has {{undertaken}} a collaborative {{study with the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to determine how well self-contained self-rescuers (SCSRs), deployed in accordance with Federal regulations (30 CFR 75. 1714), withstand the underground coal mining environment with regard to both physical damage and aging. Apparatus tested included the CSE SR- 100, the Draeger OXY-K Plus, the MSA Life-Saver 60, and the Ocenco EBA 6. 5 and M- 20. This report presents findings regarding laboratory-tested SCSRs in the tenth phase of testing, from July 2004 to March 2006. The SCSRs were tested on a breathing and metabolic simulator and on a human subject walking on a treadmill. The tests performed {{in this study are}} not the tests used for certification (Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 84). The tests performed in this study continue until the apparatus are empty to enable comparison of new versus deployed apparatus. The method for obtaining deployed SCSRs for this evaluation was not a random selection from the deployed population of SCSRs. We sought older apparatus with visible environmental impact rather than newer apparatus, and we attempted to sample a wide range of deployment modes. Although the results of these tests are useful for observing performance of the tested SCSRs, they are not representative of all deployed SCSRs. This report is the last of 10 report phases begun in 1982. Previous reports describe phases 1 through 9 [Kyriazi et al. 1986; Kyriazi and Shubilla 1992, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006] A new evaluation protocol, with revised sampling strategies, test methods, and reporting procedures, is currently being designed to enhance the applicability of the results. The results of these studies suggest that the large majority of SCSRs that pass their inspection criteria can be relied upon to provide a safe level of life support for mine escape purposes. However, the storage and handling in the mining environment seems to have caused performance degradation in some of the apparatus. In this phase, phase 10, we found some CSE SR- 100 s (93 tested) that exhibited high CO 2 levels, stuck-together breathing hoses, starter-O 2 failure, <b>breathing</b> <b>hose</b> punctures and tears, high breathing pressures, and loose particulates in the <b>breathing</b> <b>hose.</b> The loose particulates caused coughing in human-subject tests. One MSA Life-Saver 60 (20 tested) in this phase had a stuck-open relief valve. One Ocenco EBA 6. 5 (50 tested) had an unattached O 2 supply hose. An unexplained phenomenon occurred with two Ocenco M- 20 s (20 tested) : low O 2 flow rates preventing their successful use. Almost all of the failures noted involved units that failed their inspection criteria...|$|E

5000|$|The early DESCO {{full-face}} mask's twin <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses</b> {{entered through}} the skirt at the sides, {{level with the}} lower end of the nose, pointing backwards and a bit downwards, to keep the breathing tubes shorter to reduce the risk of snagging.|$|R
25|$|A {{non-return}} valve is usually fitted to the <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses</b> where they {{connect to the}} mouthpiece. This prevents any water that gets into the mouthpiece from going into the inhalation hose, and ensures that once it is blown into the exhalation hose that it cannot flow back. This slightly increases the flow resistance of air, but makes the regulator easier to clear.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{configuration}} {{which does}} not appear to have become popular is the integrated harness and storage container. These units comprise a bag which contains the buoyancy bladder and the cylinder, with a harness and regulator components which are stored in the bag and unfolded to the working position when the bag is unzipped.Some military rebreathers such as the Interspiro DCSC also store the <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses</b> inside the housing when not in use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} unit provides a simple [...] (DSV) with mouthpiece, but an optional DSV {{connects to the}} Dräger Panorama full-face mask using the standard Dräger P-port connection system which is also used for the connections between the <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses</b> and counterlungs, and between the counterlungs and scrubber canister. The back mounted scrubber has axial flow, and has an auxiliary P-port on the base, {{which can be used}} to connect an optional oxygen monitor cell.|$|R
50|$|The diver {{breathes}} {{from the}} rebreather circuit through a bite-grip mouthpiece or an oro-nasal mask {{which may be}} part of a full-face mask or diving helmet.The mouthpiece is connected {{to the rest of the}} rebreather by <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses.</b> The mouthpiece of a diving rebreather will usually include a shutoff valve, and may incorporate a dive/surface valve or a bailout valve or both. On loop configured rebreathers the mouthpiece is usually the place where the non-return valves for the loop are fitted.|$|R
50|$|Resistive work of {{breathing}} {{is the sum}} of all the restrictions to flow due to bends, corrugations, changes of flow direction, valve cracking pressures, flow through scrubber media, etc., and the resistance to flow of the gas, due to inertia and viscosity, which are influenced by density, which is a function of molecular weight and pressure. Rebreather design can limit the mechanical aspects of flow resistance, particularly by the design of the scrubber, counterlungs and <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses.</b> Diving rebreathers are influenced by the variations of work {{of breathing}} due to gas mixture choice and depth. Helium content reduces work of breathing, and increased depth increases work of breathing.|$|R
50|$|All {{the stages}} {{of this type of}} {{regulator}} are in a large valve assembly mounted directly to the cylinder valve or manifold, behind the diver's neck. Two large bore corrugated rubber <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses</b> connect the regulator with the mouthpiece, one for supply and one for exhaust. The exhaust hose is used to return the exhaled air to the regulator, to avoid pressure differences due to depth variation between the exhaust valve and final stage diaphragm, which would cause a free-flow of gas, or extra resistance to breathing, depending on the diver's orientation in the water. In modern single-hose sets this problem is avoided by moving the second-stage regulator to the diver's mouthpiece. The twin-hose regulators came with a mouthpiece as standard, but a full-face diving mask was an option.|$|R

50|$|Located an hour {{north of}} Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast, Weeki Wachee Springs hosts its famous mermaid {{show in the}} natural springs there. In 1946, Newton Perry, a former U.S. Navy man who trained SEALS to swim {{underwater}} in World War II, scouted out Weeki Wachee as a good site for a new business. The spring was full of old rusted refrigerators and abandoned cars. The junk was cleared out and Newt experimented with underwater <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses</b> and invented a method of breathing underwater from a free-flowing air hose supplying oxygen from an air compressor, rather than from a tank strapped onto the back. With the air hose, humans could {{give the appearance of}} thriving twenty feet underwater with no breathing apparatus. An 18-seat theater was built into the limestone, submerged six feet {{below the surface of the}} spring, so viewers could look right into the water.|$|R
50|$|An Irish {{fire brigade}} attends {{a wide variety}} of incidents, {{spanning}} from fire calls to flooding incidents to extrication of trapped victims at road incidents. This means that {{a wide variety of}} equipment is carried on the first-turnout appliance (ladders, <b>hose,</b> <b>breathing</b> apparatus and extrication equipment as well as a vehicle mounted pump and an 1800-litre water tank), whilst more specialised vehicles - water tankers, rescue tenders, high reach appliances etc. - are stationed at strategic locations.|$|R
50|$|There is {{controversy}} over {{the invention of the}} first single hose regulator. The invention was motivated by an effort to bypass Aqua-Lung's patent on the double hose regulator. This patent involved the return of exhaust gas to the regulator to reduce the differential pressure and therefore reduce work of <b>breathing.</b> The single <b>hose</b> regulator accomplishes this by relocating a portion of the regulator to the point of exhaust, rather than routing the exhaust back to the regulator.|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) National Personal Protec-tive Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{conduct a}} Long Term Field Evaluation (LTFE) program to {{evaluate}} deployed self-contained self-rescuers (SCSRs). The {{objective of the}} program is to evaluate how well SCSRs endure the under-ground coal mining environment with regard to both physical damage and aging when they are deployed in accordance with Federal regulations (30 CFR 75. 1714). This report presents ?ndings of the combined eighth and ninth phases of the LTFE. For these phases, over four hundred SCSRs were evaluated. The units tested include the CSE SR- 100, Draeger Oxy K-Plus, MSA Life-saver 60, and the OCENCO EBA 6. 5. The OCENCO M- 20 was evaluated only in Phase 9. Testing was per-formed between December 2000 and April 2004. Results of the evaluation indicate that all SCSRs experience some performance degradation due to the mining environment. Observed degrada-tion varies from elevated levels of carbon dioxide, high breathing resistance, and reduced capacity. Mechanical degradation to the SCSR components included <b>breathing</b> <b>hoses,</b> chemical beds, outer cases and seals. The LTFE tests discussed in this report are different from tests performed for SCSR certi?cation to the requirements of 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 84 (42 CFR, Part 84). LTFE tests reported here are conducted to an end point, oxygen depletion, to enable comparison of the duration of new and deployed SCSRs. The method for obtaining deployed SCSRs for this evalua-tion was not a random selection from the deployed population of SCSRs. Although the results of these tests are useful for observing performance of the tested SCSRs, they are not representative of all deployed SCSRs. A new evaluation protocol, with revised sampling strategies, test methods, and reporting procedures, is currently being designed to enhance the generalizability of the results. This program will be implemented following completion of Phase 10 of the current LTFE protocol...|$|R
50|$|The pneumofathometer hose has {{a smaller}} bore than the main <b>breathing</b> gas <b>hose</b> of the umbilical, {{but it is}} {{connected}} to the same gas supply at the gas panel, and {{can be used as a}} secondary route for surface supplied breathing gas for the diver if the main hose malfunctions. The open end of the pneumo hose can be inserted under the neck seal of the helmet or the face seal of a full-face mask, unless the helmet is sealed to the suit to prevent contamination by a hazardous environment. This is colloquially known as pneumo-breathing, and is a useful adjunct to the bailout set, as the gas supply is less limited. Pneumo-breathing may be used during the exit from a dive aborted after main gas hose failure as it allows the emergency gas supply to be conserved in case of a further failure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spring was}} named [...] "Weeki Wachee" [...] by Seminole Indians, which means [...] "Little Spring" [...] or [...] "Winding River" [...] in their language. The {{attraction}} {{was created in}} 1947 by stunt swimmer and attraction promoter Newt Perry, who based the show on underwater air <b>hose</b> <b>breathing</b> techniques. First an 18-seat theater, then later a newer theater with a capacity of 50, were embedded in the lime rock of the spring with viewing windows {{below the surface of}} the water, to allow visitors to watch the mermaids perform in the spring. In 1982, Buccaneer Bay was opened with water slides, a lazy river, and a white sand beach for visitors to enjoy alongside the theater with the mermaid shows.|$|R
