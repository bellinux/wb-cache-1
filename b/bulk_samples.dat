25|$|To date, {{the highest}} proton {{conductivity}} achieved for a MOF electrolyte is 4.2 x 10−2 S/cm at 25°C under humid conditions (98% RH), which is competitive with Nafion. Some recent experiments have even successfully produced thin-film MOF membranes {{instead of the}} traditional <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> or single crystals, which is crucial for their industrial applicability. Once MOFs are able to consistently achieve sufficient conductivity levels, mechanical strength, water stability, and simple processing, they {{have the potential to}} play an important role in PEMFCs in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E
40|$|Single―phase In 4 Se 3 powders were {{synthesized}} by a sonochemical method {{combined with}} subsequent deoxidizing heat―treatment, and a <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> was prepared via a spark plasma sintering (SPS) method. The phase composition, microstructures and thermoelectric transport {{properties of the}} as―prepared <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> were studied. The <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> possesses refined crystalline and obvious anisotropy observed in the different directions, where {{a large number of}} fine layered structures exist along the SPS pressing direction. Therefore, the thermoelectric properties of the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> also show significant anisotropy. Owing to higher Seebeck coefficient and lower thermal conductivity, a better ZT is achieved in direction of the SPS pressure compared with the perpendicular direction. As a result, the maximum ZT reaches 0. 56 at 700 K, which is comparable with that of the samples synthesized by other physical techniques...|$|R
40|$|Niobium {{produced}} by {{chemical vapor deposition}} is compared to a <b>bulk</b> niobium <b>sample</b> (RRR= 500). We report our measurements of impurity concentrations, values of Tc and magnetization vs. H near Hc 1. X-ray measurements, taken before and after vacuum furnace annealing, indicated a greater reduction in the lattice constant (due to annealing) of the CVD sample than for the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample.</b> Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS), in combination with x-ray diffraction revealed the CVD sample had approximately 3 at. % hydrogen; seven times more hydrogen than the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample.</b> After annealing, the impurity concentrations in the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> were measured by commercial interstitial gas analysis (IGA). A precise comparison of nearby x-ray Bragg reflections with known single crystals of silicon and sapphire revealed several unsuspected features of these samples, including a possible dependence of the lattice constant on depth within a few microns of the surface and significant surface damage. Magnetic moment measurements in the superconducting state indicate sharp NC-SC transitions with Tc= 9. 26 K for the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> and Tc= 8. 88 K for the CVD sample. The difference of 0. 38 +/- 0. 03 K persisted after annealing the CVD sample. At 1. 9 K, Hc 1 (CVD) was equal to Hc 1 (bulk) or even perhaps slightly higher, while Hc 2 was 5100 - 6200 Oe for CVD and 3950 Oe for the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> (as expected for pure Nb). The impurity content in the CVD, as inferred from comparative SIMS and IGA analysis of the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> would not account for these differences, which are conjectured {{to be due to}} permanent defects caused by cooling the high hydrogen content of the CVD sample initially...|$|R

25|$|Several {{strategies}} {{exist for}} constructing homochiral MOFs. Crystallization of homochiral MOFs via self-resolution from achiral linker ligands {{is one of}} the way to accomplish such a goal. However, the resulting <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> contain both enantiomorphs and are racemic. Aoyama and coworkers successfully obtained homochiral MOFs in the bulk from achiral ligands by carefully controlling nucleation in the crystal growth process. Zheng and coworkers reported the synthesis of homochiral MOFs from achiral ligands by chemically manipulating the statistical fluctuation of the formation of enantiomeric pairs of crystals. Growing MOF crystals under chiral influences is another approach to obtain homochiral MOFs using achiral linker ligands. Rosseinsky and coworkers have introduced a chiral coligand to direct the formation of homochiral MOFs by controlling the handedness of the helices during the crystal growth. Morris and coworkers utilized ionic liquid with chiral cations as reaction media for synthesizing MOFs, and obtained homochiral MOFs. The most straightforward and rational strategy for synthesizing homochiral MOFs is, however, to use the readily available chiral linker ligands for their construction.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{experimental}} setup, X-rays are {{released from the}} particle beam by an undulator; a high-resolution monochromator produces a beam with small energy dispersion (typically 1.0 meV). The sample is irradiated with photons chosen around the resonance of the Mössbauer isotope and further information is provided for the specific isotope. Typical parameters for {{the experimental}} scan are –20 meV below recoil-free resonance energy to +100 meV above it. The number of scans (often recorded for 5 seconds every 0.2 meV) depends {{on the amount of}} Mössbauer-active nuclei in the sample. [...] The number of photons absorbed by the sample at any wavelength are measured by detecting the fluorescence emitted from the excited atom with an avalanche photodiode detector. The resulting raw spectrum contains a high-intensity resonance at corresponds to the nuclear excited state of the probed nucleus.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to {{study the effects of}} two cycles of pedigree selection in improving days to heading, 1000 -grain weight and grain yield/plant in two segregating populations of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Two cycles of pedigree selection for the days to heading, 1000 -grain weight and grain yield/plant were practiced in two segregating populations of wheat in the F 3 -F 5 generations. Highly significant differences among F 3 families in both populations and sufficient genotypic coefficients of variation were observed for all studied traits. Estimates of realized gains showed that heading date were earlier by 4. 10 and 6. 91 % for populations I and II, respectively, than the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> after the two cycles of selection. Grain weight increased 14. 72 and 6. 43 % for populations I and 8. 01 and 1. 68 % for populations II over the better parent and the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample,</b> respectively, after two cycles of selection. Selection also improved grain yield/plant in both populations over the better parent and the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> by 12. 20 and 3. 37 % for populations I and 7. 93 and 1. 60 % for populations II, respectively. In population I, one family (No. 26) yielded 17. 21 % more and was 4. 42 % earlier than the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample.</b> In population II, the best selected family (No. 82) was common to the three selection criteria and outyielded the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> by 15. 32 %, was earlier by 2. 73 % and produced 9. 10 % heavier grain weight. Single trait selection proved to be an efficient selection method for improving both studied populations.

40|$|Aim: The gray mullet, Mugil cephalus, {{has been}} farmed in semi-intensive ponds with tilapia and carps in Egypt for years. The current study used the {{fluorescent}} amplified fragment length polymorphism (F-AFLP) technique {{to search for}} genetic differences between the populations of M. cephalus in the northern region of Egypt and to detect the gene flow between sampled locations and the homogeneity within M. cephalus genetic pool in Egypt. Materials and Methods: To fulfill the study objectives 60 (15 /location) samples were collected from four northern coast governorates of Egypt (Alexandria “sea,” Kafr El-Sheikh “farm,” Damietta “farm” and Port Said “sea”). Three replicates of bulked DNA (5 samples/replicate) for each location were successfully amplified using the standard AFLP protocol using fluorescent primers. DNA polymorphism, genetic diversity, and population structure were assessed while positive outlier loci were successfully detected among the sampled locations. Based on the geographical distribution of sampling sites, the gene flow, the genetic differentiation, and correlations to sampling locations were estimated. Results: A total of 1890 polymorphic bands were scored for all locations, where 765, 1054, 673, and 751 polymorphic bands were scored between samples from Alexandria, Kafr El-Sheikh, Damietta and Port Said, respectively. The effective number of alleles (ne) for all <b>bulked</b> <b>samples</b> combined together was 1. 42. The expected heterozygosity under Hardy–Weinberg assumption (He) for all <b>bulked</b> <b>samples</b> combined together was 0. 28. <b>Bulked</b> <b>samples</b> from Damietta yielded the lowest ne (1. 35) and the lowest He (0. 23) when inbreeding coefficient (FIS) = 1. <b>Bulked</b> <b>samples</b> from Kafr El-Sheikh scored the highest ne (1. 55) and the highest He (0. 37). <b>Bulked</b> <b>samples</b> from Alexandria scored 1. 40 for ne and 0. 26 for He, while <b>bulked</b> <b>samples</b> from Port Said scored 1. 39 for ne and 0. 26 for He. The observed <b>bulked</b> <b>samples</b> formed three sub-population groups, where none {{is limited to a}} certain sampling location. A high differentiation among locations was detected, however, is not fully isolating the locations. Gene flow was 0. 58. Positive outliers loci (117) were detected among the four sampled locations while weak significant correlation (r= 0. 15, p= 0. 03) was found for the distance between them. Conclusion: Even though this species is cultivated in Egypt, the wild population is still present and by the current study a flow of its genes is still exchanged through the northern coast of Egypt. Which contribute to the cultivated populations leading to heterogeneity in its genetic pool and consequently affects the production consistency of M. cephalus in Egypt. ...|$|R
