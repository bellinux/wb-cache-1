5|$|The <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> {{suspension}} and electrics of the GM Zeta platform have been thoroughly reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and fuel efficiency. Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{introduced}} the all-new VT Commodore in 1997, {{the outcome of}} a A$600million development programme that spanned more than five years. The new model featured a rounded exterior <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> improved dynamics and many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, a stronger body structure increased crash safety. The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.|$|E
5|$|Jensen {{was able}} to take on {{production}} of the Tiger because its assembly contract for the Volvo P1800 had recently been cancelled. An additional factor in the decision was that Jensen's chief engineer Kevin Beattie and his assistant Mike Jones had previously worked for Rootes, and understood how the company operated. The first of 14 Jensen-built prototypes were based on the Series IV <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> which became available at the end of 1963.|$|E
50|$|The Zagato factory {{still had}} two spare <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> left over after {{producing}} the Sanction II Zagatos. In 1992 Richard Williams approached the executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda LTD, Walter Hayes and sought {{approval for the}} spare <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> {{to be used to}} create two further 'Sanction' cars. Walter Hayes gave his approval and the <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> along with two neglected Aston Martin DB4's (chassis' DB4/0334/R and DB4/0424/R) were completed into a pair of Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato Sanction IIIs in 2000.|$|R

5|$|Holden's {{most popular}} car to date, the Commodore, was {{introduced}} in 1978 as the VB. The new family car was loosely based on the Opel Rekord E <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> but with the front from the Opel Senator grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia. However, some of the compromises resulting from {{the adoption of a}} design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers. With the abandonment of left-hand drive markets, Holden exported almost 100,000 Commodores to markets such as New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Malta and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|The basic 1969 <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> saw a major {{facelift}} in 1971 bracketed by minor detail revisions in the 1970 and 1972 model years.|$|E
25|$|This {{would be}} the final year for the B-bodied, {{full-sized}} Grand Prix. The 1969 GP would feature a dramatic new <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> atop a chassis based on the smaller Pontiac A-body intermediates.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 20 <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> and chassis {{units were}} made. The last was {{recorded}} in 1968.|$|R

25|$|The first {{accident}} involving R62As {{happened in}} the summer of 1985 when 1687's carbody was badly damaged at the Bombardier plant prior to delivery; this car was repaired with a new <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> and entered service on December 1, 1987, on the 6 train.|$|E
25|$|Both the Cobra Mk IV and the Ace were made, {{and soon}} a 'CRS' {{version of the}} Mk IV was {{announced}} with a carbon fibre <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> a 212 S/C version with Lotus twin turbo V8 power, {{as well as the}} AC Superblower with a supercharger Ford V8. Two Aceca coupes (in closed version of the Ace) were also made.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{shape of}} the car was designed by Oscar Jankovits, probably inspired by contemporary aerodynamic theories such as Paul Jaray's,and built at the Jankovits garage between 1935 and 1937. It was a barchetta with central driving position, with fully integrated wings (ponton styling). The <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> was streamlined to minimise turbulence in the air flow, fully enveloping the underbody and integrating door handles and lights.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to body kits for the models above, other <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> were available separately. These came with matching body kits, controller steering wheels and compatible drive shafts.|$|R

25|$|Volkswagen {{vehicles}} built off different platforms {{have carried}} the Polo name plate. For example, the Volkswagen Polo Playa hatchback sold in Southern Africa {{in the late}} 1990s was a rebadged SEAT Ibiza which has a different <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> from the Mark III Polo sold in Europe at the same time. The current saloon is only available in China, Latin America and South Africa and other Southern Africa countries.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Carroll Shelby International and AC Motor Holdings, Ltd. {{announced}} {{production of}} an authentic Shelby/AC Cobra, {{with the production}} vehicle arriving at dealers in July 2004. Initially, available models included Shelby AC 427 S/C Cobra and Shelby AC 289 FIA Cobra, which would be branded as the CSX 1000 and CSX 7500 Series, respectively. In February 2004, the first handcrafted aluminum <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> was built at Frimley works.|$|E
25|$|Due to the typically-generous {{clearances}} on California railroads due {{to freight}} railroads expanding clearances to accommodate double-stacked containers, bilevel cars {{are common in}} the state. The California Department of Transportation owns 88 California Cars, {{which are based on}} the Superliner <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> but with high-density interiors suitable for corridor trains. These cars, along with 39 owned directly by Amtrak, are dedicated to state-subsidized Amtrak California routes including the San Joaquin, Capitol Corridor and Pacific Surfliner routes.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, the California Highway Patrol {{placed a}} large fleet order for Century 2-door sedans, a body style {{unavailable}} {{to the general}} public. It combined the Special 2-door sedan <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> with Century powertrain and trim. Broderick Crawford was shown driving a 2-door Century sedan during the first season of his popular syndicated TV series Highway Patrol. (In later seasons he'd drive a four-door Century, like his real life counterparts in the California Highway Patrol.) Power brakes were optional. Tubeless tires were new.|$|E
25|$|In May 1995, {{the general}} {{exterior}} {{design of the}} E46 by Erik Goplen was approved {{and as a result}} DesignworksUSA was contracted by BMW to work alongside BMW Group's in-house design team to create the exterior body work for the 3 Series range in February 1996. Based on the E36 <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> the design team put an emphasis on improving aerodynamics and increasing the car's aggressive stance. Design patents were filed in Germany on 16 July 1997 and in the US on 16 January 1998.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of 1960, the factory {{employed}} forty-three workers, the Grantura Mk1 production was ending (with a total of 100 cars produced), and the Mk2 <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> design was nearly ready. TVR had distributors selling cars in the UK, including David Buxton Ltd. in Derby and Bill Last in Woodbridge, Suffolk. In January 1961, Keith Aitchison and Bryan Hopton (of the Aitchison-Hopton Lotus/TVR dealer in Chester) expressed interest in investing in TVR. During the summer, Bernard Williams attempted to cement their interest by offering a Climax-powered Grantura Mk2 to the two men for a drive to the Monza circuit in Italy. During the trip, {{a portion of the}} exhaust system fell off the car on two separate occasions, but the two men were nonetheless impressed with the car's performance.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 and 1996 {{stocks have}} similar <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> but they use {{different}} AC traction control systems. The 1995 stock system is more modern, since the 1996 stock design specification was frozen in 1991.|$|R
25|$|The company between 2007-2010 {{produced}} 1,002 R160A New York City subway cars at its {{manufacturing plant}} in Hornell, New York, while the <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> were built at their Lapa plant, in São Paulo, Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the Milan tram network, {{although}} reduced, {{was still}} modernized. In 1971, new high capacity series 4800 Jumbotrams entered service. [...] Their construction had involved the joining together of <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> of older trams.|$|R
25|$|The bass type, {{similarly}} to the theorbo and other baroque lutes, has a vaulted <b>body</b> (<b>shell)</b> constructed of separate ribs, a flat soundboard {{with either a}} carved rose or one which is inset into the soundhole, and a bridge (without a saddle) consisting of a wooden bar acting as a string-holder glued to the soundboard. Unique to this instrument is the neck, which is long enough to allow for ten to 12 tied gut frets. The pegbox is either straight and set at a sharp angle to the neck (much like a lute pegbox), or gently curving and set at a shallow angle, either case being fitted with laterally-inserted tuning pegs (although sometimes a flat pegboard with sagittal pegs is found). The strings were of gut and are strung either singly or, especially on Italian instruments, in double courses. However, on German-made instruments, the first course (highest in pitch) is usually single (a chanterelle) and often has its own separate raised peg rider/holder attached to the pegbox. The number of courses varies from six to eight. Open string lengths tend to be fairly long (6272cm) on German instruments, but shorter (5565cm) on late Italian ones, probably because they tended to be tuned to a higher pitch.|$|E
500|$|Exterior styling was led {{by design}} {{director}} Scott Strong, then chief designer for Ford Australia. After Strong departed from operations at Ford in 2001, Simon Butterworth took over this role. Ford Australia's intention {{was to create a}} European influence for the vehicle, whereby most aspects of the AU's [...] "New Edge" [...] design would be revised. The result was a significant update of the existing AU <b>body</b> <b>shell,</b> rather than a completely new design. The BA model introduced an integrated aerial in the car's rear window, instead of the conventional retractable antenna. The aerial placement improved the vehicle's aerodynamics and ended the breakage issues that had plagued the retractable type found on previous models. Interestingly, interference from the engine did not affect the radio reception.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark V, {{launched}} in 1984, introduced [...] brake discs and plastic wheel arches (mini special arches) but retained the same Mark IV <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> shape.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the company {{split into two}} {{manufacturing}} groups, Microplas and Chrisidon Marine Limited. Microplas continued to produce <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> and later plastic pipes, while Chrisidon Marine manufactured the boats, by now renamed Microplus.|$|R
