25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren heard the sound of the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett's flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. The dark night hid the size of <b>Bartlett's</b> <b>force</b> from close scrutiny.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle at}} Lake Providence {{was meant to}} be in {{conjunction}} with Confederate attacks against Union supply depots at Young's Point and Milliken's Bend ordered by Confederate General Richard Taylor on June 7. However the Confederate commander, Lt. Col. Frank Bartlett set out 48 hours behind schedule, building a floating bridge to cross Bayou Macon and pushing on toward the Federal garrison at Lake Providence on June 9. Reid's command was made up of the 13th Texas Mounted Infantry Regiment and the 13th Louisiana Cavalry Battalion. The Union forces were commanded by Brig. Gen. Hugh T. Reid and greatly outnumbered <b>Bartlett's</b> <b>force.</b> Reid's brigade was a mixed command of white soldiers from the 1st Kansas Mounted Infantry and the 16th Wisconsin Infantry and United States Colored Troops from the 8th Louisiana Infantry. Reaching the banks of Lake Providence six miles west of their objective, the Confederate cavalrymen encountered two Companies of the 1st Kansas Mounted Infantry at Bayou Baxter, and Corporal William F. Parker of Company K, 1st Kansas was mortally wounded in the skirmish. <b>Bartlett's</b> <b>force</b> captured nine supply wagons and 36 mules. The Federals withdrew toward the town of Lake Providence, crossing the bridge over the Tensas Bayou before destroying the span. The Kansans took a position along the streambank where they were reinforced by the remainder of their regiment as well as the 16th Wisconsin and the black soldiers of the 8th Louisiana. In spite of a strong Federal presence, Bartlett formed a line of battle supported by artillery and advanced toward Tensas Bayou while a 6-pdr gun was moved into position near the present-day Club House of the Lake Providence Country Club. Confederate Pioneers attempted to rebuild the bridge, but Reid's sharpshooters drove off the artillery and a brief skirmish ensued, in which Second Lieutenant Francis Becker of Company I, 1st Kansas and Sergeant Carlisle McClung of Company F, 13th Texas were killed, and a Lieutenant and two Privates of the 13th Texas were captured. A heavy force of Union skirmishers eventually caused the Confederates to withdraw toward Floyd, Louisiana, after having suffered two men killed, five wounded and three captured. The Federals lost one man killed and another mortally wounded, both from the 1st Kansas Mounted Infantry.|$|R

50|$|Poll {{made his}} directorial debut in 2007 with the teen comedy film Charlie Bartlett. He read screenwriter Gustin Nash's film {{adaptation}} of C. D. Payne's 1993 novel Youth in Revolt and asked director Jay Roach—with {{whom he had}} previously worked on five films—if he had heard of Nash. Roach explained {{that he had been}} slated to direct another of Nash's screenplays, Charlie <b>Bartlett,</b> but was <b>forced</b> to back out of the job on the same day. Roach recommended that Poll take the role as director; Poll then pitched himself to the film's producers and was hired. Poll co-produced Sacha Baron Cohen's 2009 mockumentary film Brüno.|$|R

50|$|A Counterfeit Presentment is a play {{written by}} American author and playwright William Dean Howells in 1877. The play is a {{realistic}} comedy {{and tells the}} story of a chance encounter between a young woman, Constance, and a man whom she mistakes for her ex lover, Bartlett. However, Bartlett is not completely aware of Constance's neurotic behavior until he gets to know her a bit more. Her true personality is only truly expressed after she <b>forces</b> <b>Bartlett</b> to stay with her in the hotel so she can pretend he is her former beau. Howell’s uses comedy to reveal the deeper issue of the plight of unmarried middle and upper class women in the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|Bartlett's party now {{consisted}} of eight Karluk crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the {{family of four}} and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, {{was one of the}} few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. <b>Bartlett</b> sent his <b>forces</b> out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.|$|R
