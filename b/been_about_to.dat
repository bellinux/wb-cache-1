5|$|Hannah Beswick {{was born}} in 1688, the {{daughter}} of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed {{that he was still}} alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.|$|E

It stated that no water from this well entered the public water supply and that a nearby well and pumping station had been closed since the fire as a precaution. The chemical is a known health risk and the UK government had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> ban its use.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1986—the day {{the bodies}} of the {{teachers}} were found and McCarthy was kidnapped—Ann Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish chambermaid, was discovered in Heathrow airport with a Semtex bomb in the false bottom of one of her bags. She had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi, who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, in {{the midst}} of the tug-of-war for the AFL {{television}} rights, PBL announced that National Rugby League games will take precedence on the station over AFL games, a sign that Nine may have <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> give up the race for the rights to a proposed Seven-Ten consortium, which they did, but not without putting in a $780 million dollar bid for the rights.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September, while French and Kitchener were meeting, the British {{fought a}} small {{engagement}} at Néry. The gap between I and II Corps was finally {{closed for the}} first time since 25 August, but GHQ had to be evacuated from Dammartin in a hurry under threat from German cavalry, General Macready being left behind in the confusion and General Robertson having to hastily wrap up in newspaper a leg of mutton he had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> eat.|$|E
25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914 Blythe had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{announce}} his retirement from cricket {{at the end of}} the season. In September, after the season had been brought to a premature close, his retirement was formally announced. Blythe enlisted in the Kent Fortress Royal Engineers (KFE) alongside kent teammates David Jennings, Henry Preston and Claud Woolley. After initial training at Tonbridge he was posted to Gillingham as part of the Territorial Force complement of the KFE. He was promoted to corporal and then sergeant in 1915.|$|E

25|$|On lap 26 Massa {{attempted}} to pass David Coulthard. The two collided; Coulthard {{retired from the}} race with serious damage to his car. Coulthard was irate at Massa after the race for not apologising for the incident. The safety car came out for the second time. Massa retired on lap 29 with Ferrari's first engine failure of the race. Räikkönen, who had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> pit, had to stay out. Despite this he did not pit when the pit was re-opened two laps later, preferring {{to move up the}} field as other drivers pitted.|$|E
25|$|Colin had {{a health}} scare during {{the autumn of}} 1988 {{and for a moment}} it looked like EastEnders might have <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> do an AIDS storyline. The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs of the disease and the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin AIDS was never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give out would be to have its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and fear about AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|E
500|$|Green Goblin was {{voiced by}} Steve Blum.

500|$|There {{had been}} {{significant}} rainfall in the Toronto {{area in the}} two weeks prior to Hazel, so the ground was already saturated. Few people in Canada had any experience with hurricanes, since it was unheard of for them to travel as far north and inland as Toronto. Kennedy also notes that if [...] "Toronto had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> face a blizzard, or was threatened by a 14-inch [...] snowfall, that [...] would have been something understandable. [...] This was different. This was the unknown, the unfamiliar, the totally unexpected crisis. Hurricanes belonged in the tropics." ...|$|E
500|$|Through this passage, Bryan {{maintained}} {{the contrast between}} the common man and the city-dwelling elite. It was clear to listeners as he worked his way through the comparisons that he would refer to the farmer, and when he did, the hall exploded with sound. His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman, whom Bryan cast as a gambler. The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs, and it was several minutes before he could continue. The police in the convention hall, not sharing the enthusiasm for silver, were described by the press (some of whose members were caught up in the frenzy) as standing as if they thought the audience was about to turn on them. When Bryan resumed, his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes. One farmer in the gallery had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> leave rather than listen to Bryan, whom he deemed a Populist; he had been persuaded to stay. At Bryan's words, he threw his hat into the air, slapped the empty seat in front of him with his coat, and shouted, [...] "My God! My God! My God!" ...|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to writing scripts for British television, including Gentry with Roger Daltrey for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adaptation of Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. Lynne Truss, reviewing a repeat {{broadcast of the}} production on Channel 4 for The Times in 1994, wrote that: [...] "Clip-clop is not usually a noise to get upset about. But {{it will be an}} interesting test, today, to go up behind people and whisper 'clip-clop', to find out whether they saw The Woman in Black last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any 'clip-clop' by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing the backs of their necks." [...] The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers Central Independent Television so that they would not think he had rushed it. When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, {{had not been able to}} complete the work due to his age.|$|E

2500|$|As Greif {{entered the}} harbour in Arendal at 08:30, she was spotted from Jo. At the time, Jo had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{set off for}} Lyngør to join the fellow torpedo boats [...] and [...] in order to operate as a group. Norwegian {{neutrality}} rules regulated that since Arendal was not a protected war port, Lieutenant Holthe was required to have orders before opening fire at any intruder. As he had no orders or information to act on, and Jo was in an unfavourable position to attack, the torpedo tubes of the moored naval vessel pointing inland, Lieutenant Holthe refrained from opening fire.|$|E

2500|$|... 15 November 1956 – Annie Sharpe, {{owner of}} the guest house where the Neil Millers died – and {{therefore}} a major witness – died suddenly of [...] "carcinomatosis of the peritoneal cavity" [...] while Hannam and Hewett were in London meeting with the DPP. Adams had diagnosed cancer five days earlier and made a prescription for Sharpe for hyperduric morphine and 36 pethidine tablets. The police were very disappointed: they had had two chances to interview her, and Hannam and Hewett felt she had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> [...] "crack". She was cremated hastily, precluding an investigation into her death.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 article, James O'Neil Spady {{said that}} by Johnson's own criteria, the {{statements}} of witnesses George Wilson and Joe LaRoche ought to be considered credible and as evidence of a developed plot for the rising. Neither slave was coerced nor imprisoned when he testified. Each volunteered his testimony early in the investigation, and LaRoche risked making statements that the court could have construed as self-incriminating. Spady concluded that a group had in fact <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> launch the [...] "rising" [...] (as they called it) when their plans were revealed. Perhaps it was of a smaller scale than in some accounts, but he believed men were ready to take action.|$|E
2500|$|By 4 July 1803, Acasta, again {{under the}} command of Wood, re{{captured}} the Caerwent. Then on 2 October, Acasta captured the French privateer Aventure. [...] The Aventure was out of Bordeaux and carried 20 guns and a crew of 144 men. [...] The Acasta pursued her in the mid-Atlantic for 45 hours, finally bringing her to action and capturing her. [...] Wood also recaptured two prizes, the Royal Edward and the St. Mary's Planter, that Aventure had taken from the Jamaican convoy and whose captains were aboard Aventure. [...] When Acasta intercepted Aventure, she had <b>been</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> take possession of the Jane, before going after a fourth ship of the convoy.|$|E
