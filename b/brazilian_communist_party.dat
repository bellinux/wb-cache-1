[...] On March 27, 1964, he wrote a top secret cable to the US government, urging it to support the coup of Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco with a “clandestine delivery of arms" [...] and shipments of gas and oil, to possibly be supplemented by CIA covert operations. [...] Gordon believed that Goulart, wanting to [...] "seize dictatorial power", was working with the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> [...] Gordon wrote: [...] "If our influence is to be brought to bear to help avert a major disaster here--which might make Brazil the China of the 1960s--this is where both I and all my senior advisors believe our support should be placed.” ...|$|E

Two cables from the U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Lincoln Gordon reveal his suspicions of President Goulart's communist sympathies, and his urging of the CIA to prepare to aid the revolt. The first, dated March 27, 1964, accuses Goulart of actively working with the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> and recommends that the U.S. prepare to support anti-Goulart forces with arms and fuel, especially the General Castello Branco. [...] In the same cable, Gordon mentions that several anti-Goulart groups had approached him {{in the past two years}} about the U.S. supporting a coup. [...] He says that, out of all of them, General Branco was easily the best. [...] In Gordon's opinion, he was the one that the U.S. should put their weight behind. [...] He is very urgent in his message, saying that he is afraid of Brazil becoming, [...] "The China of the 1960's". [...] Finally, he urges for arms to be sent via an unmarked submarine (at night) as soon as possible. [...] In a second cable, sent two days later on March 29, takes a more urgent tone as Ambassador Gordon reports that the situation had [...] "worsened" [...] and [...] "possibly shortened time factors," [...] and advised that [...] "earliest possible action would achieve optimum results." ...|$|E
