5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} {{largely due to}} U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated <b>by</b> <b>refusing</b> to sell crude oil to the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis.

5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted.

In Midnapore, Bengalis took part <b>by</b> <b>refusing</b> to pay the chowkidar tax.

5|$|A {{formidable}} French squadron {{under the}} command of Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois had left Toulon bound for Cadiz to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in Egypt. On 3July they sighted and chased Speedy, and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard to lighten the ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of Desaix, Cochrane struck his colours. He was taken aboard Desaix, where her captain, Christy-Pallière, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments <b>by</b> <b>refusing</b> to accept his sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the Battle of Algeciras Bay from Desaix. He and the crew of Speedy were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.|$|E

Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed.

5|$|Henry did not {{feature in}} the {{starting}} line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. France drew in their first game against Uruguay, and lost 2–0 in their second against Mexico.

In the final group game against host-nation South Africa in which Henry came on as a second-half substitute, France lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the tournament. He then announced his retirement from international football, having won 123 caps and scored 51 goals for Les Bleus, thus finishing his international career as France's all-time top scorer, and second most capped player after Lilian Thuram.|$|E
5|$|In December 1862, Nathaniel P. Banks {{replaced}} Butler {{in command}} at New Orleans. Banks, a Massachusetts Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow <b>by</b> <b>refusing</b> to repeal Butler's order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow {{to return to}} New Orleans {{to take part in}} the planned spring offensive. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the Mississippi River, only Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana held out against federal control. Major General Ulysses S. Grant moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|In May 1998, the United States enacted {{sanctions}} upon India {{as a part}} of {{the international}} response to a series of nuclear weapons tests by India. , these sanctions effectively grounded India's Sea Kings because India could not purchase any US-supplied spare parts for the fleet. Westland also complied with the sanctions <b>by</b> <b>refusing</b> to maintain any US-made components. A limited number of Sea Kings were kept operational by cannibalising other aircraft and the manufacture of some components by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). In December 2000, President Bill Clinton permitted a relaxation of the sanctions. In the late 2000s, HAL and AgustaWestland signed an agreement to jointly maintain and perform upgrades to India's fleet of Sea Kings.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{vulnerability}} to blockade was studied. Using information {{supplied by the}} Board of Trade and the naval attaché in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, {{and many of the}} best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted <b>by</b> <b>refusing</b> insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available.|$|E
5|$|Major riots {{broke out}} in Léopoldville, the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a {{political}} demonstration turned violent. The Force Publique, the colonial gendarmerie, used force against the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the évolué class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test {{the boundaries of the}} colonial system <b>by</b> <b>refusing</b> to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May, tens of {{thousands}} of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet.

According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.|$|E
