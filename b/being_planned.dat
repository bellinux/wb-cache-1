5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel is <b>being</b> <b>planned</b> {{to connect}} northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey.

As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E

5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was <b>being</b> <b>planned</b> in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run. There was some initial support to name it after Roy Chapin, the late president of the Hudson Motor Car Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. On April 23, 1946, the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford and president of the Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943.|$|E
