5|$|State Route 195 (SR 195) was a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California, {{branching}} westward from SR 111 to SR 86 {{near the town of}} Mecca and the Salton Sea. The route formerly extended east to Interstate 10 (I-10) near Joshua Tree National Park as a longer route extending to Blythe and points further east. After the main route was shifted north, the older route remained as an alternate known as <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> Road. The route was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering, although the <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> Road portion was removed as a state highway in 1972. Following the construction of the SR 86 expressway, SR 195 was curtailed in 2009, and removed entirely in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1934, {{the road}} east of Mecca had been paved. The {{western part of}} the road, known as the <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> road, from Mecca to Blythe served as part of US 60 and US 70 until it was {{eventually}} bypassed in favor of a more direct route to Indio, diverging at Shavers' Summit. Between 1934 and 1936, US 60 and US 70 had made the shift north towards Indio, and the portion between US 99 and Mecca was paved. Initial opposition was later overcome after the road was washed out during a storm and forced motorists to take refuge in the nearby foothills. By 1940, the SR 195 designation was signed. In the 1940s, the highway continued due west of Mecca to end at an intersection with US 99, rather than turning south.|$|E
25|$|<b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> {{historical}} site, in Anza Borrego Desert State Park, San Diego County, on Highway S-2, approximately 8.7 {{miles south}} of Highway 78 (Scissors Crossing). (GPS location: N33.0152, W116.4429) Here the Battalion cut a road into the rocky side of a canyon which was otherwise impassable to wagons. Remnants of the road cut into the rock wall are still visible.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "craters," [...] these formations are [...] "erosion cirques" [...] (steephead valleys or <b>box</b> <b>canyons).</b> Craters are formed by the impact of a meteor or volcanic eruption, whereas makhteshim are created by erosion.|$|R

50|$|The season {{returns to}} a similar format {{that was used in}} the Blood Gulch Chronicles, where both teams are in a <b>boxed</b> <b>canyon</b> and do nothing but talk to each other. Also like the first seven seasons of the series, Season 11 {{featured}} no pre-rendered character animation sequences.|$|R
25|$|The rescue {{location}} was 300 miles distant inside North Vietnam, in a <b>box</b> <b>canyon</b> 20 {{miles northeast of}} Nà Sản. The F-4 had been an escort fighter {{for a pair of}} EB-66 electronic countermeasures (ECM) aircraft, and had been shot down by a MiG-21. Kennedy had not yet performed a combat rescue and so received assignment as Jolly High, while Jolly Green 36, piloted by Capt. Oliver E. O'Mara, Jr, was tasked to make the recovery.|$|E
25|$|Combat Shadow 66-0213 (Ditka 03) {{was lost}} when it flew into a {{mountain}} top in eastern Afghanistan on February 13, 2002. Assigned to the 9th SOS, the aircraft was refueling an MH-47E helicopter on a CSAR mission {{when it was}} forced to make an emergency climb in poor visibility to escape a <b>box</b> <b>canyon</b> in the mountainous terrain. The MC-130P ran out of climb performance and crash-landed wheels-up in deep snow. The aircraft was a total loss but the crew of eight survived with relatively minor injuries.|$|E
500|$|The Chetco River begins about [...] east of Chetco Peak, {{approximately}} [...] {{above sea}} level. It flows north, gathering small tributaries {{such as the}} Little Chetco River and Babyfoot Creek. The river turns west near the [...] Pearsoll Peak, the highest point in the watershed. It receives <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> Creek on the , Tincup Creek on the , and Boulder Creek on the left. It then flows south, gathering the South Fork Chetco River. A few miles farther south, the river passes through a Redwood grove. It flows between Bosley Butte {{to the north and}} Mount Emily to the south; the latter is the impact site of one of only four bombs known to have been dropped in the continental United States by an enemy aircraft. This occurred during the Lookout Air Raids of 1942.|$|E
5000|$|Physically, {{the area}} is a dry, austere {{environment}} of multi-colored sandstone, terraces, <b>box</b> <b>canyons</b> and arroyos. Small amounts of piñon and juniper {{can be found in}} the Wilderness, as well as a unique stand of ponderosa pine, the lowest elevation in New Mexico where these trees can be found.|$|R
50|$|A canyon {{may also}} {{refer to a}} rift between two {{mountain}} peaks, {{such as those in}} ranges including the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, the Himalayas or the Andes. Usually a river or stream and erosion carve out such splits between mountains. Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California's Sierra Nevada. Canyons within mountains, or gorges that have an opening on only one side, are called <b>box</b> <b>canyons.</b> Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls.|$|R
50|$|The Sierra Ancha Wilderness is a 20850 acre U.S. {{wilderness}} {{area on the}} Tonto National Forest {{in the state of}} Arizona. The terrain varies from <b>box</b> <b>canyons</b> to high cliffs and pine-covered mountains. Elevations range from lows of about 4000 ft to a high of 7733 ft at Aztec Peak. It is one of two {{wilderness area}}s within the Sierra Ancha mountain range.|$|R
500|$|The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has {{monitored}} the Chetco River for eight different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, nutrients, bacteria, chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals, turbidity, and alkalinity. Streams that exceed the standard level are then {{placed on the}} DEQ 303d list {{in accordance with the}} Clean Water Act. The Chetco from <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> Creek to its mouth exceeded the standard level for temperature and turbidity. The North Fork, South Fork, and other tributaries were also listed for temperature and turbidity. All tributaries of the Chetco usually exceed the [...] temperature standard. Water temperatures range from [...] at Bosley Creek to [...] at Willow Bar. High turbidity levels in the Chetco River watershed are usually caused by landslides, various forms of erosion, and plugged road culverts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{overloaded}} aircraft, nearing Loveland Pass as it flew up Clear Creek Valley, became {{trapped in}} a <b>box</b> <b>canyon</b> {{and was unable to}} climb above the mountain ridges surrounding it on three sides, nor complete a reversal turn away from the sharply rising terrain. At 1:14p.m. MDT, the [...] "Gold" [...] aircraft struck trees on the east slope of Mount Trelease, [...] below its summit, and crashed. The NTSB report stated a belief that many on board survived the initial impact, based on the testimony of survivors and rescuers. The load of fuel on board did not explode immediately, allowing survivors to escape the wreckage, but the passenger cabin was eventually consumed by an explosion before those still alive and trapped inside could escape.|$|E
50|$|The Little Thompson runs 51.5 mi {{from its}} {{headwaters}} to the confluence with the Big Thompson, and descends approximately 2500 ft in elevation in its approximately 24 mi course through the mountains. Its run includes {{at least one}} 15 ft waterfall and numerous granite <b>box</b> <b>canyons.</b> The river had no man-made dams as of 2007. It is managed {{as part of the}} Colorado-Big Thompson project.|$|R
50|$|<b>Box</b> Elder <b>Canyon</b> is {{a canyon}} {{located within the}} western slopes of the Wellsville Mountains, {{a branch of the}} Wasatch Range of the Rocky Mountains in Utah, in the Western United States. It was created by a prehistoric river, which flowed as a {{tributary}} into the main pool of ancient Lake Bonneville, emerging east of present-day Brigham City, Utah. The western or lower mouth of <b>Box</b> Elder <b>Canyon</b> is located approximately 56 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah, via Interstate 15 and U.S. 91. The joint national highway routes of U.S. 89 and U.S. 91 join together at 1100 South Main Street to the west, and enter <b>Box</b> Elder <b>Canyon</b> two miles east of downtown Brigham City.|$|R
50|$|The Piedra River (also {{known as}} El Rio De La Piedra Parada, Pedra, Rio, and Rio Piedre) is a {{river in the}} U.S. state of Colorado. It drains parts of Archuleta, Hinsdale, and Mineral {{counties}} along a mainstem length of about 40 mi. The river flows {{through a series of}} isolated <b>box</b> <b>canyons,</b> emptying into the San Juan River at Navajo Lake. Its name stems from the Spanish word, piedra, meaning rock.|$|R
60|$|Hardly had Shorty {{left the}} place, when a fur-clad man entered through the double storm-doors. His face lighted at sight of Smoke, who {{recognized}} him as Breck, {{the man whose}} boat they had run through the <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> and White Horse Rapids.|$|E
60|$|They {{came to the}} rapids; first, the <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon,</b> and, {{several miles}} below, the White Horse. The <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> was {{adequately}} named. It was a box, a trap. Once in it, {{the only way out}} was through. On either side arose perpendicular walls of rock. The river narrowed to a fraction of its width and roared through this gloomy passage in a madness of motion that heaped the water in the center into a ridge fully eight feet higher than at the rocky sides. This ridge, in turn, was crested with stiff, upstanding waves that curled over yet remained each in its unvarying place. The Canyon was well feared, for it had collected its toll of dead from the passing goldrushers.|$|E
60|$|They drew up to Mrs. Schoville's fat {{wood-burning}} stove, and St. Vincent told of {{the great}} whirlpool in the <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon,</b> of the terrible corkscrew in the mane of the White Horse Rapids, and of his cowardly comrade, who, walking around, had left him to go through alone--nine years before when the Yukon was virgin.|$|E
50|$|A solid chalk mass morphologically {{dominated}} by tabular zones reaching {{an altitude of}} 2,500 m extends from Azilal to Ouarzazate. Here, the contrasting landscapes are similar to Colorado in the United States, with high plateaux, gorges and <b>box</b> <b>canyons,</b> and peaks sometimes splintered by erosion. Several peaks in this area exceed 4000 m, with Jbel Mgoun at 4068 m being the highest peak {{in this part of}} the High Atlas. The area is populated by Berbers.|$|R
25|$|The Negev covers {{more than}} half of Israel, over some 13,000km² (4,700 sq mi) or at least 55% of the country's land area. It forms an {{inverted}} triangle shape whose western side is contiguous with the desert of the Sinai Peninsula, and whose eastern border is the Arabah valley. The Negev has a number of interesting cultural and geological features. Among the latter are three enormous, craterlike makhteshim (<b>box</b> <b>canyons),</b> which are unique to the region; Makhtesh Ramon, HaMakhtesh HaGadol, and HaMakhtesh HaKatan.|$|R
50|$|About 14,000 years ago, as glaciers receded {{from the}} last ice age, the 20000 sq mi Lake Bonneville crested at Red Rock Pass, Idaho, {{creating}} {{what is known as}} the Bonneville Flood. As soft soils eroded at the pass, the lake poured into the volcanic plain of the Snake River and its canyons. Today, visitors to the Snake River area can explore the house-size boulders, <b>box</b> <b>canyons,</b> and other evidence left behind by the tremendous flood. At Swan Falls (now Swan Falls Dam), peak discharge of the flood was an astounding 33 million cubic feet/second.|$|R
60|$|All {{day long}} {{he heard the}} heavy booming blasts and the rumble of {{avalanches}} up in the gorge. Chase's men were dynamiting the cliffs in the narrow <b>box</b> <b>canyon.</b> They were making the dam just as Gale had planned to make it. When this work of blasting was over Belding experienced a relief. He would not now be continually reminded of his and Gale's loss. Resignation finally came to him. But he could not reconcile himself to misfortune for Gale.|$|E
60|$|As {{before we}} {{fell into a}} manzanita thicket and had to crawl. Then we came out upon the rim of a <b>box</b> <b>canyon</b> where the echoes made such a din. It was too steep to descend. We had to head it, and Copple took chances. Loose {{boulders}} tripped me and stout bushes saved me. We knocked streams of rock and gravel down into this gorge, sending up a roar as of falling water. But we got around. A steep slope lay below, all pine needles and leaves. From this point I saw Edd on the opposite slope.|$|E

Now, I've {{been mixed}} up with water all my life,--never can get away from it, it seems,--and the more I'm mixed the less I know about it. St. Vincent knew this, too, and him a clever hand at the paddle; yet he left me to run the <b>Box</b> <b>Canyon</b> alone while he walked around. Result: I was turned over, lost half the outfit and all the tobacco, and then he put the blame on me besides. Right after that he got tangled up with the Lake Le Barge Sticks, and both of us came near croaking." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{lined the}} rough-made boat down the {{mountain}} torrent, nearly losing it a dozen times, and rowed across {{the south end of}} Lake Linderman in the thick of a fall blizzard. Next morning they planned to load and start, squarely into the teeth of the north, on their perilous traverse of half a thousand miles of lakes and rapids and <b>box</b> <b>canyons.</b> But before he went to bed that night, Young Liverpool was out over the camp. He returned to find his whole party asleep. Rousing Tarwater, he talked with him in low tones.|$|R
40|$|The Florida Escarpment is a steep {{carbonate}} cliff {{that separates}} the shallow Florida Platform carbonate province from the deep terrigenous abyssal plain of the Gulf of Mexico. This platform edge has undergone erosion since initial construction during the Mesozoic. Seabeam bathymetry and GLORIA sidescan sonar data are used to define the types of erosion that have shaped this escarpment. ^ The escarpment 2 ̆ 7 s morphology reflects these different erosional styles. North of 27 ∘N, it is covered by Cenozoic sediments that are incised by shallow ravines. South of 27 ∘N, Mesozoic limestone is exposed and is deeply incised by large <b>box</b> <b>canyons.</b> These canyons occur off two basins that underly the western Florida Platform. Offshore of the intervening arches, the escarpment is sculpted by ravines or is terraced along its lower part. ^ Deposits along {{the base of the}} escarpment show an interplay of terrigenous fan deposits and carbonate deposits. The Mississippi Fan sediments comprise large slides and smaller trubidites or debris flows that create a laterally discontinuous facies. Off {{the northern part of the}} escarpment, carbonate gravity flows originating from the ravines form a thin continuous sheet that interfingers with the fan deposits. Erosion of the escarpment is not continuous south of 27 ∘N, as talus deposits, consisting of Mesozoic limestone, are found only at the heads of the <b>box</b> <b>canyons.</b> ^ The different erosional styles appear to be surficial expressions of differences in the geology and/or hydrology of the platform itself. Erosion of the northern part is by the external processes of mass wasting and is limited to the Cenozoic sediment cover. Along the southern part, ground water sapping may play an important roll in the erosion. Undercutting of the cliff by sapping allows exfoliation, rockfall processes, or grain by grain removal to occur. The steep cliffs at the heads of the <b>box</b> <b>canyons</b> are sites where ground water sapping and exfoliation are the dominant process, while the presence of terraces elsewhere along the escarpment suggests that differential weathering of rocks of different lithologies may be the dominant process. The varied erosional styles of this escarpment are best explained by differences in lithology and permeability of the rocks of the basins and arches underlying the platform. ...|$|R

And Old Dan must have found the speed of his best days. Strange he did not bay all down that slope! When Rock and Sue headed the bear then I saw him. He sat up on his haunches ready to fight, but they did not attack him. Instead they began to yelp wildly. I dared not shoot again for fear of hitting one of them. Old Dan just beat the rest of the pack to the bear. Up pealed a yelping chorus. I had never heard Old Dan bay a bear at close range. With deep, hoarse, quick, wild roars he dominated that medley. A <b>box</b> <b>canyon</b> took up the bays, cracking them back in echo from wall to wall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} a reactive robot architecture that uses fast re-planning methods {{to avoid the}} shortcomings of reactive navigation, such as getting stuck in <b>box</b> <b>canyons</b> or in front of small openings. Our robot architecture differs from others in that it gives planning progressively greater control of the robot if reactive navigation continues to fail, until planning controls the robot directly. Our first experiments on a Nomad robot and in simulation demonstrate that our robot architecture promises to simplify the programming of reactive robot architectures greatly and results in robust navigation, smooth trajectories, and reasonably good navigation performance.
