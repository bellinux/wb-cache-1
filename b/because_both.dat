5|$|A {{more modern}} and {{convenient}} competing bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply. There were serious public {{concerns about the}} safety of the bridge by this time, after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors, who did not intervene <b>because</b> <b>both</b> parties had paid their fares.|$|E
5|$|From −125,000 till +125,000 {{there are}} only about ten 243-year series at both nodes {{regarding}} all the transits of Venus in this very long time-span, <b>because</b> <b>both</b> nodes of the orbit of Venus move back and forward in time as seen from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, the colony had a number of {{policies}} regarding Islam and the Muslim communities. The Arabic language and Islamic law were preferred in the colony by the French in the establishment of colonial government, largely <b>because</b> <b>both</b> were codified, and thus easy to standardize.|$|E

5|$|On 23 June 2011, Wilders {{was acquitted}} of all charges. A Dutch court said that his speech was {{legitimate}} political debate, but on the edge. <b>Because</b> <b>both</b> the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.|$|E
5|$|Rajadhyaksha and Willemen, in Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, {{compare it}} to Ramachandran's other films like Malaikkallan (1954) and Madurai Veeran (1956) as they are also Robin Hood-inspired, and because Bhanumathi plays a damsel in {{distress}} in them. The French website Jolpress compared it to Manthiri Kumari <b>because</b> <b>both</b> films feature Ramachandran as a Flynn-inspired hero.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{selection}} to the Gator Bowl was a controversial one. <b>Because</b> <b>both</b> the Gator Bowl and ACC Championship game {{were held in}} Jacksonville, Georgia Tech {{would be forced to}} play two games in Jacksonville in four weeks.

5|$|Terry Sharples, {{a former}} One Nation {{candidate}} who had stood for the Senate in the 1998 election {{as an independent}} candidate, made a similar petition. <b>Because</b> <b>both</b> cases involved constitutional questions, and were substantially identical, they were heard together from 11–13 May 1999.|$|E
5|$|The IWC {{has set a}} {{quota of}} 19 fin whales per year for Greenland. Meat and other {{products}} from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within Greenland, but export is illegal. Iceland and Norway are not bound by the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling <b>because</b> <b>both</b> countries filed objections to it.|$|E
5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and ballistic missiles. The ballistic missiles would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped <b>because</b> <b>both</b> types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting their targets and that the ballistic missiles would need three hours of preparation time.|$|E

5|$|The pair did {{not meet}} in 2012 or 2013, partly <b>because</b> <b>both</b> players {{suffered}} from injury. However, they renewed their rivalry in 2014 with a quarter-final meeting at the Rome Masters, with Nadal winning in three tight sets. The pair met again in the semi-finals of French Open two weeks later, with Nadal winning comfortably in straight sets {{on his way to}} winning his ninth French Open title.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely <b>because</b> <b>both</b> men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished <b>because</b> <b>both</b> disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E

There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Marcus and Earp, but Earp certainly knew her, <b>because</b> <b>both</b> Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E
5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden {{relied on a}} trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. <b>Because</b> <b>both</b> Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. <b>Because</b> <b>both</b> Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly <b>because</b> <b>both</b> {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed <b>because</b> <b>both</b> overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Burnley on 13 December 2005 after {{picking up a}} groin injury, but {{returned to}} Kidderminster for a second loan spell on 7 January 2006. This spell ended on 26 January 2006 so Pugh could concentrate on his career at Burnley, having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster. He learned {{that he would not}} receive a professional contract at Burnley in February 2006, which was partly <b>because</b> <b>both</b> Chris McCann and Kyle Lafferty had both already received professional contracts and they were only second year apprentices.|$|E
