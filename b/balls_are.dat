5|$|Coal balls may {{be found}} in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the {{territory}} of former Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Balls</b> <b>are</b> {{major events}} held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called Commemoration balls; {{the dress code}} is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or {{irregular}} basis, and are usually black tie.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson {{analysed}} North American coal balls. Their {{discovery of}} marine organisms led to classification of coal balls were sorted into three types: normal (sometimes known as floral), containing only plant matter; faunal, containing animal fossils only; and mixed, containing both {{plant and animal}} material. Mixed coal <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> further divided into heterogeneous, where the plant and animal material was distinctly separated; and homogeneous, lacking that separation.|$|E

5|$|In coal seams, coal <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> {{completely}} {{surrounded by}} coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely.|$|E
5|$|The oldest coal balls {{were from}} the early end of the Namurian stage (326 to 313 mya) and {{discovered}} in Germany and former Czechoslovakia, but their ages generally range from the Permian (299 to 251 mya) to the Upper Carboniferous. Some coal balls from the US vary in age from the later end of the Westphalian (roughly 313 to 304 mya) to the later Stephanian (roughly 304 to 299 mya). European coal <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> generally from the early end of the Westphalian Stage.|$|E
5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E
50|$|When a new <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> {{launched}} into the plunger, the player is given {{one of five}} launch awards, which is selected when the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> fired. Unless otherwise noted, the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> launched through the spiral ramp and into the lock hole (above the pop bumpers). Another <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> popped from the left scoop and onto the left inlanes.|$|R
5000|$|Cleaning a <b>ball</b> {{while it}} <b>is</b> in play, except when the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> on the green, for identification, or to {{determine}} if the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> unfit for play (a <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> not unfit simply because it is dirty; however a cut or split may be hidden by dirt).|$|R
2500|$|The {{probability}} that the second <b>ball</b> picked <b>is</b> red depends on whether the first <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> red or white. If the first <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> red then the above formula is used with [...] reduced by one. If the first <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> white then the above formula is used with [...] reduced by one.|$|R
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E
5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E

5000|$|If the cue <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> {{touching}} another <b>ball</b> which <b>is</b> on {{or could}} be on, the referee shall state that the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "touching ball", whereupon the striker must [...] "play away" [...] from the ball without moving it, and—because the touching <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> deemed to be the object ball—without being required to hit another ball. If the object <b>ball</b> moves, it <b>is</b> considered a [...] "push shot" [...] and a foul shall be called. No penalty is incurred for playing away if (1) the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> on; (2) the <b>ball</b> could <b>be</b> on and the striker nominates such ball; or (3) the <b>ball</b> could <b>be</b> on and the striker nominates, and first hits, another <b>ball</b> that could <b>be</b> on. If the cue <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> touching another <b>ball</b> {{which could not be}} on, it isn't called a touching ball, and the striker must play away from it and hit a legally nominated object ball. Where the cue <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> touching several object balls simultaneously, the referee shall state [...] "Touching ball" [...] for each and every such object ball, and indicate to the player which object <b>balls</b> he <b>is</b> referring to. The rules for each individual touching ball then apply simultaneously.|$|R

25|$|The lottery is {{conducted}} with witnesses (from {{the accounting firm}} Ernst & Young) verifying that all fourteen <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> represented once as they are placed in the lottery machine. The <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> placed in the machine for 20 seconds to randomize before the first ball is drawn. The remaining three <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> drawn at 10-second intervals. NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine {{the second and third}} picks. In the event that a combination belongs to a team that has already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. When the first three teams have been determined, the remaining picks are given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assures each team that it can drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position.|$|E
