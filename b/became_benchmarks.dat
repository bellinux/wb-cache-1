5000|$|Upon {{graduating from}} the University of Colorado Mills {{got a job in}} Arizona working for the firm of Lescher and Mahoney. He {{maintained}} his job as a draftsman for Lescher and Mahoney for a short while before being invited to work under Frank Lloyd Wright in 1944. Mills left Taliesin West with his peer Paolo Soleri in 1948. It was also in 1948 that Nora Wood provided Mills and Soleri with their first commission in Cave Creek, Arizona. Their Cave Creek project, also known as the [...] "Dome House", was published in Architectural Forum in 1961 along with R. Buckminster Fuller's and Friedrich Kiesler's works. All of which <b>became</b> <b>benchmarks</b> for young designers to break away from corporate modernism. Essentially, Mills and Soleri became pioneers of the design/build movement that swept North America throughout the next decade. After completing the [...] "Dome House" [...] Mills headed west to San Francisco.|$|E
40|$|Most {{schools in}} {{psychology}} have emphasized individual choice despite evidence of genetic and cultural determinism. It is suggested {{in this paper}} that the rejection of classical behaviorism by psychology and other humanities flowed from deeply held cultural assumptions about volition and free will. While compatibilists have suggested that notions of free will and determinism are not mutually exclusive, the psychological mechanisms by which such an accommodation could be explained have been inadequately explored. Drawing on research into classical cultures, this paper builds an argument {{that the notion of}} free will was adaptive flowing from culturally evolved changes to the self, and that this “evolved self,” containing assumptions of personal volition, continuity, and reason, <b>became</b> <b>benchmarks</b> {{of what it means to}} be human. The paper proposes a model of a culturally evolved self that is compatible with understandings of free will and determinism. Implications for therapeutic practice and future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} urban {{regeneration}} {{has played a}} strategic role {{during the last two}} decades in European and national urban building policies. Current addresses, also defined in Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities in 2007, indentify the necessity to invest in requalification of degraded residential assets and not in new developments, individuating in urban regeneration the main tool for development of contemporary city. Public neighborhoods have developed, historically, a wide set of common problems. They are not only due to wrong planning but also to the concept of “housing for masses”.   The original ambition of modern settlment, developed from GermanSiedlung, was to be an autonomous part, on {{the point of view of}} morphology, in urban expansion. Joined by new developments, a lot of neighborhoods <b>became</b> <b>benchmarks</b> for suburban areas and now we can define themas “new urban centralities”. So theirrole in urbandynamics has changed and they can be individuate dasprecious reserves of public spaces and potential incubators for regeneration of larger areas. Analyzing some Italian and European case studies, themostinnovative relate to the densification of open spaces, inserting new services in a general redesign of green areas; concentration of built surfaces, in order to reduce land consumption and introduction of different residential types in order to improve mischbebauung. The reasons for an active recovery are motivated by the criteria of environmental sustainability and saving land, have relaunched compact projects with medium to highdensity...|$|E
