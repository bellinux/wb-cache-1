25|$|Investigators {{found out}} that when {{pressures}} {{were added to the}} brakes, then there would be an increase in drag force and temperature on the assembly. Examination on the <b>brake</b> <b>assembly</b> of Flight 420 revealed that at the time, the brake assembly's temperature were exposed to a temperature of more than 600 degree Celsius, which may indicated that there was a significant amount of drag force {{at the time of the}} crash.|$|E
25|$|Another {{test was}} {{conducted}} by investigators. This time, they conducted the test to know if hydraulic fluids of Flight 420 would ignite when it contacted the hot surface of the <b>brake</b> <b>assembly.</b> Investigators used two kinds of hydraulic fluids; the contaminated and uncontaminated one. The result was that an intense fire broke out after it contacted with the hot surface. The test also revealed that the contaminated hydraulic fluids have lower ignition point than the uncontaminated one.|$|E

50|$|The {{braking system}} {{consists}} of single disc <b>brake</b> <b>assemblies</b> fitted {{to the main}} gear and operated by a hydraulic system. Brakes are operated by pushing on the top portion of the rudder pedals. It is possible to use differential braking when taxiing and this allows very tight turns to be made.|$|R
25|$|Cracking {{is limited}} mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled {{near the edge}} of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of {{expansion}} in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the unsprung weight of the <b>brake</b> <b>assembly,</b> with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brake rotor}} (or disc) is the {{rotating}} {{part of a}} wheel's disc <b>brake</b> <b>assembly,</b> against which the brake pads are applied. The material is typically grey iron, a form of cast iron. The design of the rotors varies somewhat. Some are simply solid, but others are hollowed out with fins or vanes joining together the disc's two contact surfaces (usually included {{as part of a}} casting process). The weight and power of the vehicle determines the need for ventilated discs. The [...] "ventilated" [...] disc design helps to dissipate the generated heat and is commonly used on the more-heavily-loaded front discs.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the dirt}} tracker, {{it came with}} brakes: a rear disc brake, and in front, a Fontana four leading shoe drum brake, which is two twin leading drum brakes paired {{side by side in}} two drums. The XRTT is the final example of a {{competition}} motorcycle with drum brakes, superseded by disc brakes on all other racing bikes due to the excessive unsprung weight added by the very large drum <b>brake</b> <b>assembly.</b> The official horsepower was never published, but estimates for the early 1972 engines were in the high [...] range, increasing to an estimated [...] or more by 2008.|$|E

25|$|Each train {{consists}} of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going backwards. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked.

2500|$|The {{second round}} of the season, the 2013 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, saw Toyota debut the new 2013 {{specification}} car with one older chassis entered. After a close qualifying session, the updated No. 7 entry ran near the front of the race for the first three hours, before retiring due to overheating brakes {{as a result of a}} malfunctioning energy recovery system. With the rear <b>brake</b> <b>assembly</b> designed to be assisted with certain amounts of mechanical retardation provided by the hybrid recovery system by design, it did not provide the deceleration when malfunctioning, thus overloading the conventional rear brakes. The No. 8 sister car remained in fourth for the rest of the event, closing what was a mixed outcome for the team. Post race, technical director Pascal Vasselon explained that [...] "his team's analysis from Spa showed that the current Balance of Performance significantly favoured Audi's turbo-diesel engine over its own normally-aspirated petrol engine," [...] calling for the ACO and FIA for a more favourable balance of performance to be applied before Le Mans. As agreed at the season's start, theFIAand theACOreviewed the technical regulations at the end of May 2013 to adjust the performance between petrol and diesel LMP1 cars for the rest of the 2013 championship. From Le Mans onward, petrol-engine cars had an additional [...] of fuel capacity.|$|E

25|$|Because the Moke's A-Series engine, {{manual gearbox}} and {{suspension}} are {{identical to those}} of a standard Mini (which was still in production up to October 2000), most spare parts are still readily available. The Moke has no chassis, so the wheels, <b>brake</b> <b>assemblies</b> and suspension are attached to front and rear subframes bolted straight onto the monocoque shell, just as with a standard Mini. Mokes tend to require much structural maintenance {{if they are to}} stay in good running order.|$|R
50|$|In July 1979, Pullman Standard {{informed}} the MTA that the hand <b>brake</b> <b>assemblies</b> for the R46 were problematic. In late July 1979, inspections {{revealed that the}} steel where the car body was joined to the truck was wearing away, a severe safety issue. At the end of 1979, many other flaws were discovered in the R46 fleet, and the Transit Authority filed another US$80 million charge against Pullman Standard {{and a number of}} other subcontractors. This lawsuit invalidated an agreement made with Pullman by executive director John G. DeRoos for US$1.5 million in spare parts to remedy the defects.|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of advanced machine vision techniques for automated inspection is restricted by long development cycles for the inspection software {{and a lack}} of general applicability of the resulting system. These difficulties arise because in the majority of cases the particu-lars of the inspection are embedded in the software structure resulting in severe restrictions on user reconfiguration. This paper describes the structure and major components of an inspection system which is capable of tackling a wide range of inspection problems without repro-gramming. User configurability is based around a simple, interpreted geometric description language which provides support for both dimen-sional and surface quality measurements.

50|$|On 20 May 2013, ET 3309 derailed {{crossing}} Wellington Distant Junction, puncturing {{a hole in}} the floor. It was {{the rear}} car in a two-unit consist operating the 07:43 Porirua to Wellington service, subsequently stranding thousands of morning peak commuters across the network as it blocked both the Kapiti and Hutt Valley lines. All units were temporarily withdrawn after the derailment for urgent safety inspections, but most were back in service for morning peak the next day. Preliminary investigations suggest when one of the unit's spring park <b>brake</b> <b>assemblies</b> was replaced in March 2013, two split pins were not inserted into the bolts securing the assembly to the undercarriage, allowing the assembly to come loose over time and ultimately caused the derailment. Two air reservoir tanks came loose in the accident and pushed the air compressor behind them upwards through the floor, creating the hole.|$|R
5000|$|... 12 June 1975: Air France Flight 193, a Boeing 747-128 (N28888) {{operating}} the sector between Bombay (now Mumbai), and Tel Aviv to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport {{was destroyed by}} fire {{on the ground at}} Bombay's Santa Cruz Airport, following an aborted takeoff. The aircraft's tire on its right-hand main undercarriage had failed while the flight deck crew was executing a 180 degree turn at the beginning of Santa Cruz Airport's runway 27. When the flight deck crew began its takeoff run, another tire failed. At that point the plane's wheels and <b>braking</b> <b>assembly</b> came into contact with the runway, starting a fire. The crew aborted takeoff. The ensuing delay in shutting down the engines, as well as the improper deployment of the airport's fire service, caused the fire to spread, leading to the plane's total destruction.

40|$|Friction induced {{vibrations}} in automotive brakes {{is recognized}} as {{a major problem in}} industry. Squeal is a difficult subject because of its unpredictability caused by a not completely understood sensitivity to variation of the system parameters. In the literature several analytical and numerical studies deal with the relationship between damping and system propensity to have instability. These studies highlight the existence of a nonintuitive effect of damping distribution on modal coupling that gives rise to the unstable vibrations. The complexity of commercial brakes and the difficulties to identify the values of modal damping in <b>brake</b> <b>assemblies</b> lead to the necessity to rely on experimental analysis using simplified test rigs. This paper presents an experimental investigation {{of the relationship between the}} distribution of modal damping and the propensity to develop squeal in a beam-on-disk setup, which reliably reproduces squeal events with easy control and measurement of the damping of the disk and the beam, respectively. The experiments highlight the key role played by the modal damping distribution on squeal: A nonuniform repartition of the modal damping causes an increase of the squeal propensity...|$|R
