6000|$|Mr. Grewgious touched {{himself on}} the breast, and said: ‘I mean us. Therefore, let them have their little discussions and councils together, when Mr. Edwin Drood comes <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Christmas; and then you and I will step in, and put the final touches to the business.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} the truth," [...] said he, in his quiet impassive voice. [...] "I fixed on these lines as a pis aller; and they have done all and more than I wished, by {{bringing}} you <b>back</b> <b>here</b> for <b>at</b> least a moment." ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 7, 2017, as {{some members}} of the U.S. Congress were expressing {{interest}} in meeting with or hearing testimony from Steele, he reemerged after weeks in hiding, appearing publicly on camera and stating, [...] "I'm really pleased to be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> working again <b>at</b> the Orbis's offices in London today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You bet I did. And he'll {{stay there}} for a while. Del Rio rather liked the idea, Russ. All right there. I side-stepped Sanderson on the way <b>back.</b> But over <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the little village--Sampson they call it--I was held up. Couldn't help it, because there wasn't any road around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I have heard," [...] said Forester, [...] "of people {{losing their}} way in the woods, and, after {{a great deal of}} wandering, getting back to the place they started from. So that, possibly, we may wander about all day, and get <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Weston, with a {{strained}} quietness that jarred on her. [...] "In fact, it's scarcely probable that I shall come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all. The game's up. My directors {{have lost their}} nerve. The Grenfell Consolidated must {{go down in the}} next few months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord Wolfenden has evidently {{forgotten}} all about you," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "He left by the back way for the golf course, and I am going to join him there directly. He is not coming <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all. You had better go home, I should think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy that {{is outside}} the question," [...] said Miss Schuyler. [...] "Twice, when every good impulse that is in our kind laid her under compulsion, Hetty warned the man she loved, but at no other time did a word to your {{prejudice}} pass her lips; and if she had spoken it Grant would not have listened. Hetty was loyal, and he treated you with a fairness that none of you merited. You sent the Sheriff a bribe and an order for his arrest, and by inadvertence it fell into his hands. He brought it <b>back</b> <b>here</b> unopened <b>at</b> his peril." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was seen}} with you, yesterday, by a tall, stout old man, {{and had to}} run to save myself. He was not quick enough on his feet to follow me, and he lost me among the trees. I dare not risk coming <b>back</b> <b>here</b> to-day <b>at</b> the same time. I write this, and hide it in the sand, at six in the morning, to tell you so. When we speak next of your wicked husband's Secret we must speak safely, or not at all. Try to have patience. I promise you shall see me again and that soon.--A. C." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at her dresses!" [...] persisted the house-servant, {{waving her}} hand indignantly at the bed. [...] "I'm only a poor girl, but I wouldn't marry {{the best man}} alive without a new gown to my <b>back.</b> Look <b>here!</b> look <b>at</b> this dowdy brown thing here. Alpaca! You're not going to pack this Alpaca thing, are you? Why, it's hardly fit for a servant! I don't know that I'd take a gift of it if it was offered me. It would do for me if I took {{it up in the}} skirt, and let it out in the waist--and it wouldn't look so bad with a bit of bright trimming, would it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} will, Peter," [...] replied Veery. [...] "I wouldn't {{feel that}} I {{was going to}} bed right if I didn't sing until dark. There is {{no part of the}} day I love better than the evening, and the only way I can express my happiness and my love of the Green Forest and the joy of just being <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> home is by singing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you hate it. How can I help knowing it?--and you hate me too; I know you do;--and I believe you would be glad if you need never come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all; I do. Don't, Martha; leave me alone. I don't want all that fuss. There; I can bear it now, {{whatever}} it is. Do you choose to have your tea, Mr. Furnival? or {{do you wish to}} keep the servants waiting out of their beds all night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, I will," [...] {{answered}} the lantern-jawed notary. [...] "Yet I think it most {{unlikely that any}} one who can buy or beg a horse to ride away on should stay in this old city just now, unless indeed, the laws of his order bind {{him to do so}} that he may minister to the afflicted. Well, if the pest spares me and you, to-morrow morning I will be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> this hour to tell you all that I can gather." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Surajah replied. [...] "We {{told you}} we should come <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> unless we got news of some tiger being marked down {{near one of}} the other villages. We have been as far as the edge of the jungle, and {{although}} we have heard of several, not one of them seems to be in the habit of coming back regularly to the same spot; so we thought we could not do better than return <b>here,</b> <b>at</b> once, and make it our headquarters.|$|R

5000|$|In Victory Lane, Kenseth {{was pleased}} at ending his 18-month streak, stating {{that he was}} [...] "glad {{we were able to}} finish this tonight and we had the car to stay ahead at the end", while also stating that [...] "it was a crazy night for sure but it feels good to be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in Victory Lane". In second place was Jimmie Johnson, who {{described}} the race as [...] "a wild night", but praised his team for all their hard work and was [...] "thrilled to get such a great finish <b>here</b> <b>at</b> really one of the tougher tracks for me as a driver".|$|R
6000|$|... "You can see 'em, Muster Fenwick, in course. It don't make no odds about dinner. But I was wanting {{just to say}} a word to {{you about}} that poor young ooman there." [...] This he said in a slow, half-hesitating voice, as though he could hardly bring himself to speak of the unfortunate one to whom he alluded. The Vicar muttered some word of assent, and then the miller went on. [...] "You knows, of course, as how she be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the mill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{along in}} the forenoon," [...] said the old man. [...] "Well, well! I must go my rounds, and so must my wheelbarrow. But I'll be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> dinner-time; for my pig likes a dinner {{as well as a}} breakfast. No meal-time, and no sort of victuals, ever seems to come amiss to my pig. Good morning to you! And, Mr. Holgrave, if I were a young man, like you, I'd get one of Alice's Posies, and keep it in water till Phoebe comes back." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the great, momentous, stupendous {{day of the}} dinner, {{my beloved}} female reader may imagine that Fitzroy Timmins was sent about his {{business}} at an early hour in the morning, while the women began to make preparations to receive their guests. [...] "There will be no need of your going to Fubsby's," [...] Mrs. Gashleigh said to him, with a look that drove him out of doors. [...] "Everything that we require has been ordered THERE! You will please to be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> six o'clock, and not sooner: and I presume you will acquiesce in my arrangements about the WINE?" ...|$|E

We are to have the honour of going on and occupying Berber, and will show {{ourselves}} worthy of it. There is little chance of our meeting the Dervishes. Had they been in Berber, we should have heard of them before this. If we meet them we will fight; and you, Abu, who have the fastest camel among us, will ride <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all speed, and the General and his soldiers will come up to help us.|$|E
6000|$|Helen {{spoke with}} difficulty, her bosom heaving, her eyes fixed in wonder and pain on his face. [...] "No. How could I? You brought them only {{yesterday}} morning; {{they would have}} endangered the whole act." [...] Then, as the indignity, the injustice, the burning shame of his assault forced themselves into her mind, she flamed out in reproach: [...] "Why did you come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all? Why didn't you stay away, as you did before? You are cruel, heartless!" [...] The tears dimmed her eyes. [...] "You've ruined my whole performance. You've broken my heart. Have you no soul--no sense of honor? Go away! I hate you! I'll never speak to you again! I hate you!" [...] And she turned, leaving him dumb and staring, in partial realization of his selfish, brutal demands.|$|E
6000|$|I {{think it}} was a good stroke of luck that knocked me on my <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Napier, instead of some hotel in the centre of a noisy city. Here we have the smooth and placidly-complaining sea at our door, with nothing between us and it but 20 yards of shingle--and hardly a {{suggestion}} of life in that space to mar it or make a noise. Away down here fifty-five degrees south of the Equator this sea seems to murmur in an unfamiliar tongue--a foreign tongue--tongue bred among the ice-fields of the Antarctic--a murmur with a note of melancholy in it proper to the vast unvisited solitudes it has come from. It was very delicious and solacing to wake in the night and find it still pulsing there. I wish you were here--land, but it would be fine! ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{half an hour}} {{she waited}} in the hall, almost without moving, so {{far-reaching}} did this verdict promise to be. Her anxiety deepened into fear as Steele {{came out of the}} room and walked rapidly towards her. [...] "He's a very sick man," [...] he burst forth, irritably. [...] "Get him away from here as quickly as you can--but don't excite him. Don't let him exert himself at all till you reach a lower altitude. Keep him quiet and peaceful, and don't let him clog himself up with starchy food--and above all, keep liquors away from him. He shouldn't have come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all. Brent warned him that he couldn't live up here. Slide him down to sea-level--if he'll go--and take care of him. His heart will run along all right if he don't overtax it. He'll last for years at sea-level." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had a sharp {{fight with}} the smugglers last night, your honour," [...] the sailor said as they started. [...] "We had been {{cruising}} about for two days to the west, and yesterday morning we made out to sea and held east, and at ten o'clock came into Swanage Bay. We came upon the lugger that has fooled us so many times, and for once we caught her napping. They were at work unloading a cargo when we came up, {{and she did not}} make us out until we were within a couple of cables'-length of her, then she slipped and ran; I expect she would have shown us her heels as usual, but we gave her a broadside, and that big spar of hers came down with a run, and we were alongside in no time. They made a tough fight of it, but pretty nigh half her crew were ashore with the kegs. Howsomever we were not long in beating them below, though two or three of our chaps were pretty badly hurt, and three of theirs killed before the scrimmage was over. We did not trouble about the chaps ashore. I expect they were accounted for all right, for we heard some pistol shots there, but we came <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> once with the lugger, and got in two hours ago." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} going on very well. A horrible custom obtains in these parts of asking you to dinner somewhere at half-past two, and to supper somewhere else about eight. I have run this {{gauntlet}} more than once, and its effect is, that there is no day for any useful purpose, and that the length of the evening is multiplied by a hundred. Yesterday I dined with a club at half-past two, and came <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> half-past eight, with a general impression that it was at least two o'clock in the morning. Two days before I dined with Longfellow at half-past two, and came back at eight, supposing it to be midnight. To-day we have a state dinner-party in our rooms at six, Mr. and Mrs. Fields, and Mr. and Mrs. Bigelow. (He is a friend of Forster's, and was American Minister in Paris). There are no negro waiters here, all the servants are Irish--willing, but not able. The dinners and wines are very good. I keep our own rooms well ventilated by opening the windows, but no window is ever opened in the halls or passages, and they are so overheated by a great furnace, that they make me faint and sick. The air is like that of a pre-Adamite ironing-day in full blast. Your respected parent is immensely popular in Boston society, and its cordiality and unaffected heartiness are charming. I wish I could carry it with me.|$|E
