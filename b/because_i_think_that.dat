500|$|Gabrielle Christian first {{auditioned for}} the role of Spencer (then called [...] "Zooey") in July 2004, though Lynch also had her read for Ashley's part. Mandy Musgrave also auditioned {{for the role}} of Spencer, but Lynch liked her {{chemistry}} with Christian, so he paired the two up with Musgrave as Ashley. The pilot was first shot in October 2004 and directed by Rose Troche, but after the series was picked up by The N in January 2005, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters. He said that [...] "I didn't pick [...] up right away, I had her keep re-auditioning. ... I [...] {{to make sure that this}} combination [...] perfect." [...] Her contract was finally picked up in May 2005 and the pilot was re-filmed with the new cast in July. Filming took place in Los Angeles, with a correctional facility used largely as the high school set. Donna Deitch, who directed the second version of the pilot but no subsequent South of Nowhere episodes said that the pilot is [...] "something I'm really, really proud of, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> show has a look, a style to it that really helps". She felt that the style she set suited the material and was [...] "fairly inventive" [...] for a low-budget series.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

In an interview with Complex Magazine, director Gerardo Naranjo {{said that he had}} met Zuniga, but that [...] "I really didn’t want to go into their psyches. I guess the film has a very strong point-of-view, and we refuse to get into the minds of these guys, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what every other movie does… I wanted to live the experience from the point-of-view of an innocent person." ...|$|R

No matter what, I still was gonna make music, even if it was on a small scale. Even if it was just for me." [...] She also said: [...] "I really challenged myself in writing {{the past couple of years}} to be vulnerable in my lyrics. I didn’t want to skate past what was hurting. It didn’t scare me to be vulnerable <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> when you get something great." ...|$|R
500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E

5000|$|Speaking in February 2008 to R&B writer Pete Lewis of {{the award-winning}} Blues & Soul, Cruz {{explained}} {{the reasons for}} the single's club influence: [...] "Because lately I've been going to clubs where they play a lot of electro, it's definitely got a bit of that vibe in there. But, while some people might associate that driving beat with house and dance music, I've also noticed how Timbaland's latest productions on Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears have these new beats with a four-to-the-floor drum pattern too. So, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> where R&B is going, I basically went in that direction while adding an English techno edge that the Americans wouldn't even know about." [...] The music video features Cruz in a very slow car chase. Luciana also makes a guest appearance in the video.|$|R

However, Logan had decided during the middle of the second season that the third season should be the last, and he pitched the third season to Showtime president David Nevins accordingly. They did not release this information until after the final season had completed, as Nevins stated, [...] "given what I knew the ending of Penny Dreadful was going to be felt like a massive spoiler and it felt disrespectful to the experience that people were having with the show." [...] Logan said regarding not releasing the information: [...] "That's what the ending of this series is, it is meant to be a strong, bold, theatrical ending <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what our fans like and to water that down with an announcement or having them know <b>I</b> <b>think</b> would be an act of bad faith." ...|$|R

Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. [...] "I use Correspondence Analysis very much, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality.

King said: [...] "The people who are involved {{in the construction of the}} mosque are refusing to say where their million funding is going to come from." [...] Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, also said: [...] There should be transparency about who those investors are, whether that money is coming from domestic interest or not, and if it's coming from foreign interests we need to know, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a liability, and it shows that there is another agenda rather than domestic security and tranquility.|$|R

[...] While recording her vocals, Rowland was inspired by several singers, citing former bandmate Beyoncé Knowles, and singers Brandy and Whitney Houston as major inspirations, [...] "I listened to a lot of Whitney Houston for her vocals. I love her. I love Beyoncé's voice, and I love Brandy. Those are three vocalists who inspire me. I love how different they are. I love how they take themselves to the next level." ...|$|R

[...] Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is a fair question to be looking at. Palin answered, [...] "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game.

[...] In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer magazine, former guitarist Paul Allender said, [...] "We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out—you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff—we didn't sound anything like that. The way that I see it is that we were, and still are now, an extreme metal band." ...|$|R

These weird things are instilled in us. You know? That tell us that we’re not good enough or that there's only one kind of beauty. This song basically is contradicting that idea. It's saying, 'Well, if the world doesn't like how you look then they should change. They should change their perspective. You don’t have to change yourself.' I mean, I thought that that was important, you know, just to put out next. Especially <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> kind of the direction we're going in, you know, with 'Here'. 'Here' was about not belonging anywhere and 'Wild Things' was about finding a space you belong. Now 'Scars To Your Beautiful' is basically about embracing yourself and finally coming to that conclusion where you feel love and you can love yourself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's cool to put out third <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel like I have a bigger platform now.

The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt.

And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E
