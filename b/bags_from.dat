5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer and other drug addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have a taste of the meth (which he thinks is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple pie. With the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E

By the end of the trip, Ulliott had $742,000 in cash, that he carried around with Whitaker in <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> duty-free. When returning to their casino in Leeds, Ulliott and Whitaker were met with great applause from their regular opponents.|$|E

500|$|Canada has a {{long history}} of {{involvement}} with nuclear research, dating back to the pioneering work of Ernest Rutherford at McGill University in 1899. In 1940, George Laurence of the National Research Council (NRC) began experiments in Ottawa to measure neutron capture and nuclear fission in uranium to demonstrate the feasibility of a nuclear reactor. For that purpose, he obtained [...] of uranium dioxide in paper <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> the Eldorado Mine at Port Radium in the Northwest Territories. For a neutron moderator, he used carbon in the form of petroleum coke. This was placed with the bags of uranium oxide in a large wooden bin lined with paraffin wax, another neutron moderator. A neutron source was added, and a Geiger counter used to measure radioactivity.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1896, Bryan {{departed}} {{on a train}} {{trip that}} continued until November 1, {{two days before the}} election. [...] At first, he rode in public cars, and made his own travel arrangements, looking up train schedules and even carrying his own <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> train station to hotel. [...] By early October, the DNC, at the urging of Populist officials who felt Bryan was being worn out, procured the services of North Carolina journalist Josephus Daniels to make travel arrangements, and also obtained a private railroad car, The Idler—a name Bryan thought somewhat inappropriate due to the strenuous nature of the tour. [...] Mary Bryan had joined her husband in late September; on The Idler, the Bryans were able to eat and sleep in relative comfort.|$|E
500|$|The D-1 used {{separate}} loading ammunition, {{with eight}} different charges. The charges included the [...] "full charge" [...] Zh-536 and smaller charges {{ranging from the}} [...] "first" [...] to [...] "sixth", which was the smallest. A [...] "special charge" [...] was used with the BP-540 HEAT projectile. Propellant charges were produced in [...] "full" [...] and [...] "third" [...] variants in munitions factories. All other charges were derived from them by removing small gunpowder <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> the charge cartridge. For flash suppression there was a special chemical mixture {{which was to be}} inserted into a cartridge before night firing. 152mm projectiles for the D-1 weighed about 40kg; a difficult job for the loaders, who had to carry the projectiles alone.|$|E

500|$|Although {{known in}} their early days as [...] "the Throstles", the club's more popular {{nickname}} among supporters came to be the Baggies, a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, {{because of the large}} baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country. Club historian Tony Matthews however suggests that it derives from the [...] "bagmen", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named Baggie Bird and Albi; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.|$|E
500|$|Military {{personnel}} {{have taken}} pictures with the Towel while stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan {{as part of}} the War on Terrorism. Fans waved Terrible Towels at the gold medal match for Women's beach volleyball at the 2008 Olympic Games. Prior to the 2008 AFC Championship Game astronaut Colonel Mike Fincke, a Pittsburgh Native, waved the Terrible Towel from the International Space Station. The Terrible Towel is seen in the Scrubs season five episode [...] "My Bright Idea", hanging on the cork board of Carla and Turk's apartment as she comes out of the bathroom after performing what she believes to be another unsuccessful pregnancy test. During her campaign for the 2008 Presidential Election, Hillary Clinton received a Terrible Towel during a visit to Pittsburgh. During the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit, visiting dignitaries received Terrible Towels in gift <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> the city. The Terrible Towel is displayed prominently and waved by Rapper Wiz Khalifa in the music video for his song Black and Yellow, which debuted during the 2010 NFL season. The Terrible Towel made an episode in season 12 of Dancing with the Stars on March 21, 2011. After Hines Ward danced, Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris is seen twirling the towel. Pittsburgh native Meghan Klingenberg waved a Terrible Towel after scoring a goal at Heinz Field during the US Women's National Team victory tour following the 2015 World Cup.|$|E

2500|$|In 1873, {{a weekly}} mail service between Southport and a mining site further south at Yam Creek was established. This service {{utilised}} pack horses, {{and during the}} wet season months when progress was slow mail <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> {{the north and south}} were exchanged at the crossing of the Adelaide River. The following year, Mr. Edward Hopewell was awarded this mail contract and built the Q.C.E. Hotel on the river bank and a restaurant, the [...] "Jolly Waggoner" [...] was opened by George Doherty, increasing the importance of the area as an overnight stop for travellers. The first police station in the town was constructed in 1879.|$|E

2500|$|Since 2002, half dollars {{have been}} minted only for collectors, due to large Federal Reserve and {{government}} inventories on hand of pre-2001 pieces; this is mostly {{due to lack}} of demand and large quantity returns from casino slot machines that now operate [...] "coinless". If and when the reserve supply runs low, the mint will again fill orders for circulation half dollars. It took about 18 years (1981–1999) for the large inventory stockpile of a similar low-demand circulation coin, the $1 coin, to reach reserve levels low enough to again produce circulation pieces. Modern-date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets, mint sets, rolls, and <b>bags</b> <b>from</b> the U.S. Mint, and existing inventory circulation pieces can be ordered through most U.S. banks. All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years. Although intended only for collectors, these post-2001 half dollars sometimes find their way into circulation.|$|E

2500|$|Normally {{the cold}} Humboldt Current flows from south to north {{bringing}} nutrient rich plankton {{and with it}} an abundance of marine life along the Peruvian coast. For a few years every century, an El Niño event occurs that reverses {{the flow of the}} current resulting in extremely poor marine catches. In response to such a period of extreme poverty of resources, a priestly class may have arisen to provide leadership and to appeal to the gods for relief. Archaeological evidence for the existence of such elites includes prestige burials with status items such as elaborate clothing and jewelry. Since no prestige burials were found at El Paraiso, there is no direct evidence for the existence of elites. However, indirect evidence for elites lies in the size and complexity of the site. Division of labour and specialization is implied by the existence of a brick factory [...] and the use of rock filled fibre <b>bags.</b> <b>From</b> measuring the structures, archaeologists determined that El Paraiso was built according to a standardized set of engineering principles and measurements. This means that the El Paraiso site was carefully planned and was not just an ad hoc group of buildings. The conclusion is that a hierarchy was necessary to plan the site and to organize and coordinate a large labour force but the precise nature of the social organization remains elusive.|$|E
