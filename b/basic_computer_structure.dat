40|$|The COSC- 1 Assembly Language Simulator {{running on}} the Micro Network was {{developed}} {{as a tool for}} teaching the <b>basics</b> of <b>computer</b> <b>structure</b> and assembly language programming. COSC- 1 fs a simple computer of complexity about equivalent to a small personal computer. There is no actual hardware that behaves like a COSC- 1 computer, instead its behavior is simulated on another computer. While this is somewhat unreal, it has the advantage that the Micro Network provides quite a sophisticated programming environment to make life easier for the users. Another advantage {{is that some of the}} awkward features of real machines have been left out so that simple programs are more straightforward to write and understand. The network also provides file storage. The COSC- 1 Simulator allows assembly-language programs to be entered, assembled and debugged interactively on the IBM Personal Computer workstations used with the Micro Network. There is an editor for preparing COSC- 1 programs and facilities for translating these into machine language and running them. In addition, it is possible to start and stop a COSC- 1 program and peep into a COSC- 1 machine to study what happens at each step while a program is running...|$|R

40|$|Computers {{are used}} to process information. In {{understanding}} how a computer system is set up we can discover what information would be effectively processed, and what information would be ineffectively processed. The most basic level of a computer system is its logic gate level. At this level the computer only knows true or false. This information is carried by the most <b>basic</b> of <b>computer</b> <b>structures,</b> the bit. Ultimately, this is how modern computers process information – {{through a series of}} true and false signals carried by bits. Since each bit only contains one true or one false, it takes quite a number of bits to represent any sophisticated information. For instance, to represent a simple letter takes 8 bits. Current Cryptosystems Because of the current design of computer systems, some processes are very difficult for a computer to do efficiently. It is precisely these “weaknesses ” that current cryptography standards exploit when creating algorithms. Many cryptosystems today use large number factoring as part of their algorithm because it is very difficult for computers to solve such factorings. Quantum Computing With the development of quantum physics came quantum computing. Quantum physics has shown that atomic and sub-atomic particles do not necessarily follow the classical laws of physics as larger objects do. Quantum computing suggests that we use this atomic/sub-atomic level to process information in a computer system in place of the bit. One big advantage to quantum computing is that the qubit (quantum bit) is not limited to being set to one state (true or false), but can be both states at th...|$|R

Starting from the unique features of students and the characteristics of <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> education in accounting vocational colleges, this article has stated the necessity of the layered-teaching-in-one-class teaching mode and investigated the current problems with this mode for <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> education in these colleges. Most vocational colleges have realized the hierarchical teaching of <b>computer</b> <b>basic</b> course, that is, to clarify the necessicity, significance and implementation of hierarchical teaching to the newly-entered students. Then the students enroll for placement test, go different classes according to their scores and receive different education. Obviously, this hierarchical teaching is feasible for colleges with rich teaching resources while it is unpractical for the others. Therefore, it must be realistic to conduct the hierarchical teaching of <b>computer</b> <b>basic</b> course. With the accounting major of Chongqing Business Vocational College as an example, a brand new “layered-teaching-in-one-class ” mode has been put forward in this article.

40|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>computer</b> {{training}} {{is an important}} part of the fundamental training for engineers in each application area. The article shows that the purpose of such training has been always the formation of the basic theoretical concepts and practical skills to solve problems by programming with computers. All the formation periods and the following improvement of <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training were analyzed by the example of the National Research University «Moscow Power Engineering Institute» (NRU MPEI). Special role of the structured programming technology is mentioned, the use of which allows you to effectively develop easy understood algorithms and computer programs with a minimal number of errors. Particular attention is drawn to the serious methodological support in the 80 th (the last century), the <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training of students by the Ministry of Higher Education of the USSR and the Research Institute of Higher School Problems. The important role of methodical councils of universities on the computer technology application to coordinate in those years the <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training at the University is mentioned. The article shows the new teaching methods of the main discipline with generally accepted today in Russia term “Informatics”. This method was developed in the National Research University «Moscow Power Engineering Institute» at the Applied Mathematics Department, providing the <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training of students in 1 – 2 semesters. This new teaching method has such a «reference point» as fundamental programming concepts «task – method of this task solution – algorithm for solving the task – computer program». The main tasks of the discipline of the <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training were defined: – formation of students’ formal logic, algorithmic thinking; – learning of modern technology of structured programming, providing efficient development of algorithms and computer programs; – formation of practical skills of designing algorithms of any complexity; – learning of procedure-oriented programming languages. The article analyzes some negative aspects, related to <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training and appeared in the last 15 – 20 years in the National Research University «Moscow Power Engineering Institute» and other higher technical educational universities of Russia, including: – subjective diluting effect, changing the purpose and content of <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training and replacement by the other, «unconvincing» in the content subjects; – lack of a unified program of discipline «Informatics» for higher technical educational institutions of Russia; – lack of understanding of the specificity of very intensive work of lecturers, conducting such training, and the underestimation of their labor; – insufficient current level of initial computer training for the secondary school graduates; – lack of methodological interaction of higher technical educational universities of Russia among themselves and with the secondary school on <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training. The article emphasizes that the <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> training in engineering education in Russia will be in perspective realized in its classic historical sense of the word, if the qualified engineers, who are able to think logically and resolve efficiently any professional tasks, will be necessary for the country as before. </p...|$|R

The hospital has identified {{a need to}} assess <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> literacy of new employees prior to offering them training on various HIT applications. Lack of research in identifying an accurate assessment method for <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> literacy among health care professionals led to this explanatory correlational research study, which compared self-assessment scores and a simulated actual computer skills test to find an appropriate tool for assessing computer literacy. The theoretical framework {{of the study was}} based on constructivist learning theory and self-efficacy theory. Two sets of data from 182 hospital employees were collected and analyzed. A t test revealed that scores of self-assessment were significantly higher than they were on the actual test, which indicated that hospital employees tend to score higher on self-assessment when compared to actual skills test. A Pearson product moment correlation revealed a statistically weak correlation between the scores, which implied that self-assessment scores were not a reliable indicator of how an individual would perform on the actual test. An actual skill test was found to be the more reliable tool to assess <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> skills when compared to self-assessment test. The findings of the study also identified areas where employees at the local hospital lacked <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> skills, which {{led to the development of}} the project to fill these gaps by providing training on <b>basic</b> <b>computer</b> skills prior to them getting trained on various HIT applications.
