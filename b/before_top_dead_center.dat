2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest mean effective pressure, however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (TDC), and longer intake ducts, improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due {{to the absence of}} throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke engine's intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type engine's intake timing opens and closes <b>before</b> and after <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R
50|$|In a {{conventional}} Otto cycle engine, each cylinder performs all four strokes per cycle. This means that two revolutions of the crankshaft {{are required for}} each power stroke. The pistons fire every other revolution, while the Scuderi engine fires every revolution. The Otto cycle design convention calls for combustion just <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (BTDC) {{in order to allow}} combustion pressure to build.|$|E
50|$|In a {{turbocharged}} or supercharged gasoline engine, the CR is customarily {{built at}} 10.5:1 or lower. This {{is due to}} the turbocharger/supercharger already having compressed the air before it enters the cylinders. Port fuel injected engines typically run lower boost than direct fuel injected engines because port fuel injection allows the air/fuel mixture to be heated together which leads to detonation. Conversely, directly injected engines can run higher boost because heated air will not detonate without a fuel being present. In this instance fuel is injected as late as 60 degrees <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> to avoid heating the mixture to the point of compression ignition.|$|E
5000|$|... "Timing advance" [...] {{refers to}} the number of degrees <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (BTDC) that the spark will ignite the air-fuel mixture in the {{combustion}} chamber during the compression stroke. Retarded timing can be defined as changing the timing so that fuel ignition happens later than the manufacturer's specified time. For example, if the timing specified by the manufacturer was set at 12 degrees BTDC initially and adjusted to 11 degrees BTDC, it would be referred to as retarded. In a classic ignition system with breaker points, the basic timing can be set statically using a test light or dynamically using the timing marks and a timing light.|$|E
40|$|Air-borne {{acoustic}} based {{condition monitoring}} is a promising technique {{because of its}} intrusive nature and the rich information contained within the acoustic signals including all sources. However, the back ground noise contamination, interferences {{and the number of}} Internal Combustion Engine ICE vibro-acoustic sources preclude the extraction of condition information using this technique. Therefore, lower energy events; such as fuel injection, are buried within higher energy events and/or corrupted by background noise. This work firstly investigates diesel engine air-borne acoustic signals characteristics and the benefits of joint time-frequency domain analysis. Secondly, the air-borne acoustic signals in the vicinity of injector head were recorded using three microphones around the fuel injector (120 ° apart from each other) and an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based scheme was developed to decompose these acoustic signals. The fuel injection process characteristics were thus revealed in the time-frequency domain using Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) technique. Consequently the energy levels around the injection process period between 11 and 5 degrees <b>before</b> the <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> and of frequency band 9 to 15 kHz are calculated. The developed technique was validated by simulated signals and empirical measurements at different injection pressure levels from 250 to 210 bars in steps of 10 bars.

40|$|The {{demand for}} more {{powerful}} engines on one hand, and greater fuel-efficiency on the other, requires a revolution in engine combustion technology. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) can be a fuel-saving, low emissions approach {{that seems to be}} very suitable for large displacement passenger car engines. HCCI is used as a generic name for auto-ignited combustion in an engine, initiated by a temperature rise due to the compression of a mixture of fuel, air and/or residuals. Fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions are reduced, in a window within a relevant engine speed and load domain, but the emissions levels are not compromised compared to a spark-ignited (SI) engine with catalytic exhaust-gas after-treatment, mainly due to the ultra low nitrogen-oxides (NO x) emissions. Since HCCI combustion can only be valid for a specified speed/load window (due to a required dilution of the combustion mixture), the method should be applied as a mode that can be engaged or disengaged, instead of running in it all the time, thus avoiding compromising the power output of the engine in SI mode. A very high temperature is required to auto-ignite gasoline (about 1100 K), but by trapping hot combustion products (residuals) of the previous combustion using a negative valve overlap (NVO) this can be accomplished. The overlap is created with valve timings, different than during conventional SI mode, where the exhaust valves are closed early and the intake valves late. Also direct fuel injection can have a positive influence: <b>before</b> piston <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> of the negative valve overlap a small amount of fuel can be injected (the pilot fuel) which will auto-ignite in the NVO, thereby elevating the temperature of the captured mixture further. There are no direct means for controlling the start of combustion (as the spark timing is for SI combustion). The auto-ignition timing, however, can be controlled by varying the negative valve overlap; a large overlap advances the auto-ignition timing while a shorter NVO period delays it. It can also be controlled by the excess air ratio, effective compression ratio (varied by adjusting the timing of the intake valve closure), timing of exhaust valve opening, direct fuel injection timing and the amount of pilot fuel. The thesis describes the result of engine experiments in which it was possible to utilize advanced hardware and equipment in combination with engine simulations (chemical kinetics, gas exchange and CFD) focusing on discovering the mechanisms behind the method (HCCI NVO). In addition to the detailed investigations published in the papers, which are added {{in the back of the}} thesis, more information can be found on: HCCI in general, different methods of generating HCCI combustion, the history of the project, the methods of experimenting, and HCCI NVO including a comparison with SI combustion...|$|R

50|$|Regular {{gasoline}} two-stroke engines {{will run}} backwards {{for short periods}} and under light load with little problem, {{and this has been}} used to provide a reversing facility in microcars, such as the Messerschmitt KR200, that lacked reverse gearing. Where the vehicle has electric starting, the motor will be turned off and restarted backwards by turning the key in the opposite direction. Two-stroke golf carts have used a similar kind of system. Traditional flywheel magnetos (using contact-breaker points, but no external coil) worked equally well in reverse because the cam controlling the points is symmetrical, breaking contact <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (TDC) equally well whether running forwards or backwards. Reed-valve engines will run backwards just as well as piston-controlled porting, though rotary valve engines have asymmetrical inlet timing and will not run very well.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} {{advancing}} {{the timing of}} the spark is because fuel does not completely burn the instant the spark fires, the combustion gases take a period of time to expand, and the angular or rotational speed of the engine can lengthen or shorten the time frame in which the burning and expansion should occur. In a vast majority of cases, the angle will be described as a certain angle advanced <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (BTDC). Advancing the spark BTDC means that the spark is energized prior {{to the point where the}} combustion chamber reaches its minimum size, since the purpose of the power stroke in the engine is to force the combustion chamber to expand. Sparks occurring after top dead center (ATDC) are usually counter-productive (producing wasted spark, back-fire, engine knock, etc.) unless there is need for a supplemental or continuing spark prior to the exhaust stroke.|$|E

5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959. Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did {{not refer to}} the cylinder displacement, but rather to the year it was introduced. Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid L) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid L). It was a simplified version of the Series 53 {{that did not have}} exhaust valves. This was accomplished by using loop scavenging ports for both intake and exhaust along with a mechanical blower. This engine used a dry sleeve with 9 intake ports and three exhaust ports in that sleeve. These sleeves were located {{in such a way that}} the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the intake ports in the block. This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the intake ports just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the intake ports while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height. The net compression ratio is 18:1. Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture. Instead, the blower forced air in the intake ports and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by a gear pump. As fuel is injected just <b>before</b> <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center,</b> little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine. The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine. The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the intake air and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the air intake. The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible. Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses. It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use. This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency. It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.|$|E
