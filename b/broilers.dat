5|$|Beyond the {{flexibility}} of the new <b>broilers,</b> the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs. A more efficient design of the burners in the Nieco units produces a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Duke units produce a $4,000 -$5,000 annual savings on energy compared to the original units, which ran approximately at full capacity all day. The units are so fuel-efficient that in many US states, the company and its franchises qualify for energy-efficiency rebates. However, and issue arose in September 2011 when the state of Washington department of health warned Burger King of issues with the Duke units. In multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state, the Duke units were found to have cracked heat spreaders which resulted in under cooked products. Additionally, there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues. Upon notification, Burger King released a statement that the company has notified franchisees and corporate-owned stores operating the Duke units with orders to repair the problem immediately. Additional training for operators was also ordered.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>broiler</b> breeder age on the morphological development of the small intestine <b>broiler</b> embryos (villus height, crypt depth, microvillus height, and villus density) at 20 day of incubation.

The results showed that embryos from older <b>broiler</b> breeders presented longer villi in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum compared with younger <b>broiler</b> breeders. In addition, embryos from older <b>broiler</b> breeders presented deeper crypts in the jejunum and ileum, longer microvilli in jejunal enterocytes, and lower villus density (microvillus number/mm 2) in the duodenum and ileum than younger breeders.

5|$|In the {{developed}} world, {{the majority of}} the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as <b>broilers,</b> and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time. A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.|$|E

The elasticities of response of the various <b>broiler</b> production activities with respect to <b>broiler</b> feed cost and expected <b>broiler</b> price variables decline in value as the <b>broiler</b> slaughter period approaches.
