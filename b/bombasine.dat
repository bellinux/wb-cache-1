Quality bombazine {{is made with}} a silk warp and a worsted weft. It is twilled or corded and used for dress-material. Black bombazine was once used largely for mourning wear, but the material {{had gone out of}} fashion {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|On 19 May, Rowena {{was sent}} to Epsom Downs Racecourse to contest the Oaks Stakes over {{one and a half}} miles in which her main rival was {{expected}} to be the Duke of Rutland's Emmeline, the winner of the Riddlesworth Stakes at the Newmarket Craven meeting. The Epsom meeting was badly affected by stormy weather, with heavy rain and strong winds, resulting in a much reduced attendance for both the Derby on Thursday and the Oaks a day later. In a field of 13 runners, Rowena was made the favourite at odds of 6/4, with Emmeline next in the betting on 4/1. Rowena finished second to Caroline, which reversed the 1000 Guineas form to win by a length with <b>Bombasine</b> third and Emmeline unplaced. Rowena {{does not appear to have}} raced after her defeat at Epsom.|$|E
