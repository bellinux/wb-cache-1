5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} birth control may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills,</b> injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills</b> {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills</b> at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills</b> may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|It is {{theorized that}} the use of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills</b> should affect eating {{behaviour}} as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The neurotransmitter serotonin is also thought {{to play a role in}} food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the United Nations {{launched}} the Every Woman Every Child movement {{to assess the}} progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs. The initiative has {{set a goal of}} increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world's 69 poorest countries by the year 2020. Additionally, they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended in 2014 that oral <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills</b> should be over the counter medications.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills</b> in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills</b> help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills,</b> progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills.</b> In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E
5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills,</b> which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pills,</b> she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of the <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pill</b> on divorce. To {{identify}} its effect, we use a quasi experiment exploiting the differences {{in the language of the}} Comstock anti-obscenity statutes approved in the 1800 s and early 1900 s in the US. Results suggest that banning the sales of oral contraceptive methods has a negative impact on divorce. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (such as female labour force participation, or changes in the early legal access to the <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pill)</b> and unobserved state-specific factors, and time-varying factors at the state level. Additional analysis, developed to examine whether the impact of subsequent divorce law reforms on divorce is modified after <b>controlling</b> for the <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pill</b> effect, shows that, although sales bans matter, the impact of divorce law reforms on divorce rate does not vary. ...|$|R

40|$|This article empirically assesses whether age-restricted {{access to}} {{abortion}} and the <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pill</b> influence minors’ fertility in the United States. There is not a strong consensus in previous literature regarding the relationship between laws restricting minors’ {{access to abortion}} and minors’ birthrates. This is the first study to recognize that state laws in place prior to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision enabled minors to legally consent to surgical treatment—including abortion—in some states but not in others, and to construct abortion access variables reflecting this. In this article, age-specific policy variables measure either a minor’s legal ability to obtain an abortion or to obtain the <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pill</b> without parental involvement. I find fairly strong evidence that young women’s birthrates dropped {{as a result of}} abortion access as well as evidence that <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> <b>pill</b> access led to a drop in birthrates among whites...|$|R
