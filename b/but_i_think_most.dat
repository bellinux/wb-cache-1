60|$|I {{shall never}} forget how I first became acquainted with Rectus. About {{a couple of}} years before, he was a new boy in the academy at Willisville. One Saturday, a lot of us went down to the river to swim. Our {{favorite}} place was near an old wharf, which ran out into deep water, and a fellow could take a good dive there, when the tide was high. There were some of the smaller boys along that day, but they didn't dive any, and if they even swam, it was in shallow water near the shore, {{by the side of the}} wharf. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of them spent their time wading about.|$|E

I just stood alone; there weren't no one to back me up in {{choosing}} to die rather than to serve, and so I says, 'I will join you, captain.' I don't say I was right, lad; I don't say I didn't act as a coward; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> young chaps with my bringing up, and placed as I was, {{would have done the}} same.

We went {{up and down on the}} waves with a motion that wouldn't have been so bad had we not thought we might be shuffled off, if a big wave turned us over a little too much. But there were lots of things to hold on to, and we all stuck close together. We three were in the middle. The captain told us to get there. There is no way of telling how glad I was that the captain was with us. I was well satisfied, anyway, to be with the party on the raft. I might have liked it better in a boat, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of the men in the boats were waiters, or stewards, or passengers--fellows who were in a hurry to get off. The officers and sailors who remained behind to do their best for the ship and the passengers were the men on the raft; and these I felt we could trust. I think there were ten of them, besides the captain, making fourteen of us in all.|$|E

6000|$|I {{could not}} well praise this poem enough, without praising it too much. It depicts a whole order of things, and it brings vividly before us the scene described; while its deep feeling is so lightly and {{effortlessly}} expressed, {{that one does}} not know which to like best, the exquisite manner or the excellent sense. To prove that Giusti was really a fine poet, I need give nothing more, for this alone would imply poetic power; not perhaps of the high epic sort, but {{of the kind that}} gives far more comfort to the heart of mankind, amusing and consoling it. [...] "Giusti composed satires, but no poems," [...] says a French critic; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> will not, after reading this piece, agree with him. There are satires and satires, and some are fierce enough and brutal enough; but when a satire can breathe so much tenderness, such generous humanity, such pity for the means, at the same time with such hatred of the source of wrong, and all with an air of such smiling pathos, I say, if it is not poetry, it is something better, and by all means let us have it instead of poetry. It is humor, in its best sense; and, after religion, {{there is nothing in the}} world can make men so conscious, thoughtful, and modest.|$|E

40|$|Keith (2000) gave a good {{overview}} {{of the history of}} climate/geoengineering. I was most interested in the section on fertilizing the oceans. In theory, the idea seems perfect: iron is a major limiting nutrient in the oceans, and its ratio with carbon is 1 : 10, 000 in the deep oceans. So the addition of extra iron would be very effective in burying extra carbon in the short term (Keith, 2000). The idea has already gone beyond theory: small scale experiments have been conducted in the open ocean and scientists have noted increased phytoplankton activity over a period of days or weeks. Several commercial companies have expressed interest in conducting larger demonstration projects; the companies are largely drawn by the potential to use ocean fertilization as global carbon credits (Chisolm et al., 2001). Chisolm et al. (2001) argues strongly against using ocean fertilization for carbon credits. The article is clearly biased and mentions only the negative consequences, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> its <b>most</b> compelling argument is that we can't predict the long-term consequences of large-scale ocean fertilization.
