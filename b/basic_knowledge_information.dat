More specifically, the speaker's knowledge is defined as sources of information which include the following major categories: <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> perception, inference, report and hearsay. <b>Basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> represents <b>information</b> acquired through academic, experiential, cultural and re 1 igious settings and is firmly believed to be true by the speaker. Perception includes information acquired through our five senses. Inference refers to information obtained through deliberation and thinking. Both report and hearsay indicate secondary information. Following the categorization of the five distinct information sources, three major linguistic forms in Japanese and Okinawan are analyzed as to how they specifically indicate the above-mentioned sources of information. These three linguistic forms include verbal suffixes such as an, utan and een in Okinawan and ta, te iru and te aru in Japanese; Okinawan sentence-final forms, doo, saa, sa, tee, joo and Ndi; and the complementizers si, Ndisi and Ndi in Okinawan and no, koto and to in Japanese...|$|R

It {{is extremely difficult}} for a robot to do tasks ordered by a human without having some <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> or <b>information.</b> This paper proposes a method to create object knowledge focusing on an object and object’s place relationship for the robotic service namely tidy-up service, in which a robot is asked to take objects such as books, cups, dishes on a table to appropriate places automatically. In details, as the first phase, we conduct a questionnaire to collect the trajectories in term of places of individual object from the participants. Based on the collected object trajectory information, {{we are able to}} build Markov chain model of the object which the states are possible places and transition probabilities are the probability that the object moved from one place to other places. In final, we are able to use the transition probability including the Markov chain model to predict and provide the next appropriate place. The result showed that the proposed ap-proach is efficient in creating object trajectory as knowledge, hence, helping the robots to and to provide intuitive service...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the public opinion of a rural town in northern Hokkaido with respect to the use of local forests for bioenergy production. The small Japanese town with 3, 800 citizens had been identified as an optimal case study location and selected because of its early decision to pursue forest management certification and because the municipality had been awarded the status of one out of 6 Japanese "Eco-Model Cities" - to encourage the creation of low-carbon communities - in 2008. In order to test the <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>information</b> needs of the public, a questionnaire-based drop-off survey was conducted in mid 2009 among all households of Shimokawa Town. The questionnaire was divided into 4 sections (general info, forest, forest management, and bioenergy) in each of which up to 16 questions were asked with main focus on sustainable forest management, certification, and biomass for bio-energy. The answers were made on a 4 / 5 point scale, or in dichotomous-choice form and analyzed by using SPSS. Knowing the public opinion on forest, bioenergy and the environment is seen to be crucial for the design of future policies for integrating a range of discrete and sectoral approaches such as energy supply-demand measures, green building combined with certified wooden products, eco tourism or forest protection. Such bottom-up policies need to aim at tackling the problems of low forestry activity and climate change issues by concentrating on increasing people's knowledge and positive attitudes towards an environmentally sound use of domestic forests...|$|R
40|$|As {{scavengers}} of recalcitrant polymers in the nature, filamentous fungi {{are excellent}} secretors of proteins outside the growing mycelium. This characteristic has been targeted and systematically improved in industrially-exploited production strains. Over {{the last five}} years there has been a significant shift from one-gene-at-a-time approaches to wider understanding of the organism, made possible, for example by gene array and proteome technologies that can now also be applied to filamentous fungi. This has presented novel opportunities for studies into gene regulation under specific conditions such as a particular carbon source or developmental stage with a view of advancing the <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and gaining <b>information</b> that can be applied for strain and process improvement. Filamentous fungi offer enormous potential for efficient and large scale production of heterologous gene products. Importantly, protein secretion provides a platform for the eukaryotic style posttranslational modification of gene products. Fungi are cheap to cultivate and down-stream processing is made easy with no need to break cells open for product recovery. In order to capitalize on fungi as heterologous production hosts, research is now directed to revealing the cellular mechanisms for internal protein quality control, secretion stress, functional genomics of protein expression and secretion, protein modification and linking the physiology to productivity. 27 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a hybrid prediction system consists of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for processing medical data. In {{the process of}} developing a new data mining technique and software to aid efficient solutions for medical data analysis, we propose a hybrid tool that incorporates RST and ANN to make efficient data analysis and suggestive predictions. In the experiments, we used spermatological data set for predicting quality of animal semen. The data set used in the experiments is subjected to quantize and normalize, and use this as a reflection of the internal system state. The RST is used as a tool for reducing and choosing the most relevant sets of internal states for predicting the semen fertilization potential. Chosen optimal data set is input to constructed neural network with supervised learning algorithm for the prediction of semen quality. This paper demonstrates that the RST is an effective pre-processing tool for reducing the number of input vector to ANN without reducing the <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the <b>information</b> system in order to increase prediction accuracy of the proposed system. The resulting system is a hybrid prediction system for medical database called an Intelligent Rough Neural Network System (IRNNS) ...|$|R

They are a brand new teaching aid using Jan Amos Komenský's old motto "Schola Ludus" is a school game. The combination of a virtual and realistic environment with simulation models enables students to visually explore the possibilities of dealing with an emergency situation. One of the projects implemented by the non-governmental nonprofit organization Center for Safe State Project Software Applications 3 D simulator. The motivation for choosing the topic of my thesis is that I have been working {{as the head of}} a laboratory in a chemical plant for several years. One of the main activities is the transport of dangerous chemicals by road and rail, or operations related to packaging, loading, filling and unloading of such chemicals. My daily activity is responsible for preventing the occurrence of undesirable risks with regard to the protection of persons, property and the environment. To create a textbook for 3 D simulator and consequently to use it in the framework of teaching was the main aim of this work. It is important to realize that dangerous substances can escape almost at any moment, so it is necessary to create conditions for the prevention of these events. The success of this area is mainly a good, systematic and coordinated preparation of decisive activities. The diploma thesis is divided into two parts. The theoretical part briefly summarizes the <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>information</b> about the given issue. There are described the most commonly used software tools and their use for teaching.

This article compares the public opinion of two rural towns in Japan, one of which is located in northern Hokkaido, whereas the other town is located on the southern Main Island Shikoku. Both municipalities had been identified as an optimal case study location and selected because of their early decision to pursue forest management certification and because both towns had been awarded the status of a Japanese "Eco-Model Cities" - to encourage the creation of low-carbon communities - in 2008 and 2009. In order to test the <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>information</b> needs of the public, a questionnaire-based drop-off survey was conducted in early 2007 and mid 2009 respectively among all households of the two rural towns. The questionnaire was divided into 5 sections (general info, forest, forest management, bioenergy, and information needs) in each of which up to 15 questions were asked with main focus on forest certification and biomass for bio-energy. The answers were made on a 4 / 5 point scale, or in dichotomous-choice form and analyzed by using SPSS. Gaining better knowledge about what the public thinks regarding bioenergy and the environment is seen to be crucial for the design of future policies for integrating a range of discrete and sectoral approaches such as energy supply-demand measures, energy-efficient buildings, traffic measures, waste disposal measures and forest protection. Finally, this study describes and interprets differences and similarities in the public opinion of both Eco-Model Cities in Japan where bioenergy production and forest management certification plays an important role. Forest certification and bioenergy from forest were identified as key elements for future integrated bottom-up policies that need to concentrate on facilitating the linkage between forestry and renewable energy as well as on promoting environmentally sound management and forest certification...|$|R
