40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, an extensive literature survey has been made with special focus on the braking capacity of wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop <b>braking.</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>rig</b> experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the <b>brake</b> <b>rig</b> tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|R
40|$|Pneumatic {{brake systems}} use {{pressurized}} air {{to apply the}} brakes and are used in trucks, amongst other vehicles. Due to the compressibility of the air, {{there is a time}} delay from the push-down of the brake pedal to the attainment of the desired brake effect. The time for the pressure in the brake cylinder to reach 75 % of its final pressure is subject to legal requirements, and this master thesis studies the possibilities to predict that time by simulation. The program GT-SUITE is chosen for the simulation, since it is shown to be suitable in a survey of potential software and an evaluation. Also, MATLAB is used to simulate an approximate system description. To support the modeling of brake system components, measurements are made on a simple <b>brake</b> <b>rig,</b> gradually extended with common brake components which then can be modeled. Finally, the models are verified with a measurement on a complete brake system. In the simple rigs, the simulations are accurate and able to predict the effect of new components.

40|$|Tread braking of railway wheels {{results in}} the kinetic energy of the train being {{dissipated}} into the wheel and blocks {{in the form of}} heat. This heat is further conducted into adjacent structures, notably the cold rail, and also transferred into the surroundings by convection and radiation. Heat partitioning between wheel and block is, for short time periods, controlled by local thermal interactions at the contact point and by the conductive properties of the bodies. However, for a metro train that performs longer periods of intermittent braking (or for drag braking) convective and radiation cooling properties of the components come into play.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking is {{developed}} {{for use in}} routine calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Two-dimensional finite-element models of block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model {{can be used to}} efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can be calculated.

The main objective {{of the present study}} is to find the limits for tread braking with respect to temperature impact on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the wheel tread. A wheel with an S-shaped web is studied for some different stop braking loads. Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal loading from braking and mechanical loading, with traversing wheel-rail rolling contact, are studied. In order to account for the elevated temperatures, the simulations utilise a temperature-dependent elastoplastic material model. The mechanical loads account for frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking, using a novel method that is based on elastoplastic contact simulations. Partial slip is considered and interfacial shear stresses are introduced in the wheel-rail contact area. Evolution of damage {{in the vicinity of the}} wheel tread is studied for various brake loading cases. In order to assess limits for the tread braking, the calculated damage is compared to previously developed critical damage levels which were based on full-scale <b>brake</b> <b>rig</b> testing. Results are presented for a parametric study with thermomechanical loading based on different load cases. The influence from operational parameters such as axle loads, initial speeds, decelerations and block material is studied. The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the rolling contact fatigue of the wheel treads and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels. The study gives preliminary limits for revenue traffic, described as combinations of tread temperatures and wheel-rail rolling contact loading, which should be respected to avoid thermal cracking of the wheel treads...|$|R

Basically, once the hard particles enter the gap, the value and amplitude of friction coefficient tend to decrease.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking has {{previously}} been developed for use in calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel. Heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is accounted for. The thermal model was calibrated using results from both standard <b>brake</b> <b>rig</b> tests and tests when a “rail-wheel” {{was introduced in the}} rig. Furthermore, the model was successfully calibrated using results from field studies. In the present work, the thermal model is utilised to study temperatures and partitioning of heating power during different braking set-ups and braking loads. First, the influences from geometrical changes are studied, with parameters such as wheel design, wheel wear and block wear. Also the effect of brake block configuration is studied. Second, the influence from brake block material is considered. Third, the influences from braking parameters are studied. Gradient braking on mountain descents is simulated but also the related case of brake system malfunctioning. Stop braking is studied. Fourth, the importance of rail chill is investigated with respect to shape and size of the contact patch between wheel and rail. A general result from the present parametric study is that rail chill is important for a useful simulation of wheel temperatures and heat partitioning at drag braking. Rail chill consumes a considerable part of the total heat at drag braking and it becomes increasingly important as the tread temperature rises. For example, {{at the end of a}} brake cycle at 30 kW per wheel for 30 min with composition brake blocks using a 920 mm wheel, 21 % of the total heat enters the rail...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{trains are}} {{equipped}} with different braking systems, between which the braking effort can be distributed. Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for friction braking. Tread brake systems are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread brakes demands knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended braking, braking temperatures, brake block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of wheels due to tread braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale <b>brake</b> <b>rig</b> tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the braked wheel. The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material. The developed methodology is employed in parametric studies. These consist of braking load cases characterised by operational parameters such as axle load, maximum vehicle speed, deceleration, block material, and initial wheel temperature. Damage evolution in the wheel tread is studied. A strong infuence of high temperatures on rolling contact fatigue formation in the wheel tread was observed. In particular, braking temperatures over 450 °C can result in a very short life up to crack initiation. However, for braking temperatures in the range of 300 - 350 °C, wheel tread material is more resistant to fatigue due to strain hardening...|$|R
40|$|Railway {{wheel and}} rail {{materials}} {{are subjected to}} very high stresses and, in some cases, also elevated temperatures. The rolling contact loading results in a multiaxial stress state {{with a combination of}} compression and shear. The elevated temperature is caused by frictional heat generated between wheel and brake blocks at tread braking, or between wheel and rail. The main goal of this thesis is to improve modeling of the cyclic and viscous mechanical behaviour of wheel materials subjected to mechanical and thermal loadings. Finite element analyses of generic heavy haul wheel designs, subjected to high power drag braking loads, are carried out giving global wheel behaviour e. g. in terms of axial rim displacements and residual stresses. A plasticity model and a viscoplasticity model are calibrated against results from cyclic strain controlled experiments of a railway wheel steel of ER 7 grade at different temperatures. The finite element analyses show a strong influence of the material model in particular for braking with high power. Next, a methodology to simulate full scale <b>brake</b> <b>rig</b> tests is developed. It includes three types of finite element analyses: an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheelrail contact analysis and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis. The wheel material behaviour is modelled by a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic strain controlled experiments. The results from the simulation methodology in terms of ratchetting failure show rather good agreement with full scale test rig results for three cases of initial velocity and brake block material. To further improve the material modelling, a viscoplastic model is calibrated against experimental data for cyclic loading and relaxation (low strain rates) as well as high strain rate tests. Preliminary results from the simulation methodology show that the viscoplastic model predicts larger plastic strains as compared to the plastic model...|$|R
40|$|Block braking is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several brake blocks are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of block braking has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with block braked wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the brake block material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used brake block material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of wheel roughness. The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an inertia dynamometer are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between brake block and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented. The tendency of cast iron brake blocks to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. <b>Brake</b> <b>rig</b> tests have been performed for drag braking at constant brake power for blocks made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials.

The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains.

40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, important aspects of the thermal capacity of tread braked railway wheels have been assessed in a literature survey. Then two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to standard design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. The influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution on the wheel temperatures has been investigated. A general result is that hot spots only have a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures. <b>Brake</b> <b>rig</b> experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line.

In a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials, the heat partitioning characteristics between wheel and block material at controlled elevated disc temperatures were investigated by a finite element approach where a model was calibrated using measured temperatures. In the final part of the present thesis, a modelling framework was proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential stop braking.

Sliding speeds of 4 m/s, 8 m/s, 10 m/s and 12 m/s at constant pressures of 0. 6 MPa, 0. 8 MPa and 1 MPa were applied during the tests. Results showed that the presence of hard particles and grit size has significant effect on the CoF values. The values of CoF tend to reduce when grit particles are present. However, CoF values increase with sliding speed and applied pressure. Wear debris and particle embedment of silica sand was analyzed using SEM and optical microscopy after the test. Particle embedment (PE) of 1 - 2 % of the pad area was observed. Fragmentation of hard particle has occurred only at high applied pressures. Also correlation between PE and CoF values was found to be slightly an inverse relationship as small reduction of CoF values with higher percentage of PE was determined...|$|R
40|$|Brake squeal is {{a high-pitched}} {{noise in the}} {{frequency}} range between 1 kHz and 16 kHz originating from self-excited vibrations caused by the frictional contact between brake pads and brake disc. Since some decades, it has intensively been studied and many countermeasures have been proposed, including active and passive methods. It is known from experiments and has also been proved mathematically that splitting the eigenfrequencies of the brake rotor has a stabilizing effect and avoids brake squeal. In this thesis, this knowledge is used to derive design goals for asymmetric, squeal-free discs. It is necessary to split all eigenfrequencies of the brake disc in a pre-definable frequency band to guarantee stability, inhibit the onset of self-excited vibrations and thus avoid squeal completely. In order to achieve this goal, a structural optimization of automotive as well as bicycle brake discs is conducted. Using a novel, efficient modeling technique, large changes in the geometry can be covered leading to a successful optimization in all cases studied. Optimized automotive and bicycle brake discs have been manufactured and tested on appropriate <b>brake</b> test <b>rigs</b> to assess their squeal affinity, and it is shown that the optimized discs have a greatly improved squeal behavior. This validates the mathematical theory behind the presented approach and demonstrates that splitting eigenfrequencies of the brake rotor is a passive, low-cost and effective squeal countermeasure applicable {{to a variety of}} brake systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} brake caliper {{pressure}} controller for a conventional anti-lock braking system/electronic stability control system and the experimental validation of its tracking performances. The analysis of the hydraulic plant, carried out in part I of this two-part study, is here utilized to develop the control algorithm. The control strategy is based on a feed-forward and a proportional integral controller through pulse width modulation with a constant frequency and variable duty cycle. The feed-forward contribution requires modeling of the nonlinear openloop system behavior which has been experimentally identified and described through two-dimensional maps: the inputs are the duty cycle applied to the electrovalves and the pressure drop across their orifice, while the output is the pressure gradient in the brake caliper. These maps, obtained for inlet and outlet valves, are used to set the feed-forward term. Finally a proportional integral controller is designed to reject external disturbances and compensate for model uncertainties. A <b>brake</b> system test <b>rig,</b> described in part I, is used for building inverse maps and validating the proposed control logic. Different reference pressure profiles are used to experimentally verify the control tracking performances...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many mechanisms have been suggested for brake squeal over many years. In order to identify the most appropriate of these mechanisms, an experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to define in detail the vibration characteristics of a squealing heavy vehicle air operated drum brake on both a vehicle and a laboratory <b>brake</b> test <b>rig.</b> This required the development of a novel 'scanning' technique for the modal analysis of the rotating drum, which showed the presence of well-defined complex wavelike modes. From these results, the dynamic behaviour of the drum, in particular, is found to be in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of a simple 'binary flutter' mechanism of squeal. Based on the role of rotor symmetry in this mechanism, a means of decoupling, flutter modes is developed involving a reduction in the rotational symmetry of the drum by means of attaching masses in a defined pattern at its periphery. It is shown theoretically that such decoupling would be expected to increase the dynamic stability of the brake, and experimental application of the technique confirms its effectiveness in reducing or eliminating squeal. Practical design aspects of reducing the rotational symmetry of the drum are considered, using finite element modelling, and it is also shown that the technique can be effective in other types of vehicle brake, such as disc brakes and hydraulic drum brakes. The simple lumped parameter models used in the above work are inadequate as brake design tools, however, and so a novel application of finite element modelling is used to extend the principle of the binary flutter mechanism to a more detailed model of a complete brake. This is shown to be capable of predicting known features of squeal and may be used as a brake design tool for both the brake structure and the friction material...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn automobile, {{brake system}} is an {{essential}} part responsible for control of the vehicle. Any failure in the brake system impacts the vehicle's motion. It will generate frequent catastrophic effects on the vehicle cum passenger's safety. Thus the brake system plays a vital role in an automobile and hence condition monitoring of the brake system is essential. Vibration based condition monitoring using machine learning techniques are gaining momentum. This study is one such attempt to perform the condition monitoring of a hydraulic brake system through vibration analysis. In this research, the performance of a Clonal Selection Classification Algorithm (CSCA) for brake fault diagnosis has been reported. A hydraulic <b>brake</b> system test <b>rig</b> was fabricated. Under good and faulty conditions of a brake system, the vibration signals were acquired using a piezoelectric transducer. The statistical parameters were extracted from the vibration signal. The best feature set was identified for classification using attribute evaluator. The selected features were then classified using CSCA. The classification accuracy of such artificial intelligence technique has been compared with other machine learning approaches and discussed. The Clonal Selection Classification Algorithm performs better and gives the maximum classification accuracy (96 %) for the fault diagnosis of a hydraulic brake system...|$|R
