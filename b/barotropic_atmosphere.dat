40|$|Generalized {{stability}} {{theory is}} applied to a simple dynamical model of interannual ocean–atmosphere variability in the southern midlatitudes to determine the perturbations that create the most rapid growth {{of energy in the}} system. The model is composed of a <b>barotropic</b> quasigeostrophic <b>atmosphere</b> coupled to a 1. 5 -layer quasigeostrophic ocean, each linearized about a zonally invariant mean state, and with atmo-spheric and ocean surface temperature obeying a simple heat balance. Eigenanalysis of the system reveals modes of interannual variability that resemble the so-called Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW), consis-tent with an earlier analytical study of the system. The optimal excitation of these modes relative to an energy norm is found to be a perturbation almost entirely restricted to the ocean momentum field and is shown to resemble strongly the optimal perturbations in energy for the system. Over interannual time scales most rapid growth is seen in zonal wavenumbers 4 – 6, {{despite the fact that the}} least-damped eigenmodes of the system are of a lower zonal wavenumber. The rapid transient growth in energy occurs by extracting perturbation energy from the mean state through advection of the mean meridional oceanic temperature gradient. This transient growth of high-zonal-wavenumber modes dominates the model’s variability when it is forced by noise that is white in space or time. A dominant low-zonal-wavenumber response, consistent with the observed and modeled ACW, occurs only when the forcing is red in space or time, with decorre-lation scales greater than 3 yr or 10 000 km. It is concluded that, if the ACW is a coupled mode analogous to that supported in this simple model, then it is excited by other large-scale phenomena such as ENSO rather than by sources of higher-frequency forcing. 1...|$|R

The physical scenario accounting for the oscillations on decadal time scales is almost certainly not found in the real world on shorter time scales due to limited resolution and the omission of key physics (e. g., equatorial ocean dynamics) in the model.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the flow induced {{in a highly}} idealized atmospheric model by an east–west-oriented oceanic thermal front. The model has a linear marine boundary layer coupled to a quasigeostrophic, equivalent- <b>barotropic</b> free <b>atmosphere.</b> The vertical velocity {{at the top of}} the boundary layer drives the flow in the free atmosphere and produces an eastward jet, parallel to the oceanic front's isotherms. A large gyre develops on either side of this jet, cyclonic to the north and anticyclonic to the south of it. As the jet intensifies during spinup from rest, it becomes unstable. The most unstable wave has a length of about 500 km, it evolves into a meander, and eddies detach from the eastern edge of each gyre. The dependence of the atmospheric dynamics on the strength T of the oceanic front is studied. The Gulf Stream and Kuroshio fronts correspond roughly, in the scaling used here, to T 7 °C. For weak fronts, T 4 °C, the circulation is steady and exhibits two large, antisymmetric gyres separated by a westerly zonal jet. As the front strengthens, 4 < T < 5, the solution undergoes Hopf bifurcation to become periodic in time, with a period of 30 days, and spatially asymmetric. The bifurcation is due to the westerly jet's barotropic instability, which has a symmetric spatial pattern. The addition of this pattern to the antisymmetric mean results in the overall asymmetry of the full solution. The spatial scale and amplitude of the symmetric, internally generated, and antisymmetric, forced mode increase with the strength T of the oceanic front. For T 5 °C, the solution becomes chaotic, but a dominant period still stands out above the broadband noise. This dominant period increases with T overall, but the increase is not monotonic. The oceanic front's intensity dictates the mean speed of the atmospheric jet. Two energy regimes are obtained. 1) In the low-energy regime, the SST front, and hence the atmospheric jet, are weak; in this regime, small meanders develop along the jet axis, and the dominant period is about 25 days. 2) In the high-energy regime, the SST front and the jet are strong; in it, large meanders and eddies develop along the jet, and the dominant oscillation has a period of about 70 days. The physical nature of the two types of oscillations is discussed, as are possible transitions between them when T changes on very long time scales. The results are placed in the context of previous theories of ocean front effects on atmospheric flows, in which baroclinic phenomena are dominant...|$|R

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxxii, 240 leaves ill. 29 cmThe {{mechanism of the}} intraseasonal oscillation in the South Asian summer monsoon region (ISO) is examined with a zonally averaged, atmospheric model (2 D model), a three dimensional, atmospheric intermediate model (3 D model). In both models an ocean mixed layer model is added to examine the influence of air-sea interactions {{on the characteristics of}} the ISO. Without the ocean mixed layer, an interaction between the baroclinic and <b>barotropic</b> modes of <b>atmosphere</b> can produce the ISO in both 2 D and 3 D models. The propagation of precipitation is caused by the phase relationship between convection and the barotropic divergence in the atmosphere. Most importantly, in the northern hemisphere, the vertical advection of July-mean easterly wind shear in regions of convection induces barotropic divergence (convergence) to the north (south) of convection. The resulting moisture convergence in the boundary layer induces the northward propagation of precipitation. The initiation of convection is also produced by the barotropic divergence in the atmosphere. Especially, the strong July-mean vertical motion at IDS causes convergence in the boundary layer between IDS and the equator. The baroclinic mode, on the other hand, acts to enhance existing convection. The differences between the ISO simulated by the 2 D model and 3 D models are caused by the zonal variation of winds, and atmospheric waves in the 3 D model. The zonal divergence of barotropic winds enhances the westward propagation of convection along 18 N, and the barotropic mode of zonal advection drives the continuous northward movement of convection across the equator. The continuous northward propagation across the equator is also enhanced by the atmospheric waves, since the Rossby wave response to the heating source in both hemispheres creates a divergence in the baroclinic mode near the equator. The inclusion of air-sea interactions in the 2 D and 3 D models improves the continuity in the northward propagation of convection. The meridional variation of SST enhances the boundary layer moisture convergence in front of the convection, thereby facilitating the northward propagation of convection. In addition, the SST gradient induced by the dipole type of Rossby-wave-like convection in the Indian ocean may increase the development of convection near the equator...|$|R
50|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{is the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the geostrophic wind due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational force, hydrostatic balance occurs.In a <b>barotropic</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> where density is a function only of pressure, a horizontal pressure gradient will drive a geostrophic wind that is constant with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along isobars, the isobars will be thicker. This causes the slope of the isobars to increase with height. This is illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because isobars are steeper at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there. However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting geostrophic wind at higher elevations must be greater {{in the direction of the}} pressure force.|$|E

The zonal flow is assumed to be characterized by 'thin' atmospheric, nearly geostrophic flow which does not change the gravity darkening and stellar shape determined by the underlying uniformly rotating model. The contribution that such flows make to the continuum spectra of such stars is investigated. The additional rotationally induced Doppler displacement resulting from such zonal wind belts can distort the rotationally broadened stellar lines leading to significant departures from the line profiles predicted by the classical model of rotating stars. Our estimates of the zonal flow velocity stem from the assumption of a relation between it and the latitudinal wavenumber of the zonal velocity field. It is thus possible to create <b>barotropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> models which, in turn, enable the modeling of the stellar spectrum including important spectral lines. In addition, the radiative transfer equations for the Stokes parameters I and Q are solved for the locally plane-parallel atmospheres so that the polarization structure of the radiation field is determined.

40|$|In this paper, a link will be {{established}} between atmospheric ultralow-frequency variability (ULFV) and {{the occurrence of}} homoclinic dynamics in models of large-scale atmospheric flow. It is known that uncoupled atmosphere models possess significant variability on very long timescales (years to decades), which must be generated by internal atmospheric dynamics. The mathematical structure of this long-timescale variability is investigated, using a global two-layer atmosphere model formulated in terms of preferred flow patterns (EOFs). Due to its efficient formulation, this model can simulate an atmospheric flow with realistic features, using {{only a small number}} of degrees of freedom. The 10 -dimensional version of the model possesses both nonzero ultralow-frequency variability and several realistic short timescales. The essence of the ultralong timescale behavior of the 10 D model, which manifests itself as bursting in the atmospheric turbulent energy, can be represented by a four-dimensional subsystem. In this subsystem, strong evidence for the existence of a homoclinic orbit is found. The chaotic dynamics generated by the homoclinic orbit explains the occurrence of ultralong timescales in the model. It is argued that hints of homoclinic dynamics can also be found in more complex models. As an example, a T 21 <b>barotropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> model (231 dimensions) of the Northern Hemisphere is shown to possess behavior that suggests the existence of a homoclinic orbit. 1...|$|E

The integrations of primitive equations for a <b>barotropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with free surface are made. The patterns of initial fields {{are the same as}} Phillips used in 1959 for a test of his map projection system and computation schemes. Ten test runs are performed for a period of 16 'days.

Four runs include the effect of non-linear viscosity with different coefficients, and the remaining three are computed with different amounts of linear viscosity. A noticeable distortion of the flow pattern does not occur in an early period in any run. Analyses of the results suggest that the damping of high frequency oscillation of both long and short wavelengths can be achieved by an iterative time integration scheme, e. g., the modified Euler-backward iteration method, with little effect on the prediction of a trend of the meteorological wave. Either the non-linear or the linear viscosity can be used to suppress a growth of short waves of both low and high frequency modes, if the optimum amount of viscosity for that purpose does not exceed the amount representing the actual diffusion process in the atmosphere.

40|$|To {{understand}} the climate variability and weather prediction in the Earth’s atmosphere, measurements of winds, temperature and wave activities are very crucial. The Earth’s atmosphere {{is believed to}} act as a source and sink for the waves of a broader spectrum with periods from few seconds to years. Generally, the Earth’s atmosphere is stably stratified except the planetary boundary layer and thus makes a reasonable assumption for the presence of atmospheric waves. A <b>barotropic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in a resting basic state is able to support these spectra of waves. These waves move diagonally upward or downward and horizontally. The mean zonal circulation is mainly driven by these atmospheric waves, which are believed to be generated in the troposphere and propagates horizontally and vertically in to the middle and upper atmosphere. These waves transport energy and momentum from one region to another without the transport of material medium thereby impinging the signature of the source region on to the sink region. The waves propagating in Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere are expected to be both anisotropic and dispersive. The anisotropic characteristics of these waves mean that the properties of the waves are not uniform in all the directions. The propagating waves can be characterized by the amplitude and phase, which depends on time and space. When the wave frequency depends on the wavelength (2 /K) then the wave is dispersive. For such waves the group velocity is different from the phase velocity. A better understanding of the vertical coupling by these wave activities will provide a deeper insight into the processes that control the dynamics and energetics of the whole atmosphere.

Conservation of potential vorticity results in the formation of a horizontal jet at low levels south of the mountain. This jet is barotropically unstable and leads to a continuous production of synoptic scale vorticity maxima which separate from the mountain and propagate downstream. Numerical simulations using topography representative of the Sierra Madre in Mexico imply that this mechanism may be important in providing some of the initial disturbances which grow into tropical cyclones in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. The wave train produced in the simulations corresponds to waves with 3 - 7 day periods which have been identified observationally in the eastern North Pacific region. The sensitivity of this effect to the stability of the basic state and the upstream wind speed is investigated. Simulations are also performed which show that the Hoggar and Atlas mountains of west-central Africa block the low-level easterlies resulting in a barotropically unstable jet and a train of vorticity maxima which separate from the mountain and propagate downstream. The spacing of these disturbances is roughly 1600 km and they propagate to the east with a period of about 2. 5 days. These characteristics correspond to those of observed waves in the Africa/Atlantic region. It will also be shown that the unique topography of north-central Africa results in a mid-tropospheric easterly jet which has a maximum between 0 - 10 °E and 15 - 20 °N. The location and magnitude of this jet correspond to the so-called African easterly jet which is usually attributed to the strong surface temperature gradients over the continent of Africa. The numerical simulations presented in this work suggest that the mechanical effect of the topography may provide a constant source of energy for the maintenance of the African easterly jet...|$|E
40|$|Radio-occultation and thermal-infrared {{measurements}} are complementary investigations for sounding planetary atmospheres. The vertical resolution afforded by radio occultations is typically approximately 1 km or better, whereas that from infrared sounding is often comparable to a scale height. On the other hand, an instrument like CIRS can easily generate global maps of temperature and composition, whereas occultation soundings are usually distributed more sparsely. The {{starting point for}} radio-occultation inversions is determining the residual Doppler-shifted frequency, that is the shift in frequency from {{what it would be}} in the absence of the atmosphere. Hence the positions and relative velocities of the spacecraft, target atmosphere, and DSN receiving station must be known to high accuracy. It is not surprising that the inversions can be susceptible to sources of systematic errors. Stratospheric temperature profiles on Titan retrieved from Cassini radio occultations were found to be very susceptible to errors in the reconstructed spacecraft velocities (approximately equal to 1 mm/s). Here the ability to adjust the spacecraft ephemeris so that the profiles matched those retrieved from CIRS limb sounding proved to be critical in mitigating this error. A similar procedure can be used for Saturn, although the sensitivity of its retrieved profiles to this type of error seems to be smaller. One issue that has appeared in inverting the Cassini occultations by Saturn is the uncertainty in its equatorial bulge, that is, the shape in its iso-density surfaces at low latitudes. Typically one approximates that surface as a geopotential surface by assuming a <b>barotropic</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> However, the recent controversy in the equatorial winds, i. e., whether they changed between the Voyager (1981) era and later (after 1996) epochs of Cassini and some Hubble observations, has made it difficult to know the exact shape of the surface, and it leads to uncertainties in the retrieved temperature profiles of one to a few kelvins. This propagates into errors in the retrieved helium abundance, which makes use of thermal-infrared spectra and synthetic spectra computed with retrieved radio-occultation temperature profiles. The highest abundances are retrieved with the faster Voyager-era winds, but even these abundances are somewhat smaller than those retrieved from the thermal-infrared data alone (albeit with larger formal errors). The helium abundance determination is most sensitive to temperatures in the upper troposphere. Further progress may include matching the radio-occultation profiles with those from CIRS limb sounding in the upper stratosphere...|$|E
