5|$|The Japanese convoy was {{a result}} of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters {{decision}} in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the South West Pacific. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae. The plan was understood to <b>be</b> <b>risky,</b> because Allied air power in the area was strong, but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|In giving {{attention}} to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, {{and when the}} Republican state convention met in Zanesville in May 1895, {{it proved to be}} controlled by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the Ohio General Assembly in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> to have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.|$|E

25|$|Leg {{theory can}} be a {{moderately}} successful tactic when used with both fast bowling and spin bowling, particularly leg spin to right-handed batsmen or off spin to left-handed batsmen. However, because it relies on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers Sydney Barnes and Frank Foster used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911-12. In England, at {{around the same time}} Fred Root {{was one of the main}} proponents of the same tactic.|$|E
500|$|A male elk {{can produce}} [...] of antler velvet {{annually}} and on ranches in the United States, Canada and New Zealand, this velvet is collected {{and sold to}} markets in East Asia, where it is used in medicine. Velvet is also considered by some cultures to be an aphrodisiac. However, consuming velvet from elk in North America may <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> since velvet from animals infected with chronic wasting disease may contain prions {{that could result in}} a human getting variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.|$|E
500|$|As for any army, {{logistics}} {{were always}} a problem. In his initial campaigns in Byzantine territories, especially in Anatolia, Heraclius likely supplied his troops by requisitioning from his surroundings. During Heraclius' offensive raids into Persia, each time the harsh conditions of winter forced him to desist, partly because both his and the Persian horses needed stored fodder in winter quarters. Forcing his troops to campaign in the winter would <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> as Maurice had been overthrown due to his poor treatment of his troops in winter. Edward Luttwak believes that the Göktürks with their [...] "hardy horses (or ponies)" [...] that could survive [...] "in almost any terrain that had almost any vegetation" [...] were essential in Heraclius' winter campaign in hilly northeast Iran in 627. During the campaign, they took the provisions from Persian lands. With the victory at Nineveh and the capture of Persian palaces, they no longer had issues with supplying their troops in foreign territories and with winter conditions.|$|E

We consider two models of savings demand: one in which future labor income <b>is</b> <b>risky</b> and {{one in which the}} return on savings <b>is</b> <b>risky.</b> In each model, we examine the e¤ects of anN th-degree stochastic change in the risk. For each case, we establish necessary and su ¢ cient conditions on preferences that will guarantee that the individual increases his or her level of savings. We show how in the case of only labor income risk, any changes in savings are purely due to precautionary savings motives. For the case where the return on savings <b>is</b> <b>risky,</b> we show how both a precautionary e¤ect and a substitution e¤ect need to be analyzed...|$|R
500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{began working}} on the project in early 2007. They found {{difficulties}} in recruiting a production company for the shooting of [...] "A Beautiful Lie" [...] since most operators passed on the project, who considered it to <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> and dangerous. After six months, Yamani Watkins and Edy Enriquez attached to produce, while Elliott Lester was set to co-direct the short film. The crew spent a month in Ilulissat, Greenland, preparing pre-production; almost 200 different kinds of insurance were required to shoot the video. Determined to offset the impact of filming on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council on strategies that minimized fuel consumption on the shoot, using renewable energy products. Jared Leto described the whole project as [...] "one of the most painstaking and difficult creative challenge we have ever undertaken as a band. It has also {{been one of the}} most inspiring – a rare opportunity to reach into our imagination and push the limits of what's possible." [...] The short film for [...] "A Beautiful Lie" [...] marked the first music video entirely shot on location 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland.|$|E
500|$|Most of the 20th Division was {{landed at}} Wewak from naval high speed {{transports}} on 19 January 1943. The {{bulk of the}} 41st Division followed on 12 February. Imamura [...] and Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, {{the commander of the}} South East Area Fleet, developed a plan to move the command post of the headquarters of the Japanese XVIII Army and {{the main body of the}} 51st Division from Rabaul to Lae on 3 March, followed by moving the remainder of the 20th Division to Madang on 10 March. This plan was acknowledged to <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> because Allied air power in the area was strong. The XVIII Army staff held war games that predicted losses of four out of ten transports, and between 30 and 40 aircraft. They gave the operation only a 50–50 chance of success. On the other hand, if the troops were landed at Madang, they faced a march of more than [...] over inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads. [...] To augment the three naval and two army fighter groups in the area assigned to protect the convoy, the Imperial Japanese Navy temporarily detached 18 fighters from the aircraft carrier ’s fighter group from Truk to Kavieng.|$|E
500|$|Wired said Kaspersky's critics {{accuse him}} of using the company to spy on users for Russian intelligence. Russian {{telecommunications}} companies for example are required by federal law in Russia {{to cooperate with the}} government's military and spy operations if asked. Kaspersky said his company has never been asked to tamper with its software for espionage and called the accusations [...] "cold war paranoia." [...] According to Wired, Kaspersky staffers argue [...] "not unconvincingly" [...] that spying on users would hurt its business and its relationship with the Russian FSB, the KGB's successor, is limited. According to Gartner, [...] "There's no evidence that they have any back doors in their software or any ties to the Russian mafia or state... but there is still a concern that you can’t operate in Russia without being controlled by the ruling party.” Computing mocked some of the more extreme accusations of espionage, but said it would be unlikely for a Russian business to grow to the size of Kaspersky Lab without relationships within the Russian government. NPR journalists also said it was unlikely Kaspersky was using its software for espionage, because it would <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> for the company's business, but said Kaspersky showed an unusual disinterest in Russia-based cybercrime.|$|E
5000|$|Time {{consistency}} is also {{a property}} in financial risk related to dynamic risk measures. The purpose of the time consistent property is to categorize the risk measures which satisfy the condition that if portfolio (A) <b>is</b> more <b>risky</b> than portfolio (B) {{at some time in}} the future, then it is guaranteed to <b>be</b> more <b>risky</b> at any time prior to that point. This is an important property since if it were not to hold then there is an event (with probability of occurring greater than 0) such that B <b>is</b> <b>riskier</b> than A at time [...] although it is certain that A <b>is</b> <b>riskier</b> than B at time [...] As the name suggests a time inconsistent risk measure can lead to inconsistent behavior in financial risk management.|$|R

2500|$|A 2007 study {{reported}} that two large population surveys found [...] "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women." [...] Among men who have anal sex with other men, anal sex without use of a condom {{is considered to be}} very risky behavior. A person who inserts their penis into an infected partner is at risk because sexually transmitted diseases (STDS/STIs) can enter through the urethra or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can <b>be</b> <b>risky.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Interest rate {{targets are}} a vital tool of {{monetary}} policy and {{are taken into}} account when dealing with variables like investment, inflation, and unemployment. The central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country's economy. However, a low interest rate as a macro-economic policy can <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble, in which large amounts of investments are poured into the real-estate market and stock market. [...] In developed economies, interest-rate adjustments are thus made to keep inflation within a target range for the health of economic activities or cap the interest rate concurrently with economic growth to safeguard economic momentum.|$|E

He once remarked, [...] "In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin {{to worry about the}} character of the next generation... It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and until we have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> to try and do anything in the way of eugenics...

2500|$|The {{volatility}} of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) {{is lower than}} that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than stocks, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of dividend payments. Bonds are often liquid – it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities – and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. [...] Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes bankrupt, its bondholders will often receive some money back (the recovery amount), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> but less risky than stocks: ...|$|E
2500|$|MacDougall {{contacted}} attorney John Green Jr., {{who advised}} him {{the chances of}} him winning the case were 70 percent, and that a trial would <b>be</b> <b>risky</b> and costly.

At his first hearing on the afternoon of July 22, he pleaded guilty to the charge of [...] "illegally operating a satellite uplink transmitter", a violation of 47 U.S.C[...] Under an agreement with Gentile, MacDougall plea bargained and received a $5,000 fine, was put on unsupervised probation for one year, and had his amateur radio license suspended for one year. That same day, he was arraigned and freed on a $5,000 bond. MacDougall's plea bargain was confirmed at his sentencing by Judge Howard T. Snyder on August 26. Lawyers for Hughes Communications subsequently reviewed the option of taking MacDougall to civil court, but chose not to take any further action.|$|E
