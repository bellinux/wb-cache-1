5|$|Camouflage is a soft-tissue {{feature that}} is rarely {{preserved}} in the fossil record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the Cretaceous period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin, reveal that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light <b>bellies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light <b>bellies.</b> The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were exhausted and virtually naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had swollen <b>bellies</b> due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all were suffering from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases. Some children died after the effort of simply getting up.|$|E

50|$|Fire {{fans are}} often used in <b>belly</b> dance, {{especially}} in tribal fusion <b>belly</b> dance styles. <b>Belly</b> dancers typically move fire fans more slowly and {{in combination with the}} layered hip and arm dance movements distinctive to the art of <b>belly</b> dance.|$|R
50|$|Tribal Fusion <b>Belly</b> Dance is {{a modern}} Western form of <b>belly</b> dance which was created by fusing American Tribal Style <b>belly</b> dance and American Cabaret <b>belly</b> dance. Artists {{frequently}} incorporate elements from Popping, Hip Hop, 'Egyptian' or 'Cabaret' <b>belly</b> dance, as well as movement principles from traditional forms such as Flamenco, Kathak, Odissi, and other folkloric and classical dance styles.|$|R
5|$|Young velvet <b>bellies</b> feed {{mainly on}} krill and small bony fish, {{transitioning}} to squid and shrimp {{as they grow}} larger. There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age. This species exhibits a number of adaptations to living in the deep sea, such as specialized T-cells and liver proteins {{for dealing with the}} higher concentrations of heavy metals found there. Velvet <b>bellies</b> often carry a heavy parasite load. It is ovoviviparous, giving birth to litters of six to 20 young every two to three years. This species has virtually no commercial value, but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries. Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-sepia striped backs, and grey-white <b>bellies,</b> breasts, and throats. Males {{have some}} buff {{markings}} on their breasts, and less sharp brown spots on their napes than females. The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology is poorly known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve in Colombia and the Sierra de Perijá National Park in Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Like other bows, {{they lost}} {{importance}} {{with the introduction}} and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made with fiberglass <b>bellies</b> and backs with a natural or man-made core.|$|E
50|$|Pork <b>belly</b> is a {{boneless}} cut of fatty {{meat from}} the <b>belly</b> of a pig. Pork <b>belly</b> is popular in East Asian, European and North American cuisine.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate the genetic parameters for pork <b>belly</b> traits and muscles in Yorkshire pigs. Each pork <b>belly</b> was cut into nine parts perpendicular to the thoracic vertebrae (6 th to 14 th). Traits of <b>belly</b> muscles including the deep pectoral, latissimus dorsi, cutaneous trunci, rectus abdominis, external and internal abdominal oblique from 382 purebred pigs were recorded and analyzed using SAS Package (9. 1) and Derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood methods. Heritability estimates for <b>belly</b> traits ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 49, while they were 0. 12 to 0. 66 for <b>belly</b> muscles. Moderate to high heritability estimates were noted in <b>belly</b> weight (0. 33), <b>belly</b> length (0. 28), and <b>belly</b> width (0. 49). In <b>belly</b> muscles, the latissimus dorsi and deep pectoral, which are located only in the 6 th to 9 th vertebrae sections, were found to have heritability estimates ranging from 0. 21 to 0. 29 and 0. 23 to 0. 35, respectively. Strong heritability estimates were observed in the 7 th to 13 th sections of cutaneous trunci muscle ranging from 0. 42 to 0. 66. Genetic correlations of latissimus dorsi m. with <b>belly</b> length were positive (0. 50), while cutaneous trunci m. with <b>belly</b> weight also revealed a positive relationship that ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 47. The estimated genetic parameters indicate that <b>belly</b> weight can be improved by genetic selection. Differences in the levels of heritability occurred among various parameters of Yorkshire pork <b>belly,</b> which should be considered when performing selection to improve pork <b>belly</b> quality. Moreover, these results can provide valuable information that can be used as the basis for further investigations to improve pork <b>belly...</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>belly</b> chain or waist chain are {{the popular}} English terms for the Kamarband/Udiyanam, {{which is a}} type of body jewelry worn around the waist. Some <b>belly</b> chains attach to a navel piercing; these are also called [...] "pierced <b>belly</b> chains". They are often made of silver or gold. Sometimes a thread is used around the waist instead of a chain. A <b>belly</b> chain is a common {{adornment}} for <b>belly</b> dancers.|$|R
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their <b>bellies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and <b>bellies</b> {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E
5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy loads of conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black <b>bellies</b> to defeat searchlights.|$|E

40|$|As both {{a scholar}} and a <b>belly</b> dancer, I believe that <b>belly</b> dance is {{recognizable}} on aesthetic grounds. In {{addition to the}} movements that <b>belly</b> dancers typically perform—muscle isolations, undulations, graceful hand motions and turns, and lots of hip work—belly dancers wear costumes that are visually identifiable as <b>belly</b> dance costumes. While this description may seem tautological, there are recognizable standards both {{in the public sphere}} and among dancers for what constitutes the <b>belly</b> dance image—or images, as <b>belly</b> dance is a diverse phenomenon that encompasses teaching, learning, performing, watching, socializing, and costuming...|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Underbelly Limited and By Popular Demand Productions Limited {{were set}} up to turn the Underbelly into a {{professional}} venue {{with a number of}} performance spaces and a wide range of productions. The venue was set up with performance spaces in the Iron <b>Belly,</b> White <b>Belly</b> and Big <b>Belly.</b> The <b>Belly</b> Laugh (then named the <b>Belly</b> Bar) was also used for late night cabaret as well as the venue's second bar. Space downstairs which is now used for <b>Belly</b> Dance was used to exhibit a film installation by Nick Hornby.|$|R
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the house mouse (Mus musculus). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and their heads and <b>bellies</b> were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's honeyeaters. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned honeyeaters, noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange <b>bellies</b> have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended <b>bellies</b> and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E

5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their <b>bellies,</b> screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E
