He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper Bedfordshire on Sunday after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of Bedford.|$|E

Strains may <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis. Serologic tests and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which measure variola virus-specific immunoglobulin and antigen have also been developed to assist in the diagnosis of infection.|$|E

5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> the {{prominence}} of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, {{the prominence of}} Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle.

The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E

Review of histological slides was done, when appropriate. The duodenal specimens were composed of 567 benign lesions and 48 malignant lesions. The 567 benign lesions were composed of chronic non-specific duodenitis in 334 cases (60. 0 %), duodenal ulcer in 101 cases (17, 8 %), heterotopic gastric mucosa in 81 cases (14. 3 %), hyperplastic polyp in 16 cases (2. 8 %), Brunner's gland hyperplasia in 14 cases (2. 5 %), Brunner's gland adenoma in 8 cases (1. 4 %), lymphoid polyp in 5 cases (0. 8 %), tubular adenoma in 4 cases (0. 7 %), lymphangioma in 2 cases (0. 4 %), endocrine nests in 1 case (0. 2 %), and amyloidosis in 1 case (0. 2 %).
