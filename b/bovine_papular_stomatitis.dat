40|$|ABSTRACT. Molecular {{analysis}} of parapoxvirus envelope genes was performed. Parapoxvirus DNA was detected in eight calves from eight farms in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, between April and September 2010. Seven of the detected viruses {{were identified as}} <b>bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (BPSV) by sequencing, because their nucleotide identity was more than 96. 8 % similar compared with BPSV strain V 660. Among them, two formed a subgroup, because their amplicons were digested with Xmn I (a marker for BPSV) and Hinc II and exhibited a T 61 C nucleotide substitution in the sequenced region. The remaining virus was pseudocowpox virus {{that had not been}} reported previously in Japan. Our results demonstrate the presence of a new BPSV variant in Japan with genetic variability in the envelope gene.

40|$|Background: Orf virus (ORFV) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} contagious pustular dermatitis {{and is the}} prototype of the genus Parapoxvirus (PPV). It causes a severe exanthematous dermatitis that afflicts domestic and wild small ruminants. Case presentation: In the present study, an outbreak of proliferative dermatitis in farmed goats. The presence of ORFV in tissue scrapings from the lips was confirmed by B 2 L gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The molecular characterization of the ORFV was performed using PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the B 2 L gene. Conclusion: The results of this investigation indicated that the outbreak was caused by infection with an ORFV that was closely related genetically to Nantou (DQ 934351), which was isolated from the Tai wan province of China and Hoping (EU 935106), which originated from South Korea in 2008.

This effort has the potential to improve our nation's ability to discriminate between foreign animal diseases and those that are endemic using a single assay, thereby increasing our ability to protect animal populations of high economic importance in the United States. Under 2005 DHS funding we have developed multiplexed (MUX) nucleic-acid-based PCR assays that combine foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) detection with rule-out tests for two other foreign animal diseases Vesicular Exanthema of Swine (VESV) and Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD) and four other domestic viral diseases Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Bovine Herpes Virus 1 (BHV- 1 or Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitus IBR), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Parapox virus complex (which includes <b>Bovine</b> <b>Papular</b> <b>Stomatitis</b> Virus BPSV, Orf of sheep, and Pseudocowpox). Under 2006 funding we have developed a Multiplexed PCR [MUX] porcine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for VESV and SVD foreign animal diseases in addition to one other domestic vesicular animal disease vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and one domestic animal disease of swine porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). We have also developed a MUX bovine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for the two bovine foreign animal diseases malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), rinderpest virus (RPV) and the domestic diseases vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), infectious bovine rhinotracheitus virus (BHV- 1), bluetongue virus (BTV), and the Parapox viruses which are of two bovine types <b>bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (BPSV) and psuedocowpox (PCP). This document provides details of signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used. A condensed summary of the development, testing and performance of the multiplexed assay panel was presented in a 126 page separate document, entitled 'Development and Characterization of A Multiplexed RT-PCR Species Specific Assay for Bovine and one for Porcine Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Rule-Out'. This supplemental document provides additional details of large amount of data collected for signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used for all steps in the assay development and utilization processes. In contrast to last years effort, the development of the bovine and porcine panels is pending additional work to complete analytical characterization of FMDV, VESV, VSV, SVD, RPV and MCF. The signature screening process and final panel composition impacts this effort. The unique challenge presented this year was having strict predecessor limitations in completing characterization, where efforts at LLNL must preceed efforts at PIADC, such challenges were alleviated in the 2006 reporting by having characterization data from the interlaboratory comparison and at Plum Island under AgDDAP project.

Here we report the genomic sequences and comparative analysis of BPSV strain BV-AR 02 and ORFV strains OV-SA 00, isolated from a goat, and OV-IA 82, isolated from a sheep. Parapoxvirus (PPV) BV-AR 02, OV-SA 00, and OV-IA 82 genomes {{range in size from}} 134 to 139 kbp, with an average nucleotide composition of 64 % G+C. BPSV and ORFV genomes contain 131 and 130 putative genes, respectively, and share colinearity over 127 genes, 88 of which are conserved in all characterized chordopoxviruses. BPSV and ORFV contain 15 and 16 open reading frames (ORFs), respectively, which lack similarity to other poxvirus or cellular proteins. All genes with putative roles in pathogenesis, including a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -like gene, are present in both viruses; however, BPSV contains two extra ankyrin repeat genes absent in ORFV. Interspecies sequence variability is observed in all functional classes of genes but is highest in putative virulence/host range genes, including genes unique to PPV. At the amino acid level, OV-SA 00 is 94 % identical to OV-IA 82 and 71 % identical to BV-AR 02.

40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (BPSV) is a Parapoxvirus that induces acute {{pustular}} skin lesions in {{cattle and}} is transmissible to humans. Previous {{studies have shown}} that BPSV encodes a distinctive chemokine-binding protein (CBP). Chemokines are critically involved in the trafficking of immune cells to sites of inflammation and infected tissue, suggesting that the CBP plays a role in immune evasion by preventing immune cells reaching sites of infection. We hypothesised that the BPSV-CBP binds a wide range of inflammatory chemokines particularly those involved in BPSV skin infection, and inhibits the recruitment of immune cells from the blood into inflamed skin. Molecular analysis of the purified protein revealed that the BPSV-CBP is a homodimeric polypeptide with a MW of 82. 4 kDa whilst a comprehensive screen of inflammatory chemokines by surface plasmon resonance showed high-affinity binding to a range of chemokines within the CXC, CC and XC subfamilies. Structural analysis of BPSV-CBP, based on the crystal structure of orf virus CBP, provided a probable explanation for these chemokine specificities at a molecular level. Functional analysis of the BPSV-CBP using transwell migration assays demonstrated that it potently inhibited chemotaxis of murine neutrophils and monocytes in response to CXCL 1, CXCL 2 as well as CCL 2, CCL 3 and CCL 5 chemokines. In order {{to examine the effects of}} CBP in vivo, we used murine skin models to determine its impact on inflammatory cell recruitment such as that observed during BPSV infection. Intradermal injection of BPSV-CBP blocked the influx of neutrophils and monocytes in murine skin in which inflammation was induced with lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, intradermal injection of BPSV-CBP into injured skin, which more closely mimics BPSV lesions, delayed the influx of neutrophils and reduced the recruitment of MHC-II+ immune cells to the wound bed.

Initial signs of disease included excessive lacrimation, pyrexia, nasal discharge and coughing. As the disease progressed, effected animals exhibited respiratory embarassment (especially upon exertion), malaise, low weight gains, and pneumonitis (as determined {{by the presence of}} dyspnea, and by stethoscopic examination for the detection of abnormal lung sounds). Forty-two one to five day old calves were randomly chosen for the study. Twenty-one calves were vaccinated with bovine adenovirus type 3 experimental vaccine. The vaccine consisted of a killed viral preparation with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, and was prepared by a commercial biological firm. The remaining twenty-one calves were unvaccinated controls. Two of the vaccinated calves experienced pneumonia, nine-conjunctivitis and two [...] keratoconjunctivitis. No fatalities occurred among the vaccinated calves. Fourteen of the vaccinated calves produced a four-fold or greater rise in the titer of serum-viral neutralizing antibodies to bovine adenovirus type 3, strain 5 C. Five calves had high levels of colostral viral serum-neutralizing antibodies which interferred with active antibody production. Two calves had low levels of colostral antibodies and low levels of active antibody production. No adverse side-effect was noted at the vaccination site in any of the vaccinated animals.

The animals were autopsied and blood and tissue samples were collected for serology (alphaherpes- and pestivirus; virus neutralization test) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR; parapoxvirus; B 2 L gene) investigations. Autopsy revealed that 39 of 48 animals (81 %) had died of emaciation. Parapoxvirus-specific DNA was detected in samples from 6 of 48 animals (12. 5 %; liver, parotid salivary gland and/or pulmonary lymph nodes). A DNA sequence of 376 base pairs from a PCR amplicon obtained from a liver sample from one animal showed 98 - 99 % identity with orf virus strain Orf- 11 and reindeer parapoxvirus isolates from Norway and Finland (1992 and 1994), 92 - 93 % similarity with pseudocowpoxvirus and 87 % similarity with <b>bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus. Alphaherpes- and pestivirus antibodies were detected in 10 % and 33 % of the animals, respectively. These results indicates that parapoxvirus, presumably orf-virus, is present among reindeer also in Finnmark, although contagious ecthyma has never been reported in reindeer in this important reindeer herding area. Furthermore, they show that herpes- and pestiviruses are still endemic in reindeer herds in Finnmark. The nature of these viruses {{and their impact on}} reindeer health and reproduction and reindeer herding economy should be further addressed, as well as the possibility that these viruses may be transferred between reindeer and domestic animals in this region. Abstract in Norwegian / Sammendrag: I lÃ¸pet av perioden mars-mai 2000 ble 48 reinsdyrkadavre (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) samlet inn fra vinterbeiter og kalvingsomrÃ¥der fra to flokker i Vest-Finnmark og to i Ã˜st-Finnmark, Norge. Dyrene ble obdusert, og blod og vevsprÃ¸ver ble samlet for pÃ¥visning av antistoffer mot alfaherpes- og pestivirus i blod(serologi) og tilstedevÃ¦relse av parapoxvirus-DNA i vev (Polymerase kjedereaksjon, PCR; parapoxvirus B 2 L genet). Obduksjonen viste at 39 av de 48 dyrene (81 %) hadde dÃ¸dd av avmagring. Parapoxvirus-spesifikt DNA ble funnet i prÃ¸ver av lever, spyttkjertel (Gl. parotis) og/eller lungelymfeknuter fra 6 av de 48 dyrene (12, 5 %). En DNA sekvens pÃ¥ 376 basepar fra PCR-oppformeringsproduktet fra en leverprÃ¸ve hadde 98 - 99 % likhet med orf-virus (Orf- 11) og parapoxvirus isolert fra reinsdyr i Norge og Finland (1992 og 1994), 92 - 93 % likhet med pseudocowpoxvirus og 87 % likhet med bovint papulÃ¦r stomatittvirus, hvorav de to siste parapoxvirusartene er assosiert med storfÃ©.

40|$|Parapoxvirus (PPV) are {{member of}} a genus in the family poxviridae which {{currently}} encompasses four species: the prototype orf virus (OV), <b>bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (BPSV), pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) and parapoxvirus of New Zealand red deer (PVNZ). PPVs cause widespread, but localized diseases of small and large ruminants and {{they can also be}} transmitted to man. Knowledge of the molecular biology of PPV is still limited as compared to orthopoxviruses, especially vaccinia virus (VACV). The PPV genome displays a high G+C content and relatively small size for poxvirus. Coventional electron microscopy displays PPV virions with ovoid shape and slightly smaller in size than the brickshaped orthopoxviruses. The most striking feature, which readily enables identification of PPV, is a tubule-like structure that surrounds the particle in a spiral fashion. PPV genome organization and content is very similar to that of other poxviruses, the central region contain 88 genes which are present in all poxviruse, in contrast the terminal regions are variable and contain a set of genes unique to the genus PPV. Genes in the near-terminal regions of the genome are frequently not essential for growth in cultured cells encoding factors with important roles in virushost interactions including modulating host immune responses and determining host range. Recently it was suggested that the open reading frames (ORFs) 109 and 110 of the OV genome have a major role in determining species specificity during natural infection in sheep and goats. This hypothesis is based on the analysis of a few number of sequences of different sheep and goats viral isolates. PPV replicate into the cytoplasm of infected cells and produce three structurally different infectious particles: the intracellular mature virions (IMV), intracellular enveloped virions (IEV) and the extracellular enveloped virions (EEV). The vaccinia A 33 R and A 34 R hotologue proteins encoded by the ORFS 109 and 110 are expressed in the envelope of the IEV and EEV. The F 1 L immunodominant protein of orf virus is the major component of the surface tubule structure of the IMV and can post-translationaly insert into membranes via Cterminal, hydrofobic anchor sequence like its orthologue VACV H 3 L protein. Moreover the F 1 L protein binds to glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface and has an important role in IMV adsorption to mammalian cells. In this study we investigated the morphogenesis of the PPV through the construction of a mutant virus deleted of the F 1 L protein. A study of the deleted virus life cycle was conducted in different type of cells and its morphology was observed with electron microscopy. It was demonstared that F 1 L protein have important role in morphogenesis and infectivity. Moreover it is essential to determine the spiral fashion of the tubule like structure of the virion surface. Some pathogenetic aspects of the PPV infection were studied, in particular the protein implicated in the host range were analysed in detail. An experimental infection with OV and PCPV was conducted in goats and sheep. After infection, the severity of the lesions were comparable in both the animal species. The OV did not result in severe disease neither in sheep nor in goats, suggesting that host factors, rather than virus strain characteristics, may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of the Parapoxvirus infections. The PCPV failed to produce any lesion in both sheep and goats, ruling out the possibility of any recombination between PCPV and OV during natural infection in these animal species. The phylogenetic analysis of the ORFs 109 and 110 from several goats and sheep viral isolates showed a clustering based on the antigenic content of the protein that was independent from species and geographic origin...|$|E
40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{is a highly}} {{infectious}} and contagious viral disease affecting bovidae (cattle, zebus, domestic buffaloes, yaks), sheep, goats, swine, all wild ruminants and suidae. Camelidae (camels, dromedaries, llamas, vicunas) have low susceptibility. Foot and mouth disease {{is caused by a}} RNS virus of the family Picornaviridae, genus Aphthovirus. There are seven immunologically distinct serotypes: A, O, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, Asia 1. Foot and mouth disease causes significant economic loss both to countries who manage it as an endemic disease (with or without vaccination), as well as those FMD free countries which may become infected. The mortality rate is low in adult animals, but often higher in young due to myocarditis. Foot and mouth disease is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America (sporadic outbreaks in free areas). The Office of International Epizootics (OIE), also referred to the World Organization for Animal Health maintains an official list of free countries and zones. 1 The OIE Terrestrial Code (Chapter 2. 2. 10) provides detailed information on the categories of freedom that can be allocated to a country as well as guidelines for the surveillance for foot and mouth disease (Appendix 3. 8. 7). In short, countries may be completely free of FMD, free with vaccination or infected with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). Source of FMDV include incubating and clinically affected animals with virus present in breath, saliva, faeces, urine, milk and semen. In experimental settings virus has been detected in milk several days before the onset of clinical signs 2. Additional sources of virus are meat and by-products in which pH has remained above 6. 0 as well as persistently infected carrier animals. Carrier animals may include cattle and water buffalo; convalescent animals and exposed vaccinates (virus persists in the oropharynx for up to 30 months in cattle or longer in buffalo, 9 months in sheep). Pigs do not become carriers. It has been shown that the African Cape buffalo are the major maintenance host of SAT serotypes. FMDV transmission can occur by either direct or indirect contact. Indirect transmission can occur via contaminated animate vectors (humans, etc.), inanimate vectors (vehicles, implements) or airborne transmission. Indirect disease transmission via animate or inanimate vectors can {{play a major role in}} disease transmission. Good biosecurity can significantly reduce this type of transmission. Airborne transmission is often debated and is known to be serotype and species specific as well as require specific environmental conditions to occur. Airborne transmission is favored in temperate zones and has been postulated to occur over distances of up to 60 km overland and 300 km by sea. Foot and mouth disease virus is an unenveloped virus which is preserved by refrigeration and freezing and progressively inactivated by temperatures above 50 C. FMDV is highly sensitive to pH change and is inactivated by pH 9. 0. There are many disinfectants which are effective against FMDV including sodium hydroxide (2 %), sodium carbonate (4 %), and citric acid (0. 2 %). FMDV is resistant to iodophores, quaternary ammonium compounds, hypochlorite and phenol, especially in the presence of organic matter. The virus can survive in lymph nodes and bone marrow at neutral pH, but is destroyed in muscle when is pH < 6. 0 i. e. after rigor mortis. FMDV can persist in contaminated feed/commodities and the environment for over to 1 month, depending on the temperature and pH conditions. The incubation period for FMD is 2 - 14 days. Animals transition through latent (infected but not infectious), subclinically infected (infectious but lacking clinical signs) clinically infected and recovered disease states. In cattle clinical signs include pyrexia, reluctance to eat, bruxism, drooling, lameness, treading or stamping of the feet and decreased milk production. Most clinical signs are related to the development and subsequent rupturing of vesicles at the coronary band and in the oral cavity. Vesicles and ulcerations can also occur on the mammary gland. Recovery in adult animals usually occurs in 8 - 15 days. Clinical signs for most serotypes are less dramatic in sheep and goats. Swine can develop very severe coronary band lesions and high mortality in piglets has been observed. One of the challenges of diagnosing FMD is that it may be clinically similar to several other vesicular or ulcerative diseases. FMD is clinically indistinguishable from Vesicular stomatitis, Swine vesicular disease and Vesicular exanthema of swine. It may also resemble Bovine viral diarrhea, Mucosal disease, Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Bluetongue, <b>Bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis,</b> Bovine mammillitis and Rinderpest...|$|E
40|$|Parapoxviruses (PPVs) are {{zoonotic}} viruses {{which cause}} contagious pustular skin infections of sheep, goats and cattle worldwide. In addition, {{they have more}} recently been shown to infect other animals such as red deer, seals, camels and reindeer. Cases of contagious pustular stomatitis in Finnish reindeer have been reported for many years. This economically important disease occurs typically during winter and {{is more common in}} the southern parts of the reindeer herding districts than in the north. The first severe outbreak occurred in the winter 1992 - 1993, and during the winter of 1999 - 2000 and in the late winter 2007 outbreaks of the disease were again observed. Usual symptoms include diminished appetite, drooling, fever, and later erosions and ulcerative lesions in the mouth. The aims of this study were to establish specific and rapid detection methods for the causative agent of the disease and characterize the viruses circulating in Finland. The causative agent of reindeer pustular stomatitis was originally considered to be Orf virus (ORFV) of the genus Parapoxvirus. PCR methods amplifying different regions of the PPV genomes were developed to analyse clinical samples obtained from outbreaks of the disease in reindeer and later from viruses isolated from the disease of sheep and cattle in Finland. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the Finnish PPVs, known members of the genus Parapoxvirus and selected members of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae were conducted to identify the virus species isolated from reindeer. The results showed that the reindeer PPV from 1999 - 2000 is most closely related to the cattle PPV Pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) whereas the PPV strains from the winter of 1992 - 1993 outbreak grouped with sheep ORFV strains. Reindeer samples from the 2007 outbreak were identified as both PCPV and ORFV. Analysis of the similarity between genes of reindeer PCPV and ORFV isolates, Finnish sheep ORFV and cattle PCPV isolates indicated that these viruses have been circulating among Finnish reindeer, cattle and sheep at least ten years. Since the initial classification of the viruses causing pustular stomatitis in Finnish reindeer relied solely on the partial sequence analysis of virion core- and EEV envelope phospholipase protein sequences, the genome of PCPV-like reindeer isolate (F 00. 120 R) was sequenced by shotgun sequencing of plasmid sublibraries of cosmids covering the central region of the genome, and by sequencing transposon random insertion libraries of plasmids derived from each end of the genome. The F 00. 120 R and the genomic sequence of a reference strain of PCPV (VR 634) were annotated and analyzed in this study. This first characterization of PCPV genomes revealed that F 00. 120 R and VR 634 are 135 and 145 kb in length and contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively. The organization of their genomes was found to be similar to that of other PPVs and both included 88 predicted genes that are conserved across all sequenced poxviruses. F 00. 120 R was found to have four, possibly fragmented, genes at the left terminus and another near the central region of the genome that are not present in ORFV or <b>Bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (BPSV; another PPV) genomes. In addition, the F 00. 120 R genome was found to lack six genes seen near the right genome terminus of other PPVs. Comparing the PPV proteomes and whole genome phylogenetic analyses confirmed the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the PPV genus and verified that the virus causing pustular stomatitis in reindeer in 1999 - 2000 can be classified as PCPV. The observed six gene deletion at the right terminus of the F 00. 120 R genome was further investigated in an attempt to use it in differentiating PCPV and ORFV causing pustular stomatitis in reindeer. The preliminary PCR analyses of wild type virus and early passages of F 00. 120 R implied that the deletion of genes may have arisen during cell culture of the virus. The sequence around the deleted region was determined by sequencing two cloned overlapping PCR fragments from F 00. 120 R wt virus isolated from lesion material. The same region was sequenced from an Italian PCPV field isolate (It 1303). Further PCR analyses together with sequence determination showed that a 5431 bp sequence containing genes 116 - 121 was likely to have been deleted from the F 00. 120 R genome prior to the 7 th passage in cell culture. In addition, genes 116 - 121 were present in It 1303 and in other isolates of reindeer and bovine PCPV isolated in Finland during the years 2005 - 2010. These results indicate that the genome of reindeer PCPV is about 140 kbp in length and has 137 genes instead of previously estimated length of 135 kbp and 131 genes; it contains homologues of all known ORFV genes and this analysis further reinforces the close genetic relationship between PCPV and ORFV...|$|E
40|$|The Poxviruses are {{a family}} of double {{stranded}} DNA (dsDNA) viruses that cause disease in many species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Their genomes {{range in size from}} 135 to 365 kbp and show conservation in both organization and content. In particular, the central genomic regions of the chordopoxvirus subfamily (those capable of infecting vertebrates) contain 88 genes which are present in all the virus species characterised to date and which mostly occur in the same order and orientation. In contrast, however, the terminal regions of the genomes frequently contain genes that are species or genera-specific and that are not essential for the growth of the virus in vitro but instead often encode factors with important roles in vivo including modulation of the host immune response to infection and determination of the host range of the virus. The Parapoxviruses (PPV), of which Orf virus is the prototypic species, represent a genus within the chordopoxvirus subfamily of Poxviridae and are characterised by their ability to infect ruminants and humans. The genus currently contains four recognised species of virus, <b>bovine</b> <b>papular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (BPSV) and pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) both of which infect cattle, orf virus (OV) that infects sheep and goats, and parapoxvirus of red deer in New Zealand (PVNZ). The ORFV genome has been fully sequenced, as has that of BPSV, and is 138 kb in length encoding 132 genes. The vast majority of these genes allow the virus to replicate in the cytoplasm of the infected host cell and therefore encode proteins involved in replication, transcription and metabolism of nucleic acids. These genes are well conserved between all known genera of poxviruses. There is however another class of genes, located {{at either end of the}} linear dsDNA genome, that encode proteins which are non-essential for replication and generally dictate host range and virulence of the virus. The non-essential genes are often the most variable within and between species of virus and therefore are potentially useful for diagnostic purposes. Given their role in subverting the host-immune response to infection they are also targets for novel therapeutics. The function of only a relatively small number of these proteins has been elucidated and there are several genes whose function still remains obscure principally because there is little similarity between them and proteins of known function in current sequence databases. It is thought that by selectively removing some of the virulence genes, or at least neutralising the proteins in some way, current vaccines could be improved. The evolution of poxviruses has been proposed to be an adaptive process involving frequent events of gene gain and loss, such that the virus co-evolves with its specific host. Gene capture or horizontal gene transfer from the host to the virus is considered an important source of new viral genes including those likely to be involved in host range and those enabling the virus to interfere with the host immune response to infection. Given the low rate of nucleotide substitution, recombination can be seen as an essential evolutionary driving force although it is likely underestimated. Recombination in poxviruses is intimately linked to DNA replication with both viral and cellular proteins participate in this recombination-dependent replication. It has been shown, in other poxvirus genera, that recombination between isolates and perhaps even between species does occur, thereby providing another mechanism for the acquisition of new genes and for the rapid evolution of viruses. Such events may result in viruses that have a selective advantage over others, for example in re-infections (a characteristic of the PPV), or in viruses that are able to jump the species barrier and infect new hosts. Sequence data related to viral strains isolated from goats suggest that possible recombination events may have occurred between OV and PCPV (Ueda et al. 2003). The recombination events are frequent during poxvirus replication and comparative genomic analysis of several poxvirus species has revealed that recombinations occur frequently on the right terminal region. Intraspecific recombination can occur between strains of the same PPV species, but also interspecific recombination can happen depending on enough sequence similarity to enable recombination between distinct PPV species. The most important pre-requisite for a successful recombination is the coinfection of the individual host by different virus strains or species. Consequently, the following factors affecting the distribution of different viruses to shared target cells need to be considered: dose of inoculated virus, time interval between inoculation of the first and the second virus, distance between the marker mutations, genetic homology. At present there are no available data on the replication dynamics of PPV in permissive and non permissive hosts and reguarding co-infetions there are no information on the interference mechanisms occurring during the simultaneous replication of viruses of different species. This work has been carried out to set up permissive substrates allowing the replication of different PPV species, in particular keratinocytes monolayers and organotypic skin cultures. Furthermore a method to isolate and expand ovine skin stem cells was has been set up to indeep further aspects of viral cellular tropism during natural infection. The study produced important data to elucidate the replication dynamics of OV and PCPV virus in vitro as well as the mechanisms of interference that can arise during co-infection with different viral species. Moreover, the analysis carried on the genomic right terminal region of PCPV 1303 / 05 contributed to a better knowledge of the viral genes involved in host interaction and pathogenesis as well as to locate recombination breakpoints and genetic homologies between PPV species. Taken together these data filled several crucial gaps for the study of interspecific recombinations of PPVs which are thought to be important for a better understanding of the viral evolution and to improve the biosafety of antiviral therapy and PPV-based vectors. ...|$|E
