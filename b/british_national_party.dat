5|$|At the 2016 EU {{membership}} referendum, {{all three}} Northern England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave {{vote in the}} Northern England regions was 55.9% – {{higher than in the}} Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in Northern constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right <b>British</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP), who exploited racial tensions {{in the wake of the}} 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from Northern constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as most voters swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} various results in {{research}} focused on {{why people are}} attracted to religion and religious movements. This {{is also the case}} with the reasons why people are attracted to far–right nationalist movements. The focus of this thesis is to analyze <b>British</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party’s</b> political documents after nationalistic quasi-religious elements. If nationalism was {{to be seen as a}} form of religion or as a substitute for religion the result could be a better understanding of why people are attracted to nationalist movements in general, and also to far-right movements. By stating that nationalism is a quasi-religion which can function as a substitute for religion, this thesis attempts to show how the attraction of religion and nationalism has on people can be similar. Therefore, one of the conclusions of this thesis is that theories based upon religion, such as religious sect theories, can also be applied to nationalist and nationalist far-right movements. The main conclusion of this thesis is that <b>British</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party’s</b> political documents do contain quasi-religious elements...|$|R
