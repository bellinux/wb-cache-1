As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, even though he was not the primary weapon in the backfield.

5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown too <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit {{what was in the}} script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the Government {{felt that}} the best way to ensure {{minority}} representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, as it would be economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had grown too <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, {{the year in}} which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became too <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays have been developed for housing, although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen. All but a small remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s {{to make way for the}} development on the north side of the dock. Due to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town— the Irene. The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.|$|E

The climax of the show which was <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.|$|E

25|$|The {{picture was}} to be {{exhibited}} in the King's Hall of the then Parliament House with the other historic records of events as {{the opening of the}} first Parliament in Canberra in 1927 and the Royal opening of Parliament in 1954, however it was too <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> available space. The decision was made to store the painting at the Australian War Memorial after a tour of the various state galleries.

Meanwhile, Mallory's misgivings that the ships were too <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> available trade proved correct, and Roach was faced with cutthroat competition from a British shipping line. After several years of increasing losses, he was forced in 1881 to sell the ships and wind up the Line.|$|E

25|$|With its capture, Phan Rang Air Base {{became a}} Vietnam People's Air Force base.

A few of the hangars remain standing, others have been torn down. The large aircraft parking ramp and concrete aircraft shelters remain, although the shelters appear to have been left unused. Steel and sand revetments also remain on the ramp.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} how the hull shape for Cutty Sark was chosen. Willis chose Hercules Linton {{to design and}} build the ship but Willis already possessed another ship, The Tweed, which he considered to have exceptional performance. The Tweed (originally Punjaub) was a frigate designed by Oliver Lang based on the lines of an old French frigate, built in Bombay for the East India Company as a combination sail/paddle steamer. She and a sister ship were purchased by Willis, who promptly sold the second ship plus engines from The Tweed for more than he paid for both. The Tweed was then lengthened and operated as a fast sailing vessel, but was considered too <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tea runs. Willis also commissioned two all-iron clippers with designs based upon The Tweed, Hallowe'en and Blackadder. Linton was taken to view The Tweed in dry dock.|$|E

Most of the main structure, consisting of two and a half storeys, and of rubble stone and stone-tiled roofs, dates to c. 1659 when it was built for a Mr Forster, although some parts are earlier. Later additions date to post-1711 and improvements to c. 1911.|$|E

According to Pitchfork, [...] "after two years of hectoring Stones Throw for making unsalable records, distributor EMI couldn't keep Madvillainy in stock." [...] The album peaked at number 179 on Billboard 200 and sold approximately 150,000 copies, {{making it one of}} the label's best-selling albums. Its success allowed Stones Throw to open an office in Highland Park, Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Bovis Lend Lease, {{noted for}} work on Disneyland Paris, Petronas Towers, and the Time Warner Center, was the {{construction}} company. James McHugh Construction Co, the concrete subcontractor, implemented a comprehensive formwork {{for the construction of}} the building. At the completion of construction the building was the tallest formwork structure in the world, and follows in the footsteps of its neighbor, Marina City, as well as Chicago's Two Prudential Plaza, as past recordholders. Concrete moulding was used, because using a traditional ironwork structure would have required a building footprint that would have been too <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> property size, proportional to the height of the designed building. A steel frame would have had to be [...] wider to have supported a building of this proportion. Concrete will counteract the force of wind with the force of gravity of the [...] building. A new chemical process that leveraged more fluid liquid concrete facilitated pumping concrete up several hundred feet to the elevating construction site. Although previous technology limited formwork to , this technology permitted the pumping of concrete [...] high.|$|E
