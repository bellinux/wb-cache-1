40|$|The {{effects of}} varyng dietary calcium and {{phosphorous}} levels, vitamin D deficiency, oophorectomy, adrenalectomy, and simultaneous pregnancy on <b>bone</b> mineral <b>loss</b> during lactation in rats are studied. The experimental procedures and evaluations are described. The femur ash weight of lactating and nonlactating rats are calculated. The data reveals that {{a decrease in}} dietary calcium of 0. 02 percent results in an increased <b>loss</b> of <b>bone</b> mineral, an increase in calcium to 1. 4 percent does not lessen <b>bone</b> mineral <b>loss,</b> and <b>bone</b> mineral <b>loss</b> in vitamin D deficient rats is independent of calcium levels.

5|$|Periodontitis, a {{bacterial}} disease affecting the jaws, is particularly virulent in marsh rice rats; the animal {{has been proposed}} {{as a model for}} research on the disease in humans. The identity of the bacterial agent remains unknown. Vitamin E, fluoride, and iodide protect against <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> associated with this disease in the rice rat and a high-sucrose diet increases the severity of periodontitis. A case of kyphosis has been observed in a North Carolina marsh rice rat.|$|E
5|$|Zygoma implant; a long implant {{that can}} anchor to the cheek bone by {{passing through the}} maxillary sinus to retain a {{complete}} upper denture when bone is absent. While zygomatic implants offer a novel approach to severe <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> in the upper jaw, {{it has not been}} shown to offer any advantage over bone grafting functionally although it may offer a less invasive option, {{depending on the size of}} the reconstruction required.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E

40|$|That bone is lost {{in space}} is now {{commonly}} known, but this recognition was quite a surprise when human spaceflight began. What is less well known, but no less true, is that the loss concentrates on the leg bones. Is it caused by fluid shifts, simple mechanics or space food? Loss of density in the leg bones can amount to a reduction of one-quarter within 6 months of spaceflight (Vico et al. 2000), a magnitude and rate that seem to outweigh the <b>bone</b> <b>losses</b> of 5 – 10...|$|R
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
25|$|A 1970 {{research}} study of 1012 patients by Jozewicz showed denture wearers {{had a significantly}} higher rate of <b>bone</b> <b>loss.</b> Tallgren’s 25-year study in 1972 also showed denture wearers have continued <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> over the years. The biting force on the gum tissue irritates the bone and it melts away with a decrease in volume and density. Carlsson’s 1967 study showed a dramatic <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> {{during the first year}} after a tooth extraction which continues over the years, even without a denture or partial on it.|$|E
25|$|However, if the {{thyrotoxicosis}} {{is treated}} early, <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> can be minimized. The level of calcium {{in the blood}} can be determined by a simple blood test, and a bone density scan can document the amount of <b>bone</b> <b>loss.</b> There are many medications that can help to rebuild bone mass and to prevent further <b>bone</b> <b>loss.</b> Risedronate treatment has been demonstrated to help restore bone mass in osteopenia/osteoporosis associated with Graves' disease. Nevertheless, weight-bearing exercises, a balanced diet, calcium intake of about 1500mg a day and enough vitamin D, are of course elementary foundations.|$|E

25|$|Osteoporosis {{may be due}} {{to lower}} than normal bone mass and greater than normal <b>bone</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Bone</b> <b>loss</b> {{increases}} after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the hip.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{immobilization}} causes <b>bone</b> <b>loss</b> (following the 'use it or lose it' rule).

5000|$|People {{purchase}} iguanas due to {{the small}} size, low price, and apparent low cost of feeding of juvenile iguanas. Though small as juveniles, iguanas can grow to 4 feet in length and weigh some 20 pounds An iguana will not grow properly without a UVB light source. The UVB is necessary because captive iguanas do not get natural sunlight and this UVB allows the iguana make vitamin D3. The purpose of vitamin D3 is to digest calcium. Without being able to digest calcium, the iguana develops Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD). Metabolic Bone Disease causes soft bones, stunted growth, permanent bone deformities, frequent broken <b>bones,</b> <b>loss</b> of limbs and ultimately, death.|$|R

Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, as some of the injected testosterone will be aromatized into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in cisgender men). However, a single small study of trans men after oophorectomy demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to retard <b>bone</b> <b>loss.</b> (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and bone metabolism in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.)

30|$|It is of {{considerable}} importance that insufficiency subchondral fractures, osteonecrosis, and transient osteoporosis be differentiated, because their treatments and prognoses are quite different. Of course, since {{the causes of}} individual cases differ, history taking of alcohol and steroid intake and others is important, but much scope remains for controversy regarding radiological diagnoses. Some have reported differential diagnoses being made based on MRI findings, and that insufficiency subchondral fractures are characterized by a low signal intensity serpiginous line paralleling the articular surface. Transient osteoporosis, which should be distinguished as such, occurs in young patients as a self-limiting syndrome, and focal <b>bone</b> <b>losses</b> or subchondral collapses are not apparent during radiological examinations [18], whereas MRI may show diffuse and homogeneously reduced signal intensities in T 1 -weighted images and increased signal intensities in T 2 -weighted images, but no localized lesions [19 – 22].|$|R
40|$|Hypoestrogenism due lo {{castration}} induces <b>bone</b> mineral <b>loss</b> in premenopausal women. However，it {{remains unclear}} {{as to whether}} or not there is an age-related difference in bone mineralloss due to castration. To investigate the aging effect on bone mineralloss due to castration，several studies were performed. 1) The effect of surgical castration on femoral bone mineral density (BMD) in female Sprague-Dawley rats at various ages was examined. 2) The effect of surgical castration on lumbar spine BMD (L 2 -L 4) in premenopausal women was investigated. 3) The effect of medical castration with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on lumbar spine BMD in premenopausal women was also assessed. 1) The percent changes in femoral BMD 12 weeks after castration were + 4. 4 % compared to baseline levels in rats that were castrated at 8 weeks of age，- 0. 8 % at 16 weeks，- 7. 7 % at 24 weeks，and - 11. 2 % at 32 weeks. Rats that were castrated at higher ages showed greater <b>bone</b> mineral <b>loss</b> than younger aged-ovariectomized-rats. 2) The percent changes in lumbar spine BMD 6 months after surgical castration in women in their forties were - 3. 98 ± 2. 04 % compared to baseline levels，which was significantly greater than those in women in their thirties (- 1. 34 ± 2. 48 %) (P < 0. 05). 　 3) 　The percent change in the lumbar spine BMD 6 months after medical castration in women in their forties was - 4. 15 % compared to baseline levels， which was significantly greater than that in women in their thirties (- 0. 05 %) (P < 0. 05). Based on these results, we conclude that there is an age-related difference in <b>bone</b> mineral <b>loss</b> due to castration. Higher aged-premenopausal women undergo greater <b>bone</b> mineral <b>loss</b> than younger-aged women. This may be attributable to age-related differences in bone metabolism even in premenopausal women. 医歯学総合研究科博士論文(医学); 学位取得日: 平成 11 年 7 月 16...|$|R
