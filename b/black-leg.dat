6000|$|December 6.--A bad and {{disturbed}} {{night with}} fever, headache, and some touch of cholera morbus, which greatly disturbed my slumbers. But I fancy Nature was scouring the gun after her own fashion. I slept little till morning, and then lay abed, contrary to my wont, until half-past nine o'clock, when I {{came down to}} breakfast. Went to Court, and returned time enough to write about five leaves. Dined at Skene's, where we met Lord Elgin and Mr. Stewart, a son of Sir M. Shaw Stewart, whom I knew and liked, poor man. Talked among other things and persons of Sir J. Campbell of Ardkinglas, who is now here.[422] He is happy in escaping from his notorious title of Callander of Craigforth. In my youth he was a <b>black-leg</b> and swindler of the first water, and like Pistol did ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{shower of}} nutshells, orange-peel, and {{harmless}} missiles begins [...] to rattle {{against the glass}} of the window. Many voices take up [...] the groaning: [...] "More! Traitor! <b>Black-leg!</b> More!" [...] And through [...] the window can be seen waving flags and lighted Chinese [...] lanterns, swinging high on long bamboos. The din of execration [...] swells. MORE stands unheeding, still gazing after the cab. [...] Then, with a sharp crack, a flung stone crashes through one of [...] the panes. It is followed by a hoarse shout of laughter, and a [...] hearty groan. A second stone crashes through the glass. MORE [...] turns for a moment, with a contemptuous look, towards the [...] street, and the flare of the Chinese lanterns lights up his [...] face. Then, as if forgetting all about the din outside, he [...] moves back into the room, looks round him, and lets his head [...] droop. The din rises louder and louder; a third stone crashes [...] through. MORE raises his head again, and, clasping his hands, [...] looks straight before him. The footman, HENRY, entering, [...] hastens to the French windows.|$|E
60|$|Paul Friche was not by {{any means}} the only man who was being vigorously attacked. After the first two or three minutes of this kingdom of pandemonium, it was {{difficult}} to say who was quarrelling with whom. Old grudges were revived, old feuds taken up there, where they had previously been interrupted. Accusations of spying were followed by abuse for some past wrong of <b>black-legging</b> or cheating a confrère. The temperature of the room became suffocating. All these violent passions seething within these four walls seemed to become tangible and to mingle with the atmosphere already surcharged with the fumes of alcohol, of tobacco and of perspiring humanity. There was many a black-eye already, many a contusion: more than one knife--surreptitiously drawn--was already stained with red.|$|R
50|$|Royoporus badius or Picipes badius, {{commonly}} known as the black-footed polypore or <b>black-leg,</b> is a species of fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It causes a white rot of hardwoods and conifers. The species is found in temperate areas of Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. It has a dark brown or reddish-brown cap that reaches a diameter of 25 cm, and a stipe that is often completely black or brown at the top and black at the base.|$|E
50|$|He married Anne, {{daughter}} of Charles Townshend. They were divorced in 1798. Lady Louisa Stuart wrote of his elopement with Anne Townshend that:...this Mr Wilson - whose name, when known, made nobody the wiser - was an Irishman, born to an inheritance of three hundred a year, but greatly in debt, of no profession, accounted a <b>black-leg,</b> and chiefly remarkable for having fought {{two or three}} duels... His conversation was bragging and his manner familiar and aisy {{like those of the}} Paddy in a farce. All his friends had ten thousand a year; he talked of his horses and carriages, his estate and his interest; and when he addressed you as a lady, you could not help drawing back for fear he should give you a kiss.|$|E

During the past century, the species Pec-tobacterium atrosepticum and Pectobacterium carotovorum dominated the pathogenic populations in samples collected from <b>black-leg</b> and soft-rot symptoms of potato plants and tubers under temperate climates. Since the 1970 ’s, Dickeya strains, mostly D. dianthicola, were also detected in potato fields in Europe. More recently, in the 2000 ’s, a novel species called Dickeya solani [2, 3], emerged among the pectinolytic enterobacteria recovered from potato symp-toms in several countries. The emergence and challenges of the Dickeya species in potato production have been deeply discussed by Toth et al. [2]...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{complete}} and annotated genome {{sequence of the}} plant-pathogenic enterobacterium Pectobacterium sp. strain SCC 3193, a model strain isolated from potato in Finland. The Pectobacterium sp. SCC 3193 genome consists of a 516, 411 -bp chromosome, with no plasmids. Members of the genus Pectobacterium cause soft rot and <b>black-leg</b> disease {{in a wide range}} of plants, including economically important crop species such as potato (1). Pectobacterium sp. strain SCC 3193 has been a model strain in the research of soft rot molecular biology for over 2 decades. It was isolated from potato stem on a Finnish field in the 1980 s (8). SCC 3193 was originally characterized as Pectobacterium carotovorum but the species status is, at this point, unclear. Previously sequencedPectobacterium spe-cies are P. atrosepticum strain SCRI 1043, P. carotovorum strain WPP 14, P. brasiliensis strain PBR 1692, P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum strain PC 1, and P. wasabiae strain WPP 163. The genome was sequenced using a hybrid approach combin-ing data from three different technologies. First, a fragment library was produced and sequenced with the 454 Genome Sequencer GS 20 (6), yielding 712, 702 reads, with a mean read length of 101 bp and a total of 71, 982, 902 bp (ca. 14 coverage). A fosmid library was constructed by shearing genomic DNA cloned in the CopyControl pCC 1 FOS vector (Epicentre, Madison, WI) me-chanically with a needle. End sequences were determined from 865 fosmids using BigDye chemistry and analyzed on ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), yielding a total of 1, 047, 795 bp. In addition, we constructed a fragment library fo...|$|E
