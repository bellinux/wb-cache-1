40|$|In {{the last}} two years, there is a gaining {{interest}} in usage based accounting for the Internet. One of the driving forces for this growing interest is the progress being made in providing some form of quality assurance in IP packet forwarding. One of the key processes in an accounting system is metering, gathering of network usage parameters on which the accounting is or can be based. In this paper are addressed issues that are potentially of interest in Internet accounting. One of these issues is the possibility to base accounting on traffic or flows that cross the borders of a domain to different neighboring domains; that is, {{is it possible to}} meter these different flows. In this paper, the <b>backgrounds</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationales</b> of this, so-called, domain based metering are discussed and two preliminary experiments are reported...|$|R

Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman.

40|$|Head Start {{has served}} as a model of {{comprehensive}} services for young children in both the United States and the world’s developing countries. In this article, we compared Head Start with generally accepted principles underlying early childhood programs in developing countries. Comparisons revealed several areas of similarity, such as the historical <b>backgrounds</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationales</b> for the pro-grams, a holistic approach to child development, and the comprehensive nature of early childhood services. Notwithstanding the similarities, a stark area of difference lay in the credence given to children’s rights, as the basis of international early childhood programs, compared with a complete absence of such an acknowledgement nationally. Head Start’s role as a national and world labora-tory is discussed. Key words: developing countries, early childhood development programs, Head Start, international comparisons EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT(ECD) programs in the developed world extend back to the 1800 s (Zigler & Hall, 2000), but their existence in the developing nations is a much more recent phenomenon beginning in the late 1970 s (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organi-zation [UNESCO], 2007).

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{students}} on taught vocational courses {{finds that the}} student group is diverse, in terms of prior learning and cultural experiences, {{and in terms of}} expectations and priorities. There are high levels of student motivation and engagement, and staff time needs to be used differently than on undergraduate programmes. The most frequent student expectations of a postgraduate taught programme are that it will increase their personal ‘commercial capital’, specialist knowledge and transferable skills. Others include satisfaction and self-esteem.

40|$|This study engages {{mathematics}} {{teachers in}} reflecting on their practice by collecting data electronically from their students {{during the course}} of a mathematics lesson. This method of data collection eliminates the burden of manual collation and produces immediate feedback for analysis while the lessons are still fresh in the teachers ’ minds. It is possible to pose a number of standard questions across all lessons as well as questions formulated by the teachers as being of interest. This paper is an unusual format in that it represents a proposed research project rather than being a report on completed research. The intention is to engage with others with an interest in using innovative data collection instruments to facilitate teacher learning, and to seek feedback that can help to optimise the use and utility of these instruments. At the time of writing the instruments have been prototyped, but at the time of presentation some piloting will have been completed and preliminary results will be available. <b>Background</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rationale</b> The following section gives the <b>background</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationale</b> for the project in terms of canvassing possible ways of improving teacher learning, the constraints imposed on these by the secretive nature of teaching, and the role that teacher reflection could play in forming the basis for professional communities.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this MA thesis {{is to examine the}} ways of {{blending}} classroombased and web-based learning and teaching of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) for adult social care learners at Kuressaare Regional Training Centre. A needs analysis research by means of questionnaires and interviews was conducted at Kuressaare Regional Training Centre {{in order to determine the}} needs of learners. The questionnaires were completed by forty learners and graduates of Kuressaare Regional Training Centre in the period of February – April 2016. The interviews were organised among twelve social care learners and graduates in the same period. In general terms, the completed research aimed to determine the language skills needed for social care learners in occupation-related fields, the most practical ESP tasks and activities in order to gain the necessary skills and finally, to evaluate <b>and</b> provide <b>rationales</b> for the implementation of the current web-based course. The thesis comprises the introduction, two core chapters, the conclusion, references and seven appendices. The introduction lists the reasons of the present study, the aims and the introduction of methodology. Furthermore, the <b>background</b> <b>and</b> <b>rationales</b> of the current research are discussed in this chapter. Chapter One presents a theoretical overview of combining technology and ESP, pedagogy in computer-assisted learning and in addition, the learner-centred approach in teaching adults and the discussion of needs analysis are described in this chapter.
