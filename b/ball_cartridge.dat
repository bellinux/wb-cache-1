25|$|The Galil is {{a family}} of Israeli small arms {{designed}} by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries (IMI) (IMI privatized their small arms division, now called IWI) of Ramat HaSharon. The rifle design borrows heavily from the RK-62 and has a modified gas diversion system similar to the RK-62 to reduce the recoil of the rifle {{making it easier to}} fire especially in automatic mode. The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56×45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 <b>ball</b> <b>cartridge</b> and several models designed for use with the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after one of its inventors, Yisrael Galil. The Galil series of weapons is in use with military and police forces in over 25 countries.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, the U.S. Air Force {{adopted the}} Cartridge, Caliber [...]38, Ball M41, a {{military}} {{variant of the}} [...]38 Special cartridge designed {{to conform to the}} rules of land warfare. [...] The original [...]38 M41 <b>ball</b> <b>cartridge</b> used a 130-grain full-metal-jacketed bullet, and was loaded to an average pressure of only , giving a muzzle velocity of approximately [...] from a [...] barrel. This ammunition was intended to prolong the life of S M12 and Colt Aircrewman revolvers equipped with aluminum cylinders and frames, which were prone to stress fractures when fired with standard [...]38 ammunition. [...] By 1961, a slightly revised M41 [...]38 cartridge specification known as the Cartridge, Caliber [...]38 Ball, Special, M41 had been adopted for U.S. armed forces using [...]38 Special caliber handguns. [...] The new M41 Special cartridge used a 130-grain FMJ bullet loaded to a maximum allowable pressure of [...] for a velocity of approximately [...] in a solid [...] test barrel, and about [...] from a [...] revolver barrel. [...] The M41 <b>ball</b> <b>cartridge</b> was first used in [...]38 revolvers carried by USAF aircrew and Strategic Air Command security police, and by 1961 was in use by the U.S. Army for security police, dog handlers, and other personnel equipped with [...]38 Special caliber revolvers. [...] A variant of the standard M41 cartridge with a semi-pointed, unjacketed lead bullet was later adopted for CONUS (Continental United States) police and security personnel.|$|E
2500|$|The new 6mm {{cartridge}} {{achieved a}} muzzle velocity of 2,550 fps (777m/s) and was initially manufactured by Winchester (WRA) for the Navy. [...] Because of production delays {{and the desire}} to have a secondary ammunition source in the event of war or other emergency, the Union Metallic Cartridge (UMC) Company was also awarded a contract to produce 6mm ammunition. After the adoption of the M1895 Lee, the case rim of the government cartridge was redesigned with a slight bevel (rebated rim) for optimum performance in the en bloc charger-loaded magazine of the M1895 rifle. The revised cartridge was designated the 6mm U.S.N., but continued to be referred to in naval stores reports as the <b>Ball</b> <b>Cartridge,</b> 6mm. [...] Owing to difficulties in obtaining acceptable lots of Rifleite smokeless powder for the cartridge, as well as cartridge clips, Winchester and UMC did not fill the initial April 1896 Navy order of 1,000,000 cartridges for more than a year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cartridge}} is {{an inside}} lubricated type. The rebated heel type bullet design of its predecessor, the [...]44 Colt (.452 -.454" [...] diameter bullet), was eliminated, {{since it was}} an outside lubricated type, which would pick up dirt and grit during handling. The [...]45 Colt replaced the [...]50 caliber Model 1871 Remington single shot pistol and the various cap-and-ball revolvers converted to take metallic cartridges in use at the time. While the Colt remained popular, the Smith & Wesson M1875 Army Schofield Revolver was approved as an alternate which created a logistic problem for the Army. The S revolver used the [...]45 S Schofield, a shorter cartridge, which would also work in the Colt, however the Army's S Schofield revolvers could not chamber the longer [...]45 Colt, [...] so in the mid 1880s Frankford Arsenal, then almost exclusive supplier of small arms ammunition to the U.S. Army, dropped production of the [...]45 Colt {{in favor of the}} [...]45 S round. Adoption of the [...]45 M1887 Military <b>Ball</b> <b>Cartridge</b> resolved the Army's ammunition logistic problems. The M1887 Govt round was replaced by the [...]38 Long Colt in 1892.|$|E
2500|$|By 1894, the U.S. Navy {{desired to}} adopt a modern small-bore, {{smokeless}} powder rifle in keeping with other first-line naval powers. [...] Naval authorities decided that the new cartridge should be adaptable to both rifles and machine guns. [...] As the military forces began adopting smaller and smaller caliber rifles with higher velocity cartridges, U.S. naval authorities decided to leapfrog developments by adopting a semi-rimless cartridge in 6-mm caliber, with a case capable of holding a heavy charge of smokeless powder. [...] On August 1, 1894 a naval test board was convened at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island to test submitted magazine rifles in the new 6mm Navy government chambering. [...] Per {{the terms of the}} Notice to Inventors, the new government-designed 6mm U.S.N a.k.a. <b>Ball</b> <b>Cartridge,</b> 6mm was the only cartridge permitted for rifles tested before the Naval Small Arms Board. [...] Both the ammunition and rifle barrels were supplied by the government; the barrels, made of 4.5 per cent nickel steel, used Metford-pattern rifling with a rifling twist of one turn in 6.5inches, and were supplied unchambered with the receiver thread uncut. [...] The rifle action was required to withstand the firing of five overpressure (proof) cartridges with a chamber pressure of 60,000 psi.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the summer}} of 1826–7 clans from the Big River, Oyster Bay and North Midlands nations speared a number of stock-keepers on farms and {{made it clear that}} they wanted the {{settlers}} and their sheep and cattle to move from their kangaroo hunting grounds. Settlers responded vigorously, resulting in many mass-killings, though this was poorly reported at the time. On 8 December 1826 a group led by Kickerterpoller threatened a farm overseer at Bank Hill farm at Orielton, near Richmond; the following day soldiers from the 40th Regiment killed 14 Aboriginal people from the Oyster Bay nation and captured and jailed another nine, including Kickerterpoller. In April 1827 two shepherds were killed at Hugh Murray's farm at Mount Augustus near Campbell Town, south of Launceston, and a party of settlers with a detachment of the 40th Regiment launched a reprisal attack at dawn on an undefended Aboriginal camp, killing as many as 70 Aboriginal men, women and children. In March and April several settlers and convict servants were killed and a pursuit party avenged one of the incidents in a dawn raid in which [...] "they fired volley after volley in among the Blackfellows ... they reported killing some two score (40)." [...] In May 1827 a group of Oyster Bay Aboriginal people killed a stock-keeper at Great Swanport near Swansea and a party of soldiers, field police, settlers and stock-keepers launched a night raid on the culprits' camp. A report noted: [...] "Volley after volley of <b>ball</b> <b>cartridge</b> was poured in upon the dark groups surrounding the little camp fires. The number slain was considerable." ...|$|E
