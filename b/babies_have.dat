But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E

25|$|Touch is the {{earliest}} sense {{to develop in}} the fetus. The development of an infant's haptic senses and how {{it relates to the}} development of the other senses such as vision has been the target of much research. Human <b>babies</b> <b>have</b> been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch, even if they retain sight and hearing. Infants who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.|$|E

25|$|Passive {{memory is}} usually short-term, lasting between {{a few days}} and several months. Newborn infants have had no prior {{exposure}} to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. In utero, maternal IgG is transported directly across the placenta, so that, at birth, human <b>babies</b> <b>have</b> high levels of antibodies, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk contains antibodies (mainly IgA) that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.|$|E
25|$|The blood {{clotting}} factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; {{this may be}} due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1–4μg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100μg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births. Premature <b>babies</b> <b>have</b> even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.|$|E

25|$|Olfactory cues are {{widespread}} within {{parental care}} {{to assist in}} the dynamic of the mother-infant relationship, and later development of the offspring. In support of fetal olfactory learning, newborn infants display behavioral attraction to the odor of amniotic fluid. For example, babies would more often suck from a breast treated with an amount of their own amniotic fluid, rather than the alternative untreated breast. Newborns are initially attracted to their own amniotic fluid because that odor is familiar. Although exposure to amniotic fluid is eliminated after birth, breast fed <b>babies</b> <b>have</b> continued contact with cues from the mother’s nipple and areola area. This causes breast odors to become more familiar and attractive, while amniotic fluid loses its positive value. Maternal breast odors are individually distinctive, and provide a basis for recognition of the mother by her offspring.|$|E
25|$|The {{ontogeny}} {{of sleep}} {{is the study}} of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human <b>babies</b> <b>have</b> 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of NREM sleep on an average. The percentage of time spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of postnatal development, there is a marked reduction in percentage of hours spent in REM sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he spends about 6–7 hours in NREM sleep and only about an hour in REM sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies.|$|E

500|$|Newborn infants have {{no prior}} {{exposure}} to microbes and {{are particularly vulnerable}} to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. [...] During pregnancy, {{a particular type of}} antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly through the placenta, so human <b>babies</b> <b>have</b> high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk or [...] colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.|$|E
