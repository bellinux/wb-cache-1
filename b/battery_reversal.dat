5000|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>reversal</b> {{is used by}} some {{voice over}} IP {{adapters}} to indicate call status. Instead of removing the battery voltage, the polarity of the DC power on the line is briefly reversed.|$|E
50|$|The other {{mechanism}} of POTS disconnect supervision is <b>Battery</b> <b>reversal.</b> In order to indicate disconnection of the far-end party, {{there is a}} polarity reversal of tip and ring conductors of a telephone port.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{loop start}} trunks often provide {{additional}} methods supervision {{to avoid the}} far-end-disconnect problem. Answer supervision and disconnect supervision are extensions to alert a foreign exchange office (FXO) interface that the remote party has answered or hung up. Answer supervision usually {{takes the form of}} the central office reversing the polarity of the line (<b>battery</b> <b>reversal)</b> {{for the duration of the}} call when it has been answered. For disconnect supervision the polarity may reverse back, or the battery voltage may be removed from the line for a short period of time.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{mechanisms}} used by signaling methods prior to SS7 (<b>battery</b> <b>reversal,</b> multi-frequency digit outpulsing, A- and B-bit signaling), these older methods could not communicate much signaling information. Usually only the dialed digits were signaled, and merely during call setup. For charged calls, dialed digits and charge number digits were outpulsed. SS7, being a high-speed and high-performance packet-based communications protocol, can communicate {{significant amounts of}} information when setting up a call, during the call, {{and at the end}} of the call. This permits rich call-related services to be developed. Some of the first such services were call management related, call forwarding (busy and no answer), voice mail, call waiting, conference calling, calling name and number display, call screening, malicious caller identification, busy callback.|$|E
