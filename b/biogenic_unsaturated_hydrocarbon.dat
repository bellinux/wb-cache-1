40|$|Recent {{laboratory}} experiments have demonstrated that, even though contribution from other reaction channels cannot be neglected, <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> easily break their multiple C-C bonds to form CO after {{their interactions with}} atomic oxygen. Here we present an upgraded chemical modelling including a revision of the reactions between oxygen atoms and small <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> for different astrochemical environments. A first conclusion is that towards hot cores/corinos atomic oxygen easily degrades <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> directly to CO or to its precursor species (such as HCCO or HCO) and destroys the double or triple bond of alkenes and alkynes. Therefore, environments rich in atomic oxygen at a relatively high temperature {{are not expected to}} be rich in large <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. On the contrary, in O-poor and C-rich objects, hydrocarbon growth can occur to a large extent. In addition, new radical species, namely ketyl and vinoxy radicals, generated from other reaction channels can influence the abundances of hydrocarbons towards hot cores. We, therefore, suggest they {{should be included in the}} available databases. Hydrocarbon column densities are calculated in the 10 (13) - 10 (15) cm(- 2) range, in good agreement with their observed values, despite the small number of data currently published in the literature.

40|$|<b>Unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{are highly}} {{reactive}} {{species that are}} found in flames and plasma discharges being important intermediates {{in the formation of}} polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and in the processes of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Some particular <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> have been identified in the interstellar medium where their role is not yet fully understood. Linear carbon chains are one of the simplest rigid nanostructures that can potentially conduct electron current. Most of the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are highly reactive species and for this reason they can only be studied in situ during the short time after their formation. The species are generated in the gas phase through an electrical discharge of a precursor gas and cooled in the supersonic expansion. High-resolution optical absorption spectra are recorded using a tunable dye laser. Because the concentrations of the reactive species studied are generally low, highly sensitive detection technique has to be used. This work presents a study of highly <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> by cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS). High-resolution electronic spectra of ions and radicals allow identifying them in remote environments such as interstellar medium and providing information about the physical conditions of the environment. It is shown how the information about the structure of the unknown absorbing species can be deduced from its rotationally resolved spectrum...|$|R
40|$|The {{exposure}} of saturated hydrocarbons to ultrasound (800 kHz, 6 W/sq cm) {{in the presence}} of water results in: (1) cleavage of the carbon chain, producing saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with a lower number of carbons than the initial hydrocarbon (cracking); and (2) recombination after cleavage, producing saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with a higher number of carbons than the initial hydrocarbon (reformation).

On the basis of equilibrium constants, K, and shifts of vNH to low frequency, it has been established that complexed Oct 3 NH + -L., cations with n = 1 and 2 are formed and have unidentate and bifurcated N-H + ⋯μ hydrogen bonds, respectively. Bifurcated hydrogen bonds to <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> have not been observed previously. The <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> studied include benzene and methylbenzenes, fused-ring aromatics, alkenes, conjugated dienes, and alkynes. From the magnitude of the redshifts in the N-H stretching frequencies, AvNH, a new scale for ranking the It basicity of <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is proposed: fused-ring aromatics ≤ benzene < toluene < xylene < mesitylene < durene < conjugated dienes ≈ 1 -alkynes < pentamethylbenzene < hexamethylbenzene < internal alkynes ≈ cycloalkenes < 1 -methylcycloalkenes.

40|$|Chemicals in indoor air, either {{emitted from}} a source or from a reaction, have been {{suggested}} to cause ill health in buildings. However, no clear correlations between exposure and health effects have been made. In this thesis we studied the reaction between monoterpenes, a group of <b>biogenic</b> <b>unsaturated</b> C 10 <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and ozone. Ozonolysis of monoterpenes was used as model reactions for unsaturated compounds in ambient air. Also the products formed from these reactions have been suggested as important participants in the occurrence of discomfort and ill health in buildings. To enable a reliable and sensitive measurement of ppb-ppt levels of monoterpenes and the formed products {{in the presence of}} ozone an evaluation of available scrubber materials was made. Potassium iodide was shown to remove ambient levels of ozone and have a recovery of > 95 % for all monoterpenes and formed products included in the investigation. Experimental conditions showed to have a large impact on the initial steps of the ozonolysis, and also on the composition of the formed products. We showed that water plays an important and complex role both in the initial stage of ozonolysis of ∆ 3 -carene and in the formation and composition of products from the ozonolysis of ∆-pinene. The use of experimental design facilitated the evaluation of the investigated reactions. We showed that the formation of OH radicals could be studied using multiple linear regression models and that {{the presence or absence of}} OH radicals had a profound impact on the formation of many of the formed products. We also made an observation of the lack of formed OH radicals in the ozonolysis of limonene and discussed probable causes of this observation. Despite the short reaction times and the ambient levels of ozone and monoterpenes used in our experiments we showed that a number of oxidation products were formed, and that the reaction rate is significantly increased in a ventilation system. This formation is underestimated by theoretical calculations and leads to high amounts of known irritants in the indoor air. We showed that theoretical calculations underestimate the formation of these oxidation products 3 - 13 times, depending on ventilation system and monoterpene...|$|R
