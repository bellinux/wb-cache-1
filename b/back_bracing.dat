[...] "I have {{sometimes}} believed that Jeff Durgin was goin' to turn out a blackguard. He's got it in him. He's as like his gran'father as two peas, and he was an old devil. But you got to account in all these here heredity cases for counteractin' influences. The Durgins are as good as wheat, right along, all of 'em; and I guess Mis' Durgin's mother must have been a pretty good woman too. Mis' Durgin's all right, too, if she has got a will of her own." [...] Whitwell returned from his scientific inquiry to ask: [...] "How 'll she take it?" ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{the cause}} of {{scoliosis}} can sometimes remain unknown (idiopathic scoliosis) there is treatment available that targets at strengthening the back muscles, for milder cases usually do not require medical attention, more severe cases require either muscle strengthening exercises aimed at the back muscles and even special <b>back</b> <b>braces</b> or surgery can be recommended if the case is extreme. Studies have shown that treatment with a special <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> among children ranging from 10-16 years can be successful and using this method of muscle training scoliosis can be cured with non-surgical treatment.|$|R

50|$|A <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> is {{a device}} {{designed}} {{to limit the}} motion of the spine in cases of fracture or in post-operative fusions, as well as a preventative measure against some progressive conditions.|$|R
50|$|Other story arcs include Deenie's {{friendship}} with Barbara Curtis, a girl whose eczema alienates {{her from her}} other classmates, and Deenie's anxiety over whether her crush will still like her {{in spite of her}} <b>back</b> <b>brace.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Boston brace, {{a type of}} thoraco-lumbo-sacral-orthosis (TLSO), is a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> used {{primarily}} {{for the treatment of}} idiopathic scoliosis in children. It was developed in 1972 by John Hall and William Miller at the Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Back</b> <b>braces</b> {{are also}} {{commonly}} prescribed to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, {{as they may}} stop the progression of spinal curvature in a growing child/adolescent. In some cases, the <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> may also help decrease the amount of curvature in the spine. A variety of brace styles are available; the Boston brace is {{the most commonly used}} brace for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Other designs include the Milwaukee brace, the Charleston bending brace, the Peak Scoliosis Bracing System, and the SpineCor (a soft brace) in the United States, Canada and Europe. In Europe, however, the SPoRT and Cheneau and Crass Cheneau braces are also used. There has been considerable research and information published in reputable journals on <b>back</b> <b>braces</b> for scoliosis. Issues like patient compliance with treatment, psycho-social impact of brace use, and exercise with bracing have been looked at. Quality of Life research has been attempted, but is difficult due to a current lack of instruments. Bracing is the primary treatment for AIS in curves that are considered to be moderate in their severity and are likely due to progress (determined by curve pattern/type and the patient's structural maturity).|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods of}} binding include {{compression}} bandages, <b>back</b> <b>braces,</b> tape, modified clothing, very firm sports bras and tight-fitting shirts. These methods are more popular {{with young people}} who have not yet come out as trans, or those who have limited financial means.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978-'79 {{the paper}} labels were {{discontinued}} {{and the inner}} <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> was [...] "branded." [...] Later Korean production show a resurgence in the paper label system for model and serial number, sometimes along with the brand. These had an even fancier border.|$|R
2500|$|Blake {{started playing}} tennis at age 5 {{alongside}} his brother Thomas. When he was 13, {{he was diagnosed}} with severe scoliosis, and for five years as a teenager he was forced to wear a full-length <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> for 18hours a day, though not while playing tennis.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Back</b> <b>Brace</b> Brand: From 1978 through 1983; 1978 being a {{transition}} year, one might find the center <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> is pressure stamped, or [...] "branded" [...] in a football shape stating Sigma Guitars/Made in Japan/For/C.F. Martin & Co. Being a mid-year change, some continued {{on with the}} [...] "Purple" [...] label, though with the new serial number designation preceded by an [...] "S" [...] or an [...] "E" [...] This is prefixed by the serial number assigned to the instrument and followed by an ink stamp of the model number. (e.g. L-R as seen through the sound hole: Serial number, [...] "Brand," [...] Model number.) The serial numbers on these instruments were often preceded by the letters S or E; e.g. S0XXXXX. It is currently believed that this transition was complete by 1979.|$|R
5000|$|From {{approximately}} 1978 through 1983, and {{in later}} Korean made instruments with few exceptions, stamps, or [...] "brands" [...] were embossed into the <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> wood {{instead of using}} a paper label.

50|$|Wiedemann {{was born}} and raised in New York City and {{attended}} high school at the United Nations International School, where she became fluent in French. Growing up, Wiedemann suffered from scoliosis, a spinal condition that had also afflicted her mother, and had to wear a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> 23 hours a day from the ages of 12 to 17.|$|R
50|$|Duke {{was born}} in Hope, Arkansas, the son of Ray and Bettie Duke. As a seventh grader in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, he was {{diagnosed}} with scoliosis; it was determined that his spine had a curvature of over 26 percent, and he wore a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> 23 hours a day. Duke had surgery two years later after it was determined that his spine had a 51 percent curvature. At Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, on February 25, 1985, the day of the surgery, Duke's spine was at 72 degrees and worsening. Once a 16-inch metal rod was attached to his spine, the curve of Duke’s back was set at 38 degrees, within the range of normal, and that’s where it has stayed ever since. Months later, back playing for Arkadelphia High School, he won medalist honors in a high school district golf tournament while wearing a <b>back</b> <b>brace.</b> In 1987, he was the Arkansas High School Medalist at Pleasant Valley Country Club in Little Rock.|$|R

It is a full-torso brace that extends from the pelvis {{to the base of the}} skull. It was originally designed by Blount and Schmidt in 1946 for postoperative care when surgery required long periods of immobilization.|$|R
60|$|He {{admitted}} that to realize his ambitions might be hard, but {{he meant to}} try. Canada was for the young and stubborn. If his chiefs did not promote him, {{he would make a}} plunge, and if his new plan did not work, he would go over and see the Old Country. Then he would come <b>back,</b> <b>braced</b> and refreshed, and try his luck again.|$|R

500|$|At {{one point}} during the European tour, guitarist Carlos Alomar ripped a {{ligament}} in his leg, an injury that caused him to change his on-stage character. Said Alomar, [...] " [...] had to change my character into the mad, limping Mad Max reject with spiky hair. I went to a chiropractor and asked him {{for a lot of}} metal stuff -- leg <b>braces,</b> <b>back</b> <b>braces</b> and everything. Now I'll be adding more metal as the show progresses." ...|$|R
50|$|Treatment usually {{includes}} antibiotics, {{and reducing}} the mobility of the affected region, either with a <b>back</b> <b>brace</b> or a plaster cast. Without treatment, the patient may form an abscess which {{may need to be}} surgically corrected. Due to the poor vascularity of the disc, drugs required for treatment often include potent agents such as Ciprofloxacin along with Vancomycin. Occasionally, oral drugs can be used to treat the infection but it may fail and IV drugs may be required.|$|R
2500|$|Body casts, which {{cover the}} trunk of the body, and in some cases the neck up to or {{including}} the head (see Minerva Cast, below) or one or more limbs, are rarely used today, and are most commonly used in the cases of small children, who cannot be trusted to comply with a <b>back</b> <b>brace,</b> or in cases of radical surgery to repair an injury or other defect. A body cast which encases the trunk (with [...] "straps" [...] over the shoulders) is usually referred to as a body jacket. These are often very uncomfortable.|$|R
