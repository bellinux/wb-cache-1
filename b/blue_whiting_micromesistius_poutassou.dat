No significant population trends were detectable, mainly because of the short time-series and large spatial and inter-annual variation in the number of breeding pairs in the colonies monitored. However, the breeding success of all three penguin species has improved slightly over the last few years, indicating a potential for increasing populations in the near future. During the breeding season, all three penguin species preyed opportunistically on a mixture of fish, squid and crustaceans. Diet composition too showed a high degree of spatial and temporal variation. However, in all three penguin species studied, squid gradually disappeared from the diet over successive years, to be replaced by fish. Coincidentally, the commercial catches of the squid species Loligo gahi in Falkland Islands waters decreased and the by-catch of nototheniid fish increased.

Freezing at - 40 °C caused certain changes in rheological parameters. In heat-induced gels, breaking deformation, elasticity and cohesiveness increased. Of the high-pressure-induced gels, breaking force increased and cohesiveness decreased in the gel formed at lower pressures, while the only change in the gel formed at higher pressure was some loss of elasticity. There was a general fall in water holding capacity (WHC) values. Lightness remained stable. In terms of protein solubility, there was an increase in covalent bonds in lot L. As for the ultrastructure, all gels matrixes were more disorganized as a result of freezing. In the course of frozen storage, the greatest changes in rheological parameters generally took place during the first 8 weeks, and in all the gels there was a decrease in WHC. In the heat-induced gel the changes were less marked over the storage period compared with those in the high-pressure-induced gels, but the heat-induced gel was more brittle and did not maintain maximum folding test scores. Covalent bonds increased and hydrophobic interactions decreased in all lots.

Recent studies have reported schools of adult fish from Atlantic waters migrating along the southern Chilean coast in mid-winter, moving northwards to spawn in August (47 °- 51 °S), and then returning to Atlantic waters, presumably to feed. The migratory pattern suggests the presence {{of one or more}} stock units associated with the South American coast. In the present study, "otolith morphometry" is used to determine the stock structure of M. australis based on applications of basic size descriptors (SDs) (area, perimeter and otolith size), shape indices (SIs) (circularity, squareness, shape factor, roundness, ellipticity), and normalised elliptical Fourier descriptors (NEFDs). Samples were collected during the winter and spring of 2010, during the reproductive period, in the economic zone of southern Chile (36 °- 57 °S), in the Pacific Ocean and around the Falkland Islands economic zone (50 °- 52 °S) in the Atlantic Ocean. Analyses were conducted to include the effects of size, sex and age. A stepwise canonical discriminant analysis showed that fish were successfully discriminated with SDs, SIs and NEFDs. In this analysis, 86. 4 % and 70. 1 % of the fish were correctly classified as belonging to the Atlantic and Pacific stocks, respectively. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that the mean values of the NEFDs, SDs, and SIs did not vary significantly between sexes within areas (P > 0. 05), but varied significantly between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (P < 0. 05).

The 2012 survey was part of an international collaborative survey using the vessels RV Celtic Explorer (Ireland), RV Fridtjof Nansen (Russia), RV Tridens (Netherlands) and the RV Magnus Heinason (Faroes) and the FV Brennholm (Norway). The total combined area coverage extended from the Faroe Islands {{in the north}} (62 ° N) to south of Ireland (52 ° N), with east -west extension from 4 °- 19 ° W. International survey participants meet shortly after the survey to present data and produce a combined relative abundance and biomass index the blue whiting spawning stock in western waters. The combined survey report is presented annually at the WGIPS meeting held in December. The information presented here relates to the Irish survey produced by the ICES led Working Group International Pelagic Surveys...|$|E
40|$|The {{spawning}} stock of <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> (<b>Micromesistius</b> <b>poutassou),</b> an economically important pelagic gadoid in the North Atlantic Ocean, increased threefold after 1995. The reproductive {{success of the}} stock is largely determined during the very early stages of life, but {{little is known about}} the spawning dynamics of this species. Here we show that the spawning distribution of blue whiting is variable, regulated by the hydrography west of the British Isles. When the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is strong and spreads its cold, fresh water masses east over Rockall Plateau, the spawning is constrained along the European continental slope and in a southerly position near Porcupine Bank. When the gyre is weak and conditions are relatively saline and warm, the spawning distribution moves northwards along the slope and especially westwards covering Rockall Plateau. The apparent link between the spawning distribution and the subpolar gyre is the first step towards understanding the reproduction variability, which currently is the main challenge for appropriate management of the blue whiting stock...|$|E

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. While rights-based management is generally purported enhance economic efficiency in fisheries and reduce over-capitalization, {{the social and}} economic outcomes due to this regulatory regime are less comprehensively understood. Relatively recently, industrialized and export-oriented Latin American fisheries began adopting individual transferable quota (ITQ) regimes to recover collapsed fish stocks. While these programs tend to follow standard, Western approaches to ITQ design and implementation, Argentina experimented with a new design model by interjecting social and ecological objectives into ITQ design through the creation of Artisanal and Social Quota reserves and through determining initial allocation based on historical vessel landings, employment, at-sea and on-land production, investment, historical landings across species, and record of fishery violations. In 2010, Argentina established ITQs for four commercially important and export-oriented fisheries: Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus), Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), and southern <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> (<b>Micromesistius</b> australis). The first part of this study, to be presented, is a comprehensive institutional analysis of the ITQ fishery management program in Argentina to preliminarily evaluate how configurations of rights-based managed influence social, economic, and ecological outcomes in regulated fisheries. This paper analyzes legislative documents and government data on program design, vessel landings, and participation in the ITQ program from 2000 - 2016, to evaluate how program design, specifically initial allocation and trading restrictions, potentially influences fishery outcomes. The results of this study are broadly applicable to understanding how the design of rights-based management regimes influence compliance behavior, social equity, and economic efficiency outcomes in developing country fisheries...|$|R
40|$|The {{diet and}} {{breeding}} performance of Grey-headed Albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma and Black-browed Albatrosses Diomedea melanophris breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, were studied simultaneously during the chick-rearing period between 1996 and 2000. When samples for all years were combined, cephalopods and crustaceans {{were the main}} components in the diet of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. However, their diets exhibited interannual variations. Cephalopods {{were the most important}} component in the diet of Grey-headed Albatrosses between 1996 and 1999 (60 - 75 % by mass) but decreased significantly in 2000 (17 %), when crustaceans dominated (61 %). The Black-browed Albatross diet varied greatly, with cephalopods being the most important component in 1996 (49 % by mass) and 1997 (48 %), fish in 1998 (32 %) and 1999 (40 %), and crustaceans in 2000 (63 %). In 1998 and 2000 there was a significant change in the cephalopod species present in the diet of both albatross species, when their breeding success was low. The consumption of the ommastrephid Martialia hyadesi was significantly and positively correlated with Grey-headed Albatross breeding success. For Black-browed Albatrosses significant correlations were found between its consumption of the Icefish Champsocephalus gunnari and breeding success, and between its consumption of M. hyadesi and M. hyadesi CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort). These findings suggest that Grey-headed Albatrosses are more reliant on Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone prey (M. hyadesi and Lamprey Geotria australis) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses are more dependent on Antarctic prey (Icefish and Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba). The differences between diets of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses breeding on different islands of the Southern Ocean showed that Grey-headed Albatrosses feed more on oceanic cephalopods (e. g. M. hyadesi) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses feed primarily on shelf fish (e. g. <b>Blue</b> <b>Whiting</b> <b>Micromesistius</b> australis), suggesting that albatross diets are likely to be influenced by the geographical position of those islands, albatross foraging preference and prey availability...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of water activity on basic {{physical and chemical}} characteristics of salted fish products with intermediate moisture has been defined. During the research the product quality has been assessed by the organoleptic method; determination of the water mass fraction {{has been carried out}} by the drying method; the salt mass fraction – by the argentometric method; water activity has been measured by a cooled mirror dew-point sensor. Based on experimental data the {{dependence of}} Aw on concentration of sodium chloride in the salt semi-finished products of pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias), <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> (<b>Micromesistius),</b> pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) has been established. The empirical formula showing the correlation of the parameter (Aw) with mass fraction of sodium chloride and water has been derived; on its basis it is possible to calculate the parameters of semi-finished product in order to obtain a final minced salt product of intermediate moisture with desired microbial stability upon storage. The relations between the salt mass fraction and water mass fraction excluding bacterial spoilage and mold growth has been determined, they make up S ≥ 0, 135 ∙ W and S ≥ 0, 34 ∙ W respectively, where S – the mass fraction of salt, %, W – the mass fraction of water, %. An example of calculating the required dosage of sodium chloride in the semi-finished minced salmon has been described to produce the finished product with the exactly given values of humidity and water activity. During the process of minced salted fish products' dehydration the basic physical and chemical parameters – the mass fraction of salt and water affecting the water activity (Aw) – have been changing. Determination of these parameters' relationship provides the ability to predict the qualitative changes of salted fish products of intermediate moisture during storage and to calculate the necessary parameters of salted semi-finished product preparing...|$|R
