25|$|The Flyer's {{gangplank}} {{was extended}} out {{to one of}} these freight loading slips. As the passengers were boarding, the slip locking mechanism gave way, the ramp collapsed into the water, and 50 people were tumbled into the sound.

The fireboat Snoqualmie, which had {{come to the aid of}} the Flyer twenty years <b>before,</b> <b>now</b> again went to her assistance, as did the launch Skeeter, skipper Roy Lillico, and boat of the Rosalie, in charge of mate Louis Van Bogaert. The captain ordered the crew to toss life preservers and anything else floatable to the people struggling in the water. Within ten minutes, all but two people, Mrs. G.V. Leonard and a one–year–old baby, Carl Bruder, had been rescued. Their tragic drownings broke the Flyer's long record of passenger safety.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{as soon as}} he was released, Alexander was at {{war with}} the king. Domhnall Ballach ("the Freckled"), son of his uncle John Mór, may have been seeking revenge for his father's death, and if this was the case, he was {{supported}} by his other uncle Alasdair Carrach ("the Curly"), Lord of Lochaber. Together, these two men, the two most important nobles in the lordship, probably helped pressure Alexander into war. In Spring 1429, Alexander's forces advanced on Inverness. Although Maol Choluim Mac an Tóisich ("Malcolm MacKintosh"), head of Clan Chattan and custodian of the castle, managed to hold Alexander off, Alexander was still able to burn down the burgh. Alexander, meanwhile, was planning to support James Mór, son of Duke Murdoch, in his claim on the Scottish throne. James Mór had become a serious threat to King James, not merely because was he likely to have the support of Murdoch's former vassals in Lennox, Menteith and Fife, but also because he had obtained the backing of the King of England, who was angry that King James was ignoring his superior status and the terms of his release from captivity in England several years <b>before.</b> <b>Now</b> James Mór had the support of Alexander too.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is more precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless.

[...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious than it was <b>before</b> <b>now</b> that it is finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E

500|$|In a pre-release comment, {{popular culture}} expert Robert Thompson said: [...] "The fact is, {{the story has}} {{developed}} in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something {{they did not know}} <b>before.</b> <b>Now</b> we're getting into the details, which is never that thrilling." [...] The LRA researcher Craig Valters of the LSE's department of International Development said that the second video [...] "overwhelmingly" [...] failed to answer criticisms raised by the first film. On the other hand, Mike Pflanz, East Africa correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, said that the sequel was [...] "a more solid, moving and, finally, accurate presentation of the ongoing battle to capture Joseph Kony" [...] and that, in comparison to the original video, the [...] "new video is couched in nuance and deploys dialogue more commonly heard in a United Nations workshop – displacement, rehabilitation, post-conflict—than in a YouTube smash." ...|$|E

He concluded by stating that: [...] "A cipher for good songs rather than the reasons those songs are good she may be, but there are few that do it better". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy too questioned the decisions of which songs appeared on the album, but wrote that: [...] "the very fact that she can't fit all her classics on to one disc can be seen as nothing more than a testament to her enduring career". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine pointed out that Lopez's other well or moderately charted songs such as [...] "Play", [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright", [...] "I'm Glad", and [...] "Hold You Down" [...] were not present on the compilation, while also writing that her older hits didn't fit neatly with her newer songs and that it's sequencing was [...] "scattershot".

2500|$|The 1974 Rallys {{were mostly}} {{unchanged}} from the 1973s. Just {{like on the}} Rambler American, their largest difference was the new rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and relocated rear license plate. These models incorporated {{the first set of}} VAM's original five-spoke wheels, which carried full volcano-shaped hubcaps and trim rings. Due to this, wheelcovers were removed as available accessories for this model. For the first time a set of factory side stripes decorated the exterior of the model including a stylish manuscript [...] "Rally" [...] emblem over the rear quarter panel, creating a two-tone appearance. Front seats were mostly the same as the year <b>before,</b> <b>now</b> shared with the brand-new Classic AMX (Matador X) model. The discontinuation of the original VAM logo during 1973 in favor of the new arrow-type one meant its removal from the dial of the tachometer. The shifter was changed into a T-shaped Hurst unit. A new AMC logo over a black background replaced the American Motors legend over the transparent acrylic cap in the steering wheel's horn button. The 258 six engine got a slight drop in compression ratio from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1.|$|E
2500|$|Newman spelt out his {{theology}} of friendship in a sermon he preached on the Feast of St John the Evangelist, traditionally {{thought to be}} the same person as the disciple John, [...] "whom Jesus loved". In the sermon, Newman said: [...] "There have been men <b>before</b> <b>now,</b> who have supposed Christian love was so diffuse as not to admit of concentration upon individuals; so that we ought to love all men equally. ...Now I shall maintain here, in opposition to such notions of Christian love, and with our Saviour's pattern before me, that the best preparation for loving the world at large, and loving it duly and wisely, is to cultivate our intimate friendship and affection towards those who are immediately about us". For Newman, friendship is an intimation of a greater love, a foretaste of heaven. In friendship, two intimate friends gain a glimpse of the life that awaits them in God. Juan R. Vélez writes that someday Newman [...] "may well earn a new title, that of Doctor amicitiae: Doctor of the Church on Friendship. His biography is a treatise on the human and supernatural virtues that make up friendship".|$|E
