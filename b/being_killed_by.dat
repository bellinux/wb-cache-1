5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Jim, and <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days before}} the accident, on 20 June, Dean Mellberg, an emotionally {{disturbed}} ex-USAF serviceman, entered Fairchild's hospital and shot and killed five people and wounded many more before <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> an Air Force Security Policeman. The crime was a major distraction for personnel stationed at Fairchild for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} the funeral of Angela, who {{departed}} the show during the second series, after <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> a moose, {{at least according to}} Guy. Mac, after a month's leave, discovers what has happened between Caroline and Guy, and although hurt, makes no attempt to interfere.

5|$|According to the Tuskegee Institute, 4,745 {{people are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1964, 3,446 (72.7 percent) of them black. Lynching came to be associated, in particular, with the Deep South; 73 percent of lynchings {{took place in the}} Southern United States. Between 1882 and 1903, 125 black-on-black lynchings were recorded in 10 southern states, as were four cases of whites <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> black mobs.|$|E
5|$|Erinys– The {{daughter}} of Thanatos. After {{the destruction of}} Atlantis, Erinys searched for Kratos, killing various Spartans as a warning for Kratos to stop his quest to find Deimos. Erinys eventually found Kratos in the Mounts of Aroania, and after a land battle, an aerial battle ensued as Erinys shape shifted into an enormous bird before <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Kratos, after which, Kratos took her power, the Scourge of Erinys. The character was overdub voiced by Jennifer Hale and Erin Torpey in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth was {{initially}} succeeded by his stepson Lulach, but Lulach ruled {{for only a}} few months before also <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Malcolm III, whose descendants would rule Scotland until the late 13th century. Macbeth is today best known as the main character of William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth and the many works it has inspired. However, Shakespeare's Macbeth is based on the Holinshed's Chronicles (published in 1577) and is not historically accurate.|$|E
25|$|Livilla died shortly afterwards, either <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> or <b>by</b> suicide. According to Cassius Dio, Tiberius handed Livilla {{over to her}} mother, Antonia Minor, who locked her up in a {{room and}} starved her to death.|$|R

50|$|The numbers killed {{range from}} just a few people to many millions. The common factor of a {{massacre}} (as with mass murder) is that multiple people are <b>being</b> violently <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> other people.|$|R
5|$|Martial {{reports a}} contest between an {{elephant}} and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed {{part of its}} training, but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power. He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> an elephant, {{but there is nothing}} to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.|$|E
5|$|Succession: the Augustan History {{claims that}} Maeonius was proclaimed emperor {{for a brief}} period before <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the soldiers. However, no {{inscriptions}} or other evidence exist for Maeonius' reign and he was probably killed immediately after assassinating the king. Odaenathus was succeeded by his son, the ten-year-old Vaballathus under the regency of Zenobia. Hairan II probably died soon after his father, as only Vaballathus succeeded to the throne.|$|E
5|$|When {{breeding}} is over, the {{black-necked grebe}} usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes {{with large numbers}} of invertebrate prey, so that it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult {{until the end of the}} moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Lightning Lad was interred {{there for}} a time after <b>being</b> {{apparently}} <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Zaryan the Conqueror, but he was later revived by the sacrifice of Proty (or replaced by Proty, according to v4 Legion).|$|R

25|$|The mentors of {{the main}} heroes also share many parallels. Both also mentored the main villain of their stories before they turned bad and betrayed their {{respective}} mentor. Both mentors were also eventually killed when fighting their former students. Albus Dumbledore was betrayed by Tom Riddle before <b>being</b> eventually <b>killed</b> off <b>by</b> him as Lord Voldemort (through Draco Malfoy and Snape). Obi-Wan was betrayed by Anakin Skywalker before eventually <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> off <b>by</b> him as Darth Vader. Both also voluntarily allowed themselves to be killed and advised the hero from beyond the grave.|$|R
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|Chad is {{a member}} of the Crane family. The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch Alistair Crane, Chad is {{introduced}} as a music producer from Los Angeles who is searching for his biological family. Chad becomes involved in a love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone Russell. His romance with Whitney is complicated by the possibility they may be engaging in an incestuous relationship as Chad is initially believed to be her half-brother, and later revealed to be her adoptive cousin. Chad's later storylines focus on his confusion over his sexual identity, and his sexual relationship with tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, Ethan Winthrop.|$|E
5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just {{enough to keep the}} breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war, and along with fresh imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E

5|$|Long's demise {{did not end}} the {{sequence}} of self-proclaimed mystics who raised armies and engaged in politics. During the interwar period, a sorcerer named Chem Keo claimed to be Long's reincarnation. During World War II, Huỳnh Phú Sổ {{claimed to be a}} living Buddha and quickly gathered more than a million supporters. He raised a large peasant army and battled both the French and the communist Viet Minh independence movement, before <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the latter. In another case in 1939, a Taoist attempted to demonstrate that he was immune to French bullets. Furthermore, in the years immediately after World War II, the Cao Đài's numbers swelled to 1.5million.|$|E
5|$|Predators on the {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog {{has also been}} recorded as taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked, as reflected in a high breeding success. There is a record of a corn crake on migration through Gabon <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> a black sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are {{particularly}} intelligent, {{can be trained}} to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> state officials.|$|E

2500|$|His {{story was}} the subject of stage melodramas during the 19th century, most notably Dion Boucicault's {{inaccurate}} 1884 play Robert Emmet. He mistakenly portrayed Emmet and Curran as Roman Catholics (they were both Protestants), her father John Philpot Curran being portrayed as a Unionist, and Emmet <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> onstage <b>by</b> firing squad.|$|R
5000|$|In his epitaph for the Colony Room, novelist Will Self {{argued against}} {{the view that}} the closure {{demonstrated}} that [...] "the old Soho is <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> off <b>by</b> smoking bans and other sanitising measures.

5|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} military program, the , wherein fifty randomly selected classes of third-year junior {{high school students are}} kidnapped, dropped into a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> a friend.|$|E
5|$|Their nocturnal {{approach}} to the breeding sites means that Zino's petrels avoid the attentions of gulls or diurnal raptors, and the only owl on the island, the barn owl, is a rodent hunter. Other than bats, there are no native land mammals on Madeira, although {{there are a number}} of introduced species, two of which will take birds or chicks. These are brown rats and feral domestic cats. Even the high mountain nest sites of the Zino's petrel are not safe from these adaptable predators, ten adults <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> cats in 1990. Feather lice found on Zino's petrels include Trabeculus schillingi, Saemundssonia species and an unnamed species of Halipeurus.|$|E
5|$|With the Nazi {{invasion}} of Belgium on 10 May 1940, Zita {{and her family}} became war refugees. They narrowly missed <b>being</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> a direct hit on the castle by German bombers and fled to Prince Xavier's French Castle in Bostz. The Habsburgs then fled to the Spanish border, reaching it on 18 May. They moved on to Portugal where the U.S. Government granted the family exit visas on 9 July. After a perilous journey they arrived in New York City on 27 July, having family in Long Island and Newark, New Jersey.; at one point, Zita and several of her children lived, as long-term house-guests, in Tuxedo Park, New York.|$|E
