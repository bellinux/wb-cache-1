5|$|After the 1987 {{resignation}} of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded {{his own private}} equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm {{was responsible for the}} 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign {{of the end of the}} 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in , and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.|$|E
5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E

5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of plasma polymers as coatings {{has also been}} studied. Plasma polymers formed from tetramethoxysilane have been studied as protective coatings and have shown to increase the hardness of polyethylene and polycarbonate. The use of plasma polymers to coat plastic lenses is increasing in popularity. Plasma depositions are able to easily coat curved materials with a good uniformity, {{such as those of}} bifocals. The different plasma polymers used can <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> scratch resistant, but also hydrophobic leading to anti-fogging effects.|$|E

25|$|Designed by the {{architect}} Philip Hardwick, it {{was inspired by}} the Roman architecture Hardwick encountered on a trip to Italy in 1818 and 1819. Strictly speaking it was not an arch at all, but a propylaeum of the Doric order. The sandstone structure was designed for the London and Birmingham Railway (L), complementing Birmingham Curzon Street station, {{at the other end of}} the company's mainline.

25|$|In the United States, {{mandatory}} vaccination laws sometimes provoke {{opposition from}} members of anti-government or libertarian factions, who express concern for what they view as the convergence or merger {{of the public and}} private sectors. They point to possible conflicts of interest due to vaccine research funding and misinformation that fuels debate on both sides. Others argue that, for compulsory vaccination to effectively prevent disease, there must <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> available vaccines and a population willing to immunize, but also sufficient ability to decline vaccination on grounds of personal belief.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that filamentation is induced as a response of DNA damage (by the mechanisms previously exposed), participating SulA mechanism and additional factors. Furthermore, {{the length of the}} filamentous bacteria could have a stronger attachment to the epithelial cells, with an increased number of adhesins participating in the interaction, making even harder the work for (PMN). The interaction between phagocyte cells and adopting filamentous-shape bacteria provide an advantage to their survival.

Baeksuk, which is the Korean counterpart to the chicken noodle soup of Western culture, is also popular among Koreans for its power to cure minor illnesses such as a cold.

25|$|Freud, like Josef Breuer, {{found the}} {{hypothesis}} that hysterical manifestations were generated by ideas to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> warranted, but given in observation.

Richard Wollheim comments that given the close correspondence between hysteria {{and the results of}} hypnosis, Breuer's hypothesis appears more plausible, and that it is only when repression is taken into account that Freud's hypothesis becomes preferable.|$|E

25|$|In March 1949, Holloway was {{the junior}} {{member of the}} Stearns-Eisenhower Board, convened to {{consider}} the topic of educational unification among the services.

To everyone's surprise, Holloway persuaded the other members to adopt the diametrically opposite recommendation that the existing service academy system <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> preserved but expanded by adding a new service academy for the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Having {{lost his}} home world of Krypton, Superman is very {{protective}} of Earth, and especially of Clark Kent's family and friends. This same loss, {{combined with the}} pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite having his friends and parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians, Power Girl (who is, in fact from the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe) and Mon-El, have led to disappointment. The arrival of Supergirl, who has been confirmed to <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> from Krypton, but also his cousin, has relieved this loneliness somewhat. Superman's Fortress of Solitude acts {{as a place of}} solace for him in times of loneliness and despair.|$|E
