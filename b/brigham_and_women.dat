Previous studies demonstrate substantial variability in the accuracy of GDM reporting, and rarely report how the GDM was diagnosed. Our aim was to identify deliveries coded as gestational diabetes, and then to determine how the diagnosis was assigned and whether the diagnosis followed established guidelines. Methods We identified which deliveries were coded at discharge as complicated by GDM at the <b>Brigham</b> <b>and</b> <b>Women</b> 2 ̆ 019 s Hospital in Boston, MA for the year 2010.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Single-segment {{saphenous vein}} remains the optimal conduit for infrainguinal revascularization. In its absence, {{prosthetic}} conduit may be used. Existing data regarding {{the significance of}} anastomotic distal vein adjunct (DVA) usage with prosthetic grafts are based on small series. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysisderived from the regional Vascular Study Group of New England {{as well as the}} <b>Brigham</b> <b>and</b> <b>Women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s hospital database. A total of 1018 infrainguinal prosthetic bypass grafts were captured in the dataset from 73 surgeons at 15 participating institutions. Propensity scoring and 3 : 1 matching was performed to create similar exposure groups for analysis. Outcome measures of interest included: primary patency, freedom from major adverse limb events (MALEs), and amputation free survival at 1 year as a function of vein patch utilization. Time to event data were compared with the log-rank test; multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the adjusted association between vein cuff usage and the primary end points. DVA was defined as a vein patch, cuff, or boot in any configuration. RESULTS: Of the 1018 bypass operations, 94 (9. 2...|$|E
40|$|Gawande’s fourth popular book, Being Mortal, layers {{touching}} {{story after}} touching story into a devastating critique {{of how people}} approach the end of life. At times, keeping all the narratives straight proves difficult, yet each piece of each narrative remains powerful. These accounts are woven neatly together with personal and professional reflection as well as scholarship. For example, {{in the midst of}} telling readers about his grandmother-in-law 2 ̆ 7 s approach to the end of life, surgeon/journalist Gawande (<b>Brigham</b> <b>and</b> <b>Women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital; Harvard Medical School; The New Yorker) quotes B. Vladeck, summing up the origins of one problematic approach: “describing the history of nursing homes {{from the perspective of the}} elderly ‘is like describing the opening of the American West from the perspective of the mules’” (Unloving Care: The Nursing Home Tragedy, 1980). As Being Mortal draws to a close, Gawande offers some (albeit tentative) recommendations for improving how people face the end of life. Though he does not break new ground here, he rightly points out and announces human shortcomings in a way that all can see and understand. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All levels/libraries...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of functional dissymmetry (or asymmetry) {{between the two}} sides of the brain seems to have been suggested in the fifth century BC by Hippocrates, when he pointed out that wounds on one side of the head usually caused seizures on the opposite side of the body (1). At approximately the same time the Biblical psalmist said, "If I forget you, 0 Jerusalem, let my right hand wither! Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you" 2; a tongue that does not move well, associated with right-upper-extremity weakness, would suggest speech difficulty caused by a stroke in the left hemi-sphere. Somewhat more scientifically, Marc Dax noted in 1836 that aphasia in right-handed indi-viduals was generally associated with lesions in the left hemisphere. This concept was generally ignored until after Broca's work on aphasia was presented in 1865 (2). Although numerous articles did appear in the first two-thirds of the present century, mainly by anatomists and anthropologists, describing some morphologic brain asymmetries, the differences were so small that correlation between the asym-metries and cerebral function were considered by many scientists to be probably irrelevant (3). Advances in technology have made it easier to discover structural dissymmetries in the cerebral hemispheres. We are now trying harder to relate them to brain function. 1 Address reprint requests to Dr LeMay, <b>Brigham</b> <b>and</b> <b>Women</b> 's Hos...|$|E

40|$|Seizures {{are a major}} {{presenting}} {{feature of}} several non-neoplastic cerebral lesions. We reviewed the experience at the <b>Brigham</b> <b>and</b> <b>Women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital, Boston, on the surgical management of benign intracerebral lesions presenting with seizures with intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) guidance. Our aim was to demonstrate {{that this is an}} effective and efficient treatment for these lesions. The histories of thirteen patients who presented with seizures secondary to benign intraaxial lesions treated by craniotomy and resection within the iMRI unit at our institution were reviewed. The surgical results, histology and clinical outcomes were reviewed. The mean follow-up was 22. 1 months (range 2 - 48). In all cases, lesions were accurately located with iMRI. After initial macroscopic resection, 5 cases were found to have residual lesion. All had complete radiological resection {{at the end of the}} procedure. At follow-up, five patients had no seizures, 5 had rare seizures and the remaining 3 had worthwhile improvement in seizure frequency. Intraoperative MRI is a safe and effective adjunct for the surgical treatment of benign intracerebral lesions presenting with seizures. It provides effective and efficient intraoperative guidance for planning and approach to the lesion and the assurance that the lesion is totally removed. Surgical resection with iMRI may, therefore, provide a useful approach to these lesions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
