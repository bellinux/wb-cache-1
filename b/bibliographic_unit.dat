It outlines some specific features of electronic resources and reasons why conventional cataloging methods are not proper for description of these resources. The main goal of this work is to make reader acquainted with selected descriptive metadata formats and illustrate their usage in practice. [...] Problems of determination of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>unit</b> are mentioned briefly. There is short chapter on IFLA study Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR, [URL] Bibliographic entities and their relations are presented.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the stability of}} the co-authorship networks in time. The analysis is done on the networks of Slovenian researchers in two time periods (1991 - 2000 and 2001 - 2010). Two researchers are linked if they published at least one scientific <b>bibliographic</b> <b>unit</b> in a given time period. As proposed by Kronegger et al. (2011), the global network structures are examined by generalized blockmodeling with the assumed multi-core [...] semi-periphery [...] periphery blockmodel type. The term core denotes a group of researchers who published together in a systematic way with each other. The obtained blockmodels are comprehensively analyzed by visualizations and through considering several statistics regarding the global network structure. To measure {{the stability of the}} obtained blockmodels, different adjusted modified Rand and Wallace indices are applied. Those enable to distinguish between the splitting and merging of cores when operationalizing the stability of cores. Also, the adjusted modified indices can be used when new researchers occur in the second time period (newcomers) and when some researchers are no longer present in the second time period (departures). The research disciplines are described and clustered according to the values of these indices. Considering the obtained clusters, the sources of instability of the research disciplines are studied (e. g., merging or splitting of cores, newcomers or departures). Furthermore, the differences in the stability of the obtained cores on the level of scientific disciplines are studied by linear regression analysis where some personal characteristics of the researchers (e. g., age, gender), are also considered...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundStrong {{growth of}} {{interdisciplinary}} sciences might find exceptional example in academic health economics. We decided {{to observe the}} quantitative output in this science {{since the beginning of}} the twenty-first century. MethodsElectronic search of the published literature was conducted in four different databases: one medical database—MEDLINE/PubMed, two general databases—Scopus/Elsevier and Web of Science (WoS), and one specialized health economic database—NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED). The applied combination of key words was carefully chosen to cover the most commonly used terms in titles of publications dealing with conceptual areas of health economics. All bibliographic units were taken into account. ResultsWithin the time horizon from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2016, without language or limitations on <b>bibliographic</b> <b>unit</b> types, we identified an output ranging approximately from 60, 345 to 88, 246 records with applied search strategy in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus/Elsevier, and WoS. In NHS EED, we detected 14, 761 records of economic evaluations of health interventions during the period in which database was maintained and regularly updated. With slightly more than one-third of the identified records, USA clearly dominates in this field. United Kingdom takes a strong second place with about 12 % of identified records. Consistently, USA and UK universities are the most frequent among the top 15 affiliations/organizations of the authors of the identified records. Authors from Harvard University contributed to the largest number of the identified records. ConclusionThere is a clear evidence of both the upward stream of blossoming in health economics publications and its acceleration. Based on this bibliographic data set, it is difficult to distinguish the actual impact growth of this output provided dominantly by academia with modest contribution by pharmaceutical/medicinal device industry and diverse national government-based agencies. Further insight into the citation track record of these individual publications could provide helpful upgrade and a perspective on ongoing development...|$|E

Methodology. On various stages of the survey the following methods were used: analysis and synthesis, comparison, generalization, primary sources search; sociological method (survey). These methods allowed determining, processing and ana lyzing the whole complex of available sources, which became an important factor of research objectivity. Finding. Survey results allowed us to analyze the dynamics of changes, new needs of the readers, and to make a decision regarding the quality improvement of information search services. Practical value. Creating a theoretical foundation for implementation of set tasks is the practical value of the acquired findings. Conclusions and results of the research can be used in university students’, postgraduates’ and professors’ information search activities. Certain results of the research are used and implemented in practice of the library of Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University, namely at workshops on the basics of information culture (using <b>bibliographic</b> reference <b>unit,</b> information search by key words, authors and titles via electronic catalogue). Guides for users were created. Duty bibliographer’s work on providing information search services for the users was improved. Results. Consequently, the experience of the library of Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University’s shows that both electronic and card catalogs may coexist, they complement each other, and facilitate providing quality services for the users, that’s why today the discontinuation of using card catalogs is untimely. Traditional catalogs will be used for a long time. The advantage of using electronic catalogue is availability of quick and efficient information search by any element of bibliographic entry, as well as possibilities for completing various users’ requests.

U suvremenim studijama inovativnost se ističe kao ključni čimbenik promjena i razvoja. Inovativna komunikacija je strateška sposobnost planiranja, izvršavanja, koordiniranja i vrednovanja dionika komunikacijskog procesa kako bi se ustanovile, proširile i redefinirale komparativne prednosti u cilju stvaranja inovativne poslovne organizacije (Pfeffermann, 2012).

This {{doctoral}} thesis was {{created as a}} result of the motivation of the author to explore the notion of communication and innovative communication approaches that affect the success of business organizations in the Republic of Croatia. In contemporary studies, innovation is highlighted as a key factor for change and development. Innovative communication is the strategic ability to plan, execute, coordinate and evaluate stakeholders of the communicative process as a means to found, spread and redefine comparative advantages in the aim to creative innovative business organisations. (Pfeffermann, 2012). The aim of this doctorate research is to determine guidelines in innovative communication in the business envirnonment, the strategies and their holders, as well as to explore how they hold-up in the works of the business organisation, their reputation and position on the market. This research document will shed light upon what exactly has an effect on the innovation and innovative communication in the business organisation. The research shall show how a proactive communication strategy affects the innovative envirnonment in an organisation. It will perceive the communicative guideslines which define a innovative business organisation. The paper is structured in the following manner: it consists of five chapters (Introduction, Innovative Communications and Communicating, Researching Innovative Communication, Discussion, and Conclusion). It also embodies the Acknowledgments, Information about the Mentor, the Conclusion along with key words in both Croatian and English, Content, Bibliography, Annexes (photo list, graph list and copy of survey) and Biography. It is written on 213 pages and includes 29 photos, 70 graphs and 134 <b>bibliographic</b> <b>units.</b> In the first chapter (Introductory Considerations) a theoretical introduction is shown in the area of research, with a clear view of current research in the area of innovative communications. A description of the relevance and importance of the research in the given topic is examined, as well as an explanation of the structure. The methadology used is shown in the research which was carried out, and has been corroborated with research questions which led the way to the empirical area of the thesis. The scientific contribution which was expected is explained in detail. The goal of the research is clearly defined, whose stronghold is in the establishing of the type of innovative work organisations belong to in the researched organisations in the Republic of Croatia, and which forms and types of communications are being used most often in the Republic of Croatia. In this manner it is seen which innovative processes are used in order to define which of the examined work organisations have been recognised as innovative. Three hypopethesis have been researched: H 1 : Only specific forms of communication encourage innovativness on behalf of management in a work organisation. Innovative communication (professional, proaktiv, assertive, conruent, spontaneous, open, goal aiming, communicating with the use of creative techniques which are realised through personal communication, meetings, internet, social media, press releases, exhibitions, presentations, fairs etc.) encourages the innovativeness of a work organisation (creativeness, innovativeness, imagination, market competition, developement, change) which is proven by the descriptive analysis and corroboration of the empirical research. H 2 : There is a link between the quality of communication process and the innovative atmosphere in the workplace of an organisation. It has been proven that there exists a connection between the quality of the communication process (a continued exchange and evaluation of information as well as the opinion of the inner and outer stakeholders; planning, carrying-out, control and evaluation of communication activity within and out of the work organisation on an operative and strategic level, the establishing of professional communication processes with vital groups etc.) and innovative work atmosphere of the organisation (including management, workers, innovative teams, advisers, professionals, scientific institutions, partners and interes groups, politics and the end user in the process of creativing new ideas, development and production of innovative products, as well as their introduction to the market) which is confirmed with an extensive analysis and corroboration of the empirical research. H 3 : Work organisations in the Republic of Croati which have a reputation and are in leading postitions on the market, belong to work organisations which are catagorised as continual, dynamic and innovative organisations and are therefore the most desirable form of innovative work organisations. Successful work organisations in the Republic of Croatia encourage productivness, and have a reputation and a leading position on the market, belong to a specific type of innovative organisation, with that the most desirable form being dinamic continual innovative work organisation, which is seen via the network pages of the examined work organisations, and have been substantiated by the results oft he empirical research. In the second chapter (Innovative Communications and Communicating) a state review description has been addressed and former research in the area of communication in work organisations, concepts and topicalities in the areas of creativeness and innovativness have been problematised. In this chapter, the notion of creativity and innovatiness have been defined, as well as their interralation which in a stimulating atmosphere in work organisations, bring innovative communication. Highlighted are the benefits which creative and innovative communication bring, as corporative and imperative in creating successful and recognised work organisations. A difussion of innovations which the author applies to the development of innovative communication in work organisations, is shown. The importance of the development of innovative communication is featured, as a social type of innovation, being one of the most important factors of development, work productivity and on-going employability. European documentation which innovative communications raise importance from a legal stance (the Republic of Croatia being a member of the EU has the obligation to carry-out iniciatives and strategies) have been indicated. In giving examples of the text and theoritical displays, the author has used displays of photographs and graphs which have contributed to the clearness of the work. In combination of the theoretical displays and contributions of innovative communications, the author has stressed the importance of understanding and investing in the innovative society (work organisation) and its on-going improvement. In the third chapter (Researching Innovative Communication) a detailed methodology and research plan, goal and hypothesis is shown. It has been designed, systematised and logically combined and shows the reseaching of innovative communications, where previous scientific knowledge has been taken into consideration in an effort to come to new paradigma. It has contributed to a relatively unexplored area of innovative communication. The chapter shows investigation carried out with the goal of finding the entrance of innovative communication. A coincidental sample (203 respondents) was used. The research was carried out in five large work organisations in the Republic of Croatia: Končar – ELEKTROINDUSTRIJA d. d., Hrvatska elektroprivreda d. d., Vipnet d. o. o. Hrvatska, Hrvatski Telekom d. d. i Ericsson Nikola Tesla d. d. as well as other organisations. Using on-line surveys all levels of management were tesed, as well as units responsible for communication. Criteria which were used for selected professional organisations were: success rate on the market, the possession of organisational units which are responsible for communication, disimilarity shares of ownership kapita in mentioned organisations and the like. The research was done individualy, in a manner where managers were questioned via Internet, as well as in printed form where necessary, and was delivered in the form of a survey in Google Doc format. The survey, which was translated, which was used by the authors Zerfass and Ernst: „Forschungsprojekt „Kommunikation als Erfolgsfaktor im Innovationsmanagement“ (Zerfass i Ernst, 2004) has already been used in Germany for scientific research in the areas of media. Therefore, the curents version of the authors version can be compared with the previose mentioned Greman version in the field of the innovative communication. In the empirical segment oft he research, a description oft he research intrument is given as well as the respondents, results oft he research int he area of innovation and innovative communications. The findings are reasoned with photos and graphs which are explained according to the given goal oft he research and research questions. In the forth chapter the results were interpreted and the highlighted main discoveries which resulted from the conducted research.
