5|$|On release, Contact Harvest {{reached a}} top spot of #3 on the New York Times bestseller list, where it {{remained}} for four weeks. The novel also {{appeared on the}} USA Today bestsellers list at the same time. Reviewers noted that despite being an unproven writer, Staten had succeeded in crafting an excellent novel.

5|$|Seventh-century Muslim armies had no siege equipment, and {{typically}} employed siege tactics {{only when there}} were no other options. Without the necessary siege equipment, armies of the early Muslim expansion would surround a city, denying it supplies until the city's defenders surrendered. Meanwhile any chance of <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city would be availed, if possible, using stealth and espionage. Muslim armies would usually isolate the city {{from the rest of the}} region and deploy scouts along vital routes.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.|$|E
5|$|Müller's role can be {{described}} as an attacking all-rounder, a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder, but since <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4–2–3–1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern, and on the right for Germany. He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.|$|E

A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{started his}} career with local side Cambridge United, {{progressing}} through the club's youth system and eventually <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first-team in 2001. He spent three seasons at Cambridge, but was released {{at the end of}} the 2003–04 season after failing to agree terms on a new contract. Bridges had a brief spell in Latvia playing for FK Rīga, before returning to England to play four games for Braintree Town in January 2005. He joined Histon in March 2005, playing for the club until the end of the season. He left Histon {{at the end of the}} season, and subsequently earned himself a one-year contract to rejoin Cambridge United in July 2005.

5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} {{in favour of}} using the 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier suggested he would never resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision to pack the midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first team, Wenger chose to deviate from their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted a fluid 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger switched to a 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E
5|$|Comminges {{began his}} career playing for Amiens SC, <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first-team during the 2001–02 season. He joined Stade Reims of Ligue 2 the {{following}} season, and spent four years with the club. In 2007, Comminges moved to England, signing for Football League One side Swindon Town on a one-year deal, after a successful trial, and played regularly during the 2007–08 season. When his contract expired, he signed for Championship side Cardiff City on a free transfer. During his time at Cardiff, Comminges was briefly loaned out to Carlisle United. In January 2011, he left Cardiff and joined Southend United on a free transfer {{for the remainder of}} the 2010–11 campaign. He was released by Southend at the end of the season, and later signed for MLS side Colorado Rapids in September 2011. Comminges left the club when his short-term contract expired in January 2012. He joined League One side Stevenage, signing in September 2012 after a successful trial period, and spent a season at the club before being released in May 2013.|$|E
5|$|Comminges {{had played}} youth {{football}} {{in his native}} Guadeloupe for local side Rapid Club Petit-Canal before moving to France in 1997. After a successful spell on trial, he joined the youth academy at Amiens SC {{at the age of}} 15, <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first-team in 2002. Although naturally right-footed, Comminges' first experience in the Amiens first-team came as a left sided player as manager Denis Troch was forced to utilise him in an unfamiliar position following an injury crisis at the club. During the 2002–03 season, he made 14 league appearances as Amiens finished in a mid-table position, despite only being on an amateur contract at the club. He left the club in May 2003, and joined Stade Reims of Championnat National, the third division of the French football league system, on a free transfer. In his first season with the club, he helped the side earn promotion to Ligue 2, with Reims finishing the season as champions. During his four years with the club, Comminges made 74 league appearances, with Reims establishing themselves in the second tier of French football.|$|E

5|$|Constable {{started his}} career with the Cirencester Town youth system, before <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first team during the 2002–03 season. He moved to Chippenham Town in 2003, before signing for Walsall in the Football League in 2005. He moved out on loan to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in 2006, before signing {{permanently}} in 2007. After a year at the club, during which he scored the first club goal at the new Wembley Stadium in the 2007 FA Trophy Final, he returned to the League with Shrewsbury Town. After spending 2008–09 on loan at Oxford United, he signed for the club permanently in 2009. Constable scored the second goal in Oxford's 3–1 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final victory over York City in 2010, which secured Oxford's promotion into League Two. He was leading goalscorer in each of his six seasons at the club, and when he left after 2013–14 he had scored 106 goals, one short of the club record.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played {{for the first time}} as a false nine, {{positioned}} as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He assisted with a chip his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Returning to the wing, he played his first final since <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey. With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Pogba {{was named}} by The Guardian {{as one of}} the ten most {{promising}} young players in Europe. On 20 February, Pogba scored his first goal in UEFA club competitions as Juventus defeated Trabzonspor 2–0 at home in the first leg of the round of 32 of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. On 14 April, Pogba produced an assist in Juventus's 2–0 win over Udinese, the same team that Pogba scored two magnificent goals against in the previous season. Later that week, Pogba scored the only goal in Juventus's 1–0 win over Bologna. Pogba was also named the man of the match for his performance. Pogba would prove to be a key player for the club that season, <b>breaking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> starting line-up, and making more appearances (51) for the club than any other player across all competitions that season, also scoring 9 goals. He finished the season by winning his second consecutive Serie A title under manager Antonio Conte, and reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League.|$|E
