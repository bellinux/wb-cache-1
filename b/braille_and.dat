5|$|New Method for Representing by Dots... (1839) {{put forth}} Braille's {{plan for a}} new writing system with which blind people could write letters that could be read by sighted people. Called decapoint, the system {{combined}} his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by <b>Braille</b> <b>and</b> requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.|$|E

25|$|Other {{systems for}} {{assigning}} values to braille patterns are also followed beside the simple mapping of the alphabetical order onto the original French order.

25|$|The book {{finishes}} with {{a proposal}} for braille shorthand, utilizing the first decade for vowels, and the fifth for consonants (without a voicing distinction). That is, Braille's shorthand used a 4-dot cell rather than the standard 6-dot cell, taking two-thirds the space of normal <b>braille,</b> <b>and</b> one-third the space of Barbier's night writing.|$|E
25|$|A braille {{embosser}} is, simply put, {{a printer}} for braille. Instead {{of a standard}} printer adding ink onto a page, the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page.

25|$|A third {{principle}} was {{to assign}} braille codes according to frequency, with the simplest patterns (quickest ones to write) {{assigned to the}} most frequent letters of the alphabet. Such frequency-based alphabets were used in Germany and the United States in the 19th century (see American Braille), but none are attested in modern use. Finally, there are braille scripts which don't order the codes numerically at all, such as Japanese <b>Braille</b> <b>and</b> Korean Braille, {{which are based on}} more abstract principles of syllable composition.|$|E
