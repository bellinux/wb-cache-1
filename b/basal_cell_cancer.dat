25|$|<b>Basal</b> <b>cell</b> {{carcinoma}} {{makes up}} about 1–2% of vulvar cancer. These {{tend to be}} slow-growing lesions on the labia majora but can occur anywhere on the vulva.

50|$|To {{diagnose}} <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas, a skin biopsy {{is performed}} for histopathologic analyses. The most common method is a shave biopsy under local anesthesia.

The quoted cure rate for Mohs surgery on previously treated <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> is about 94%. Reasons for variations in the cure rate include the following.|$|E
5000|$|The cure rate {{is highly}} user dependent. [...] The more {{aggressive}} the surgeon is at performing EDC, {{the higher the}} cure rate. Like standard excision, the wider the surgical margin, the higher the cure rate. Cure rate for small cancer is higher than cure rate for larger cancers. Cure rate for nodular <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> is higher than for infiltrative <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer.</b> Essentially, all the prognostic factors that apply to Mohs surgery and standard surgical excision will also apply to EDC.|$|E

Surgical excision cure rate varies from 99% for wide margin (4 to 6 mm) and small tumor, to {{as low as}} 70% for narrow margins applied to large tumors. Here {{the weakness of the}} procedure is the histopathological processing, and not the surgeon himself. The fault of the surgeon is lack of understanding pathology laboratory methods, and failing to follow the standard of care for adequate surgical margin. Usually, the cure rate using standard bread loafing is very low for narrow surgical margin and a large tumor, and very high for large margins on small tumors. It is the pathology lab that makes the difference, especially when frozen section is utilized in the operating theater. A randomized study assigning patients with recurrent facial <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> to either Mohs surgery or standard excision revealed no statistical difference in the treatment of primary basal cell carcinoma. It found a higher cure rate with Mohs surgery in the treatment of recurrent basal cell carcinoma (5 year recurrence rate of 2.4% for Mohs vs 12.1% for standard).|$|E

Four methods of treatment were used during the period: simple excision with primary closure (n = 43), skin grafting or trans-position flap (n = 19), radiotherapy (n = 99), and cryosurgical ablation (n = 34). The methods were compared by observing the immediate results, the subsequent tumour recurrence rate {{and the length of}} follow-up. Statistical comparison of tumour recurrence rate showed no significant difference between treatment groups. Radiotherapy had the lowest recurrence rate (2 %), but required an average of 9 out-patient treatment attendances. Excision with primary closure carried the highest recurrence rate (9. 3 %), whilst excision with defect closure by flap or graft, which needed a mean in-patient stay of 8. 2 days, and cryosurgical treatment had similar recurrence rates of 5 to 6 %. Comparing the modes of treatment, cryosurgery was quickest to perform, required no hospitalization and less than 2 out-patient treatment sessions per patient and gave the best cosmetic result.

5000|$|A shave biopsy is {{done with}} either a small scalpel blade or a curved razor blade. The {{technique}} is very much user skill dependent, as some surgeons can remove a small fragment of skin with minimal blemish using {{any one of the}} above tools, while others have great difficulty securing the devices. Ideally, the razor will shave only a small fragment of protruding tumor and leave the skin relatively flat after the procedure. Hemostasis is obtained using light electrocautery, Monsel's solution, or aluminum chloride. This is the ideal method of diagnosis for <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer.</b> It can be used to diagnose squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma-in-situ, however, the doctor's understanding of the growth of these last two cancers should be considered before one uses the shave method. The punch or incisional method is better for the latter two cancers as a false negative is less likely to occur (i.e. calling a squamous cell cancer an actinic keratosis or keratinous debris). Hemostasis for the shave technique can be difficult if one relies on electrocautery alone.

40|$|Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{increasingly}} used for non-invasive destruction of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer</b> mediated by a photochemical reaction. There is no evidence-based data on its efficacy. Aim: To compare the objective response of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer</b> of various clinical types, stages, histological types, course and localization to PDT with the intralesional administration of photosensitizers Radachlorin and Fotoditazin. Materials and methods: From March 2007 to March 2010, the study recruited 74   patients with primary and relapsing solid basal skin cancer (ulcerated, 40. 5 %  of patients, superficial, 24 %, nodular, 21. 5 %, scleroderma-like, 14 %), stage  Ι–ΙI (mostly Т₂N₀M₀); with localization that was unfavorable {{in terms of}} relapses and inconvenient for treatment application. The tumors were of a uniform complex histological type and of a morphea type. The patients were administered one course of PDT with an intralesional administration of chlorine photosensitizers. The group I (n= 45) was administered Radachlorin (0. 5 – 1  mL per 1  cm² of the tumor surface), group II (n= 34) was administered Fotoditazin (0. 3 – 0. 5   mL per 1   cm² of the tumor surface). For all patients the light dose was chosen at 300  J/cm², the light source being the medical laser device LAMI with a wave length of 662 ± 3  nm, class II А. Clinical and cytological regression of the lesions at 3  months after treatment was chosen as a  primary study endpoint. The secondary endpoints were a  stable clinical and cytological response at 12  months after treatment. Thereafter, a relapse-free period was assessed annually up to 5  years after treatment. In addition, adverse reactions to treatment were registered up to 2  months and cosmetic results were assessed at 12  months after PDT. The treatment results were assessed in all patients. Results: Complete regression of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer</b> was found in 43  (95. 5 %) of patients from the group I  and in 31   (91. 2 %) patients from the group II. Partial regression was seen in 2  (4. 5 %) and 3   (8. 8 %) of patients, respectively; these patients were subsequently cured by repeated courses of PDT. In both groups, {{there was no difference}} in the early treatment results in patients with various clinical forms of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer</b> at Т₁N₀M₀ (p> 0. 05). There was a  significant improvement in the treatment results for the ulcer type of the tumor at stage T₂N₀M₀: 92. 8 %  in the group  I  and 77. 8 % in the group II (р< 0. 05). The long-term follow-up  showed  a  5 -year  relapse-free  disease  in 42 (97. 7 %) of 43 cured patients of the group I and in 30 (96. 8 %) of 31 patients in the group II. Adverse events  were  seen  in  all  patients;  however,  they were  limited  to  short-term  unavoidable  adverse reactions such as skin hyperemia, edema, exudation, paresthesia and pain. Eight (8) per cent of patients from the group I and 6 % from the group II had  their  blood  pressure  values  increase.   An  excellent  and  good  cosmetic  result  after  PDT  was observed in the majority of patients (74. 4 % in the group  I  and  77. 4 %  in  the  group  II).   Conclusion: PDT with the intralesional administration of pho- tosensitizers Radachlorin and Fotoditazin is an effective treatment approached for any clinical and morphological type of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer.</b> It is associated with minimal adverse reactions and has an acceptable cosmetic result. </p...|$|R

The present study is based on {{morphology}} and represents a cellular and genetic investigation of p 53 alterations in normal human skin and <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer.</b> Using double immunofluorescent labelling, we have demonstrated an increase in thymine dimers and p 53 protein expression in the same keratinocytes following ultraviolet radiation. Large inter-individual differences in the kinetics of thymine dimer repair and subsequent epidermal p 53 response were evident in both sunscreen-protected and non-protected skin. The formation of thymine dimers and the epidermal p 53 response were partially blocked by topical sunscreen. We have optimized a method to analyze the p 53 gene in single cells from frozen tissue sections. In chronically sun-exposed skin there exist clusters of p 53 immunoreactive keratinocytes (p 53 clones) in addition to scattered p 53 immunoreactive cells. Laser assisted microdissection was used to retrieve single keratinocytes from immunostained tissue sections, single cells were amplified and the p 53 gene was sequenced. We have shown that p 53 mutations are prevalent in normal skin. Furthermore, we detected an epidermal p 53 clone which had prevailed despite two months of total protection from ultraviolet light.

40|$|Aim: To {{increase}} {{the efficacy of}} radiation therapy of malignant epithelial cell skin neoplasms {{with the use of}} radiation sensitizers of hypoxic tumor cells. Materials and methods: The study was performed in 517 patients with <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> (n = 361) and squamous cell (n = 156) skin cancer, 274 (53 %) of whom had T 2 and 243 (47 %), T 3 tumors. Patients with locally advanced and metastatic tumors were excluded from the study. The following treatment modalities were used: distant gamma-therapy, short-distance radiation therapy and combined radiation therapy with the use of non-conventional dose fractioning at total local doses equal to 72 – 73 Gr. The sensibilization of hypoxic tumor cells to radiation therapy with metronidazole was done by targeted delivery of the drug to the tumor by means of topical application of Coletex-M drapes impregnated with metronidazole in a high concentration (up to 20 mcg/cm²). The second method of radiosensibilization of hypoxic tumor cells was based on a preliminary use of low intensity laser radiation onto the tumor. As a source this radiation, a helium neon laser was used with the power of up to 12 mVt and the wave length of 0. 63 to 0. 89 mcm, duration of sessions from 3 to 15 minutes. The control group comprised 192 skin cancer patients who underwent radiation therapy without the use of radiation sensitizers. Results: The use of metronidazole and low intensity laser radiation within the radiation therapy of T 3 skin cancer patients, compared to the treatment without the radiation modifiers, significantly improved the immediate cure rates (full tumor regression at 1 to 1. 5 months after completion of radiation) from 75. 5 ± 3. 1 % to 89. 2 ± 1. 9 % (р < 0. 05). In the group with <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer</b> that underwent radiation therapy combined with metronidazole, there was an association of its radio-modifying effect and tumor size. Short-distance roentgenotherapy of patients with T 2 <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer</b> and tumor size of < 4 cm was equally effective, irrespective of the use of metronidazole: the immediate cure rate was 94. 8 ± 2. 2 % (92 / 97 patients) in the metronidazole group and 89. 8 ± 3. 9 % (53 / 59) in the control group. With the combined radiation therapy of T 2 basal skin cancer patients with the tumor size of 4 – 5 cm, the immediate cure rate was increased significantly from 73. 2 ± 6. 9 % (30 / 42) in the control group to 88. 2 ± 3. 7 % in the metronidazole group (67 / 76) (р < 0. 05). With distant gamma-therapy of T 3 <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer,</b> this parameter was increased from 70. 5 ± 6. 8 % (31 / 44) in the control group to 88. 4 ± 4. 8 % (38 / 43) in the metronidazole group (р < 0. 05). The radiation-sensitizing effect of metronidazole and low intensity laser combined with the distant gamma-therapy of T 3 <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancer</b> was significant and similar: the immediate cure rate with the use of metronidazole was 85. 9 ± 4. 6 % (49 / 57), and with the use of low intensity laser, 84. 6 ± 5. 0 % (44 / 52), compared to 66. 0 ± 6. 9 % (31 / 47) in the control group (р < 0. 05). Although the relapse rate after radiation therapy with metronidazole or low intensity laser was lower by 5 – 11 %, compared to that after the radiation without modifiers, there was no statistically significant difference after a 3 -year follow-up. Conclusion: A significant benefit of radiation therapy combined with radiation sensitizers on the immediate cure rate of locally-advanced <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> skin <b>cancers</b> was confirmed. It seems that radiation sensitizers of hypoxic cells do improve immediate results of cure without any significant effect on tumor relapse rate in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|Imiquimod {{belongs to}} the class of 1 H-imidazo-[4, 5 -c]quinolones - drugs {{originally}} developed as nucleoside analogues {{with the aim of}} finding new potential antiviral agents (Harrison et al., 1988). Indeed, Imiquimod was first released as treatment for genital warts before its actions against skin cancer were studied. Imiquimod is a relatively small sized molecule (Mr = 240. 3) and is hydrophobic, allowing it to penetrate the skin epidermal barrier and therefore making it suitable for topical formulations (Gerster et al., 2005). Imiquimod has shown itself effective against skin cancers and precancerous lesions, especially <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers</b> and actinic keratosis (Salasche et al., 2002, Beutner et al., 1999). There have been reports of Imiquimod being used as topical treatment against cutaneous metastases of melanoma and some authors have reported its use as first-line therapy against melanoma in situ (Smyth et al., 2011, Gagnon, 2011). We report a case of an invasive malignant melanoma arising de novo at the specific site of application of Imiquimod (Aldara cream 5 %) for a biopsy-proven superficial BCC. Therefore while Imiquimod has added to our topical armamentarium against skin cancer, care must be exercised in prescribing this treatment and it is especially important to follow up patients regularly...|$|R
