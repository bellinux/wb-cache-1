25|$|In Gaza, a {{four-year}} management contract {{was awarded to}} a joint venture of Lyonnaise des Eaux (now Suez) and Khatib and Alami in 1996. The contract was entirely funded by a US$25 million World Bank credit. According to a 1998 World <b>Bank</b> <b>paper,</b> water quality improved since the contract became active. Furthermore, water losses fell and water consumption and revenues rose. However, actual responsibility for service provision remained with municipalities. When the contract ended in 2000, it was renewed twice for one year until 2002. The World Bank reports that from 1996 to 2002, 16,000 illegal connections have been identified and more than 1,900km of pipes have been observed for leakage. Moreover, 22,000 connections have been replaced, more than 20km of pipes have been repaired and more than 30,000 water meters have been replaced. The amount of non-revenue water (NRW) decreased to about 30%. After {{the end of the}} contract, the Coastal Municipal Water Utility (CMWU) has been established to manage water and sanitation in the Gaza strip.|$|E

[...] However, in recent years after the DOTC took over maintenance of the train system in 2012, the safety and reliability of the system has been put into question, with experts calling it [...] "an accident waiting to happen", and while several incidents and accidents were reported between 2012 and 2014, that has not deterred commuters from continuing to patronize the system.

According to Fedozzi and Costa, this system has been recognized as a successful experience of interaction between people and the official administrative spheres in public administration and, as such, has gained a broad impact on the political scene nationally and internationally, being interpreted as a strategy {{for the establishment of}} an active citizenship in Brazil.

"Why," [...] says he, [...] "I've been tugging {{ever since}} harvest, getting out wheat and hauling {{it to the}} river to raise State <b>Bank</b> <b>paper</b> enough to pay my tax this year and a little school debt I owe; and now, just as I 've got it, here I open this infernal Extra Register, expecting to find it full of 'Glorious Democratic Victories' and 'High Comb'd Cocks,' when, lo and behold! I find a set of fellows, calling {{themselves}} officers of the State, have forbidden the tax collectors, and school commissioners to receive State paper at all; and so here it is dead on my hands.

60|$|The sum {{was part}} in specie, part in <b>bank</b> <b>paper,</b> and part in {{circular}} notes payable {{to the name}} of James Gregory. We took it out, counted it, enclosed it once more in a despatch-box belonging to Northmour, and prepared a letter in Italian which he tied to the handle. It was signed by both of us under oath, and declared that this was all the money which had escaped {{the failure of the}} house of Huddlestone. This was, perhaps, the maddest action ever perpetrated by two persons professing to be sane. Had the despatch-box fallen into other hands than those for which it was intended, we stood criminally convicted on our own written testimony; but as I have said, we were neither of us in a condition to judge soberly, and had a thirst for action that drove us to do something, right or wrong, rather than endure the agony of waiting. Moreover, as we were both convinced that the hollows of the links were alive with hidden spies upon our movements, we hoped that our appearance with the box might lead to a parley, and perhaps a compromise.|$|E

60|$|And if the chaise was a danger, what {{an anxiety}} was the despatch-box and its golden cargo! I {{had never had}} a care but to draw my pay and spend it; I had lived happily in the regiment, as in my father's house, fed by the great Emperor's commissariat as by {{ubiquitous}} doves of Elijah--or, my faith! if anything went wrong with the commissariat, helping myself with the best grace in the world from the next peasant! And now I began to feel {{at the same time the}} burthen of riches and the fear of destitution. There were ten thousand pounds in the despatch-box, but I reckoned in French money, and had two hundred and fifty thousand agonies; I kept it under my hand all day, I dreamed of it at night. In the inns, I was afraid to go to dinner and afraid to go to sleep. When I walked up a hill I durst not leave the doors of the claret-coloured chaise. Sometimes I would change the disposition of the funds: there were days when I carried as much as five or six thousand pounds on my own person, and only the residue continued to voyage in the treasure-chest--days when I bulked all over like my cousin, crackled to a touch with <b>bank</b> <b>paper,</b> and had my pockets weighed to bursting-point with sovereigns. And there were other days when I wearied of the thing--or grew ashamed of it--and put all the money back where it had come from: there let it take its chance, like better people! In short, I set Rowley a poor example of consistency, and, in philosophy, none at all.|$|E
