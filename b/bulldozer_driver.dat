2500|$|In 2010, Corrie's parents, {{represented}} by Attorney Hussein Abu Hussein, {{filed a lawsuit}} against the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli Defense Ministry in the Haifa District Court, seeking US$324,000 in compensation. The case began in Haifa on March 10, 2010. Judge Oded Gershon presided over the case. On October 21, 2010, the <b>bulldozer</b> <b>driver</b> who had run over Corrie testified for four hours, and was cross-examined by the Corries' attorney. At the request of state prosecutors, who argued that his life could be imperiled if he was publicly identified, the driver was hidden behind a screen and visible to only the judge and attorneys. A request by the Corrie family that they also be allowed to see the driver was turned down by the judge. The driver was identified only by his initials, [...] "YB", and a gag order was imposed on identifying details, although it was disclosed in court that he was a 38-year old Russian immigrant who had arrived in Israel at age 23, and was working for a food processing company at the time. The driver denied having seen her before hitting her. In addition, four experts, including an expert on the behalf of the Corrie family testified during the trial, and concluded that the <b>bulldozer</b> <b>driver</b> could not see Corrie. Four ISM witnesses testified during the case. However, the Palestinian physician from Gaza who had examined Corrie's wounds on the scene was unable to testify after Israel refused him an entry visa and rejected an application for him to testify by video link.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court ruled}} against Corrie's family on August 28, 2012. In a 62-page verdict, Judge Oded Gershon ruled that Corrie's death was an {{accident}} for which she was responsible, and absolved the IDF of any wrongdoing. The judge ruled that the <b>bulldozer</b> <b>driver</b> and his commander had a very limited field of vision and {{could not possibly have}} seen her. According to the judge [...] "The mission of the IDF force {{on the day of the}} incident was solely to clear the ground.... The mission did not include, in any way, the demolition of homes." [...] The court invoked the principle of the combatant activities exception, as the IDF was attacked in the same area where Corrie was killed a few hours earlier; that Corrie could have avoided the danger and that defendants were not at fault as there was neither intent nor negligence involved in her death. The judge said that the IDF did not violate Corrie's right to life because Corrie had placed herself in a dangerous situation, that Israel's investigation was appropriate and did not contain mistakes, and also criticized the U.S. government for failing to send a diplomatic representative to observe Corrie's autopsy. Gershon said: [...] "I rule unequivocally that the claim that the deceased was intentionally hit by the bulldozer is totally baseless. This was an extremely unfortunate accident. I reached the conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of the <b>bulldozer</b> <b>driver.</b> I reject the suit. There is no justification to demand the state pay any damages. She [...] did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done. She consciously put herself in harm's way." ...|$|E

Hardman became the first Jewish chaplain at the site. On arriving at the camp he tried to bring comfort to the survivors and said the Kaddish, the Jewish memorial prayer, over the dead. He tried to persuade the army <b>bulldozer</b> <b>drivers</b> who were pushing the bodies of the dead into a pit to bury them with some kind of dignity.

Photos of blond and petite Corrie, taken during the incident by fellow twenty-something nonviolent activists in the “International Solidarity Movement” (ISM), which Corrie had joined for her work in Palestine, showed her standing high {{on a pile of}} dirt in front of the American-made Caterpillar bulldozer. A small figure in a fluorescent jacket holding a bullhorn, she sat down momentarily to stop the bulldozer and then stood high on the dirt pile and looked the <b>bulldozer’s</b> <b>driver</b> in the eye. The bulldozer didn’t stop. It ran her over, pinning her under the mound of dirt; it then reversed without lifting its blade and ran over her again. ISM volunteers quickly surrounded the crushed and bleeding Corrie, who gasped, according to 21 -year-old fellow ISM activist Joe from Iowa, “They broke my back. ” Shortly after Palestinian ambulance drivers transported Corrie to a local hospital, she died from a crushed chest and skull, joining the hundreds of young Palestinians and scores of young Israelis killed throughout the Israeli military and settler occupation that she and other ISMers had come to challenge...|$|R

40|$|Annual Conference of the Association-Posture-Equilibre, Marseille, FRANCE, DEC, 2006 International audiencePostural {{stability}} of bulldozer operators {{after a day}} of work is investigated. When operators are no longer exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV) generated by their vehicle, their sensorimotor coordination and body representation remain altered. A sensorimotor treatment based on a set of customized voluntary movements is tested to counter and prevent potential post-work accidents due to prolonged exposure to WBV. This treatment includes muscle stretching, joint rotations, and plantar pressures, all known to minimize the deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to mechanical vibrations. The postural {{stability of}} participants (drivers; N = 12) was assessed via the area of an ellipse computed from the X and Y displacements of the center-of-pressure (CoP) in the horizontal plane when they executed a simple balance task before driving, after driving, and after driving and having performed the sensorimotor treatment. An ancillary experiment is also reported in which a group of non-driver participants (N = 12) performed the same postural task three times during the same day but without exposure to WBV or the sensorimotor treatment. Prolonged exposure to WBV significantly increased postural instability in <b>bulldozer</b> <b>drivers</b> after they operated their vehicle compared to prior to their day of work. The sensorimotor treatment allowed postural stability to return to a level that was not significantly different from that before driving. The results reveal that (1) the postural system remains perturbed after prolonged exposure to WBV due to operating a bulldozer and (2) treatment immediately after driving provides a ``sensorimotor recalibration'' and a significant decrease in WBV-induced postural instability. If confirmed in different contexts, the postural re-stabilizing effect of the sensorimotor treatment would constitute a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and efficient means to prevent post-work accidents due to balance-related issues...|$|R

50|$|In 1993, {{there was}} {{considerable}} opposition from inhabitants of the suburb {{to the construction of}} the Hymettus ring road (Motorway 64). The ring road was to form a major highway on the mountainside linked directly to the Motorway 6, and the construction of both motorways were to commence immediately. The realization that this plan would demand the felling of a considerable number of trees, as well as spurring an increase in noise pollution, predictably aroused the opposition of the local population, who requested a different solution: a covered road. However, the government would not reverse the decision and, in fact, sent bulldozers to the mountainside. This led to a riot in April, 1993. Thousands of people travelled up the mountainside and faced the <b>bulldozers,</b> forcing the <b>drivers</b> to leave. At length police arrived and managed to force the demonstrators off the site; eventually the construction of the two highways began, and was completed in 2001. The road was covered only at a small section, that running over the Deree College.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{determine}} whether there is support for a causal link between exposure to whole body vibration and back disorders in vehicle operating occupations. The review was completed in three steps. We searched the scientific literature using electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, NIOSHTIC, Ergoweb, and Arbline) and reference literature, then sorted the literature for relevance and topic. The selected scientific studies were reviewed using standard epidemiological criteria, looking for consistency between studies, strong associations unlikely to be due to chance or confounding, increases in response with increases in exposure, and plausible temporal and biological relationships. Forty epidemiological studies of the association between back disorders and vehicle operation jobs were selected for detailed review. The risk was elevated in a broad range of driving occupations, including truck drivers, earth moving machine operators, power shovel operators, <b>bulldozer</b> operators, forklift <b>drivers,</b> crane operators, straddle carrier operators, agricultural workers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, helicopter pilots, subway operators, reindeer herders, and vehicle drivers not otherwise specified.

Beadell joked that the <b>bulldozer</b> <b>driver</b> followed the flashing mirror for eight years and never caught it. If large sandhills intervened, flares fired from a pistol were substituted. Some reconnaissance forays took many days, hundreds of kilometres, and usually several punctured tyres. He used a theodolite to observe stars, the sun and the moon to accurately calculate his position which he termed an [...] "astrofix".|$|E

Rocha Peixoto and José Fortes interrogated the finders on the location of the findings. Some time later, José Fortes published an article in the Portugália stating that these jewels were of the Castro culture.

The IDF says that tapes of the event show Corrie below the driver's eye level, and also say that the noise level was too loud for Ms. Corrie to be heard.

The board of education rejected any delays in the building project. Protests erupted at several school construction sites in Cleveland. The most serious was at the Stephen E. Howe Elementary School site on Lakeview Road. On April 6, UFM protestors attempted to halt construction by blocking entrances, lying on {{the ground in front of}} vehicles, and throwing themselves into construction ditches. Police in riot gear forcibly dragged protestors away. The protests occurred again on April 7. That day, several protestors tried to stop a bulldozer from clearing the site by laying down in front of it. Reverend Bruce W. Klunder lay down behind it. The <b>bulldozer</b> <b>driver,</b> not seeing Klunder, backed up, and killed the clergyman.
