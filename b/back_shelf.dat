6000|$|We find {{ourselves}} in a paved alley, some seven feet wide where it is widest, full of people, and resonant with cries of itinerant salesmen,--a shriek in their beginning, and dying away into a kind of brazen ringing, all the worse for its confinement between the high houses of the passage along which we have to make our way. Over-head, an inextricable confusion of rugged shutters, and iron balconies and chimney flues, pushed out on brackets to save room, and arched windows with projecting sills of Istrian stone, and gleams of green leaves here and there where a fig-tree branch escapes over a lower wall from some inner cortile, leading the eye up to the narrow stream of blue sky high over all. On each side, a row of shops, as densely set as may be, occupying, in fact, intervals between the square stone shafts, about eight feet high, which carry the first floors: intervals of which one is narrow and serves as a door; the other is, in the more respectable shops, wainscotted to the height of the counter and glazed above, but in those of the poorer tradesmen left open to the ground, and the wares laid on benches and tables in the open air, the light in all cases entering at the front only, and fading away in {{a few feet from the}} threshold into a gloom which the eye from without cannot penetrate, but which is generally broken by a ray or two from a feeble lamp at the back of the shop, suspended before a print of the Virgin. The less pious shopkeeper sometimes leaves his lamp unlighted, and is contented with a penny print; the more religious one has his print coloured and set in a little shrine with a gilded or figured fringe, with perhaps a faded flower or two on each side, and his lamp burning brilliantly. Here, at the fruiterer's, where the dark-green water-melons are heaped upon the counter like cannon balls, the Madonna has a tabernacle of fresh laurel leaves; but the pewterer next door has let his lamp out, and there is nothing to be seen in his shop but the dull gleam of the studded patterns on the copper pans, hanging from his roof in the darkness. Next comes a [...] "Vendita Frittole e Liquori,"[154] where the Virgin, enthroned in a very humble manner beside a tallow candle on a <b>back</b> <b>shelf,</b> presides over certain ambrosial morsels of a nature too ambiguous to be defined or enumerated. But a few steps farther on, at the regular wine-shop of the calle, where we are offered [...] "Vino Nostrani a Soldi 28-32," [...] the Madonna is in great glory, enthroned above ten or a dozen large red casks of three-year-old vintage, and flanked by goodly ranks of bottles of Maraschino, and two crimson lamps; and for the evening, when the gondoliers will come to drink out, under her auspices, the money they have gained during the day, she will have a whole chandelier.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the fifties, {{living in}} near-poverty with three young children, Brooks pursued his writing. Critical success came {{with his second}} novel, Jampot Smith (recently republished in the Library of Wales {{classics}} series). This led to opportunities for paid work and the family eventually moved to London, with the manuscript of his third novel (Henry’s War, 1962) lying on the <b>back</b> <b>shelf</b> of the car (where a bottle of his wife’s ink slowly seeped into it {{for the duration of}} the journey, obliterating all but the edges of each page of tissue-thin typing paper - a disaster that Brooks later said had resulted in a better book).|$|E

50|$|In the end, it {{came down}} to a three player race between Oosthuizen, Bubba Watson, and Matt Kuchar. Kuchar hit his {{approach}} at the 15th hole to three feet (0.9 m) and eagled to temporarily tie Oosthuizen at −9, but followed it with a bogey at the par-3 16th hole and finished two strokes back, in the four-way tie for third. After Watson made a two at the 16th for his fourth consecutive birdie, he was tied at the top with Oosthuizen at −10. Playing together in the penultimate pairing, both parred the 17th hole and were on the green in regulation at the uphill 18th. Oosthuizen missed a 35 ft birdie putt from the <b>back</b> <b>shelf</b> and Watson had 25 ft for his first major, but he missed the putt on the high side. After Watson tapped in, Oosthuizen holed his four-footer (1.2 m) to force a sudden death playoff.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Thomas Doherty {{published}} Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939, which {{explored the}} relationship between the American film industry and Nazi Germany. In his early research, Doherty was not able to locate a single copy of Hitler's Reign of Terror. Late into his research, however, Doherty received news that the Royal Belgian Film Archive in Brussels had located a copy of the film in their possession. Doherty's theory is that a Belgian film distributor must have ordered a copy of the film from outside the country before the Nazis invaded Belgium. Being a foreign film, the copy had to clear customs. After the Nazis invaded the country, though, the distributor likely {{did not want to be}} caught with the film, and never picked it up from customs. As a result, the film lay on a <b>back</b> <b>shelf</b> in cold storage in Belgium for almost eighty years.|$|E

In 1967, he joined forces with Bo Diddley, Little Walter, and Howlin' Wolf to record the albums Super Blues and The Super Super Blues Band, containing Chess blues standards. In 1972, he went back to England to record The London Muddy Waters Sessions with Rory Gallagher, Steve Winwood, Rick Grech, and Mitch Mitchell, but their playing was not up to his standards. [...] "These boys are top musicians, they can play with me, put the book before 'em and play it, you know," [...] he told Guralnick. [...] "But that ain't what I need to sell my people, it ain't the Muddy Waters sound. An' if you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man."

5000|$|In 1966 Burke {{teamed with}} fellow Atlantic artists Wilson Pickett, Don Covay, Otis Redding, and Joe Tex {{to form a}} {{coalition}} called The Soul Clan. In a 1992 interview Burke indicated that The Soul Clan asked Atlantic to advance $1 million to them. [...] "I remember one time we walked in {{and asked for a}} million dollars. It was Otis Redding, Joe Tex, Wilson Pickett, Don Covay, Ben E. King and myself. We all went in together. We were all on the charts. We all asked for a million dollars for a real estate project, as an organization, as a soul clan. We intended to buy up a lot of property in the South, in the ghetto areas and re-modeled them and built homes. And, we needed a million dollars to put this project together. We walked into Atlantic asking for that and wound up being put on the <b>back</b> <b>shelf.</b> ... All of us together were asking for a million. You and I know of course that all of us together at that time made millions and millions for Atlantic. Their idea was [...] "to pool their talents and resources, and become a positive force within the black community. They envisioned things like buying ghetto real estate and refurbishing it, providing jobs, building schools, and creating black-owned restaurant franchises that would knock the McDonald's and KFCs out of the box... the possibilities were endless." [...] Burke explained the purpose of this alliance: [...] "We wanted to interlock ourselves as a group, to express to the younger people how strong we should be and to help one another, work with one another and support one another." [...] While [...] "Burke saw the collaboration as a stepping stone toward building an autonomous African-American business empire, ... Covay, more successful as a songwriter than a performer, hoped to promote his own career alongside those of his friends." [...] About this time Burke, Redding and James Brown had discussed forming an organization to provide health care benefits and pensions for older black musicians.|$|E

25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them <b>back</b> on <b>shelves,</b> trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|R
