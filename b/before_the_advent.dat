5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, {{the number of}} eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It is therefore very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, {{but they were not}} reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E
5|$|Even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of printing, {{the visual}} {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings {{in the initial}} letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played {{an important part in}} the overall effect of many poems.|$|E

5|$|The visage of the Indian which dominates Fraser's obverse {{design was}} a {{composite}} of several Native Americans.

5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In {{an effort to make}} them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that a small native {{settlement}} occupied the site <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of the Romans, possibly as the main trading station on the boundary between two British tribes, the Corieltauvi in the East Midlands whose later tribal centre was at Ratae Corieltauvorum, and the Cornovii to the west with their original capital Uriconon (which would later give {{its name to the}} important Roman British city of Viroconium) at the hill fort on The Wrekin. These tribes offered little resistance to Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Much Middle Scots {{literature}} {{was produced by}} makars, poets with links to the royal court. These included James I who wrote The Kingis Quair. Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c. 1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of printing in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas {{have been seen as}} leading a golden age in Scottish poetry.|$|E

5|$|The inverse {{square root}} of a {{floating}} point number {{is used in}} calculating a normalized vector.

This was troublesome for 3D graphics programs <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of specialized hardware to handle transform and lighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} purpose {{of much of}} Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house {{for the duration of}} their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> {{of music}} downloads, only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards {{positions on the}} UK music charts.

Downloaded singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. As single downloads grew in popularity, so did album downloads – 1.8million albums were downloaded in 2005; a further 825,000 were downloaded during the first three months of 2006.|$|E

5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of the European {{system of}} {{education}} in Mysore, agraharas (Brahmin quarters) provided Vedic education to Hindus, and madrassas provided schooling for Muslims. Modern education began in Mysore when a free English school was established in 1833. Maharaja's College was founded in 1864. A high school exclusively for girls was established in 1881 and was later renamed Maharani's Women's College. The Industrial School, the first institute for technical education in the city, was established in 1892; {{this was followed by}} the Chamarajendra Technical Institute in 1913. While the modern system of education have makde inroads, colleges such as the Mysore Sanskrit Pāthaśhāla, established in 1876, still continue to provide Vedic education.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any real change in the climate in which they develop.|$|E

5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of electronic sound systems. He also made {{a great deal of}} money and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> of the FADOF.|$|E

In 1857, 174 steamboats carrying 13,000 tons of freight tied up at Omaha wharves.
