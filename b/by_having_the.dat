5|$|After {{listening}} to the song, Barber was inspired to create a video around the Beatles' appearance on Sullivan's show based on the song's musical structure, but André 3000 had never seen this footage. Barber showed the footage to André 3000 {{and came up with}} the idea of reversing the British Invasion, <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> American band the Love Below becoming popular on a British television program. The music video was filmed in two days in August 2003 on a sound stage at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E

5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers emphasised not only action sequences but stunts, {{a practice that}} prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E
5|$|Heroes {{will appear}} {{at various points}} and times, {{sometimes}} accompanied by a tunneller dwarf, who, like imps, are able to dig. The dungeon can be protected from being breached <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> imps fortify the walls. Heroes include giants, wizards, and samurai warriors. Most levels have a 'Lord of the Land', a heavily armoured knight, who must be defeated. In the final level, the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from Ultima VIII), the most powerful hero, appears as the Lord of the Land, and is resurrected after being defeated. He must be defeated again when he reappears with a large army.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, {{plus the}} noble gases are collectively {{referred}} to as the elemental gases.

However, this attempt by the Fascist government to change the Italian flag to incorporate the fasces was stopped by strong opposition to the proposal by Italian monarchists. Afterwards, the Fascist government raised the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag in public ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|It {{is usually}} easy to {{recognise}} {{that a particular}} insect is a bee. They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (bristles), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.|$|E
5|$|Kohli {{conceived}} Teri Meri Kahaani {{from the}} idea of soulmates, showing the strength of love beyond generations <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> same two actors portray all three couples without using a reincarnation theme. He co-wrote the film with Robin Bhatt. Muneesh Sappel created three sets for depicting the different time periods, requiring months of research and detailed designs. Principal photography began in Mumbai in mid-2011 and later moved to London, where it was primarily shot at the Jublee Campus of the University of Nottingham and Stratford-upon-Avon.|$|E
5|$|Rastignac, {{who moved}} to Paris from the south of France, becomes {{attracted}} to the upper class. He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, {{in the ways of}} high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers to clear the way for Rastignac <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> brother killed in a duel.|$|E

5|$|The Gracchi {{aimed to}} address these {{problems}} by reclaiming lands from wealthy members of the senatorial class that could then be granted to soldiers; by restoring land to displaced peasants; by providing subsidized grain for the needy and <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> Republic pay for the clothing of its poorest soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The NFR {{takes place}} on 10 {{consecutive}} days.

5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> person take the medication {{about an hour before}} they drink alcohol, and only then.

5|$|The {{producers}} {{also thought}} it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic so they wanted to surprise the audience <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two came from an observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, they made the characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.|$|E
5|$|Two {{victories}} – away to Aalborg {{and at home}} to Celtic – {{and four}} draws were enough to secure passage to the knockout phase of the competition. Following a Celtic victory over Villarreal in the final group match, United went through as group winners. This meant that they would avoid Roma, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Porto and Juventus in the first knockout round; however, their potential opposition still included Internazionale, Lyon and Real Madrid. The draw paired Manchester United with José Mourinho's Internazionale, but since United had won their group, they were rewarded <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|Water hemlock {{poisoning}} {{is usually}} diagnosed following {{a history of}} plant ingestion and symptoms of abrupt onset of seizures. Laboratory tests to determine the presence of cicutoxin in the blood such as spectrofluorimetry, high pressure liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and mass spectrometry {{have been used to}} detect cicutoxin but these tests are not performed routinely in hospital laboratories. If a sample of the plant ingested has been retained, diagnosis can be confirmed <b>by</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> plant identified by a botanist.|$|E
