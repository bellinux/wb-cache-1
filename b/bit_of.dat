5|$|Programs {{were entered}} in binary form by {{stepping}} through each word of memory in turn, {{and using a}} set of 32switches known as the input device to set the value of each <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> each word to either 0 or 1. The SSEM had no paper-tape reader or punch.|$|E
5|$|We wrote 'Mama' when I {{was going}} through a bad phase with my mum. The sentiments are really that your mum's {{probably}} the best friend that you've got. Whether she's an over-protective mother or a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a landmine, she probably knows you better than yourself in some ways.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, with United only losing three matches, {{and either}} winning or drawing their other league fixtures, the club ascended {{in the standings}} and eventually, into a {{position}} that offered a berth into the wildcard round of the playoffs. United held a spot within the league's top ten overall standings throughout July and August. By September, the luck faded as the club ran into a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a slump.|$|E
50|$|To use CFB {{to make a}} self-synchronizing {{stream cipher}} that will {{synchronize}} for any multiple <b>of</b> x <b>bits</b> lost, start by initializing a shift register {{the size of the}} block size with the initialization vector. This is encrypted with the block cipher, and the highest x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the result are XOR'ed with x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the plaintext to produce x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> ciphertext. These x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> output are shifted into the shift register, and the process repeats with the next x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> plaintext. Decryption is similar, start with the initialization vector, encrypt, and XOR the high <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the result with x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the ciphertext to produce x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> plaintext. Then shift the x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the ciphertext into the shift register. This way of proceeding is known as CFB-8 or CFB-1 (according {{to the size of the}} shifting).|$|R

5|$|In April 1949, Northwest Airlines {{sued the}} Glenn L. Martin Company, {{manufacturers}} of the Martin 2-0-2, for $725,000. The lawsuit {{claimed that the}} company had sold the airline five defective aircraft, including the aircraft lost in Flight 421. Glenn Martin, president of the aircraft manufacturing corporation, dismissed the lawsuit as a mere formality, a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> meaningless legal maneuvering to appease disagreeing insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal style {{was also a}} knowing collage. There was a certain moment in the '90s when, if you were headed downtown and turned left, every girl looked like Bettie Page. But {{they did not do}} what Winehouse did, mixing Bettie Page with Brigitte Bardot and adding that little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> Ronnie Spector.|$|E

5|$|Morrowind also {{contained}} a fair <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> voiced dialogue; an aspect somewhat better {{received by the}} gaming press. Of note is Lynda Carter, television's Wonder Woman, promoted by Bethesda {{for her role in}} voicing the female Nords in the game. Morrowinds race-specific voice acting received praise from some reviewers, though was met with disdain from others, who disliked the discord between a culturally inflected voice spoken in an alien dialect and the grammatically flawless dialogue printed in the dialogue boxes. The Special Edition Soundtrack was released over DirectSong as a digital release.|$|E
5|$|Numerous ships {{encountered}} the hurricane along its course. On the President Harding, {{en route to}} New York, one crew member drowned due to the rough conditions and 73 crew and passengers suffered injury, of various severity, requiring a call for emergency medical supplies. The ship itself sustained a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> damage. As the storm passed near the island of Bermuda, it generated strong winds—gusting to —and heavy precipitation. Damage was fairly significant; the winds uprooted trees, shattered windows, and disrupted public utilities.|$|E
5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} not {{promoted}} well, no radio singles were issued, {{and it did}} not chart. Despite no commercial and sales success, Soul Food Taqueria was mostly well received by music critics, who commended its diverse style, production quality, and viewed it as a progression for Guerrero from his 2000 album A Little <b>Bit</b> <b>of</b> Somethin.|$|E
5|$|There was a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{controversy}} surrounding the cover art {{used for this}} album. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre. Monte Conner of Roadrunner sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, Cause of Death. For years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was upset with Monte Conner for giving away their album cover. The artwork for Arise, however, was designed by Michael Whelan exclusively for the album.|$|E
