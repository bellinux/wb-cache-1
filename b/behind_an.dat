5|$|Cadmium zinc {{telluride}} (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy {{that can}} be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. When <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland won the AAFC {{championship}} {{again in}} 1947 <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> offensive attack that employed the forward pass more frequently and effectively than was typical at the time. The Browns' offensive success {{was driven by}} Brown's version of the T formation, which was gradually replacing the single-wing formation as football's most popular and effective scheme.|$|E

In the second verse, the girl group's bodies change colour with butterflies in the sky on them, {{and it is also}} shown in the final chorus. During the bridge section of the song, the three girls are dancing in the rain <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> plain black background.|$|R

5|$|The episode's {{finalised}} average {{viewing figure}} was 8.22 million viewers and was, excepting World Cup games, the second most-watched television programme of the week, <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> episode of Coronation Street, and eighth most-watched overall. The companion episode of Doctor Who Confidential gained just {{over one million}} viewers, making it the second most watched programme on a non-terrestrial channel that week. The ratings for the episode were higher than the following World Cup match between Germany and Portugal, which had a million fewer viewers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{arguments}} <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> {{association of the}} chitinozoans with annelids or gastropods, {{and it is not}} impossible that the chitinozoans are a convergent phenomenon laid by both groups. In fact, the spirally coiled nature of chitinozoan chains has been used to suggest that they were laid by a spirally coiled organism, such as the gastropods; were this inference true, uncoiled chains could be to be attributed to the (straight) annelid worms or other organisms.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1946, the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Eastern Pacific moved {{north of}} its typical position. An {{associated}} weather disturbance moved over Central America and interacted with a surface low-pressure area over Guatemala. Meanwhile, a broad high-pressure area moved over the United States <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> intense storm that moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Connected to the cyclone was a shear line stretching from Bermuda to the Caribbean Sea, which spawned an upper-level low over open waters. It moved westward on October 4, and {{by the next day}} it was located over the Southeastern United States. The feature over Guatemala began moving toward the northeast as the upper-level low approached and began deepening. Modern-day analysis estimates that the system became a tropical storm early on October 5, shortly after emerging into the Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|From March 13, 2014 to October 31, 2016, the {{entirety}} of the newspaper's Web site was placed <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> paywall. The site had been <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> paywall for most of the early 2000s but that paywall was also eventually removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{first hour}} record <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> {{motorcycle}} {{was set at}} 34 mi by Harry Elkes of the USA in 1898. He rode <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> motor-powered tandem. The first record <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> pure motorcycle was 42 mi, by Tom Linton of Britain, at the Parc des Princes track in northwest Paris in 1902. The speed increased but records become more hazy because some were made under restrictions imposed by the Union Cycliste Internationale and others with no rules at all.|$|R
5000|$|On March 13, 2014, the {{entirety}} of the newspaper's Web site was placed <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> paywall. The paywall was removed November 1, 2016. The site had previously been <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> paywall for most of the early 2000s but that paywall was also removed.|$|R
5|$|Combat in Mass Effect is squad-based and two squad members {{accompany}} the {{player on the}} battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different talent abilities for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and features a cover system which allows players to strategically hide behind objects while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue orders to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> object, scout ahead, regroup, or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union {{splintered}} {{into several}} different factions. Some {{of the more}} radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Alston {{managed the}} St. Paul Saints, a Dodgers Class AAA affiliate, to an 86-68 win-loss record. The team {{finished}} in third place, 14 games <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> Indianapolis Indians team managed by Al López. That year, Alston managed Campanella again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. The media {{was critical of}} Alston for playing Campanella; {{they said that the}} catcher was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers. The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and four of its players collected more than 90 runs batted in (RBI). The team finished in first place, half a game in front of Indianapolis. During the baseball off-season, Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown.|$|E

5|$|In Tibetan Buddhism, sharabha is {{represented}} as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it {{is represented}} additionally with horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head {{is replaced by a}} lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young Devas or dwarfs in a Torana – a six-level archway <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> enlightenment throne of a Buddha or Boddhisattva. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his {{scouting}} frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately made {{off in the direction}} of the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was Audacieux, of Nielly's squadron. Pursuing Audacieux after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun Républicaine and 16-gun Inconnue. Continuing his chase over the next three days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on the eastern horizon slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plans for}} {{memorials}} included {{a garden of}} remembrance at the BDP firm's studio in Bristol, a published anthology of Yeates' work and an annual landscape design prize named after her for students of the University of Gloucestershire. BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary, with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family. Yeates left <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> estate valued at £47,000, which included money set aside to purchase a home with Reardon. As she had not written a will, the sum was inherited by her parents.|$|E

5000|$|... "Hinterlands" [...] is a German {{term that}} {{literally}} translates to [...] "behind land", {{and in that}} original context it refers to a remote or less developed area <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> more central or developed site, for example the land <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> coast, a harbour, or a city.|$|R

5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E
5|$|The German plan {{of attack}} was {{influenced}} by their army's experiences during the Battle of France. Their strategy {{was to create a}} diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was made}} {{available}} on television, across 185 countries, {{with an estimated}} 500 million viewers. Danish television channel DR1 announced that they would use seventeen cameras, for the match coverage. In the United Kingdom, BBC One, the main channel of the public television corporation, the British Broadcasting Corporation acquired the rights for the final; the network broadcast the event, with live commentary provided by veteran professional sports pundit and television presenter Barry Davies, who was assisted by former English footballer Trevor Brooking. In the United Kingdom, the final came second in the overnight ratings list, with 9.1 million viewers, <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> episode of Coronation Street. The game was shown on Fox Sports World in the United States. In Turkey, the match was broadcast on the public television channel TRT 1.|$|E

5|$|The front {{entrance}} of the 1931 office building, on {{the southeast corner of}} the block, faced south on John Street towards Downtown Seattle and had the newspaper's name etched into the stone above the main entrance; the sign was supplemented for several decades by an ornate golden sign with the newspaper's letterhead that was installed above the main entrance. The exterior of the office building had subtle details, including etched columns and aluminum grillwork on the windows, forgoing ornaments for a simpler design that emphasized its mass. The main entrance was <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> elaborate aluminum gate, decorated with octagons, spirals and floral patterns. At the sides of the entrance were limestone panels with floral patterns carved into relief.|$|E
5|$|The {{two people}} fencing {{take off their}} masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her doppelgänger {{surprised}} to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films {{are present in the}} room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> electric chair.|$|E
5|$|Union {{military}} leaders assigned Lieutenant Colonel Samuel P. Cox to kill Anderson, providing {{him with a}} group of experienced soldiers. Soon after Anderson left Glasgow, a local woman saw him and told Cox of his presence. On October 26, 1864, he pursued Anderson's group with 150 men and engaged them in battle. Anderson and his men charged the Union forces, killing five or six of them, but turned back under heavy fire. Only Anderson and one other man, the son of a Confederate general, continued to charge after the others retreated. Anderson was hit by a bullet <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> ear, likely killing him instantly. Four other guerrillas were killed in the attack. The victory made a hero of Cox and led to his promotion.|$|E
