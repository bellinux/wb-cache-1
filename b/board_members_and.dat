5|$|In 1826, the Congregationalists joined these united efforts. The Congregational mission {{societies}} were {{merged with}} the United Domestic Missionary Society to become the American Home Missionary Society. The Congregational American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) became the recognized missions agency of the General Assembly, and the United Foreign Missionary Society's operations were {{merged with the}} American Board. By 1831, the majority of <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> missionaries of the ABCFM were Presbyterians. As a result, most of the local churches established by the organization were Presbyterian.|$|E

5|$|After his {{retirement}} from the Air Force, Tibbets worked for Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), an air taxi {{company based in}} Columbus, Ohio, and now called NetJets. He {{was one of the}} founding <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> attempted to extend the company's operations to Europe, but was unsuccessful. He retired from the company in 1968, and returned to Miami, Florida, where he had spent part of his childhood. The banks foreclosed on EJA in 1970, and Bruce Sundlun became president. Sundlun lured Tibbets back to EJA that year. Tibbets succeeded Sundlun as president on 21 April 1976, and remained in the role until 1986. He served for a year as a consultant before his second and final retirement from EJA in 1987.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Toulmin's {{letters of}} {{recommendation}} from Jefferson and Madison, {{the board of}} trustees of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky, elected him president of the seminary in February 1794. He was the first president of the seminary who was not a Presbyterian, and his election was effected when the Baptist and more liberal members of the board united against the more conservative Presbyterian members. His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative <b>board</b> <b>members,</b> <b>and</b> at their insistence, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous vote of the board of regents to re-elect the seminary's president. Toulmin resigned in protest in April 1796.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF {{made the}} {{transition}} from amateurism to full professionalism in the late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} club chairman Eric Persson.

The general meeting approves the accounts, votes to elect the chairman and other <b>board</b> <b>members,</b> <b>and</b> decides on incoming motions. The current chairman is Håkan Jeppsson, who has been chairman since 2010, when he replaced Bengt Madsen.

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
