25|$|Other {{types of}} UDDTs exist which are {{essentially}} {{variations of the}} single-vault type, but which are more self-contained, {{sometimes referred to as}} portable, mobile or stand-alone units and identifiable by their one-piece molded plastic shells or, in the case of DIY versions, simple plywood <b>box</b> <b>construction.</b> Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof. A post-treatment step is unnecessary in the case of very modest seasonal use.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, every seat in {{the stadium}} was {{replaced}} and the north end zone scoreboard was dismantled in preparation for replacement. From 2003 to 2004, the entire video and audio systems were replaced and new video scoreboards were placed at both end zones. The west side, long ignored except for the press <b>box</b> <b>construction</b> in 1975, received restroom and concession improvements. Most importantly, a street running east of the east stands was moved {{to allow for the}} construction of an upper deck with club seating for 2,500 and 27 suites on the east side, which increased the capacity of the stadium to 82,112. The renovation, led by architecture firms 360 Architecture and HOK Sport, cost $54 million.|$|E
25|$|The all-wood wing pairs {{comprised}} {{a single}} structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There {{was a single}} continuous main spar and another continuous rear spar. Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this rear spar {{was one of the}} most complex units to laminate and to finish machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply <b>box</b> <b>construction,</b> using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.|$|E

2500|$|As {{all other}} types of the Einheitslokomotiven program, the class E 10 / class 110 had 2-axle pivoted bogies/trucks as welded <b>box</b> <b>construction</b> with pivot pins, and welded {{superstructure}} with fan grills. [...] The class 110.3 used {{the body of the}} E 10.12 with the pulled-forward frontal area, also called the “crease” (Bügelfalte). [...] The frame is propped up over the bogies by coil springs and rubber elements. [...] Originally a bumpy ride at higher speeds was noticeable, which required repeated rework of the bogies. [...] In two locomotives (110 475 and 476) a flexicoil suspension was tested.|$|E
2500|$|Melton {{manufactured}} ferro-concrete fence posts, {{then from}} 1915, signal posts. During World War I, Marriott {{was asked by}} the Government to develop building blocks for postwar housing (as there has been bombing). Although concrete had been used before on the railways, William mass-produced it and made everything out of concrete. There were many patents produced relating to developments in concrete sleepers, chairs and signal posts. When the original Holt station burnt down, Melton concrete works produced a new concrete station. Today there are still many examples of the concrete products, including the lamp posts at Sheringham station on the North Norfolk Railway and the station sign at West Runton railway station. Cromer signal box base is made of Melton concrete. After 1916, the M used the concrete blocks for <b>box</b> <b>construction,</b> however only Cromer Beach was built to this design.

50|$|Box houses (boxed house, box frame, box and strip, piano box, single-wall, {{board and}} batten, {{and many other}} names) have minimal framing in the corners and widely spaced in the {{exterior}} walls, but like the vertical plank wall houses, the vertical boards are structural. The origins of <b>boxed</b> <b>construction</b> is unknown. The term box-frame was used in a reconstruction manual in 1868 after the American Civil War.|$|R

2500|$|The Severn Bridge {{is located}} {{close to the}} former Aust Ferry. The bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge of conventional design, with the deck supported by two main cables slung between two steel towers. In 1966 the cables supporting the bridge deck were spun from [...] of wire. The main cables are each made up of 8,322 individual [...] wires. An unusual feature of the suspension cables carrying the deck {{is that they are}} not vertical, as for most suspension bridges, but rather arranged in a zig-zag fashion, with adjacent mounts closely spaced. The triangulation this offers is an attempt to reduce vibration, as is the prominent use of Stockbridge dampers on the cables. The bridge is [...] long, consisting of a [...] central span between the towers and the two [...] side spans. The towers rise to [...] above mean high water and are of hollow <b>box</b> <b>construction.</b> The deck is an orthotropic steel box girder of aerofoil shape with cantilevered cycle tracks and footway supported from the box. The shape of the bridge was determined by the designers Freeman, Fox and Partners following wind tunnel tests for the Forth Road Bridge, after the original wind tunnel model was accidentally destroyed. The sections of the deck were built at Fairfield-Mabey in Chepstow, and each 132tonne section was then floated down the river before being hoisted into position.|$|E

50|$|Glass {{may be used}} {{which is}} transparent, {{translucent}}, or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. Transparent glass usually refers to vision glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes. Opaque glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through shadow <b>box</b> <b>construction</b> (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow <b>box</b> <b>construction</b> creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.|$|E
