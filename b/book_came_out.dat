25|$|Gerrold is {{the author}} of the War Against the Chtorr series of books, about an {{invasion}} of Earth by mysterious aliens: A Matter for Men (1983), A Day for Damnation (1985), A Rage for Revenge (1989), and A Season for Slaughter (1993). He eventually announced that what was initially supposed to be a trilogy would in fact require seven books. In approximately 2010 Gerrold was reputed to have a considerable amount of work completed on the remainder of the series, and the fifth book, A Method for Madness, was listed on Amazon with a publication date. The publication date has been updated several times since; the last was January 1, 2014. At that time the remaining books in the series were tentatively titled A Method For Madness, A Time For Treason, and A Case For Courage. In 2017, he announced that the fifth book, now tentatively titled A Nest for Nightmares, and the sixth book, A Method For Madness, are nearing completion, over two decades after the last <b>book</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b> Whether a seventh Chtorr book is still planned, or what its title will be if it is, are unknown. Gerrold is considering crowdfunding and other ways to raise money to fund completion of organization of the material and final writing for the two books.|$|E

500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the <b>book</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Billings and his {{followers}} worked as singing masters, who led singing schools. The purpose of these schools was to train {{young people in the}} correct singing of sacred music.

The first shape note tunebook appeared in 1801: [...] The Easy Instructor by William Smith and William Little. At first, Smith and Little's shapes competed with a rival system, created by Andrew Law (1749–1821) in his The Musical Primer of 1803. Although this <b>book</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> two years later than Smith and Little's book, Law claimed earlier invention of shape notes.

Complaints of this as a seditious <b>book</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> to New England, and John Eliot was forced to appear before the court, when he owned the authorship, but disowned the publication, and retracted whatever might have declared the Government of England, by King, Lords, and Commons, to be anti-Christian, avowing it to be [...] "not only a lawful but eminent form of government, and professing himself ready to conform to any polity that could be deduced from Scripture as being of Divine authority." [...] The court was satisfied, and suppressed the book, while publishing Mr. Eliot's retractation. Some have sneered at his conduct on this occasion as an act of moral cowardice; but it would be very hard if every man were bound to stand to all the political views expressed in an essay never meant for the general eye, ten years old, and written in the enthusiasm of the commencement of an experiment, which to the Presbyterian mind had proved a grievous disappointment.|$|E
6000|$|A {{good example}} of the toils of the {{collector}} in pursuit of perfection is given by M. Henri Beraldi in his very amusing catalogue of M. Paillet's library. This book, by the way, is itself scarce, and the bibliomaniac will be rather lucky if he meets with it. M. Beraldi describes M. Paillet's copy of Dorat's [...] "Fables," [...] published in 1773, with illustrations by Marillier. Nobody perhaps ever reads Dorat now, but his <b>book</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in the very palmiest days of the art of illustration in France. There were no photogravures then, nor hideous, scratchy, and seamy [...] "processes," [...] such as almost make one despair of progress and of the future of humanity. The people that takes to [...] "processes" [...] is lost! The illustrations of the [...] "Fables" [...] were duly engraved on copper. There were ninety-nine vignettes, and as many tail-pieces. The bibliographical history of the book is instructive, either to young collectors or to the common herd, not to speak impolitely--the persons who do not understand what collectors want. The [...] "Fables" [...] were originally published on three different sorts of paper, Dutch paper at seventy-two francs, French paper at twenty-nine francs, and on [...] "small paper" [...] at twenty-four francs. In 1853 the original drawings were bought by one of the Rothschilds for about 60 pounds; they would now, probably, be worth at least 1,000 pounds. The ordinary copies of the book itself bring about 6 pounds, the large paper copies about 30 pounds, and a copy in old morocco can hardly be estimated--you may pay anything for it, as a copy in old calf has sold for 240 pounds.|$|E
