By {{taking the}} <b>belt</b> <b>spindle</b> of the {{machining}} center high speed and high precision as the research object, using the finite element method, the Solidworks software {{is used to}} make the thermal analysis. In this paper, we define the boundary conditions and thermal load of the spindle thermal analysis, and establish the finite element model. The steady-state thermal analysis and temperature rise is simulated, and the temperature distribution is predicted by using Solidworks software. The results show that the structural design of the <b>belt</b> <b>spindle</b> is reasonable, and the temperature rise is in the control range...|$|E
5000|$|Engine lathe is {{the name}} applied to a {{traditional}} late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with automatic feed to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with manual feed only. The usage of [...] "engine" [...] here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step pulley called a cone pulley designed to accept a flat <b>belt.</b> Different <b>spindle</b> speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the cone pulley. Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) {{on the back side}} of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These gears were called back gears. Larger lathes sometimes had two-speed back gears which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds.|$|R
40|$|In a {{proposed}} advance in friction stir welding, the torque exerted on the workpiece by the friction stir pin would be measured and controlled {{in an effort}} to measure and control the total heat input to the workpiece. The total heat input to the workpiece is an important parameter of any welding process (fusion or friction stir welding). In fusion welding, measurement and control of heat input is a difficult problem. However, in friction stir welding, the basic principle of operation affords the potential of a straightforward solution: Neglecting thermal losses through the pin and the spindle that supports it, the rate of heat input to the workpiece is the product of the torque and the speed of rotation of the friction stir weld pin and, hence, of the spindle. Therefore, if one acquires and suitably processes data on torque and rotation and controls the torque, the rotation, or both, one should be able to control the heat input into the workpiece. In conventional practice in friction stir welding, one uses feedback control of the spindle motor to maintain a constant speed of rotation. According to the proposal, one would not maintain a constant speed of rotation: Instead, one would use feedback control to maintain a constant torque and would measure the speed of rotation while allowing it to vary. The torque exerted on the workpiece would be estimated as the product of (1) the torque-multiplication ratio of the <b>spindle</b> <b>belt</b> and/or gear drive, (2) the force measured by a load cell mechanically coupled to the spindle motor, and (3) the moment arm of the load cell. Hence, the output of the load cell would be used as a feedback signal for controlling the torque (see figure) ...|$|R
40|$|Thin film sensor systems {{based on}} {{hydrogenated}} carbon {{have the advantage}} to combine two very important characteristics {{in order to be}} used in measurement engineering: Firstly, the sensory layer demonstrates piezoresistive behavior and secondly its good properties related to hardness and wear resistance lead in a tribologically stable system. Therefore, the thin film sensor systems can be applied into the main distribution of force within machine parts or used for universal interchangeable sensor systems, e. g. sensory washers. In this article the deposition of a self-contained thin film sensor system on a large technical component (spindle shaft) is shown. The spindle shaft with a length of 480 mm and an outer diameter of 90 mm is part of a <b>belt</b> driven machining <b>spindle</b> for planing machines in woodworking industries. In order to establish a measurement system, which allows monitoring the clamping force of the tool holder and the imbalance of the mounted tool, the thin film sensor system was directly applied to the front surface of the spindle shaft. For this application a novel self-contained thin film sensor system was developed, which consists of an alumina layer for electrical isolation, a chromium layer to establish internal sensor electrodes, a piezoresistive hydrogenated carbon layer (1 Âµm) and a second covering wear resistance and insulation layer (silicon and oxygen modified carbon layer). The piezoresistive sensor layer and the top layer are part of the diamond like carbon layer family (Robertson, Diam Relat Mater 12 : 79 - 84, 2003; Bewilogua et al.
