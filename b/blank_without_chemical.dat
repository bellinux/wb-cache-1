Our objective was to evaluate impacts of using blanks containing additive (i. e., specific <b>blanks)</b> or <b>blanks</b> <b>without</b> additive on estimation of in vitro net gas and CH(4) production.

At 16 h of incubation, monensin reduced (P <= 0. 02) total gas production in flasks containing substrate (162. 0 ml versus 146. 3 ml) and in blanks (84. 4 ml versus 79. 2 ml).
