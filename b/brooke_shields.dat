The company was established with the financial backing of Friedman's employer, Norman J. Lewis, who later sold {{his interest in the}} company to a Chinese investor. After Lewis moved on, Friedman remained committed to promoting the company's growth and focused the company's strategy toward licensing. Basing toys on popular characters wasn't a new concept, but Friedman had an instinct for recognizing blockbusters, could conceive products for diverse audiences, and could negotiate and execute licenses quickly, which brought the practice to a new level. LJN found initial success making merchandise from the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.

500|$|The {{production}} {{continued at}} the Westside Theatre with an open-ended commercial {{run with the}} casting strategy of rotating 4-week casts because it enabled the production to pursue higher caliber actors. Nora Ephron stated at one question and answer session: [...] "We keep re-casting it {{so we can get}} really great actresses to come for four weeks.

500|$|For the {{character}} of news reporter Gale Weathers, the studio wanted a recognizable actress. They auditioned <b>Brooke</b> <b>Shields</b> and Janeane Garofalo. Courteney Cox, who was starring in the sitcom Friends at the time, approached the production herself to pursue the role. She was interested in playing a [...] "bitch" [...] character to offset her [...] "nice" [...] Friends image. This image was the main reason why the producers initially refused to consider Cox for the part. Cox continued to lobby the studio as she felt she could believably play {{the character}}; her efforts ultimately succeeded. Actresses Melinda Clarke and Rebecca Gayheart auditioned {{for the role of}} Tatum Riley, before Rose McGowan was cast. The casting director believed she best embodied the [...] "spunky", [...] "cynical" [...] but [...] "innocent" [...] nature of the character. The studio felt the strong female cast of Campbell, Barrymore, Cox, and McGowan would help draw a significant female audience to the film. Gayheart would later land a role in Scream 2.|$|E

However, Bening became pregnant, allowing Pfeiffer to get the role. Pfeiffer's $3 million salary was $2 million more than was offered to Bening. To prepare for the role, Pfeiffer attended kickboxing classes and practised handling a whip (during which she accidentally cut her teacher's chin). Susan Sarandon, Meryl Streep (who was considered [...] "too old" [...] by Burton), <b>Brooke</b> <b>Shields</b> (who Burton considered [...] "not bankable"), Demi Moore, Nicole Kidman (who ended up playing Dr. Chase Meridian in Batman Forever), Jodie Foster, Geena Davis, Sigourney Weaver, Lena Olin, singer Madonna, Raquel Welch, Cher, Ellen Barkin, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lorraine Bracco, Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Beals were also considered for the role, but they lost out to Pfeiffer.|$|E

500|$|Other celebrities {{have since}} posed nude or semi-nude while in {{advanced}} pregnancy, including Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears whose billboard advertisements led to great controversy.

Eventually, Vogue and Harper's Bazaar included pregnant cover models, and Star included a pregnant foursome of Katie Holmes, Gwen Stefani, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie.

The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the San Francisco Chronicle, with Mick LaSalle commenting, [...] "Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other." [...] Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and helped establish her as a rising star. The making of the film also gave Witherspoon significant acting experience; as she said, [...] "Once I overcame the hurdle of that movie– which scared me to death– I felt like I could try anything." ...|$|E
