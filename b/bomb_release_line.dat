50|$|The AN/MSQ-77 control {{algorithm}} continually commanded the A/C so the BTG simulated bomb impact point, which was plotted {{separately from the}} A/C track, would move toward the target. While the A/C was being guided, an AN/MSQ-77 <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> algorithm used {{a model for the}} future path of simulated bomb impact points to predict the nearest impact to the target (a No Go condition aborted before effecting an outlying <b>bomb</b> <b>release).</b> Instead of releasing from the A/C position corresponding to the nearest predicted impact point, the AN/MSQ-77 began the <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> sequence just prior, which accounted for the delay in generating the radio command, in transmitting the command, and in the A/C effecting the mechanical release. The delay time was based on calibration testing of the AN/MSQ-77 with A/C <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> circuity (e.g., mean <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> time for salvo drops from B-52s).|$|R

50|$|The Cambodian raids {{were carried}} out at night under the {{direction}} of ground units using the MSQ-77 radar, which guided the bombers to their release points and indicated the precise moment of <b>bomb</b> <b>release.</b> This made deception easier, as even crew members aboard the bombers did not have to know what country they were bombing. However, the specific flight coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the points of <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> were noted in the navigator's logs {{at the end of each}} mission, and a simple check of the map could tell the crews which country they were bombing.|$|R

50|$|The range unit also {{contained}} the <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> mechanism. On the bombsight, {{this was an}} electrical contact system attached to the same output shaft as the sight, and a second contact connected to the cam-based trajectory calculator. The two contacts, along with automatic indicator slides, one for the viewing angle of the bombsight to the target, {{the other to the}} calculated drop angle at the <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> point, would approach each other as the bomber flew towards the target, and completed the release circuit at the right moment for the drop. The same system also included a set of contacts that connected earlier, turning on a red lamp on top of the bombsight and another in front of the pilot. These remained lit through the approach, for about ten minutes, and turned off the instant the <b>bombs</b> were <b>released.</b>|$|R

500|$|Use of the codename Silverplate was {{discontinued}} in May 1947. It was {{superseded by}} a new codename, [...] "Saddletree", which was applied to aircraft modifications only. Initially it was intended that Saddletree would refer only to modifications to the B-29s, but {{it came to be}} used for modifications to B-50 and B-36 bombers as well. Saddletree modifications included a new bomb bay frame and hoist, and replacing the British FG <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> with the newly developed U-1 pneumatic <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> mechanism. Due to delays in the delivery of the B-50s, Saddletree commenced in February [...] 1948. In all, 6,000 hours of work was carried out on each of the 36 B-50s by Sacramento Air Materiel Area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attack was}} to be made at very low level, with bombs being dropped at a height of 10 feet off the ground. The {{aircraft}} had to slow to just above their loaded stall speed {{at the time of}} <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> so the <b>bombs</b> would not be destroyed by their impact with the ground. This was a significant risk in itself, as stalling while at such low altitude allowed no possibility for recovery. After <b>bomb</b> <b>release</b> the planes then had to pull up to clear the 20 foot high walls of the prison. Time delay fuses, with an 11 second delay, were used to allow the aircraft time to clear the target before their bombs exploded.|$|R

5000|$|A {{nuclear weapon}} is an {{explosive}} device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) {{or from a}} combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb).

50|$|An {{early use}} of fire-control systems was in bomber aircraft, {{with the use}} of {{computing}} bombsights that accepted altitude and airspeed information to predict and display the impact point of a <b>bomb</b> <b>released</b> at that time.

Early model B-29s were plagued by a host of engine problems, and the early Silverplate bombers were no exception.

50|$|A {{significant}} improvement on Red Beard's predecessor, the Blue Danube, {{was in the}} provision of electrical power for the bomb firing mechanism, and the radar altimeter fusing. Blue Danube had used 6 volt lead-acid batteries that were unreliable, and had to be installed at the last minute before takeoff. There were also potential risks associated with 'stray' electrical discharges to the firing mechanisms which might have led to accidental detonation. Red Beard used twin ram-air turbines located in the nose, from which there could be no stray discharges before <b>bomb</b> <b>release.</b> The air inlet {{can be seen in the}} extreme nose. They exhausted through 'blow-out' patches in the nose sides. Until <b>bomb</b> <b>release,</b> the weapon drew electrical power from the aircraft for heating and pre-heating of the radar fuses.|$|R
