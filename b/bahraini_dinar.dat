40|$|Shrimp are {{the most}} {{valuable}} fish stock in Bahrain waters, the fishery being based on a single species P. semisulcatus which forms about 95 {{percent of the total}} landings. In 1993, shrimp landings formed 23. 8 percent of the total Bahrain fish landing, which totalled 2, 128 tonnes at a first sale value of 5. 4 million <b>Bahraini</b> <b>Dinars</b> (1 DS. 0. 380 BD). Beside the increased fishing effort, the marine habitat of Bahrain suffers from several sources of pollution. Most evident is dredging and reclamation which have altered most of the coastal areas. Despite the shrimp fishery importance and the development-related stresses on Bahrain coastal environments, there were limited basic data on this valuable stock. The current study aimed to provide as full an understanding as possible of the shrimp fishery of Bahrain. Several surveys were conducted on the shrimp populations and their environment. A sediment survey was conducted from 9 August to 26 October. From May 1991 to May 1992, a regular sampling programme was initiated to record the physical properties of the sea water at fixed stations in TUbli Bay and off Mina Sulman. Physical properties of sea water were also recorded in the open sea during June 1980, October and December 1991. Plankton collection was conducted mainly through two sampling programmes. The first was conducted in the open sea from September 1991 to January 1992 (excluding November 1991). The second programme was restricted to Tubli Bay; samples were obtained over periods from May 1991 to June 1992 inclusive and from March to May 1993. Two major benthic surveys were completed. The first was conducted from June 1980 to June 1981 using an industrial trawler, covering the whole shrimping ground, except TUbli Bay. A second survey was carried out on the shrimp population in TUbli Bay from May 1991 to June 1993 in three time periods, from May 1991 to June 1992, November 1992 and from April to June 1993. Based on the above surveys, physical properties of sea water and bottom sediment of the shrimping ground were described. Also the bionomics of the seven penaeid species found in Bahrain waters were determined. Benthic and plankton surveys revealed spawning activities of P. semisulcatus restricted to the offshore waters. Also prolonged spawning activity was determined for this species, which most significantly occurred from August to March. P. semisulcatus main recruits appeared in the shrimping grounds from April to July, originating from nurseries found within the areas A and B. Two migration patterns were determined for P. semisulcatus within Bahrain shrimping grounds throughout a season. The updated information on shrimp fishery generated by the current work provides a basis for identification of areas for further improvement of this fishery. Consequently, the work determines of future investigations necessary for Bahrain shrimp fishery...|$|R

50|$|The Labour Ministry pushed {{legislation}} through {{parliament in}} 2007 to introduce unemployment benefit, set at 60% of previous earnings. First-time jobseekers get 120 <b>Bahraini</b> <b>Dinar</b> (320 US dollars) {{a month in}} the case of undergraduates, or BD150 (400 dollars) for graduates. These figures were worked out in consultations during 2005 and 2006 between the General Federation of Workers Trade Unions in Bahrain, the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Labour, consultations which were brokered by the International Labour Organization. The scheme is financed by a 3% contribution on wages split equally between employers, workers and the government, the proceeds of which are reserved for UI purposes.

50|$|In the Philippines, {{there is}} one {{shopping}} mall called the Duty Free Philippines Fiestamall, which is located {{a few miles away}} from Ninoy Aquino Airport as opposed to being at the airport itself. It is the only shopping mall {{of its kind in the}} world. The goods that are sold in this mall are often imported products which come from around the world (mainly from United States, Asia and Australasia) and are not found in any other shopping malls in the country, aside from duty-free malls. Tourists, visitors and returning citizens of Philippines often pay a visit to this mall shortly after their arrival (since only arriving passengers and their companions are allowed access). In order to gain entry, a passport is needed to be presented and registered at the Customer Registration Counter at the entrance of the mall. The customer will then be issued a shopping card; these shopping cards must be presented to the cashier for validation of purchases. Arriving customers are given a certain tax-free allowance on purchases and anything in excess will be subject to local and national taxes. In the past, the mall used to only accept US dollars and Philippine peso but in recent years, it had begun accepting other currencies such as Japanese yen, Brunei dollar, Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Saudi riyal, <b>Bahraini</b> <b>dinar,</b> and Thai baht. Currency exchange booths are also available inside the mall if a customer wishes to exchange currencies into Philippine pesos or US dollars. Credits cards can also be used for purchasing goods.In Australia, duty-free shops, once common, have all but disappeared since the introduction of GST in 2000. Retailer James Richardson operates several duty-free shops in major cities, but most duty-free shops are now located within international airports. Residents and tourists are allowed to purchase virtually any physical good within 60 days of departure, which needs to be taken on the outward flight, and claim the GST component back through the Tourist Refund Scheme when passing through customs. Consumers are now free to fully use their items prior to departure. This is in contrast prior to 2000, where all purchases had to be packed by the duty-free store in a sealed clear plastic bag, and could only be broken open by customs staff just prior to departure.|$|E
