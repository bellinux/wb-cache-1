25|$|While {{the return}} of Bo and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers alike, {{and as a result}} ratings {{recovered}} slightly, the show never completely regained its former popularity. One of Wopat and Schneider's disputes even before they left was what they considered to be increasingly weak and formulaic scripts and episode plots. With Wopat and Schneider's return, the producers agreed to try a wider scope of storylines. However, although it continued for two more seasons, the show never fully returned to its former glory. As well as what was widely recognized to be increasingly inferior scripts, many cast members decried the miniature car effects newly incorporated to depict increasingly absurd General Lee and patrol car stunts (which had previously been performed with real cars by stunt drivers). The miniature car effects were intended as a <b>budget</b> <b>saving</b> measure (to save the cost of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles) and to help compete visually with KITT from the NBC series Knight Rider. In February 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard ended its run after seven seasons.|$|E

40|$|As another Farm Bill {{approaches}} in 1995, agricultural, conservation, {{and environmental groups}} will again negotiate domestic agricultural policies. From past meetings have come such compromise solutions as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and conservation compliance. The upcoming Farm Bill debate could present a rather unique twist.

Thus, if the Iowa Plan is adopted, negotiations will turn to the appropriation of the <b>budget</b> <b>savings.</b> This paper demonstrates how these savings could be used to benefit agriculture, conservation, and the environment.

5000|$|Dear Dr. Lee and Dr. Levine:Thank you {{for your}} letter noting {{concerns}} about Arizona State University’s recent reorganization in our colleges of Education. Let me begin first by clarifying some erroneous information noted in your letter. Absolutely no graduate degree programs in education are being discontinued or disestablished {{as a result of}} this reorganization. Over the past three years of massive budget cuts in Arizona, we have been steadfast in our commitment to protect faculty lines and academic programs. This reorganization, like others we have undertaken, is an administration reorganization that reaps significant <b>budget</b> <b>saving</b> and also has the effect of reorganizing faculty into intellectual clusters that can continue to build on existing strengths and also forge new and important directions.I am sharing with you a recent article published in Change that outlines what we have continued to try to accomplish through such reorganization at Arizona State University without compromising quality.On a related note, as you may know, many of our doctoral programs are highly ranked. These rankings are based on the quality of the degree program and not the organizational umbrella under which the programs find themselves. We value the quality of research and educational vision that the majority of our faculties in education provide. We believe that this quality will continue to improve as our faculties from across the university coalesce around significant educational issues to be addressed in the decades ahead. As you know, change can be very difficult. In the multiple reorganizations we have already put in place, faculty come to understand that there can be many wonderful new opportunities for them to explore with new colleagues and new programs. At the very core of much of these reorganizations has been an increased interdisciplinary synergy, with new programmatic opportunities for our students that would not have emerged in the traditional structures that were in place.I am sorry you were misinformed.Sincerely,Elizabeth D. Capaldi,Executive Vice President and Provost ...|$|E

The area that develops these technologies is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).

The present thesis investigates methods for the extraction of volatiles from regolith within the shadowed craters of the Moon using solar power. Topics that are to be discussed within this thesis will include heat transfer calculations, experimental studies using a CO 2 laser, and lastly the design of the process schematic to validate the extraction of volatiles. ...|$|E
40|$|Reducing fuel subsidy and taxing carbon have a {{tendency}} toward reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, both instruments may have differing impacts in their magnitudes of the emissions reduction and on {{the economy as a}} whole. Using INDONESIA-E 3 (Economy-Equity-Environment) model, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model which includes carbon emissions, carbon taxation, as well as, strong feature in distributional analysis, this paper compares and contrast the two instruments to find which policy is better in improving the three pillars of sustainable development: economy, equity, and the environment. The result suggests that given the same amount of government <b>budget</b> <b>saving,</b> carbon tax is relatively superior to using a fuel subsidy reduction instrument, because it can accelerate the decline in CO 2 emissions with a lower cost on the economy in terms of GDP reduction with more favorable distributional effect. This has not taken into account the economic incentives it creates for the economy to be less reliant on carbon-intensive energy. Carbon Tax, Fuel Subsidyc Climate Change, CGE, Indonesia...|$|E
