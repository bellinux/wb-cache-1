5|$|The older {{stations}} on the North South and East West {{lines were}} originally built with no accessibility facilities, such as lifts, ramps, tactile guidance systems (Braille tactiles {{on the floor}} surface), wider fare gates, or toilets for passengers with disabilities; authorities in the past actively discouraged use of their system by the disabled. Now, these facilities are being progressively installed {{as part of a}} programme to make all stations accessible to the elderly and to those with disabilities. All stations are now <b>barrier-free,</b> although works are still ongoing to provide stations with additional <b>barrier-free</b> facilities. The installation of lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges next to six MRT stations and additional bicycle racks at 20 stations is slated to be completed by the end of 2013.|$|E
5|$|GO Transit {{stations}} {{are designed to}} provide seamless and <b>barrier-free</b> connections between its trains and buses. They include amenities such as elevators, washrooms, parking, pay phones, ticket vending machines, ticket sale kiosks and automated teller machines. All GO stations have Presto card readers. Most bus terminals are also served with a ticket sales booth or vending machine. As of 2016, the capital costs of building a GO Transit train station is about $50 to $75 million.|$|E
25|$|Since the LRT {{system was}} built in the 1990s, plans for <b>barrier-free</b> {{facilities}} have already been included during the planning stages. All 43 stations are equipped with such facilities, thus there will be no difficulties present for the old and handicapped. <b>Barrier-free</b> facilities include lifts, ramps, tactile guidance system and toilets with handicapped-friendly facilities; all stations include wide faregates. These <b>barrier-free</b> facilities will be included in all future LRT stations.|$|E
25|$|Ramah in New England offers {{inclusion}} bunks for special-needs {{and mainstream}} youngsters, stand-alone bunks, and a vocational {{training program for}} older children and adults. There are bunks with entrances that can accommodate motorized scooters, <b>barrier-free</b> bathrooms, and paved roads suitable for wheelchairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{road network}} in Ireland is {{primarily}} focused on Dublin. The M50 motorway, a semi-ring road which runs around the south, west {{and north of}} the city, connects important national primary routes {{to the rest of}} the country. In 2008, the West-Link toll bridge was replaced by the eFlow <b>barrier-free</b> tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration.|$|E
25|$|Operations for {{monitoring}} vehicles within the congestion zone will be <b>barrier-free</b> and includes E-ZPass transponders and {{a license plate}} recognition system that involves cameras. The system {{for monitoring}} congestion pricing will be made separate from existing red-light camera systems. Drivers {{would be able to}} pay by a debit from their E-ZPass account or a debit from a pre-paid non-EZPass account linked to the vehicle's license plate number. For drivers without traffic payment accounts, they would have 48 hours to pay via phone, the Internet, text messaging, or cash transactions at participating retailers.|$|E
25|$|Serving {{close to}} 550,000 {{passengers}} {{on a daily}} basis when MRTC's maintenance provider, Sumitomo Corp. of Japan, was handling the maintenance of the system, MRT-3 is the busiest among Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines, built with essential standards such as <b>barrier-free</b> access and the use of magnetic card tickets to better facilitate passenger access. Total ridership significantly exceeds its built maximum capacity of 350,000 passengers a day, with various solutions being proposed or implemented to alleviate chronic congestion in addition to the procurement of new rolling stock.|$|E
25|$|In the church, {{small changes}} were {{gradually}} implemented by 2010. The previous church benches {{have been replaced}} by folding chairs, which allow a more flexible use of the available space. The present main altar is no longer used for the church services of the centre for meditation meditation and {{has been replaced by a}} small wooden altar, which forms a circle with the folding chairs. Stairlifts or wheelchair ramps have been installed for <b>barrier-free</b> access to the church interior or other premises. The crypt and the rooms of the former parsonage were redesigned for the use as a meditation center.|$|E
25|$|The {{town has}} 25 {{developed}} and undeveloped parks, totaling over 200 acres. Main Park sits {{south of the}} town hall and features pickleball courts, basketball courts, sand volleyball courts, a playground and several picnic shelters. Boardwalk Park is adjacent to Windsor Lake, and features a <b>barrier-free</b> wheelchair-accessible playground, picnic shelters, swim beach, boating, fishing and a lake trail. Chimney Park, which features athletic fields, baseball diamonds and an outdoor swimming pool, sits on {{the eastern edge of}} town and includes property {{that was part of the}} Great Western Sugar factory. Eastman Park, adjacent to the Cache la Poudre River, features a skate park, picnic shelters, athletic fields, trails, playground, and off-leash dog park. Diamond Valley features baseball and softball diamonds.|$|E
500|$|Originally, the LRT Line 1 was {{not built}} with {{accessibility}} in mind. [...] This {{is reflected in}} the LRT-1's lack of <b>barrier-free</b> facilities such as escalators and elevators. [...] It is also inconvenient in other ways: for one, because of the use of side platforms, passengers wishing to access the other platform for the train bound in the opposite direction at single-level LRT-1 stations need to exit the station (and by extension, the system) and pay a new fare. [...] The newer LRT Line 2, unlike its counterpart, is designed to be <b>barrier-free</b> and allows seamless transfer between platforms. [...] Built by a joint venture between Hanjin and Itochu, LRT-2 stations have wheelchair ramps, braille markings, and pathfinding embossed flooring leading to and from the boarding platforms in addition to escalators and elevators.|$|E
500|$|BP Bridge {{begins in}} Millennium Park between the trellis system over the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's great lawn and the Lurie Garden; the design was changed {{so that the}} west ramp coincided with the boardwalk of the Lurie Garden seam. The bridge winds its way northward along {{the eastern edge of}} Millennium Park before {{crossing}} Columbus Drive in a C-shaped curve, above underground parking garage entrances. In Daley Bicentennial Plaza the bridge has an S-shape, then turns east. BP Bridge is designed so that its inclined surfaces have a continuous five percent slope rather than landings and switchback ramps, which provides easy access for the physically challenged. [...] The gently sloped ramp eliminates the need for lifts {{or any of the other}} common types of ramps (L-shaped, switchback, U-shaped, straight), and helped the park earn the 2005 <b>Barrier-Free</b> America Award for its exemplary <b>barrier-free</b> design.|$|E
500|$|The {{pedestrian}} bridge {{serves as a}} noise barrier for the pavilion, blocking traffic sounds from Columbus Drive. It is a connecting link between Millennium Park and destinations to the east, such as the nearby lakefront, other parts of Grant Park and a parking garage. The BP Bridge uses a concealed box girder design with a concrete base, and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards. [...] It is designed without handrails, using stainless steel parapets instead. The total length is , with a five percent slope on its inclined surfaces that makes it <b>barrier-free</b> and accessible. It has won awards for its use of sheet metal. Although the bridge is closed in winter because ice cannot be safely removed from its wooden walkway, it has received favorable reviews for its design and aesthetics.|$|E
500|$|During {{construction}} {{the underground}} parking garage remained open. An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating {{two levels of}} underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150"outriggers", or [...] "tiebacks", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows {{for the removal of}} individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning. [...] Crown Fountains design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, non-discriminatory, <b>barrier-free</b> accessibility, because its interactivity {{is not limited to the}} able-bodied. [...] The force of the water accounts for the entire range of possible interactive visitors.|$|E
500|$|The LRT-1 serves 500,000 {{passengers}} daily {{while the}} LRT-2 serves 200,000 passengers. Its [...] of mostly elevated route form two lines which serve [...] in total. [...] LRT Line1 (LRT-1), {{also called the}} Green Line (formerly known as Yellow Line), opened in 1984 and travels a north–south route. [...] LRT Line2 (LRT-2), the Blue Line (formerly known as Purple Line), was completed in 2004 and runs east–west. [...] The original LRT-1 was built as a no-frills means of public transport and lacks some features and comforts, but the new LRT-2 has been built with additional standards and criteria in mind like <b>barrier-free</b> access. Security guards at each station conduct inspections and provide assistance. A reusable plastic magnetic ticketing system has replaced the previous token-based system in 2001, and the Flash Pass introduced as a step towards a more integrated transportation system. In 2015, the plastic magnetic tickets were replaced with the Beep, a contactless smart card, was introduced to provide a common ticketing to 3 rail lines and some bus lines.|$|E
500|$|The {{park was}} {{designed}} to be accessible; it only needs a single wheelchair lift and its accessibility won its project director the 2005 <b>Barrier-Free</b> America Award. The McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion both provide accessible restrooms. [...] The park opened with 78 women's toilet fixtures and 45 for men, with heated facilities {{on the east side of}} the Pritzker Pavilion. It also had about six dozen park benches designed by GGN (Gustafson Guthrie Nichol), the landscape architect responsible for the Lurie Garden. In 2005, the park won the Green Roof Award of Excellence in the Intensive Industrial/Commercial category from Green Roofs for Healthy Cities (GRHC). GRHC considers the park to be one of the largest green roofs in the world; it covers [...] "a structural deck supported by two reinforced concrete cast-in-place garages and steel structures that span over the remaining railroad tracks". In 2005 the park also received Travel + Leisures Design Award for [...] "Best Public Space", and the American Public Works Association's [...] "Project of the Year" [...] Award. In its first year, the park, its features and associated people received over 30 awards.|$|E
2500|$|During 2007, {{passengers}} from [...] "The <b>Barrier-Free</b> Environment and Accessible Transport Group" [...] protested against the airline over {{its refusal to}} fly passengers who were completely immobile. They claimed that people with disabilities were discriminated against when booking tickets online; the CEO of the airline said it did not turn away wheelchair-bound passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Montgomery Zoo holds {{more than}} 500 animals, from five continents, in [...] of <b>barrier-free</b> habitats. [...] The Hank Williams Museum {{contains}} {{one of the}} largest collections of Williams memorabilia in the world. The Museum of Alabama serves as the official state history museum and is located in the Alabama Department of Archives and History building downtown. This museum was renovated and expanded in 2013 in a $10 million project that includes technological upgrades and many new exhibits and displays.|$|E
2500|$|The German Central Library for the Blind (...) , {{abbreviated}} DZB, is {{a public}} library for the visually impaired located {{in the city of}} Leipzig, Saxony, Germany. Its collection of 72,300 titles is amongst the largest in the German speaking countries. The institution consists of a lending library, a publishing house, and a research center for <b>barrier-free</b> communication. It also has production facilities for braille books, audiobooks, and braille music. The DZB publishes about 250 new titles annually. Founded in 1894, the DZB is the oldest library for the blind in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|MRT-3 {{stations}} have a standard layout, with a concourse level and a platform level. The concourse is usually above the platform, with stairs, escalators and elevators leading {{down to the}} platform level. [...] Station concourses contain ticket booths, which is separated from the platform level by fare gates. Some stations, such as Araneta Center-Cubao, are connected at concourse level to nearby buildings, such as shopping malls, for easier accessibility. [...] Most stations are also <b>barrier-free</b> {{inside and outside the}} station, and trains have spaces for passengers using wheelchairs.|$|E
2500|$|Fare {{collection}} {{is based on}} a proof-of-payment system. [...] The San Diego Trolley is a <b>barrier-free</b> (no turnstiles), self-service system. [...] Patrons must have proof of fare (ticket or pass) before boarding. [...] Self-serve ticket vending machines are located at each station. [...] Compass Card (see below) users must [...] "tap" [...] at a Compass Card validator (located at various points around each Trolley station, and on MTS buses) or on the Compass Card target on a ticket vending machine before boarding a trolley. [...] Random fare inspections are performed by roving transit enforcement personnel. [...] Based on frequent security inspections, nearly 98% of the 37 million patrons have proper fares.|$|E
2500|$|Herbert G. Winful {{argues that}} the train analogy is {{a variant of the}} [...] "reshaping argument" [...] for superluminal {{tunneling}} velocities, but {{he goes on to say}} that this argument is not actually supported by experiment or simulations, which actually show that the transmitted pulse has the same length and shape as the incident pulse. Instead, Winful {{argues that the}} group delay in tunneling is not actually the transit time for the pulse (whose spatial length must be greater than the barrier length in order for its spectrum to be narrow enough to allow tunneling), but is instead the lifetime of the energy stored in a standing wave which forms inside the barrier. Since the stored energy in the barrier is less than the energy stored in a <b>barrier-free</b> region of the same length due to destructive interference, the group delay for the energy to escape the barrier region is shorter than it would be in free space, which according to Winful is the explanation for apparently superluminal tunneling.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the Grorud Line {{started in}} February 1956. Landwork and {{electrical}} equipment was contracted to developers, while the trackage {{was done by}} the Planning Office. The original plans called for the use of 600 to 650 volt (V) direct current (DC) fed via a pantograph, to allow comparability with the western light rail. This was later changed to 750V DC via a third rail. This was chosen to allow a higher diameter, and thus a higher ampere, and easier maintenance. The system also took into use cab signaling and moving blocks, which were cutting edge technology at the time, and had only been implemented on the Stockholm Metro in Europe by then. While the permitted headway on the common sections was set to 90 seconds, it was set to 120 seconds on the Grorud Line. The original plans called for a depot on each of the lines, including the Grorud Line, but this was later changed to a central depot at Ryen. Stations were originally planned to be <b>barrier-free</b> and that the operator would employee conductors on board, similar to what was done of the tramway. This was however abandoned in 1958 and instead the stations were [...] "closed" [...] and ticket stands were installed at each station. The decision to allow Oslo Sporveier at the line's operator was taken in 1960.|$|E
