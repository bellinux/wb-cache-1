These questions are related to a certain series, involving the Möbius function, which, when convergent, represents, for k large enough, the probability P(G,k) that G can be generated topologically by k random elements.

40|$|Abstract. - The {{focus of}} the {{research}} reported here was {{on the design of}} high-temperature alloys which would form protective Si 02 and A 1203 scales on exposure to high-temperature, oxidizing environments. One way to promote the growth of such scales is to incorporate suf-ficient amounts of Si or A 1 in the alloy substrate; typically, additions of approximately 35 to 45 weight percent (all alloy compositions are given in weight percent unless explicitly stated oth-erwise) of Si or Al would be required to form the respective scales, in the absence of additional protective-scale-forming elements. At such levels of alloying additions, the formation of inter-metallic phases is likely, which may have undesirable features such as low melting temperatures or poor mechanical properties. The research described was an attempt to address these prob-lems from a fundamentally different point of view, for Mo- and Nb-based alloys, {{through the use of a}} dispersed reservoir phase. 1.

Modeling human {{exposures}} to {{air pollution control}} (APC) residues released from landfills in England and Wales. Environment International, 32, (4), 500 - 509. Keywords: Air pollution control residues; Risk; Air quality impact; Landfill; HealthHuman {{exposures to}} air pollution control (APC) residues released from 6 landfills were modeled and assessed. Following a qualitative risk characterisation, direct and indirect exposures were quantified. Site-specific air dispersion modeling was conducted for PM 10, PCDDs/PCDFs, Pb, Cd, As and CrVI concentrations at the closest residential points of exposure for 4 landfill sites accepting, in total, 75 % w/w of the APC residues disposed of in 2000 ? 2001 (UK). Inhalation risks, assessed by reference to air quality standards at residential exposure points, were assessed as insignificant. Preliminary modeling suggested that indirect exposures from PCDDs/PCDFs at the 95 th percentile level for the site where APC deposition rates were highest could potentially exceed the tolerable daily soil intake (TDSI) but this warrants further study given the model limitations. These results offer an initial screen {{of the significance of}} potential risks from APC disposal, which is of value in addressing concerns about the uncertainty of potential risks to human health from bulk APC disposal at strategic locations.

40|$|Background Obesity, in {{particular}} abdominal obesity, is an established determinant of insulin resistance. There is growing evidence supporting a causal contribution of OSA on insulin resistance (1, 2), independent of obesity. This prospective cohort study further investigated {{the relationship of}} abdominal fat, insulin resistance and sleep apnea. Methods Subjects were recruited from our sleep laboratory. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected. Overnight 16 -channel polysomnography was performed. Insulin resistance was estimated by the Short insulin tolerance test (SITT), and was indicated by the rate of decline in blood glucose (K constant). Fasting serum cortisol and lipid profile (cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL & HDLcholesterol, fatty acid, Apolipoproteins A & B) were measured. Overnight 12 -hour urine was collected to measure catecholamines. MRI scan of abdomen was performed to quantify the amount of visceral and subcutaneous fat at three levels of the abdomen. The Results 55 men, aged 21 – 65, BMI 27. 2 +/- 4. 6, AHI 30. 1 +/- 5. 2 were recruited. There were significant linear relationships of insulin resistance with AHI, arousal index, O 2 sat < 90 %, urinary norepinephrine, waist circumference, BMI, body fat, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride (P < 0. 05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that AHI (P < 0. 001) and abdominal fat (P < 0. 001) /waist circumference (P < 0. 005) /BMI (P < 0. 001) were independent predictors of insulin resistance. Conclusion Sleep disordered breathing reflected by AHI was a determinant of insulin resistance, independent of obesity reflected by detailed quantification of body fat. The findings further support a causal role of sleep apnea on insulin resistance. References 1 Ip M. S. M., Lam <b>B.,</b> <b>Ng</b> M. M., et al.

40|$|Antifungal {{proteins}} {{belong to}} a group of plant defense proteins, present in different plant tissues ranging from leaves, stems, roots to seeds. Upon fungal invasions, these proteins accumulate at the infection site to inhibit the growth of pathogens. Some antifungal proteins were found to have antifreeze and antiviral characteristics as well. Antifungal proteins are structurally diverse. Thaumatin-like proteins, chitinases, ribosome inactivating proteins, defensins, cyclophilin-like proteins and miraculin-like proteins are members of the family of antifungal proteins. There are antifungal proteins with other structures such as cysteine protease inhibitors and peptides. Apart from plant defense, antifungal proteins have been reported to affect the growth of murine immune cells including splenocytes, macrophages and bone marrow cells, as well as leukemia cells. In my study, five antifungal proteins were isolated from plant storage tissues that were bulbs and seeds abundant in proteins, comprising a chitinase-like antifungal proteins from black turtle beans (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. black turtle), an 8 -kDa antifungal peptide from green chickpea (Cicer arietinum cv green chickpea), two thaumatin-like proteins from two kinds of chestnut (Castanopsis chinensis and Castanea mollissima) and a 7. 1 -kDa antifungal peptide from the Chinese daffodil (Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis). In the majority of cases, the antifungal proteins were unadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose and adsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel, CM-cellulose and Mono S. They showed different antifungal potencies on various phytopathogenic fungi examined including Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, Mycosphaerella arachidicola and Physalospora piricola. Only the daffodil and Castanopsis antifungal proteins were active on all four fungal species. The remaining three antifungal proteins inhibit 2 - 3 of the 4 fungi. The purified proteins were characterized for various biological activities such as the inhibitory activity on HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase and cell-free translation in a rabbit reticulocyte system. All proteins except those from daffodil bulbs and black turtle beans exhibited HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity. The activity of purified proteins on the proliferation of normal and tumor cells in vitro, including murine splenocytes and leukemia L 1210 cells, was also studied. Daffodil antifungal protein was the only protein found to have a stimulatory activity on mouse splenocytes and an inhibitory activity on leukemia cells. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Chu Kin-tak.
