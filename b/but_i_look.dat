"Most {{guys are}} relaxed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> up and I see Kellen, and he's... going 110 miles an hour," [...] said 2013–14 Butler Bulldogs first year head coach Brandon Miller during an August {{overseas}} basketball tour. [...] "Sprinting {{up and down}} the court. Shooting pull-ups. Going as hard and as fast as he possible can. He goes at a pace, whether its shootaround in Australia, 17 minutes into practice or two hours into practice, that never changes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In Nightmare, all {{the adults}} are damaged: They're alcoholic, they're on pills, they're not around," [...] Englund has observed. Blakley says {{the parents in}} the film [...] "verge on being villains." [...] Englund adds: [...] "The {{adolescents}} have to wade through that, and Heather is the last girl standing. She lives. She defeats Freddy." [...] Langenkamp agrees: [...] "Nightmare is a feminist movie, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it more as a 'youth power' film." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My duty must be done, kin or no kin," [...] said Richard, [...] "that is if I find him; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{not to do}} that, since Norman is {{no doubt}} off to warn him." ...|$|E
60|$|Hans {{surveyed}} me with {{a watery}} eye as though {{waiting for me to}} explain them, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> haughty and declined to oblige.|$|R
60|$|I was {{somewhat}} annoyed at this effusiveness before the Celebrity, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up and caught Mrs. Cooke's eye. It was the calm {{eye of a}} general.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Assuredly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the Lady Ælueva {{where she}} stood among her maids, and her brother beside her. De Aquila's men had driven them all into the Great Hall.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> to {{the west}} when I gae to rest, [...] That happy my dreams and my slumbers may be; [...] For far in the west lives he I loe best, [...] The man that is dear to my babie and me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn't do better. By Jove!" [...] said Ukridge suddenly. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do, laddie. I wouldn't do it for everybody, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> on you as a {{favourite}} son. I'll come with you, and help break the ice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should like}} to learn very much; but who will teach me? I have learnt all Pigott knows two years ago, and since then I {{have been trying to}} learn about the trees and flowers and stars; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> and watch, and can't understand." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at Chaka and {{saw that}} the tears were running down his face, and that he only spoke thus to try the captain who loved him to the last.|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled with}} her softly severe little lips {{as she spoke}} those last words. <b>But</b> <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> {{at her with a}} purpose, saw just a tiny gleam of {{apprehension}} in her eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say. There {{were some}} {{ladies and gentlemen}} on the terrace whom <b>I</b> didn't know. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> only for you and came this way on an {{indication}} of your mother's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{upon the}} {{settlements}} as one thing, {{and on the}} Openings as another. What will do there isn't needed here; and what will do here won't answer there. But these last few days have so changed Castle Meal, that I hardly know it myself." ...|$|E
60|$|General Hunter is at Chicago, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{upon that}} as temporary. I {{have not heard}} of any command being {{assigned}} him as yet, and {{do not know that}} he has sufficiently recovered from wounds received in the late engagements in Virginia to take the field. Hunter will prove himself a fine officer.|$|E
60|$|THE DEVIL. Not that we don't admire your intellect, you know. We do. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at {{the matter}} {{from your own}} point of view. You don't get on with us. The place doesn't suit you. The truth is, you have--I won't say no heart; for we know that beneath all your {{affected}} cynicism you have a warm one.|$|E
60|$|After I {{went up to}} my room <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> out the window. It {{was only}} about ten o'clock, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> upon a silent town. The drizzle continued, {{spangled}} with dim lights, as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the Ladies' Exchange.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew what}} that meant, and a cold shiver {{went up and down}} my backbone. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> down at him--spick-and-span and glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and said, yes, he might come at three o'clock.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{telling you}} what the Colonel himself told me," [...] I answered, and ran on. [...] "Davy, darlin'!" [...] I heard him calling after me as I turned the corner, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> not back.|$|R
6000|$|Ben. to Cam. [Aside.] My master, sir, may say his pleasure; I divert myself {{sometimes}} with hearing him. Alas, good gentleman, 'tis {{not given to}} all persons to penetrate into men's parts and qualities; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> on you, sir, {{as a man of}} judgment, and therefore you shall hear me play and sing. [...] [He takes up the guitar, and begins.|$|E
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Cleanliness and respectability do {{not need}} justification, Barbara: they justify themselves. I see no {{darkness}} here, no dreadfulness. In your Salvation shelter I saw poverty, misery, cold and hunger. You gave them bread and treacle and dreams of heaven. I give from thirty shillings a week to twelve thousand a year. They find their own dreams; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> after the drainage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very much, only I {{never feel}} as if I was dressed right. My things seemed elegant at home, and I thought I'd be over over-dressed if anything; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> countrified and dowdy here. No time or money to change now, even if I {{knew how to do}} it,' {{answered}} the other, glancing anxiously at her bright pink silk grown, trimmed with cheap lace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{you both}} {{acknowledge}} it," [...] sighed Socrates, [...] "I will confess that I also am a fool, and {{have always been}} one; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> so wise the people insisted I must know everything!" ...|$|R
60|$|PATTY. Nor have I, ma'am, as yet. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>looks</b> out, {{and thinks}} I to myself, {{at any moment}} he may turn the corner. <b>I</b> ha' been <b>looking</b> out at windows {{waiting for him to}} oblige by turning the corner this fifteen years.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I mounted, Yusef {{once more}} begged me to {{interfere}} and have mercy [...] on them, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> {{around at the}} dark faces of the crowd, and I [...] couldn't find one drop of pity in my heart for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh, sir," [...] said Silas, {{unaffected}} by anything Godfrey was saying, [...] "I'm in no fear o' want. We shall do very well--Eppie and me 'ull do well enough. There's few working-folks have {{got so much}} laid by as that. I don't {{know what it is}} to gentlefolks, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> upon it as a deal--almost too much. And as for us, it's little we want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It does not. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> {{at it in}} this light. As one of {{the detectives}} said, it is {{possible}} that somebody stood outside of the rear window and saw you work the combination, but I doubt very much if they could learn the process in that way. There is a glare of light on the window that renders it very difficult to see at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "123" [...] had {{a vacancy}} for a page-boy, [...] "Glasgow Man" [...] for a {{photographer}}; page-boy {{must not be}} over fourteen, photographer must not be under twenty. [...] "I am a little over fourteen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> less," [...] wrote T. Sandys to [...] "123"; [...] "I am a little under twenty," [...] he wrote to [...] "Glasgow Man," [...] "but I look more." [...] His heart was in the work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know. Poor fellow! But, Madeline, {{is he not}} an {{excellent}} young man;--one, at any rate, that is lovable? Of course in such a matter the heart must answer for itself. <b>But</b> <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> at the offer as a mother--I could have been well pleased--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The woman met me," [...] she continued, [...] "and {{took me a}} {{long way}} from the station to a little house. She tried to take me upstairs. She said you were waiting for me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up and saw Captain Horton peeping over the banisters--" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at him. <b>I</b> reproached him no more. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at him. [...] "My dear, dear Charley," [...] said he, [...] "don't think ill of me, I beseech you! I {{know you}} have a right to my utmost confidence, and, believe me, you have ever had it until now. I abhor secrecy. Its meanness is {{intolerable}} to me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> and my dear girl have observed it for your sake." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{is merely}} {{to shake hands}} with you and give you the top of the morning in 1880. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> to be answered; and then I shall promise to answer in return. For I am now, so far as that can be in this world, my own man again, and when I have heard from you, I shall be able to write more {{naturally}} and at length.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a man of}} sentiment," [...] she declared. [...] "After fifteen years, too, {{and only}} just engaged to another woman! No, thank you, my dear Lawrence. I've lived my life, such as it has been. I'm not so very old, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> fifty, and I've vices enough to blacken an entire neighbourhood. Fancy, if people saw me, and heard {{that you might have}} married the Duchess of Lenchester. They'd hint at an asylum." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh! I am {{learning}} {{much here}} to-night. I find I didn't {{know anything about}} the American Society--that is, I didn't know its chief virtue. I didn't know its chief virtue until his Excellency our Ambassador revealed it--I may say, exposed it. I was intending to go home on the 13th of this month, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> upon that in a different light now. I am going to stay here until the American Society pays my passage.|$|E
6000|$|... "He never forced my judgement! He {{would never}} argue {{on the subject}} with me! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it in this way; what he believed, after inquiring deep into doctrines, was {{much more likely to}} be right than what I might believe, who hadn't looked into doctrines at all." ...|$|R
50|$|IRENE: <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>look</b> good in that color. I’d look faded or something.|$|R
60|$|Bel. Do {{not leave}} me, <b>I</b> charge you; <b>but</b> when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> mournfully upon you, help me out.|$|R
