40|$|In male dimorphic species, growth {{influences}} morph {{expression and}} thereby the reproductive success of males. However, how variation in nutritional conditions affects male morph development and whether males can compensate for lost growth is poorly known. Here, we performed an experiment where males of the <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini) —which are fighters, able to kill other mites, or benign scramblers—were offered high quality food during the larval stage, but food of high or low quality during the protonymph and tritonymph (=final) stage. When food quality was low during the latter two stages, males matured smaller, later {{and were more likely}} to be a scrambler than when food quality was high. We found no evidence for compensatory growth: when males had low quality food only during the protonymph stage, they matured at the same age, but grew at a slower rate and matured at a smaller size than males that had high quality food throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, males that experienced this transient period of low food quality were less likely to mature as a fighter. Interestingly, scrambler increase in body size during the protonymph and tritonymph stages was always lower than that of fighters. Given the strong link between adult size and fitness, combined with the different development times and life histories of the male morphs, the lack of ability to compensate for a transient period of food deprivation during ontogeny is likely to have consequences for the dynamics of <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> populations...|$|E
40|$|The dry <b>bulb</b> <b>mite,</b> Aceria tulipae, is {{the most}} {{important}} pest of stored tulip bulbs in The Netherlands. This tiny, eriophyoid mite hides in the narrow space between scales in the interior of the bulb. To achieve biological control of this hidden pest, candidate predators small enough to move in between the bulb scales are required. Earlier experiments have shown this potential for the phytoseiid mite, Neoseiulus cucumeris, but only after the bulbs were exposed to ethylene, a plant hormone that causes a slight increase in the distance between tulip bulb scales, just sufficient to allow this predator to reach the interior part of the bulb. Applying ethylene, however, is not an option in practice because it causes malformation of tulip flowers. In fact, to prevent this cosmetic damage, bulb growers ventilate rooms where tulip bulbs are stored, thereby removing ethylene produced by the bulbs (e. g. in response to mite or fungus infestation). Recently, studies on the role of predatory mites in controlling another eriophyoid mite on coconuts led to the discovery of an exceptionally small phytoseiid mite, Neoseiulus paspalivorus. This predator is able to move under the perianth of coconuts where coconut mites feed on meristematic tissue of the fruit. This discovery prompted us to test N. paspalivorus for its ability to control A. tulipae on tulip bulbs under storage conditions (ventilated rooms with bulbs in open boxes; 23 °C; storage period June-October). Using destructive sampling we monitored predator and prey populations in two series of replicated experiments, one at a high initial level of dry <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> infestation, late in the storage period, and another at a low initial dry <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> infestation, halfway the storage period. The first and the second series involved treatment with N. paspalivorus and a control experiment, but the second series had an additional treatment in which the predator N. cucumeris was released. Taking the two series of experiments together we found that N. paspalivorus controlled the populations of dry bulb mites both on the outer scale of the bulbs {{as well as in the}} interior part of the bulbs, whereas N. cucumeris significantly reduced the population of dry bulb mites on the outer scale, but not in the interior part of the bulb. Moreover, N. paspalivorus was found predominantly inside the bulb, whereas N. cucumeris was only found on the outer scale, thereby confirming our hypothesis that the small size of N. paspalivorus facilitates access to the interior of the bulbs. We argue that N. paspalivorus is a promising candidate for the biological control of dry bulb mites on tulip bulbs under storage conditions in the Netherlands...|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{conflict}} {{leading to}} sexual antagonistic coevolution has been hypothesized to drive reproductive isolation in allopatric populations and hence lead to speciation. However, the generality of this speciation mechanism is under debate. We used experimental {{evolution in the}} <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> Rhizoglyphus robini to investigate whether sexual conflict promotes reproductive isolation measured comprehensively to include all possible pre- and post-zygotic mechanisms. We established replicate populations in which we either enforced monogamy, and hence removed sexual conflict by making male and female evolutionary interests congruent, or allowed promiscuity. After 35 and 45 generations of experimental evolution, we {{found no evidence of}} reproductive isolation between the populations in any of the mating systems.

40|$|Sperm {{competition}} {{is a potent}} evolutionary force shaping the reproductive biology of most animal species. Here, we estimated the heritability of sperm competition success in the promiscuous <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> Rhizoglyphus robini. Sperm competition success was measured with the sterile male technique as the proportion of eggs fertilised by the second of three males mated with a single female. Sperm competi-tion success responded significantly to selection. The heritability estimated from the response to five generations of selection was 0. 13. We also estimated the effect of inbreeding on sperm competition success. Males produced by sib-mating (F 0. 25) had a significantly lower sperm competition success than outbred males. The estimated coefficient of inbreeding depression was 0. 53.

The heritability of sperm competition success was estimated using parent-offspring regression, with the mean fertilization success from two matings used as a measure of each male’s competitive ability. There was a significant association between the sperm competition success of fathers and sons. Narrow sense heritability (I?*) was 0. 284. This result supports the hypotheses proposing the multiple mating is selec-tively maintained in females by enhancing the reproductive success of their progeny...|$|E

40|$|Although {{variation}} in male fertilization efficiency {{has been shown}} to have a genetic basis in several species, the genes responsible for the effect are generally unknown. Here, we show a strong association between the fertilization success of males and their phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Pgdh) genotype in the <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> Rhizoglyphus robini. Males homozygous for the slow (S) allele fathered a significantly greater proportion of offspring when competing with males homozygous for the fast (F) allele. There was no evidence that female fecundity was influenced by their Pgdh genotype. The fecundity of FF females did not differ significantly from the fecundity of SS females but female fecundity was significantly influenced by the genotype of their mate. Females paired with SS males laid significantly fewer eggs than females paired with FF males. Altogether these data show a trade-off, with the male SS genotype associated with their higher fertilization efficiency but at the cost of a negative impact on the fecundity of females mating with them...|$|E
40|$|In this study, I {{examined}} the effects of inbreeding and stress on fluctuating asymmetry and body length in the <b>bulb</b> <b>mite,</b> Rhizoglyphus robini.

At the larval stage, both the inbred and outbred progeny were divided between two treatments: the control was reared at a stable temperature of 22 C, whereas the stressed lines were kept under oscillating temperatures of between 10 C (night) and 28 C (day) until reaching adulthood. Fluctuating asymmetry, quantified by means of procrustean analysis based on five land-marks, and body length were measured for one male from each line. Fluctuating asymmetry increased with inbreeding but not with stress. In contrast, body length decreased with stress but not with inbreeding.

40|$|In many species, {{the genetic}} quality of gametes {{is likely to}} decline with age of the male.

Furthermore, young males won sperm competition against older males. This implies that polyandry may be an effective way of avoiding fertilization by the sperm of older males. It has also been suggested that polyandry insures females against the infertility of old males. Our results do not support this hypothesis: matings with older males did not result in female infertility significantly more often than matings with young males...|$|E

We demonstrate that populations in which monogamy was enforced suffered a dramatic fitness decline when evolving at an increased temperature, whereas the negative effects of change in a thermal environment were alleviated in polygamous populations. Strikingly, within 17 generations, all monogamous populations experiencing higher temperature went extinct, whereas all polygamous populations survived.

40|$|Life history traits play an {{important}} role in population dynamics and correlate, both positively and negatively, with dispersal in a wide range of taxa. Most invertebrate studies on trade-offs between life history traits and dispersal have focused on dispersal via flight, yet much less is known about how life history trade-offs influence species that disperse by other means. In this study, we identify effects of investing in dispersal morphology (dispersal expression) on life history traits in the male dimorphic <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini). This species has a facultative juvenile life stage (deutonymph) during which individuals can disperse by phoresy. Further, adult males are either fighters (which kill other mites) or benign scramblers. Here, in an experiment, we investigate the effects of investing in dispersal on size at maturity, sex and male morph ratio, and female lifetime reproductive success. We show that life history traits correlate negatively with the expression of the dispersal stage. Remarkably, all males that expressed the dispersal life stage developed into competitive fighters and none into scramblers. This suggests that alternative, male reproductive strategies and dispersal should not be viewed in isolation but considered concurrently...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} phenotypes (ARPs) occur {{across a}} wide range of taxa. Most ARPs are conditionally expressed in response to a cue, for example body size, that reliably correlates with the status of the environment: individuals below the (body size) threshold then develop into one morph, and individuals above the threshold develop into the alternative morph. The environmental threshold model provides a theoretical framework to understand the evolution and maintenance of such ARPs, yet no study has examined the underlying fitness functions that are necessary to realize this. Here, we empirically examined fitness functions for the two male morphs of the <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini). Fitness functions were derived in relation to male size for solitary males and in relation to female size under competition. In both cases, the fitness functions of the two morphs intersected, and the resulting fitness trade-offs {{may play a role in}} the maintenance of this male dimorphism. We furthermore found that competition was strongest between males of the same morph, suggesting that fitness trade-off in relation to male size may persist under competition. Our results are a first step towards unravelling fitness functions of ARPs that are environmentally cued threshold traits, which is essential for understanding their maintenance and in explaining the response to selection against alternative morphs...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} phenotypes (ARPs) represent discrete morphological variation {{within a}} single sex; as such ARPs are an excellent study system to investigate the maintenance of phenotypic variation. ARPs are traditionally modelled as a mixture of pure strategies or as a conditional strategy. Most male dimorphisms are controlled by a conditional strategy, where males develop into a particular phenotype {{as a result of}} their condition which allows them to reach a certain threshold. Individuals that are unable to reach the threshold of a conditional strategy are considered to ‘make the best of a bad job’; however, these individuals can have their own fitness merits. Given these fitness merits, condition-dependent selection alone is not sufficient to maintain a conditionally determined male dimorphism and other mechanisms, most likely frequency-dependent selection, are required. We studied in an experiment, the male dimorphic <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> Rhizoglyphus robini—where males are fighters that can kill other males or benign scramblers—to assess the strength of frequency-dependent survival in a high and low-quality environment. We found that male survival was frequency-dependent in the high-quality environment but not the low-quality environment. In the high-quality environment the survival curves of the two morphs crossed but the direction of frequency-dependence was opposite to what theory predicts...|$|E

40|$|Investigating how the {{environment}} affects age and size at maturity of individuals {{is crucial to}} understanding how changes in {{the environment}} affect population dynamics through the biology of a species. Paternal phenotype, maternal, and offspring environment may crucially influence these traits, but to my knowledge, their combined effects {{have not yet been}} tested. Here, I found that in <b>bulb</b> <b>mites</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini), maternal nutrition, offspring nutrition, and paternal phenotype (males are fighters, able to kill other mites, or benign scramblers) interactively affected offspring age and size at maturity. The largest effect occurred when both maternal and offspring nutrition was poor: in that case offspring from fighter sires required a significantly longer development time than offspring from scrambler sires. Investigating parental effects on the relationship between age and size at maturity revealed no paternal effects, and only for females was its shape influenced by maternal nutrition. Overall, this reaction norm was nonlinear. These non-genetic intergenerational effects may play a complex, yet unexplored role in influencing population fluctuations—possibly explaining why results from field studies often do not match theoretical predictions on maternal effects on population dynamics...|$|R

The nutritional requirements of the <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> Rhizoglyphus robini Claparede (Acari: Astigmata: Acaridae) in the laboratory {{have been shown to}} be very easily satisfied, and in the field the mites prefer fungus-infected over uninfected plants. To test whether symbiotic bacteria facilitate the survival of R. robini on a temporarily nutritionally unbalanced diet, we investigated the composition of its microbiome. Using 454 pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA gene fragments, 3 genera were found to dominate the bacterial community: Myroides (41. 4 %), Serratia (11. 4 %), and Alcaligenes (4. 5 %); the latter 2 are known to include chitinase-producing species. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that mite fecundity is significantly higher (2 times) on fungus than on controls (sterilized potato dextrose agar and filter paper). Also, when mite homogenate was applied to a chitin layer, the halo produced through degradation was clearly visible, while the saline control did not produce a halo. We thus concluded that R. robini utilizes fungal chitin, at least to a certain extent, as a food source with the help of its associated bacteria. This information supports the general concept of multigenome organisms and the involvement of bacteria in the mite's nutritional ecology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. If genetically {{distinct}} morphs coexist under a {{range of}} natural conditions, they should have equal long-run fitnesses across {{a wide range of}} different stochastic environments. In other words, the sequence and frequency of good and bad environments should not substantially impact long-run growth rates. When different morphs have contrasting life histories that vary with environmental conditions, however, it seems improbable that growth rates can be equivalent across {{a range of}} stochastic environments without invoking a strong stabilizing mechanism to explain their persistence. As yet, there has been no research characterizing the long-run stochastic growth rate (lambdaS) of different morphs across a wide range of stochastic environments. Assuming density independence, we show that the two genetic male morphs in the <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini-fighters, which are able to kill other mites, and benign scramblers-have similar lambdas in different Markovian environments (different simulated random sequences of good and bad habitats). Elasticity analyses revealed that Xs was most sensitive to perturbation of adult survival rate. A slight (biologically and statistically realistic) increase in scrambler adult survival equalized scrambler and fighter X,. The fitness equivalence of the two morphs suggests that stabilizing mechanisms, such as density or frequency dependence, required to maintain their coexistence, are weak. We advocate that stochastic demography can offer a powerful approach to identify and understand the circumstances under which genetic polymorphisms can be maintained in stochastic environments...|$|E
40|$|Many species exhibit two {{discrete}} male morphs: {{fighters and}} sneakers. Fighters {{are large and}} possess weapons but may mature slowly. Sneakers are small and have no weapons but can sneak matings and may mature quickly to start mating earlier in life than fighters. However, how differences in competitive ability and life history interact to determine male morph coexistence {{has not yet been}} investigated within a single framework. Here we integrate demography and game theory into a two-sex population model to study the evolution of strategies that result in the coexistence of fighters and sneakers. We incorporate differences in maturation time between the morphs and use a mating-probability matrix analogous to the classic hawk-dove game. Using adaptive dynamics, we show that male dimorphism evolves more easily in our model than in classic game theory approaches. Our results also revealed an interaction between life-history differences and sneaker competitiveness, which shows that demography and competitive games should be treated as interlinked mechanisms to understand the evolution of male dimorphism. Applying our approach to empirical data on <b>bulb</b> <b>mites</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and bullhorned dung beetles (Onthophagus taurus) indicates that observed occurrences of male dimorphism are in general agreement with model predictions...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} {{and maintenance of}} within-sex reproductive morphs, or alternative reproductive phenotypes (ARPs), requires in depth understanding of the proximate mechanisms that determine ARP expression. Most species express ARPs in complex ecological environments, yet little is know about how different environmental variables collectively affect ARP expression. Here, I investigated the influence of maternal and developmental nutrition and sire phenotype on ARP expression in <b>bulb</b> <b>mites</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini), where males are either fighters, able to kill other mites, or benign scramblers. In a factorial experiment, females were raised on a rich or a poor diet, and after maturation they were paired to a fighter or a scrambler. Their offspring were put on the rich or poor diet. Females on the rich diet increased investment into eggs when mated to a fighter, but suffered reduced longevity. Females indirectly affected offspring ARP expression as larger eggs developed into larger final instars, which {{were more likely to}} develop into a fighter. Final instar size, which also strongly depended on offspring nutrition, was the main cue for morph development: a switch point, or size threshold, existed where development switched from one phenotype to the other. Sire phenotype affected offspring phenotype, but only if offspring were on the poor diet, indicating a gene by environment interaction. Overall, the results revealed that complex environmental effects can underlie ARP expression, with differential maternal investment potentially amplifying genetic effects on offspring morphology. These effects can therefore {{play an important role in}} understanding how selection affects ARP expression and, like quantitative genetics models for continuous traits, should be incorporated into models of threshold traits...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the hypothesis that presence of the generalist soil-dwelling predatory mite Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Womersley) results in lower densities of the phytoseiid soil-dwelling predator Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes in Hippeastrum (amaryllis). If true, this may increase risks of <b>bulb</b> scale <b>mite</b> Steneotarsonemus laticeps (Halbert) infestations in Hippeastrum, because N. barkeri predates on this pest, whereas S. scimitus does not. In a greenhouse trial we show indeed that the release of S. scimitus results in significantly lower densities of N. barkeri in a Hippeastrum crop. Moreover, analyses of soil and bulb samples from a commercial Hippeastrum farm suggest that this predator interference is facilitated by soil cooling techniques that drive the predators together to small ‘islands’ of higher surface temperature...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{benefits}} are potentially the most robust {{explanation of the}} controversial issue of evolutionary maintenance of polyandry, but the unambiguous demonstration of such benefits has been hindered {{by the possibility of}} their confusion with maternal effects. Previous research has shown that polyandrous <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> females produce daughters with higher fecundity than monandrous females. Here, we investigate whether this effect arises because polyandrous females invest more in their offspring, or because their offspring inherit 'good genes' from their fathers. Females were mated with either one or four (different) males. However, by sterilizing three of the four males with ionizing radiation, we eliminated any chance of sexual selection (in the polyandrous treatment) so that any differences in the female mating regimes must have been owing to maternal effects. Polyandry had no significant effect on daughter fecundity, thus indicating that any previously documented effects must have been genetic. This was further supported by a significant association between fathers' offensive sperm-competitive ability and the fecundity of their daughters. The association with fathers' sperm defensive ability was not significant, and neither was the association between fathers' sperm competitiveness and sons' reproductive success. However, sons of polyandrous females had lower reproductive success than sons of monandrous females. This shows that the maternal effects of polyandry should be taken into account whenever its costs and {{benefits are}} being considered...|$|E

In this thesis, I investigated interactions of eriophyid mites, important agricultural pests, which hide inside refuges, where they are temporarily safe, and their natural enemies. I found that only a smaller member of the predatory mite guild on coconut trees was able to enter refuges of the coconut mite, consisting of {{the area of the}} coconut covered by the perianths. However, they could only do so after the distance between the perianth and the coconut surface had increased with time. To further understand the role of this refuge, I experimentally increased its entrances in the field, and found that successful control of the pest critically hinged on refuge opening and predator size. I furthermore prove that this predatory mite and a larger, commercially available species responded to prey-associated volatiles, but only the smallest mite was able to move into narrow spaces such as the prey refuge. Although {{it has been suggested that}} larger predators have the advantage to easily subdue their prey, being small thus seems advantageous when prey hide inside refuges. I furthermore demonstrate that this small predator can control the dry <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> on Dutch tulip bulbs. These mites hide between bulb scales and cannot be reached by the conventionally used larger predatory mites. Thus, I show that a small tropical predatory mite from the tropics can be used to control an important pest of Dutch tulip bulbs...|$|E
40|$|In the US Easter lilies {{are forced}} as {{seasonal}} pot plants. Bulbs are planted into a medium {{that is well}} drained and aerated 0. 5 to 1 inch {{from the bottom of}} a 6 inch standard pot. A fungicide and miticide are applied to control root diseases and <b>bulb</b> <b>mites.</b> The <b>bulbs</b> are watered judiciously to provide enough water to avoid excessive drying but not too much to cause root rot and leaf yellowing. Supplying adequate nutrition is important. The choice of fertilizer depends on the desired pH response. The bulbs are left to develop roots between 1 – 3 weeks. Care is taken not to allow the stem to emerge during root development. Flower induction is achieved through a six-week vernalization (cold and moist) treatment with the length of the cooling treatment being most critical. Cooling is accomplished using one of three different methods, natural cooling, controlled-temperature forcing and case cooling. Then the lilies are exposed to 1 - 3 weeks of long days upon emergence from the growth medium following the cooling treatment to ensure flower induction. Long days are given by applying night-interruption lighting. As the lily develops growers use leaf counting to help ensure proper timing of a lily crop. Leaf counting usually starts 3 weeks after emergence or when plants are 3 - 5 inches tall. The rate of leaf unfolding is a linear function of average daily temperature. Temperature will also determine final plant appearance. Leaf and flower length, plant eight and leaf orientation are all characteristics influenced by the day and night temperatures during this period. Once a visible bud has appeared the time to flower ranges between 24 to 42 days depending upon temperature regime chosen. As with all ornamental plants, managing pests and diseases is a critical component of lily production since any damage usually renders a plant unsaleable Insect Pest...|$|R
40|$|Tulip virus X (TVX) is a Potexvirus causing {{economic}} losses in tulip. Potexviruses are generally transmitted by mechanical contact and, indeed, several mechanical transmission pathways for TVX {{have been identified}} during tulip bulb production. However, TVX transmission does also seem to occur during bulb storage. Since mechanical transmission is excluded in this period, a biological vector should be involved. The eriophyoid mite Aceria tulipae, the acarid storage mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae, and the acarid <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> Rhizoglyphus echinopus are the main arthropod pests of stored tulip bulbs. Therefore, we studied their putative role in transmission of TVX during tulip bulb storage. We show that mites {{of each of these}} species can carry TVX with them after feeding on TVX-infected bulbs. In addition, some of the healthy bulbs acquired an infection with TVX when inoculated with mites. Although the current setup of the experiments does not confirm which species of mite transmit TVX, we have strong indications that mites are involved in transmission. Additional research with larger numbers of independent replicates is required to further prove the vector status of each species of mite, the efficiency, and mode of virus transmission. If our results will be confirmed, this would be the first case reporting a Potexvirus to be transmitted by mites, and the first case of an association between acarid mites and a plant pathogenic virus. Consequently, TVX control in tulip bulb production should include an adequate control strategy of both eriophyoid and acarid mites...|$|E
40|$|In many species, the {{accumulation}} of mutations in the male germline can result in decreased progeny fitness. Consequently, females may evolve preferences for younger partners. Here, we used a promiscuous and relatively long-living <b>bulb</b> <b>mite</b> (Rhizoglyphus robini) to test whether male age affects his progeny fitness. We found that daughters of 4 - to 5 -week-old males had a 6 % lower fecundity than those of 4 - to 8 -day-old males. Furthermore, we investigated whether male age and female mating status affect the probability of copulation. Male age classes {{did not differ in}} motility measured in the presence of females, but older males were less likely to mate within an hour of pairing. We had predicted that females' reluctance to mate with older males would be revealed by their higher motility after the physical contact between the sexes. However, postcontact female motility was not affected by male age, nor was it a significant predictor of the occurrence of copulation. Apart from male age, mating probability was affected by female mating status, with virgin females copulating more readily than females that had mated multiply before the experiment. The interaction between male age and female mating status was not significant. It took less time for males to locate virgin females, and a higher proportion of virgins mated. Higher male motility in the presence of virgin females suggests that they may use sexual pheromones to attract males, whereas females that have already copulated may avoid the costs of mating by suppressing emission of sexual attractants.
