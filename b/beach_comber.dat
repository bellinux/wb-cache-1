5000|$|On 19 August 1942, <b>Beach</b> <b>Comber</b> {{arrived in}} Britain, despite {{hazardous}} conditions, from Dieppe, France carrying {{a message from}} the Canadian Army alerting commanders of their landing there, marking the start of the Dieppe raid. As a result, on 6 March 1944, the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals awarded <b>Beach</b> <b>Comber</b> the Dickin Medal. [...] <b>Beach</b> <b>Comber</b> remains the only Canadian war pigeon ever to be awarded a Dickin Medal, and one of only three Canadian animals ever to be so honoured.|$|E

This separation lasts too long for him, causing his mind to split into good and its opposite, evil, which when dominant created sand vortexes to ensnare <b>beach</b> <b>combers.</b> Spider-Man arrived to confront Sandman, ultimately using Sandman's mental instability to free his captives and cause him to explode.|$|R

Kelvin waves are warm bumps in the Pacific Ocean, characterized by a gentle yet massive swell of warm water. Usually not much happens when a Kelvin wave arrives [...] <b>beach</b> <b>combers</b> experience a bit of extra rain, perhaps, and slightly warmer surf. Nevertheless, scientists pay careful attention to them because these gentle waves occasionally herald something far more powerful: the next El Niño...|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} {{presence of a}} lascar (Indian seaman) in Fiji was by Peter Dillon, a sandalwood trader in Fiji. The lascar survived a ship wreck and lived amongst the natives of Fiji in 1813. Dillon has written about Lascar Joe who, according to the Cyclopedia of Fiji, deserted from the brig Hibernia. He lived in Fiji with other <b>beach</b> <b>combers,</b> hiring himself out as a mercenary to different chiefs in the numerous intertribal wars in Fiji. The Indian indenture ships which carried Indians from India to Fiji between 1879 and 1916 were manned mainly by lascars.|$|R

5000|$|Severn Beach only existed as a farm until Great Western Railway linked Pilning and Avonmouth in 1900. The railway saw the {{possibilities}} of development now that trains passed through the area and in 1922 the village was created as a seaside resort with a swimming pool called the [...] "Blue Lagoon", a boating lake and the <b>Beach</b> <b>Comber</b> Strip Club, mostly by local entrepreneur Robert Stride. Many people came from nearby Bristol because Severn Beach had less strict licensing laws.|$|E
5000|$|In {{early spring}} 1998, John Lorimer, a special-needs worker {{who was also}} an amateur {{archaeologist}} and <b>beach</b> <b>comber,</b> was on Holme beach with his brother-in-law Gary catching shrimps when he came across a Bronze Age axe head in the silt, {{but at the time}} did not know what it was. Intrigued, he revisited the same area on a number of other occasions, coming across a lone tree stump that had been unearthed on the beach, which he felt was unusual in that it appeared to be upside down. He decided to call up a friend of his who was a metal detectorist who was able to recognise what it was, and so they contacted the [...] Castle Museum in Norwich. Archaeologists working at the museum examined the axe head, and noted that it was the second that had been found on the Holme Beach over the previous few months. Meanwhile, Lorimer had continued to monitor the lone tree stump on the beach, and when the gradual erosion showed that it was surrounded by a ring of wooden posts, he realised that it was definitely a man-made construction, and so contacted Castle Museum once more.|$|E
40|$|Cumbria {{is famous}} {{throughout}} {{the world for the}} spectacular scenery of the Lake District, but it also hosts dramatic formations along its coast, which are much less well known (Figure 1). Few people ever see these strange termite mound-like workings, as the Cumbrian coast is rarely explored by the hordes of tourists who come to marvel at the mountains. those that do venture down to the coast often miss these bizarre formations, as they are only exposed at low tide. thus for many years the workings of a small polychaete worm called Sabellaria were known only to the few fishermen, <b>beach</b> <b>combers</b> and marine biologists who ventured down onto the lower shore at low tide. This all changed {{with the advent of the}} Habitats Directive, which defined the workings of the humble Sabellaria worm as ‘biogenic reef’, an Annex I habitat and therefore potentially worthy of designation as a qualifying feature of a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) ...|$|R

Gradually it became {{populated}} with a motley throng of runaway sailors, <b>beach</b> <b>combers</b> & escaped convicts & became the scene of the wildest orgies. In 1830 Ben Turner opened the first store & grogshop & thenceforward it was a busy place, numbering in 1830 a thousand souls with grogshops, billiard saloons, skittle alleys, hells, a theatre & a church. To keep some sort of safety an association was formed which dispensed a rough justice in which tarring & feathering were features. Here the first war commenced when Heke cut down the obnoxious flagstaff which was supposed to interfere with the trade of the port.

5000|$|From 1952 to 1968, Miller {{directed}} the Norma Miller Dancers and Norma Miller and Her Jazzmen, {{both of which}} included Frankie Manning's son Charles [...] "Chazz" [...] Young {{as well as her}} long-time partner Billy Ricker. The group always debuted their new work at the Apollo Theater. The group toured the country and in Australia. In 1954, her group joined the Count Basie show. The Norma Miller dancers performed with other stars of the show Cab Calloway, Sallie Blair, and George Kirby. This was the first all Black show to play the <b>Beach</b> <b>Comber</b> in Miami Beach. It was in Miami Beach where Miller started comedy. She and Cab Calloway acted of a comedy skit of Romeo and Juliet. She remained there until 1959. In 1972, Miller traveled to Vietnam on a solo comedy tour. When she heard about the death of Roy Glenn, she returned to the United States and finished her comedy tour there. In 1977, Norma Miller moved to Las Vegas where she starred in and produced shows, one of her favorite being, Let Me Off Uptown. In 1982, back in New York Miller danced and choreographed shows at the Village Gate. In 1988, Miller's mother died and she returned to Las Vegas.|$|E
