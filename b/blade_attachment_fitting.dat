40|$|Abstract. Blade {{roots and}} <b>blade</b> <b>attachment</b> grooves are highly {{stressed}} areas of steam turbine rotors. An unknown crack in blade roots or <b>blade</b> <b>attachments</b> {{can lead to}} a serious failure of the complete turbo generator set. Due to the high demand of power energy worldwide there is a strong demand to extend the calculated life of turbo generator sets. The extended operation cycle of turbines leads to the demand of advanced NDT methods, especially for highly stressed areas of turbine and generator rotors. The most critical ranges of a turbine rotor are the turbine blade roots as well as the turbine <b>blade</b> <b>attachment</b> grooves. The individual design of the turbine manufacturer require separate NDT methods for each blade root or <b>blade</b> <b>attachment</b> to be inspected. Phased Array Ultrasonic Inspection offers a reliable inspection without dismantling the parts for inspection. This paper describes examples of development of new Phased Array probes and the qualification of the inspection techniques for selected application in steam turbine field-service. 1...|$|R

The approach is validated on a benchmark problem.

A tubular collet having flexible finger projecting from its forward end is arranged in the fastener body to be shifted forwardly by an elongated expander member coaxially arranged within the tubular collet for advancing the collet fingers into the opening in the <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting.</b> Biasing means are arranged between the elongated expander member and a rotatable actuator which is threadedly mounted within the tubular collet {{so as to be}} rotated for urging the expander member into engagement with the collet fingers. A first coupling member is arranged on the rotatable actuator to be accessible from outside of the fastener so that a second coupling member on the distal end of a flexible shaft can be introduced into the fastener body and coupled to the first coupling member to enable a typical actuating tool coupled to the shaft outside of the fastener body to be operated for advancing the outwardly-enlarged ends of the collet fingers into the opening in the <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting</b> and thereafter rotating the actuator member to expand the fingers to that <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting.</b> Upon expansion of the collet fingers, the biasing means impose a biasing force on the expander to releasably retain the fingers in their latching positions...|$|R
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting.</b> This meant that the pylon <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting</b> had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R

The investigation relies on stationary RANS simulation of air flow past the GRC common platform fuselage and a generic main rotor hub in cruise flight at Mach number equal to 0. 204, and - 2. 5 o pitch angle. Modular grids were generated around two fuselage configurations and three main rotor hub shapes.

30|$|Comparing {{the steel}} {{guardrail}} and the steel guard pipe, the GHG emissions {{of the steel}} guard pipe were 127  % of the GHG emissions of the steel guardrail, which was significantly higher. There are two likely reasons for this. First, the guard pipe has a narrower support post spacing (3  m), and therefore uses {{a larger number of}} support posts with an attendant increase in the emissions associated with the raw material procurement and production of support posts, as well as their construction. Second, the guard pipe is installed in three tiers of beams, which increases the number of <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings.</b> While the GHG emissions from raw material procurement and production of <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings</b> for the steel guardrail were 1.36  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, the equivalent emissions for the steel guard pipe were 6.00  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} turbine disk cavity aerodynamics and heat transfer {{was conducted to}} provide an experimental data base that can guide the aerodynamic and thermal design of turbine disks and <b>blade</b> <b>attachments</b> for flow conditions and geometries simulating those {{of the space shuttle}} main engine (SSME) turbopump drive turbines. Experiments were conducted to define the nature of the aerodynamics and heat transfer of the flow within the disk cavities and <b>blade</b> <b>attachments</b> of a large scale model simulating the SSME turbopump drive turbines. These experiments include flow between the main gas path and the disk cavities, flow within the disk cavities, and leakage flows through the <b>blade</b> <b>attachments</b> and labyrinth seals. Air was used to simulate the combustion products in the gas path. Air and carbon dioxide were used to simulate the coolants injected at three locations in the disk cavities. Trace amounts of carbon dioxide were used to determine the source of the gas at selected locations on the rotors, the cavity walls, and the interstage seal. The measurements on the rotor and stationary walls in the forward and aft cavities showed that the coolant effectiveness was 90 percent or greater when the coolant flow rate was greater than the local free disk entrainment flow rate and when room temperature air was used as both coolant and gas path fluid. When a coolant-to-gas-path density ratio of 1. 51 was used in the aft cavity, the coolant effectiveness on the rotor was also 90 percent or greater at the aforementioned condition. However, the coolant concentration on the stationary wall was 60 to 80 percent at the aforementioned condition indicating a more rapid mixing of the coolant and flow through the rotor shank passages. This increased mixing rate was attributed to the destabilizing effects of the adverse density gradients...|$|R

The study {{is designed to}} obtain detailed local convection heat transfer rates on specially constructed turbine disk models that employ either multiple cooling jet impingement near the disk outer radius from a jet ring, or alternatively, single entrance coolant supply {{into the center of}} the disk cavity. Jet impingement is an effective scheme for cooling of turbine disks at or near the <b>blade</b> <b>attachment</b> region, but the heat transfer mechanisms and merits relative to other schemes are not well understood. The present study employs two specially constructed full scale plastic model disks, contoured and plane, together with the corresponding stators. Local heat transfer rates are determined by a computer vision system from the response of thin liquid crystal coatings applied to the disk test faces.

40|$|Single crystal nickel base {{superalloy}} {{turbine blades}} are being utilized in rocket engine turbopumps and turbine engines {{because of their}} superior creep, stress rupture, melt resistance and thermomechanical fatigue capabilities over polycrystalline alloys. Currently {{the most widely used}} single crystal nickel base turbine blade superalloys are PWA 1480 / 1493 and PWA 1484. These alloys {{play an important role in}} commercial, military and space propulsion systems. High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) induced failures in aircraft gas turbine and rocket engine turbopump blades is a pervasive problem. <b>Blade</b> <b>attachment</b> regions are prone to fretting fatigue failures. Single crystal nickel base superalloy turbine blades are especially prone to fretting damage because the subsurface shear stresses induced by fretting action at the attachment regions can result in crystallographic initiation and crack growth along octahedral planes. Furthermore, crystallographic crack growth on octahedral planes under fretting induced mixed mode loading can be an order of magnitude faster than under pure mode I loading. This paper presents contact stress evaluation in the attachment region for single crystal turbine blades used in the NASA alternate Advanced High Pressure Fuel Turbo Pump (HPFTP/AT) for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Single crystal materials have highly orthotropic properties making the position of the crystal lattice relative to the part geometry a significant factor in the overall analysis. <b>Blades</b> and the <b>attachment</b> region are modeled using a large-scale 3 D finite element (FE) model capable of accounting for contact friction, material orthotrophy, and variation in primary and secondary crystal orientation. Contact stress analysis in the <b>blade</b> <b>attachment</b> regions is presented as a function of coefficient of friction and primary and secondary crystal orientation, Stress results are used to discuss fretting fatigue failure analysis of SSME <b>blades.</b> <b>Attachment</b> stresses are seen to reach peak values at locations where fretting cracks have been observed. Fretting stresses at the attachment region are seen to vary significantly as a function of crystal orientation. Attempts to adapt techniques used for estimating fatigue life in the airfoil region, for life calculations in the attachment region, are presented. An effective model for predicting crystallographic crack initiation under mixed mode loading is required for life prediction under fretting action...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of finite element (FE) simulation and study of 3 -D stress-strain state of attachments of steam turbine last stages blades performed {{with the use of the}} ANSYS FE software. The attachments of the steam turbine last stages blades consist of a great deal of structural elements (e. g. rivets, forks) that have complicated geometrical shape and are in contact interaction with each other. To obtain the FE results, correctly describing local stresses and to reduce the computation time, a series of 3 -D finite element models has been built and a method of multi-level submodeling has been used. In the process of the finite element study of the 3 -D stress-strain state of the <b>blades</b> <b>attachments</b> the following models have been used: 1. Initial model – a macro-model incorporating a disc sector and a blade with a shroud flange, damper links, and the attachment; 2. First-level submodel comprising a <b>blade</b> <b>attachment</b> and a disc sector; 3. Second-level submodel intended for correct determination of local stress fields in rivets. With the use of the method of multi-level submodeling on a submodel 717675 degrees of freedom, fields of local stresses and strains for the rivets have been obtained. To calculate the complete model without applying the method of multi-level submodeling, it would be necessary to solve a problem of 3 -D contact interaction with as many degrees of freedom as 1102743. As a result of the finite element simulation performed with due regard to the 3 -D multiple contact interaction of the blade tail and the disc, there have been revealed the areas where the equivalent, Mises stresses exceeded the yield strength. The practical recommendations have been worked out allowing reduction of the equivalent stresses in the mentioned areas.

The blades are also subjected to extreme variations in temperature during start-up and shutdown transients. The most prevalent HCF failure modes observed in these blades during operation include crystallographic crack initiation/propagation on octahedral planes, and noncrystallographic initiation with crystallographic growth. Numerous cases of crack initiation and crack propagation at the blade leading edge tip, <b>blade</b> <b>attachment</b> regions, and damper contact locations have been documented. Understanding crack initiation/propagation under mixed-mode loading conditions is critical for establishing a systematic procedure for evaluating HCF life of single crystal turbine blades. This paper presents analytical and numerical techniques for evaluating two and three dimensional subsurface stress fields in anisotropic contacts. The subsurface stress results are required for evaluating contact fatigue life at damper contacts and dovetail attachment regions in single crystal nickel-base superalloy turbine blades. An analytical procedure is, presented, for evaluating the subsurface stresses in the elastic half-space, using a complex potential method outlined by Lekhnitskii.
