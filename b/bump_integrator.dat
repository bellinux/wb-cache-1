Comfort ability refers {{to the degree of}} protection offered to vehicle occupants from uneven elements in the road surface. So, it is preferable to have a lower roughness index value for a better riding quality of road users. Roughness is generally defined as an expression of irregularities in the pavement surface which can be measured using different equipments like MERLIN, <b>Bump</b> <b>integrator,</b> Profilometer etc. Among them <b>Bump</b> <b>Integrator</b> is quite simple and less time consuming in case of long road sections. A case study is conducted on low volume roads in West District in Tripura to determine roughness index (RI) using <b>Bump</b> <b>Integrator</b> at the standard speed of 32 km/h. But it becomes too tough to maintain the requisite standard speed throughout the road section. The speed of <b>Bump</b> <b>Integrator</b> (BI) has to lower or higher in some distinctive situations. So, it becomes necessary to convert these roughness index values of other speeds to the standard speed of 32 km/h. This paper highlights on that roughness index conversional model. Using SPSS (Statistical Package of Social Sciences) software a generalized equation is derived among the RI value at standard speed of 32 km/h and RI value at other speed conditions...|$|E
40|$|Response-type road {{roughness}} measuring {{systems are}} widely used for collecting roughness data of pavement in many countries. These systems estimate IRI from correlation equations of IRI with other variables and help collect roughness data {{in a short time}} comparing to many Class I and Class II devices. Although they produce roughness data rapidly, most of them still have the restrictions in survey speed. It is recommended to maintain the survey speed within a certain range or at constant speed. But maintaining the speed within a certain range is quite difficult due to the existence of traffic control devices and the friction with other vehicles. Therefore, these systems can produce a significant bias in roughness measurement if the survey speed is not properly maintained. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a calibration equation that eliminates the bias produced by speed constraints and allows any survey speed. A simplified procedure that produces a regression relationship for IRI with <b>bump</b> <b>integrator</b> reading and survey speed as explanatory variables is developed using ROMDAS <b>bump</b> <b>integrator.</b> Moreover, this study investigates how the bias created by speed fluctuation affects the outcome and demonstrates how alternative method eliminates that bias using a case study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRoughness {{has been}} universally {{accepted}} {{as a measure of}} functional condition of a pavement. It constitutes the smoothness and frictional properties of the pavement surface and in turn is related to the safety, and the ease of the driving path. It is determined using the international roughness index (IRI), which is a measure for texture of the pavement surface, and also depends on the amount of other functional distresses present on the road surface. The present study focuses on developing a relationship between the roughness and other surface distresses of PMGSY roads. Accordingly, eight PMGSY roads were selected in Jhunjhunu and Churu districts of Rajasthan, India. Distress data was collected for every 50 m separately. Roughness data was collected using <b>Bump</b> <b>Integrator,</b> which was calibrated using MERLIN on the couple of selected study stretches. Unevenness data was also collected from a newly laid stretch of pavement, and the value thus obtained was subtracted from the observed unevenness values of the test stretches, to get the net effect of the distresses on the pavement condition. A regression equation was then developed with the IRI value and the visible distresses based on the data collected in the field...|$|E

Numbers of newly asphalt overlaid roads in various parts of Sri Lanka were surveyed using Vehicle Mounted Bump Integrators and corresponding International Roughness Indices (IRI) were derived. The change of roughness for a short period was also observed. Asphalt overlaid roads with various undulations were surveyed for roughness with <b>Bump</b> <b>Integrator</b> (BI) and the same locations were run with straight edge to measure bump and dip. Smoothness specifications which are currently in use in other countries are taken into consideration. The outcome of roads of those countries as a result of setting a smoothness target is also discussed. This study revealed that it is practical to set an initial roughness value in terms of IRI when the roughness is measured with B a n d the roughness does not change drastically in a short period. Also, it is revealed that the maximum tolerance of surface regularity given the SSCM published in 1989 results a higher IRI value. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe United States and European {{countries}} are increasingly using “warm-mix” technologies that allow {{a significant reduction}} in the production and placement temperatures of asphalt mixes. Such mixes are also gaining popularity {{in other parts of the}} world in countries like China, Brazil and India. Though warm-mix asphalt (WMA) is a relatively new technology, contractors and Government agencies in the West have been quick to recognize the environmental and performance benefits of warm- mixes due to extensive research. This research has also allowed several Government agencies, such as the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), to promote WMA as an important technological innovation for the industry. Many agencies have developed specifications for the use of WMA, which allows more contractors to use WMA. In India, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) has carried out initial research on the effects of WMA on Indian mixes. Certain warm-mix technologies have since been used to pave major national and state highways as well. However, lack of awareness and skepticism of field performance is shying more contractors and agencies from using WMA extensively as in the West. This paper attempts to evaluate the field performance of two pavements constructed using an IRC accredited surfactant based chemical warm-mix technology. The two pavements evaluated in this study were produced and placed at a significantly lower temperature relative to the control hot-mix sections. Both the pavements were evaluated after considerable exposure to weather elements and traffic. Methods like Benkelman beam deflection, <b>bump</b> <b>integrator</b> value, and Marshall stability, resilient modulus and static creep test on field cores were used to evaluate the performance of the WMA sections in comparison to the control hot-mix sections. The results of the study indicate that in spite of the several monsoons and heavy traffic both pavements were exposed to, the performance of the warm-mix sections was equal or better compared to the control hot-mix sections. Due to the improved densities achieved at the site, and due to the reduced oxidation of the bitumen as a result of the lower production and placement temperatures, the performance of the warm-mix seemed to be improved in terms of permanent deformation and resilient modulus...|$|E
