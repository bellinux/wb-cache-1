5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before <b>Bobby</b> <b>was</b> born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that <b>Bobby</b> <b>was</b> conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

500|$|In the 1897 season, Peel was {{suspended}} by Yorkshire for drunkenness. Alcohol was popular with many professional cricketers, and {{the careers of}} several Yorkshire players in this period, including Peate, had been ended for this reason. Peel was always {{known to be a}} heavy drinker, but his behaviour had been tolerated. His fame, brought about by his performances, made the problem worse. Derek Hodgson, in the official Yorkshire club history, writes: [...] "A cheerful, gregarious man, [...] took to hospitality and entertaining with alacrity and moved in such society, particularly in London, that when one of the foremost journalists of the day asked to see him he was fobbed off by a man who announced himself as 'Peel's secretary', adding: 'He does not like interviews and has little to say. He sent me to take his place.'" [...] Hodgson observes: [...] "It is not impossible, of course, that <b>Bobby</b> <b>was</b> either shy, or 'indisposed' at that particular moment", and suggests that Peel's downfall, like Peate's before him, was because he [...] "was too often the toast of the town".|$|E

Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place. Yet, he won the [...] for his immortal game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it [...] "The Game of the Century", writing: [...] "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of [...] play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies". According to Frank Brady, The Game of the Century' has been talked about, analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and it will probably {{be a part of the}} canon of chess for many years to come."
