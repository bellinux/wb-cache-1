5000|$|Barry removes Wally from {{immediate}} danger, {{telling him}} that he was there to return Thawne to his proper place in time; no matter how bad it seems, Wally can win if he pushes himself. He and Thawne then disappear. An enraged Zoom begins running around the world, building up speed to kill Linda by colliding with her. Although Wally rushes to catch up, he is a step or two behind. At the last minute he puts on a final burst of speed, pushing himself and hitting Zoom in the <b>back.</b> <b>Zoom</b> falls forward, caught in his self-created sonic boom and taking the brunt of its force. This creates a [...] "fissure in time", preventing Linda's miscarriage in time for her to give birth in the present. Zoom runs to the treadmill, but Wally forces them back to their (mutual) present. Along the way, they see scenes from Zoom's life. Zoom recognizes his mistreatment of Wally, and apologizes before slipping into the timestream; he is later seen as a ghostly figure, apologizing to Ashley.|$|E

At {{the top of}} the image is the camera's view; the cubes stay {{the same size as the}} teapots in the background grow bigger. At the bottom of the image is a plan view showing the camera moving <b>back</b> while <b>zooming</b> in, illustrating how the effect is achieved.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Tracking natural {{features}} to scroll and zoom a map. Moving {{side to side}} scrolls the map. Pulling <b>back</b> <b>zooms</b> out. We present a three degree-of-freedom control designed for viewing large documents and images on a mobile device equipped with a camera. Tracking natural features detected in the camera’s field of view, we can roughly estimate {{the motion of the}} device, using the results to scroll and zoom the current document. Central to our implementation is the manner by which we amplify the motion, allowing the user to scroll through large portions of the document with minimal hand movement. Then, using a Hidden Markov Model, we determine when the user is scrolling, zooming, or some combination of the two, thus providing smoother, more fluid control. We demonstrate a prototype of our 3 DOF control that can easily navigate documents that are many times larger than the display area, and show how it might be incorporated into a larger document retrieval application...|$|R
5000|$|To The Moon and Beyond is {{the title}} of a special motion picture {{produced}} for and shown at the 1964/1965 New York World's Fair. It depicted traveling from Earth out to an overall view of the universe and <b>back</b> again, <b>zooming</b> down to the atomic scale. It was filmed in a Cinerama process using a camera with a single fisheye lens and projected onto a dome screen.|$|R
50|$|As the Cylon and Galactica fleets {{prepare for}} battle, the camera zooms out (to show the entire galaxy), and <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> {{into a nearby}} section of the galaxy to show a single planet: Earth.|$|R
5000|$|Zoom is {{pursued by}} the Justice Society of America to Atlanta. Although Damage is banned from the city, he enters in search of revenge. During a scuffle, he takes Zoom hostage until he is talked down by Liberty Belle. Disappointed that Damage is not [...] "improving", Zoom throws a sharp pipe to kill him. Liberty Belle uses her superspeed to catch it and throw it <b>back,</b> {{knocking}} <b>Zoom</b> unconscious.|$|R
50|$|During levels {{the game}} changes from a side-scrolling beat em {{up into a}} {{platform}} game as the camera zooms to a far-away view {{of the characters in}} miniature. Later it <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> in for the much larger and more detailed characters to continue the brawling.|$|R
50|$|The film {{starts with}} an aerial {{image of a}} boy rowing with his dog in a boat on the Ottawa River. The {{movement}} then freezes and the view slowly zooms out, revealing more of the landscape all the time. The continuous zoom-out takes the viewer on a journey from Earth, past the Moon, the planets of the Solar System, the Milky Way {{and out into the}} far reaches of the known universe. The process is then reversed, and the view <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> through space to Earth, returning to the boy on the boat. It then zooms in to the back of the boy's hand, where a mosquito is resting. It zooms into the insect's proboscis and on into the microscopic world, concluding at the level of an atomic nucleus. It then <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> out to the original view of the boy on the boat.|$|R
5000|$|Don Shewey {{noted that}} the musical [...] "departs from any kind of {{traditional}} book musical structure. Charlotte's tale emerges in vignettes that flicker and flash, <b>zooming</b> <b>back</b> and forth in time, held together by a narrative thread as tenuous as her nonsmoking sanity." [...] Further, the music is [...] "eclectic" [...] and includes [...] "Latin, jazz, rock, there's pure urban noise." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zoom lenses (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "true" [...] zoom) are ideally parfocal in that focus is maintained as the lens is zoomed (focal length and magnification changed), which not only is convenient, but also {{has the advantage of}} allowing more accurate focusing at maximal focal length and then <b>zooming</b> <b>back</b> to a shorter focal length to compose the image.|$|R
50|$|The {{treadmill}} last appeared— rebuilt by Zoom and unwillingly {{powered by}} Jay Garrick— during the Rogue War storyarc featured in Flash #220-225. Zoom (Zolomon) {{used it in}} order to bring Professor <b>Zoom</b> (Thawne) <b>back</b> from the future. Wally was assisted by Barry Allen, who took Professor <b>Zoom</b> <b>back</b> to his rightful place in the timeline. The treadmill was seemingly destroyed during the fight between Zoom and Wally.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the revised}} {{transcript}} {{of a conversation}} between Darko Suvin [DS] and Federico Pianzola [FP]. The topics discussed are many and the focus keeps <b>zooming</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth from the}} historical context of humanities vs. resurgent fascism to formal remarks on literature, theatre, utopia, narrative, and other themes. Particular emphasis is given to a reflection on the dialectical and constructivist approach deployed by Suvin in his works...|$|R
50|$|New {{opening and}} closing titles were made to remove any {{references}} to the original studio because at the time, Warner Bros. {{did not want to}} be associated with television. Because of this, any Warner Bros. references in the cartoons themselves were also removed - such as in Porky in Wackyland, where the dodo zooms up with the WB Shield to hit Porky Pig with a slingshot, then <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> out.|$|R
50|$|In August 2010, Bing Maps added dynamic {{labels to}} its Silverlight {{experience}} (bing.com/maps/explore). Turn on the dynamic labels beta from the map style selector on bing.com/maps/explore and the labels become clickable. This {{allows users to}} quickly zoom down to a region or location anywhere on the map {{with just a few}} clicks. <b>Zooming</b> <b>back</b> out in a single click is also possible by using the ‘breadcrumb’ trail at the top left of the map.|$|R
5000|$|The in 2006 {{released}} version 2.0 introduced multiplayer play via LAN and Internet. Two {{players can}} also {{play on the}} same computer (Split screen). The chain reaction mode (where fallen bubbles will <b>zoom</b> <b>back</b> up to complete triplets, possibly causing more bubbles to fall and thus creating more combos) is also available in network mode as of Version 2.0, and greatly changes {{the mechanics of the}} game. Version 2.0 introduced artwork rendered with Blender.|$|R
5000|$|In the Season Three {{finale of}} the re-imagined series, Kara Thrace returns to Galactica after her {{apparent}} death, {{claiming to have}} been to Earth and intending to lead the fleet there. The camera then pans out from the fleet to view the Milky Way galaxy, and then <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> in to show Earth, confirming {{the existence of the}} planet. In the Season Four mid-season finale episode [...] "Revelations", the fleet finally reaches Earth, only to discover that it is a lifeless, radioactive wasteland.|$|R
5000|$|Steel's user {{interface}} (UI) {{is intended to}} be more [...] "touch friendly" [...] than that of Android's default browser, and thus emphasizes ease of use on a touch screen. <b>Back,</b> forward, <b>zoom,</b> and bookmark-related buttons are all on the bottom toolbar. A URL-entry box is on the top toolbar, and beside it is a refresh/stop button, which displays if a page is fully loaded or still loading, respectively. Both toolbars are only shown if [...] "pulled out" [...] by two semi-transparent handles at {{the top and bottom of}} the display, and after a short period of not being used will hide themselves again. Until 0.0.4, Android's status bar containing system information was only shown when the top toolbar was out. Starting in 0.0.4, it is either visible or not depending on whether the browser is set to run in fullscreen mode.|$|R
50|$|Instead, he sneaks {{out of his}} window, fuels up {{with high}} octane gas, then goes zooming all around town, spooking {{everything}} in his way. John chases after him, but can't seem to catch him, however, he gets his second wind when he sees Junior racing alongside a train, playing chicken with it. After another chase, John runs out of gas, right on the railroad track. Junior then <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> and pushes him off the tracks, only to wind up there himself when the train zooms by.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{another example}} of a match cut {{can be found in the}} final episode of the first season of David Lynch and Mark Frost's {{television}} show Twin Peaks. In the opening moments as Dr. Jacoby is struck down by a masked assailant and rolls over onto his <b>back,</b> the camera <b>zooms</b> in onto his eye which slowly fades away to a roulette wheel in One Eyed Jack's casino. This transition is a key moment in the episode as it connects two very different story lines together through a strategic cut.|$|R
5000|$|Workspaces are visualized in {{different}} ways. For example, on Linux computers using Compiz or Beryl with the Cube and Rotate Cube plugins enabled, each workspace is rendered as a {{face of an}} on-screen cube, and switching between workspaces is visualized by zooming out from the current face, rotating the cube to the new face, and <b>zooming</b> <b>back</b> in. On macOS, the old set of windows slides off the screen and the new set slides on. Window managers without [...] "eye candy" [...] often simply remove the old windows and display the new ones without any sort of intermediate effect.|$|R
50|$|Scamboli's robots {{are under}} both {{his and his}} {{daughter}} Marlene's command, {{and the lack of}} seniority in command structure is later evidenced when they <b>zoom</b> <b>back</b> and forth confused under conflicting commands from the two of them. They appear and are stupid, probably responsible for Marlene's stereotyping of robots, and a source of physical humour in the movie. Cab is a tall and lanky yellow robot, Rodo is a short red robot that resembles a porcupine. Pinocchio initially feels kinship with these two and begins to espouse how much more intelligent robots are with them, but then discovers that he is rather a unique case. Are based on the Fox and the Cat.|$|R
5000|$|On December 7, 1967 WFAA did {{a special}} episode on the Sump'n Else show called [...] "LSD: Insight or Insanity?." [...] The show {{featured}} psychedelic props and techniques {{along with a}} public service documentary {{on the dangers of}} the drug LSD. On January 22, 1968, the show broadcast a special episode called the [...] "Psychedelic Light Show" [...] because the set was redesigned to feature lighting props to change with the music being performed to. A rotating light globe and a mirror to reflect the back of the studio were used on this episode. As early as 1966, special [...] "psychedelic" [...] effects such as <b>zooming</b> <b>back</b> and forth on the band and go-go dancers had been used.|$|R
50|$|Brain Age {{also takes}} {{advantage}} of a strategy used in pen and paper Sudoku puzzles, in which the person marks which squares a number could possibly be by writing a miniature number. There are also four options at the player's disposal - Undo, Erase, Zoom Out, and Save & Quit. Undo allows the player to revert the latest change in the puzzle, Erase allows the player to erase everything in one square (alternatively, the player can circle just one number to erase it), Zoom Out is used to go <b>back</b> to a <b>zoomed</b> out view after the player has zoomed in on a square, and Save & Quit allows the player to do a quick save and quit the puzzle, which is erased once the player resumes.|$|R
5000|$|Like many of Disney's early CinemaScope films, a [...] "flat" [...] version shot in 4:3 {{ratio was}} made for theaters that were not {{equipped}} for CinemaScope. This required rearranging the artwork for some shots to accommodate the smaller screen. Shots of multiple repeated characters (like the bird chorus at the end, for instance) were cut in half, using two repetitions instead of four. The most notable change comes at {{the transition from the}} end of the [...] "Boom" [...] section to the parade that starts the finale. In the CinemaScope version, the background and characters fade out, leaving the drum in the last scene alone; the drum then jumps from the side of the screen to the centre, and the parade fades in. In the flat version, the camera zooms in on the drum, dissolving into the parade and <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> out.|$|R
2500|$|The 56th {{provided}} penetration {{support on}} 17 August 1943, for B-17s of the 4th Bomb Wing headed for Regensburg in the morning, returned to base to re-arm and re-fuel, and flew withdrawal {{support for the}} 1st Bomb Wing returning from Schweinfurt in the late afternoon. It scored its first major victory, penetrating [...] into Germany to break up frontal attacks on the bombers. The 56th used tactics it called [...] "dive, fire, and recover", attacking German fighters from a higher altitude, taking advantage of its tremendous diving speed, then <b>zooming</b> <b>back</b> to gain altitude advantage. In a running twenty-minute battle across Belgium, the 56th claimed 17 German fighters shot down (mainly of JG 3 and JG 26) for a loss of three P-47s and pilots. Three of those kills were made by Capt. Gerald W. Johnson of the 61st FS, who two days later (when the groups shot down 9 more) became the first ace in the group and the second in the ETO.|$|R
50|$|Barry chases after Zoom, and {{is joined}} by Wally, who tells Barry to push {{as hard as he}} can to break the time barrier. They reach Thawne, {{becoming}} the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris. As the two Flashes push <b>Zoom</b> <b>back</b> through time to the present, they see that the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne. Barry tosses him in and activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running. With the threat ended, everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general. Later, Barry closes the case on his mother's death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death. Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League, apologizing for being late.|$|R
40|$|It&# 039;s just {{basically}} {{some of my}} favourites that&# 039;s on here. I&# 039;m into the desert, I like Vincent Van Gogh very much, two funny cards, that&# 039;s what my best friend looks like, that&# 039;s exactly what he looks like. Take away the hat and that&# 039;s the exact spitting image of what he looks like. So in actual fact if you come <b>back</b> this way, <b>zoom</b> in on that, that {{is my best friend}} {{and as you can see}} the resemblance between him and Chef is quite staggering. That&# 039;s why I&# 039;ve called my bear Sal because he looks like him. And basically the rest of it I went to France in the World Cup, just the memorabilia, that which is round my neck there, because I write a lot I like to have a nice creative environment. So my favourite things around, nice pictures around, a nice environment that would inspire me or help me think (Mario, UK) ...|$|R
50|$|In some 3D {{video games}} the mini-map rotates when the player {{character}} or game camera faces different directions, {{to keep the}} top of the map always corresponding to forward from the cameras point of view, this is common for games in the Grand Theft Auto, and many racing games which show the track in a mini-map. Other games such as many in The Legend of Zelda series, the map does not rotate but features an arrow that moves about and rotates to show the position of the player character and the direction they're facing. In some games mini-maps that only show the close surrounding area often have icons on the edge to show the direction of locations or characters that are outside of the area shown on the map. Some games also have a feature where the mini-map zooms out when the player character is travelling at high speed, and <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> in when they slow down.|$|R
5000|$|A {{music video}} was also {{created for the}} song. The video begins with Bob Cock getting an order of nachos at an arcade, only to drop them after a {{collision}} with Larry LaLonde on a skateboard once outside. The rest of the video cuts between scenes of the band playing an out-of-control gig in a small club (Phoenix Theater), shots of the nachos being zoomed into, and race car footage. Some of the early race car footage was filmed at the Petaluma Speedway, {{a few blocks away}} from the Phoenix Theater. At the end, the camera zooms in on the cheese, and there is a claymation segment which features many of the creatures {{on the cover of the}} Sailing the Seas of Cheese album, then <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> out to the cheese, where a pit bull eats/sniffs it, closing the video. The band would return to claymation for the [...] "Southbound Pachyderm" [...] video years later.|$|R
5000|$|As usual, Wile E. Coyote (Hard-headipus ravenus) {{has gone}} {{in pursuit of}} The Road Runner (Speedipus Rex). The title shows just before the Coyote gains on the Road Runner. He lunges, leaping and {{grabbing}} his quarry by the throat. A two-second wrestling match follows, with both combatants in a round ball rolling {{down the road from}} the force of their running, but Wile E. emerges [...] "holding" [...] only a smoke outline of the bird. The confused coyote looks in his hands just as the Road Runner speeds up behind Wile E. He beeps, sending the Coyote flying through the air and leaves him hanging on a telephone pole. When he slides back down, the Road Runner beeps again, sending not only Wile E. in the air, but also the telephone pole, which escapes Wile E.'s grip. He then looks relieved, but because of the power lines, the pole <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> to Wile E. and drives him into the ground. He then comes out of a nearby manhole, flattened and humiliated. Of course, there is nothing left to do but plan more schemes.|$|R

It scored its first major victory, penetrating fifteen miles (24 km) into Germany to break up frontal attacks on the bombers.

5000|$|The video {{opens with}} a boy {{by the name of}} 'Max' (holding up a bottle of pills that says [...] "TRUTHOGEN"), who turns on the {{television}} showing the band in a dark room with about 200 dark blue TVs. The music starts playing and the TV shows dancers including soldiers, pink haired women and women in raincoats. When the chorus starts to come in, the lead singer (Jon, wearing a top-hat) starts looking happy and the dancers start to dance. The breakdown comes the camera (screen) zooms out of the TV and shows the boy watching the TV. The camera <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> in and the dancers are dancing again. Jon is then seen without a microphone stand (just a microphone) looking excited about something and the bassist Peter doing backup video. When the video ends, the dancers run in on the band and pick them up. They begin throwing the band members around. Jon takes off his hat and throws it. The band disappears and the boy turns the TV off.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} for blurred image restoration is presented. Our algorithm is based on human vision which <b>zooms</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth in the}} image in order to identify global structures or details. Deconvolution parameters are estimated by an edge detection and correspond to the ones of a chosen edge detection model. The segmentation is obtained by merging multiscale information provided by multiscale edge detection. The edge detection is achieved by using a derivative approach following a generalization of Canny-Deriche ﬁltering. This multiscale analysis performs an efﬁcient edge detection in noisy blurred images. The merging leads to the best local representation of edge information across scales. The algorithm deals with a mixed (coarse-to-ﬁne/ﬁne-to-coarse) approach and searches for candidate edge points through the scales. Edge characteristics are estimated by the merging algorithm for the chosen model. Scale, direction and amplitude informations allow a local deconvolution of the original image. The noise problem is not considered in this work since it does not disturb the process. Results show that this method allows non-uniformly blurred image restoration. An implementation of the whole algorithm in an intelligent camera (DSP) has been performed...|$|R
40|$|Competent social organisms {{will read}} the social signals of their peers. In primates, the face has evolved to {{transmit}} the organism’s internal emotional state. Adaptive action {{suggests that the}} brain of the receiver has co-evolved to efficiently decode expression signals. Here, we review and integrate the evidence for this hypothesis. With a computational approach, we co-examined facial expressions as signals for data transmission and the brain as receiver and decoder of these signals. First, we show in a model observer that facial expressions form a lowly correlated signal set. Second, using time-resolved EEG data, we show how the brain uses spatial frequency information impinging on the retina to decorrelate expression categories. Between 140 to 200 ms following stimulus onset, independently in {{the left and right}} hemispheres, an information processing mechanism starts locally with encoding the eye, irrespective of expression, followed by a zooming out to processing the entire face, followed by a <b>zooming</b> <b>back</b> in to diagnostic features (e. g. the opened eyes in ‘‘fear’’, the mouth in ‘‘happy’’). A model categorizer demonstrates that at 200 ms, the left and right brain have represented enough information to predict behavioral categorization performance...|$|R

5000|$|All {{of these}} {{animated}} specials, from 1973 to 1992, {{began with a}} fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words [...] "A CBS Special Presentation" [...] were displayed in a colorful ITC Avant Garde typeface. The word [...] "SPECIAL", in all caps and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly <b>zoomed</b> <b>back</b> into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence {{was accompanied by a}} jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (believed to be edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama Hawaii Five-O, titled [...] "Call to Danger" [...] on the Capitol Records soundtrack LP). This opening sequence - presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director Lou Dorfsman (who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing William Golden following his death in 1959) - also appeared immediately before other CBS specials of the period (such as the annual presentations of the Miss USA pageant and the Kennedy Center Honors).|$|R
