It has been prepared to address the unique planning condition required for a modification of the original planning consent for the site which requires an increased land take for a proposed <b>bin</b> <b>store.</b> The site is in a location which can be considered to have moderate to high archaeological potential. Although much of the site had been truncated to level it for the ironworks buildings, substantial parts of it have been levelled up rather than down, which may have preserved intact any archaeology below the modern surface level. Preservation of palaeoenvironmental evidence may be enhanced by the damp setting, although possible contamination of the groundwater may counteract this.

40|$|Abstract—Histogramming {{is a tool}} {{commonly}} used in data analysis. Although its serial version is simple to implement, providing an efficient and scalable way to parallelize it can be challenging. This especially holds in case of platforms that contain one or several massively parallel devices like CUDA-capable GPUs due to issues with domain decomposition, use of global memory and similar. In this paper we compare two approaches for implementing general purpose histogramming on GPUs. The first algorithm is based on private copies of <b>bin</b> counters <b>stored</b> in shared memory for each block of threads. The second one uses the Thrust library to sort the input elements and then to search for upper bounds according to bin widths. For both algorithms we analyze how the speedup over the sequential version depends {{on the size of}} input collection, number of bins, and the type and distribution of input elements. We also implement overlapping of data transfers between host CPU and CUDA device with kernel execution. For both algorithms we analyze the pros and cons in detail. For example, privatization strategy can be up to 2 x faster than sort-search with realistic inputs, but can only support a limited number of bins. On the other hand, sort-search strategy has about 50 % higher speedup than privatization when we use characters as input and can support unlimited number of bins. Finally, we perform an exploration to determine the optimal algorithm depending on the characteristics and values of input parameters. I...|$|R
