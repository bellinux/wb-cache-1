50|$|Erysiphe cruciferarum is a fungal {{pathogen}} {{that belongs}} to the phylum Ascomycota. The pathogen overwinters in survival structures known as ascospores. The powdery mildew initially appears as white, powdery spots formed on leaf surfaces, shoots, and sometimes flowers or fruits. Over time, the spots spread over a larger area of leaves and stems. Eventually, leaves infected with powdery mildew may turn yellow in color and proceed to die or fall off. In some cases, fungal growth causes leaves to twist or distort in shape. Specifically, powdery mildew functions by decreasing the fruit production of plants. The ascospores survive on leaf material and cause it to fall onto the ground. Certain <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides,</b> such as Serenade or sulfur products, {{can be used on}} plants to inhibit powdery mildew infection.|$|E

Fusarium {{is among}} the most {{aggressive}} telluric fungi causing wilt and root rots in several vegetable crops. A new disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici was recorded in southern Tunisia in the "Cinquième Saison" farm, situated in Hammet Gabès during 2000 - 2001 crop season. It caused death of up to 90 % of tomato plants in some greenhouses. In the present research, the effect of 3 chemical and 4 <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> was tested in vitro on mycelial growth and in vivo on disease severity of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. Hymexazol, benomyl and manebe were used as chemical fungicides whereas four biological products, i. e. two based on Trichoderma harzianum, one on Bacillus subtilis and another one on Bacillus thuringiensis were also tested. Among the chemical fungicides which were used, hymexazol and benomyl were the most effective in vitro and inhibited mycelial growth up to 80 %. However, in vivo assays showed that only hymexazol was effective with a reduction in disease incidence of about 76 %. In vitro, the product based on B. thuringiensis entailed a mycelial growth inhibition of less than 20 %. This value is more than 75 % higher than what was obtained through the other <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> based on either T. harzianum or in B. subtilis. The efficacy of the latter 2 <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> was more important in vivo assays using inoculated tomato plants. Indeed, by the use of the product based on B. subtilis, the reduction of disease incidence exceeded 95 %.

40|$|Powdery mildew is an economically-important {{pathogen}} {{of grapes}} worldwide. This report details {{the findings of}} our annual powdery mildew fungicide trials on grapevine cultivar Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera). The trials were conducted at Herzog Ranch, near Courtland, California in 2009. Treatments were placed in five adjacent trials in the vineyard. Spraying commenced in mid April, shortly after a heavy rainfall event that likely promoted the release of powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) ascospores from overwintering chasmothecia. Spraying was completed in mid July and treatments were evaluated for disease incidence and severity on 21 July 2009, at about the beginning of veraison. Trial I consisted of IR- 4 -funded biofungicide research that focused on two products: caprylic acid (a novel control agent in current development) and Actinovate (a registered product containing the bacterium Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 106). Trials II-V included various fungicide products (either currently registered or {{in various stages of}} product development) including strobilurins, demethylase inhibitors, oils, and other materials. Spray frequencies varied from weekly applications to 21 day intervals. Temperatures were mild during much of the 2009 growing season, providing optimal conditions for the asexual reproduction and dispersal of powdery mildew. Risk index data was high from about mid-May {{through the rest of the}} evaluation period and the pathogen quickly colonized leaves. Disease pressure was higher than in similar trials conducted in 2007 or 2008. By mid-June, heavy to severe mildew was evident on untreated clusters. Treatment performances varied widely. <b>Biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> generally reduced disease severity, but were more effective when used in a combination program with synthetic materials. As a stand-alone product, caprylic acid was most effective when applied weekly at a concentration of 0. 3 % (v/v). At a concentration of 0. 5 % it consistently showed phytotoxic effects on berries. A few organic materials performed well, lowering disease severity to < 10 %: paraffinic oil + Foliar Supreme (sulfur + nutrient cocktail) and two types of fertilizers alternated with trifloxystrobin.

3000|$|Efficient bio-control {{strains of}} the genus Trichoderma are being {{developed}} as promising <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> and their weaponry for this function also includes secondary metabolites with potential applications as novel antibiotics (André & Monika 2010). They are well known producer of chitinolytic enzymes and used commercially {{as a source of}} these proteins. Additional interest in these enzymes is stimulated by the fact that chitinolytic strains of Trichoderma are among the most effective agents of biological control of plant diseases (Harman et al. 1993; Samuels 1996; Spiegel & Chet 1998; Kubicek et al. 2001; Viterbo et al. 2002; Benitez et al. 2004; Navazio et al. 2007; Goswami et al. 2008; Vinale et al. 2009; Karlsson et al. 2010). Chitinases are chitin-degrading enzymes that hydrolyze the β - 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds between the N-acetyl glucosamine residues of chitin and are widely distributed in nature (Kitamura & Kamei 2003). Trichoderma chitinases belong to the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 and can be further grouped into class III and class V. Many chitinase genes from Trichoderma have been studied and several laboratories around the world are applying these genes to a variety of bio-control strategies and studying the mechanism of fungal antagonism and mycoparasitism (Markovich & Kononova 2003; Duo-Chuan 2006). For the evaluation of chitinases, insoluble substrates such as tritiated solid chitin, colloidal chitin or chitin covalently coupled to different dyes (chitin red, chitin-azure) can be used. In accordance with the substrate used, the assays are radiometric or photometric. A typical method to evaluate chitinases involves colorimetric quantification (Monreal & Reese 1969) which is time-consuming, less sensitive and not easily applicable to identify poor-chitinolytic microbial strains. Therefore, more simple and rapid assays like colloidal chitin (major carbon source) supplemented in solid basal media resulting in clear halo of chitin-digestion and of the microbial colonies which are measures of the chitinase activity Rojas Avelizapa et al. (2001) are used. However, this method also has a low sensitivity and its results depend on concentration and size of the particles of colloidal chitin, thickness of the media and amount and kind of inoculums. More sensitive techniques require more expensive substrates, which are suitable to study specificity of chitinases more than to select chitinolytic strains (O’Brien & Collwell 1987; McCreath & Gooday 1992; Fra¨ndberg & Schnu¨rer 1994; Barboza Corona et al. 1999). Agrawal and Kotasthane (Agrawal & Kotasthane 2009) proposed a sensitive, easy, reproducible and economic option to determine chitinases (available via Dialog, [URL] [...]) which was also followed by Kamala and IndiraDevi (Kamala & IndiraDevi 2011; Kamala & IndiraDevi 2012) to evaluate the chitinolytic properties of Trichoderma isolates from Manipur (North-East India) against Pythium aphanidermatum, Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani.|$|E

The results showed that adjuvants did not significantly influence <b>biological</b> efficacy of <b>fungicide</b> treatments against L. biglobosa and L. maculans. Generally, control of both pathogens on the leaves and stem did not depend on spray characteristics (nozzle types-droplet size). However, positive effect of air induction nozzles DB 11002 (course spray quality) on fungicide treatments against L. biglobosa, particularly with addition of adjuvant Atpolan 80 EC was observed. Two different volumes of water tested (200 and 400 l/ha) did not influence efficacy of metconazole in control L. maculans and L. biglobosa. The above suggests a possibility of decrease the volume of water used with fungicide to 200 l/ha, without a negative biological effects on fungicidal activity...|$|R

Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG- 3 (teleomorph Thanatephorus cucumeris [Frank] Donk), this desease is favoured by the capacity of fungus to survive in soil as sclerotia and mycelium in plant debris for long periods, and environmental conditions of low soil temperature and high soil moisture.

40|$|Bacillus subtilis are gram-positive {{bacteria}} that occur globally in soil, water, air, and decomposing plant material. The Bacillus bacteria are responsive to genetic alterations, {{and a large}} number of bacteria strains are part of the Bacillus genus. Some of the Bacillus bacteria strains have acquired genes for pathogenic toxins, but available techniques exist to identify and discriminate between the different strains. Bacillus subtilis has been used for industrial enzyme and food production, and even as a probiotic to treat gastro intestinal tract symptoms and disorders, including diarrhoea in infants and young children. Bacillus subtilis has been shown to act fungistatic and fungitoxic following contact with fungal pathogens at leaf or root surfaces, and may therefore be used as a <b>biological</b> <b>fungicide</b> in different crops. The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (Vitenskapskomiteen for mattrygghet, VKM) has been asked by The Norwegian Agency for Food safety to assess the health and environment related aspects related {{to the use of the}} plant protection product Serenade ASO, containing the active ingredient Bacillus subtilis QST 713. VKM has considered the data presented for the Bacillus subtilus strain QST 713, and shares the opinion of EFSA, and also US Environmental Protection Agency, in that Bacillus subtilis “is considered a benign organism as it does not possess traits that cause disease. It is not considered pathogenic or toxigenic to humans, animals, or plants. ” Bacillus subtilis is ubiquitously present in water, air and soil, also in Norway, and subject to competition by other indigenous microorganisms. Thus, the number of introduced Bacillus subtilis will rapidly decline and reach a natural equilibrium in nature. Bacillus subtilis show low or acceptable toxicity in terrestrial and aquatic non-target organisms. Effects on nontarget micro-organisms cannot be excluded, but are not expected to adversely affect natural microbial communities. The possible risk related to Bacillus subtilis is linked to the possibility of miss-identifying a toxic Bacillus strain such as Bacillus anthracis or Bacillus cereus for Bacillus subtilis. Thus, VKM emphasizes the importance of product control, to ensure and document the identity, purity and relevant contents and property of each product batch prior to marketing and use. Bacillus subtilis is not known to produce toxins, but produce proteolytic enzymes considered to be responsible for effects observed in inhalation experiments. Thus, proper preventive equipment should be used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{challenge}} {{faced by}} New Zealand’s fruit, vegetable and arable sectors {{is to reduce}} the negative impacts of fungicides on market access, environmental sustainability and consumer confidence, {{while at the same time}} achieving adequate disease control for export market and international regulatory requirements. Controlling diseases in a humid climate with ever increasing restrictions on agrichemicals and few effective alternatives to fungicides requires re-design of disease management systems. Research into re-design includes improved resistance of crop cultivars, improved understanding of microbial interactions between <b>fungicides,</b> <b>biological</b> controls and non-target microbes and completely novel methods based on molecular genetics. Disease forecasting systems can improve the efficiency of fungicide use. The success of new approaches must measured by a reduction in fungicide loading. Success depends on the linking of new research to effective technology transfer that will give crop-based industries courage to try new methods and the confidence to know they are not risking their economic viability...|$|R
50|$|The {{benefits}} of using <b>biological</b> controls and <b>fungicides</b> have been explored {{in the management}} of P. cinnamomi. Fifteen native Western Australian legumes were tested for their effectiveness as biological control agents against the pathogen. Five species showed high potential and by manipulating rehabilitation seed mix ratios could be used to suppress the pathogen. The fungicide phosphite {{has been found to be}} effective treatment against P. cinnamomi, especially when applied before a plant is infected. The fungicide can be applied after infection, however the greater the time between infection and treatment, the less effective it will be. It is difficult to estimate the cost of plant disease in conservation areas; loss of conservation values cannot be given monetary value. However, the cost of controlling the disease can. It was estimated that the control of P. cinnamomi in 1989 cost the Western Australian Government at least $3.4 million. Disease management plans focus on minimising the spread of the mould by restricting movement of propagules in soil and by translocating plant species from infected sites to healthy sites.|$|R
5000|$|Infections {{of seeds}} and roots are {{initiated}} {{by both the}} mycelia and spores of Py. ultimum. Two spore types are made, depending on the strain. Py. ultimum is a species complex that includes var. ultimum and var. sporangiiferum. [...] The major distinguishing feature is that sporangia and zoospores (swimming spores) are produced only rarely by Py. ultimum var. ultimum. Both species make oospores, which are thick-walled structures produced by sexual recombination. Both species are self-fertile (homothallic), which means that a single strain can mate with itself. In addition to oospores, Py. ultimum var. ultimum also makes hyphal swellings which germinate in a manner resembling sporangia to form plant-infecting hyphae. One important ecological difference between {{the different types of}} spores is that sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, while the thick-walled oospores can persist for years within soil, surviving even winter freezes. Mycelia and oospores in soil can infect seeds or roots. This leads to wilting, reduced yield, and ultimately plant death. Common signs of a Pythium infection include stunting of the plants, brown coloration of root-tips, and wilting of the plant during the warm part of the day. Management of disease is challenging but focuses on sanitation, <b>fungicides,</b> and <b>biological</b> control. <b>Fungicides</b> include mefenoxam, thiadiazole, etridiazole, propamocarb, dimethomorph, and phosphonates. Biological control agents include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces griseoviridis, and the fungi Candida oleophila, Gliocladium catenulatum, Trichoderma harziamum, and Trichoderma virens. [...] Effective resistance in the plant host is generally not available. Sanitation is very important since the pathogen can be easily introduced into pasteurized soil or even soil-free potting mixes on dirty tools or pots. Especially in greenhouses, fungus gnats may also help move the pathogen from place to place.|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic fungus {{is one of}} the {{constraints}} to increase crop production. Chemical control using fungicides caused negative effects either to the environment or increased pathogen resistance to <b>fungicide.</b> <b>Biological</b> control using microbial-producing ß glucanase is an alternative method to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungus. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize ß- 1, 3 - 1, 4 -glucanase produced by rice endophytic bacterium, B. cepacia E 76. Purification was carried out by ammonium sulphate precipitation, dialysis, and ion exchange chromatography using DEAE sepharose Fast Flow. A further characteristic of the enzyme activity was studied using oatmeal-glucan substrate. Results showed that precipitation using saturated 80 % ammonium sulphate generated a good yield with the purity increased by 11 fold and yield of 66 %. After chromatography step, the ß- 1, 3 - 1, 4 -glucanase of B. cepacia was successfully purified with an increasedof purity up to 33 fold and yield of 4 %. Based on 10 % SDS-PAGE, the enzyme profiles had the molecular weight of 15, 48 and 55 kDa. Of the three isozymes, only the 48 kDa isozyme showed the strongest glucanase activity when grown on media containing glucan as substrate...|$|R
40|$|Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid is a soil-borne and seed-born {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} charcoal rot in soybean and 500 different plant species. Charcoal rot {{is one of}} the most destructive diseases of soybean in the United States. Little is known about the mechanisms governing the interaction between soybeans and M. phaseolina that result in charcoal rot development. The ability of M. phaseolina to cause charcoal rot may be associated with the production of the phytotoxin phaseolinone by the fungus. There are different methods suggested by previous works that can be used to control the disease such as irrigation, tillage, <b>biological</b> control, <b>fungicide</b> and plant resistance. However, none of these techniques were effective to completely combat the disease. The objective of our study was to find new tools and new ways of finding resistant lines of soybean to charcoal rot and to find some of the genes that we believe are involved in phaseolinone production. In my research I used a cDNA-AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) approach as a qualitative and quantitative tool to identify M. phaseolina genes involved in the production of phaseolinone. I also did an assay with the toxin extracted from the fungus on soybean plants. By using this toxin assay, I was able to screen for susceptible and resistant genotypes of soybean to M. phaseolina. Scientists have been trying for years to find the best way to combat the disease and to find some soybean varieties, which are resistant to this fungus. There are different technics that can be used to quantify the amount of pathogen in plant and screen for resistant lines. One of these methods to differentiate between soybean genotypes according to their reaction to M. phaseolina is colony-forming unit index (CFUI) and intensity of internal root and stem discoloration (Mengistu, Ray et al. 2007). I used q-PCR techniques as a faster and more efficient way to quantify the amount of fungus in soybean roots and detect the most resistant soybean lines to this pathogen...|$|R
30|$|Fusarium wilt is an {{economically}} important disease of cucumber {{caused by the}} fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (Foc). It causes severe losses in the yield and quality of cucumber and {{is extremely difficult to}} control conventionally using chemical <b>fungicides.</b> <b>Biological</b> control offers an eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticide for sustainable plant disease management. In this context, biocontrol activity of rhizosphere soil bacteria was investigated against Foc in vitro. Thirty-five rhizobacterial isolates were screened for antagonistic activity in dual culture, and isolate BA 5 showed the highest antagonistic activity (58.33 % mycelial growth inhibition) against Foc. Maximum fungal biomass reduction (90.20 %) was found in King’s B broth in shake flask culture. Cell-free culture filtrate and ethyl acetate crude extract inhibited mycelial growth of Foc by 56.66 and 25.0 %, respectively. Further, the selected isolate produced siderophores, volatile compound(s), hydrocyanic acid, and protease. Siderophores and volatile compound(s) were involved in the isolate-induced antagonism. In addition, the isolate exhibited several plant growth-promoting traits, including phosphate and zinc solubilization, ammonia production, organic acid production, and in vitro biofilm formation. Based on the morphological, physiological, biochemical characteristics, and phylogeny analysis, the isolate BA 5 was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the 16 S rDNA sequence was submitted in the NCBI GenBank under the strain name RKA 5. Because of the novel antifungal and plant growth promotion potentials, the strain {{can be used as a}} promising biocontrol agent against the fungal pathogen Foc.|$|R
