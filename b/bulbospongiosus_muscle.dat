40|$|The {{proximal}} {{urethral bulb}} in men is enlarged, surrounds the bulbous urethra, and extends dorsally towards the perineum. During intercourse engorgement takes place {{due to increased}} blood flow through the corpus spongiosum. Antegrade ejaculation is facilitated by contraction of the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> during climax. Micturition during sexual stimulation is functionally inhibited. Supporting the bulb may indirectly facilitate continence in a certain subset of patients with postprostatectomy incontinence. During physical activity with increased abdominal pressure, reflex contraction of the pelvic floor muscles {{as well as the}} <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> occurs to support sphincter function and limit urinary incontinence. Operations to the prostate may weaken urinary sphincter function. It is hypothesized that the distal urinary sphincter may be supported indirectly by placing a hammock underneath the urethral bulb. During moments of physical stress the “cushion” of blood within the supported corpus spongiosum helps to increase the zone of coaptation within the sphincteric (membranous) urethra. This may lead to urinary continence in patients treated by a transobturator repositioning sling in patients with postprostatectomy incontinence. This paper describes the possible role of the urethral bulb in male urinary continence, including its function after retroluminal sling placement (AdVance, AdVance XP® Male Sling System, Minnetonka, USA) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mondia whitei and Guibourtia tessmannii {{are used}} in Cameroon {{traditional}} medicine as aphrodisiacs. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the pro-ejaculatory effects of the aqueous and organic solvent extracts of these plants in spinal male rats. Methods In spinal cord transected and urethane-anesthetized rats, two electrodes where inserted into the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> and the ejaculatory motor pattern was recorded on a polygraph after urethral and penile stimulations, intravenous injection of saline (0. 1 [*]ml/ 100 [*]g), dopamine (0. 1 [*]μM/kg), aqueous and organic solvent plant extracts (20 [*]mg/kg). Results In all spinal rats, urethral and penile stimulations always induced the ejaculatory motor pattern. Aqueous or hexane extract of Mondia whitei (20 [*]mg/kg) prevented {{the expression of the}} ejaculatory motor pattern. The pro-ejaculatory effects of dopamine (0. 1 [*]μM/kg) were not abolished in spinal rats pre-treated with Mondia whitei extracts. Aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts of Guibourtia tessmannii (20 [*]mg/kg) induced fictive ejaculation characterized by rhythmic contractions of the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> followed sometimes with expulsion of seminal plugs. In rats pre-treated with haloperidol (0. 26 [*]μM/kg), no ejaculatory motor pattern was recorded after intravenous injection of Guibourtia tessmannii extracts (20 [*]mg/kg). Conclusion These results show that Mondia whitei possesses preventive effects on the expression of fictive ejaculation in spinal male rats, which is not mediated through dopaminergic pathway; on the contrary, the pro-ejaculatory activities of Guibourtia tessmannii require the integrity of dopaminergic system to exert its effects.

MethodsThe electromyographic activity of the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> was recorded in urethane anaesthetized, spinal cord transected rats receiving dopamine (0. 1 μmol/L/kg) intravenously, in the absence or presence of aqueous and methanolic extracts of B. engleriana (2. 5, 10, 50, 60, 75 mg/kg). In another experiment, the pro-ejaculatory effect of dopamine (0. 1 μmol/L/kg, i. v.) was monitored in rats orally pre-treated with the aqueous and methanolic extracts (60 mg/kg) of B. engleriana for 1 or 4 weeks. ResultsResults of the study showed that the intravenous administration of B. engleriana did not provoke any contraction of the ejaculatory muscles whilst rhythmic and rapid contractions of the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> accompanied sometimes by penis movement and expulsion of the urethral contents were recorded after dopamine application. The sequential treatment of animals with B. engleriana extracts (2. 5 - 75. 0 mg/kg) followed by dopamine (0. 1 μmol/L/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent abolishment of the pro-ejaculatory response due to dopamine. However, in animals orally submitted to a daily gavage with B. engleriana extracts (60 mg/kg) for 1 or 4 weeks, the ejaculation stimulating effect of dopamine (0. 1 μmol/L/kg) was significantly delayed (P< 0. 01) but not completely suppressed. ConclusionsPresent findings suggest the involvement of dopaminergic system in the activity of B. engleriana and further support its aphrodisiac potentials due to sterols and saponins revealed in this plant...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To {{assess the}} outcome of single stage dorsolateral onlay buccal mucosal urethroplasty for long {{anterior}} urethral strictures (> 4 cm long) using a perineal incision. Materials and Methods From August 2010 to August 2013, 20 patients underwent BMG urethroplasty. The cause of stricture was Lichen sclerosis in 12 cases (60 %), Instrumentation in 5 cases (25 %), and unknown in 3 cases (15 %). Strictures were approached through a perineal skin incision and penis was invaginated into it to access the entire urethra. All the grafts were placed dorsolaterally, preserving the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscle,</b> central tendon of perineum and one-sided attachement of corpus spongiosum. Procedure {{was considered to be}} failure if the patient required instrumentation postoperatively. Results Mean stricture length was 8. 5 cm (range 4 to 12 cm). Mean follow-up was 22. 7 months (range 12 to 36 months). Overall success rate was 85 %. There were 3 failures (meatal stenosis in 1, proximal stricture in 1 and whole length recurrent stricture in 1). Other complications included wound infection, urethrocutaneous fistula, brownish discharge per urethra and scrotal oedema.

5000|$|In the {{presence}} of mechanical stimulation, erection is initiated by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with minimal input from the central nervous system. Parasympathetic branches extend from the sacral plexus into the arteries supplying the erectile tissue; upon stimulation, these nerve branches release acetylcholine, which, in turn causes release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells in the trabecular arteries. Nitric oxide diffuses to the smooth muscle of the arteries (called trabecular smooth muscle), acting as a vasodilating agent. [...] The arteries dilate, filling the corpora spongiosum and cavernosa with blood. The ischiocavernosus and <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> also compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa, limiting the venous drainage of blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic stimulation is discontinued; baseline stimulation from the sympathetic division of the ANS causes constriction of the penile arteries, forcing blood out of the erectile tissue.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the course and}} variation of the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (DNC) to better define its anatomy in the human adult before embarking on therapeutic strategies in this region {{of the body and}} as an aid to surgeons to help avoid iatrogenic injury to the DNC during vaginal surgical procedures. Methods: Six human female cadavers of variable body weights were sectioned. A vertical midline incision {{from the base of the}} clitoris extending toward the direction of the umbilicus was made. The DNC was identified by dissecting out the fascia, fat, and muscles around it. The anatomy of the nerve was noted bilaterally. Results: Distally, the DNC pierced the perineal membrane lateral to the external urethral meatus. It traversed along the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscle</b> before traversing posterior to the crura. The DNC reappeared, hooking over the crura to lie on the anterolateral surface of the body of the clitoris, before dividing into 2 cords and terminat-ing short of the tip of the glans clitoris.

40|$|Complications of {{spinal cord}} injury in males include losing {{brainstem}} control of pudendal nerve–innervated perineal muscles involved in erection and ejaculation. We previously described, in adult male rats, a bulbospinal pathway originating in a discrete area within the medullary gigantocellularis (GiA/Gi), and lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) nuclei, which when electrically microstimulated unilaterally, produces a bilateral inhibition of pudendal motoneuron reflex circuitry after crossing to the contralateral spinal cord below T 8. Microstimulation following a long-term lateral hemisection, however, revealed reflex inhibition {{from both sides of}} the medulla, suggesting the development or unmasking of an injury-induced bulbospinal pathway crossing the midline cranial to the spinal lesion. In the present study, we investigated this pathway anatomically using the transsynaptic neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) injected unilaterally into the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscle</b> in uninjured controls, and ipsilateral to a chronic (1 – 2 months) unilateral lesion of the lateral funiculus. At 4. 75 days post-injection, PRV-labeled cells were found bilaterally in the GiA/Gi/LPGi with equal side-to-side labeling in uninjured controls, and with significantly greater labeling contralateral to the lesion/injection in lesioned animals. The finding of PRV-labeled neurons on both sides of the medulla after removing the mid-thoracic spinal pathway on one side provides anatomical evidence for the bilaterality in both the brainstem origin and the lumbosacral pudendal circuit termination of the spared lateral funicular bulbospinal pathway. This also suggests that this bilaterality may contribute to the quick functional recovery of bladder and sexual functions observed in animals and humans with lateral hemisection injury...|$|E

The 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonist (1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 Ro 600175 i. v.) evoked the characteristic bursting pattern responses in the VDN. The 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist (1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 8 -OH-DPAT i. v.) failed to elicit any responses. However, 8 -OH-DPAT coadministered in combination with Ro 600175 induced a potentiation of the responses. Responses were also evoked in rats with a mid-thoracic spinalisation, with a more predictable response being observed following the combination of agonists. This suggests an action of both agonists in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Responses were blocked by 0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 SB 206553 i. v. (5 -HT 2 B/C receptor antagonist) or 0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 WAY 100635 i. v. (5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist), but not 0. 1 or 1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 SB 269970 i. v. (5 -HT 7 receptor antagonist). We suggest that activation of 5 -HT 2 C and 5 -HT 1 A receptor subtypes synergistically elicits contraction of the vas deferens through the activation of sympathetic preganglionic neurones in the spinal cord. These data support the idea of a proejaculatory action of 5 -HT 2 C receptors in the lumbosacral spinal cord, suggesting a descending 5 -HT excitatory pathway in addition to a 5 -HT inhibitory pathway.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to find a minimal dose of 17 α-ethinyl estradiol (EE) that is detrimental to the developing penis and fertility and to compare estrogenic effects between EE and diethylstilbestrol (DES). Neonatal rats received EE at 10 ng (1 μg/kg), 100 ng, 1 μg, or 10 μg per pup on alternate days from postnatal days 1 to 11 (dose-response study) or received EE or DES at 100 ng per pup daily from postnatal days 1 to 6 (comparative study). Effects of EE were dose dependent, with ≥ 100 -ng dose inducing significant (p < 0. 05) reductions in penile length, weight, and diameter. Additionally, the penis was malformed, characterized by underdeveloped os penis and accumulation of fat cells. Fertility was 0 % in the ≥ 1 -μg groups, in contrast to 60 % in the 100 -ng group and 100 % in the 10 -ng and control groups. Animals treated with ≥ 10 ng had significant reductions in the weight of bulbospongious muscle, testis, seminal vesicle, epididymal fat pad, and in epididymal sperm numbers. A comparison of EE and DES effects showed similar reductions in penile weight and length and the weight of <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscle,</b> testis, seminal vesicle, epididymis, and epididymal fat pad in both adolescent and adult rats. While 5 / 6 control males sired, only 1 / 6 in the EE group and 0 / 6 in the DES group sired. Hence, neonatal exposure to EE at 10 ng (environmentally relevant dose) adversely affects male reproductive organs.

40|$|Urethral {{stricture}} {{disease is}} as old as mankind. In the old times urethral strictures were mainly associated with longstanding infectious disease (gonococcal urethritis) or trauma (Beard and Goodyear, 1948). Current stricture aetiology in the developed world is mainly iatrogenic, such as strictures after (traumatic) urethral catheterization or transurethral resection, and idiopathic (Fenton et al., 2005, Lumen et al., 2009). Besides the aetiology of strictures, also the armamentarium to treat them has evolved. Repeated dilatation or, in complicated cases, external urethrotomy or cystotomy were the only treatment options for centuries instead of leaving the disease on its natural evolution. Today, optic urethrotomy, anastomotic urethroplasty and substitution urethroplasty offer better functional results, better cosmesis and in the majority of patients a permanent solution to the disease. Urethral strictures most frequently occur at the bulbar urethra (Lumen et al., 2009, Fenton et al., 2005, Meeks et al., 2009, Andrich and Mundy, 2008, Santucci et al., 2007). This is the part of the urethra that is surrounded by the corpus spongiosum and the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscle.</b> When a bulbar stricture is encountered {{for the first time in}} a patient, a direct vision internal urethrotomy can be offered. This may be curative for short strictures in about half of the patients treated. Previous urethrotomy/dilatation or direct vision internal urethrotomy in longer strictures reduces success rates to almost zero (Pansadoro and Emiliozzi, 1996, Steenkamp et al., 1997). This does not mean that the patient cannot be managed this way, but the treatment is palliative in nature and repeat treatments or intermittent self catheterization will be mandatory to maintain patency. When these patients want to be cured from their stricture disease, an operative approach has to be offered. It is probably better to offer this approach sooner than later. From a surgical point of view, less spongiofibrosis will be found and from an economical point of view, early surgery is probably more cost effective (Rourke and Jordan, 2005, Greenwell et al., 2004, Andrich and Mundy, 2008, Wright et al., 2006). The operative approach can essentially be divided in anastomotic and substitution urethroplasties. In the first, a tension free, spatulated anastomosis is the key to success. This technique is generally advocated for shorter strictures that can be excised completely. It is assumed that results from end-to-end anastomotic urethroplasty are superior to substitution urethroplasty. This believe is partially based on intuition: excision of the diseased urethra and subsequent restoration of the continuity using healthy ends ‘has to be better’ then leaving the diseased urethra in place and augmenting it with another tissue. However, the evidence to support this believe is not solid (Meeks et al., 2009, Andrich et al., 2003). In a substitution urethroplasty, the urethral lumen calibre is restored using flaps (derived from scrotal or penile skin, tunica vaginalis,…) or grafts (skin, buccal mucosa, lingual mucosa, small intestinal submucosa,…) (Mangera et al.). This technique has become more widespread after the introduction of buccal mucosa as a free graft. Buccal mucosa offers a relatively resilient and easy to handle graft, rendering this surgery more accessible. In the following chapter we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of buccal mucosa free graft in the treatment of bulbar urethral stricture disease. We will not only focus on success as defined by absence of stricture recurrence but also on functional results and patient reported outcomes. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|Another {{role that}} the {{parasympathetic}} nervous system plays is in sexual activity. In males, the cavernous nerves from the prostatic plexus stimulate smooth muscles in the fibrous trabeculae of the coiled helicene arteries to relax and allow blood to fill the corpora cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum of the penis, making it rigid to prepare for sexual activity. Upon emission of ejaculate, the sympathetics participate and cause peristalsis of the ductus deferens and closure of the internal urethral sphincter to prevent semen from entering the bladder. At the same time, parasympathetics cause peristalsis of the urethral muscle, and the pudendal nerve causes contraction of the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> (skeletal <b>muscle</b> is not via PN), to forcibly emit the semen. During remission the penis becomes flaccid again. In the female, there is erectile tissue analogous to the male yet less substantial that plays {{a large role in}} sexual stimulation. The PN cause release of secretions in the female that decrease friction. Also in the female, the parasympathetics innervate the fallopian tubes, which helps peristaltic contractions and movement of the oocyte to the uterus for implantation. The secretions from the female genital tract aid in sperm migration. The PN (and SN to a lesser extent) {{play a significant role in}} reproduction.|$|R

Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were also {{implanted in the}} ischiocavernosus (IC) <b>muscles</b> and <b>bulbospongiosus</b> (BS) <b>muscles</b> to monitor their activity. During coitus the mean peak CSP pressure was 1031 mm Hg and this peak occurred during the ejaculatory thrust immediately after the peak corpus cavernosum penis pressure. Anesthesia of the SS muscles significantly reduced the peak CSP pressures of the coital period; however, it did not change the normal, precoital, and postcoital pressures. The EMG activity of the BS muscles was in phase with CSP pressure peaks. A comparative study of the mechanism of erection and ejaculation in domestic animals has been conducted at this laboratory. The peak corpus cavernosum penis (CCP) pres-sure of coitus has been reported for the goat (Beckett et a!., 1972), stallion (Beckett el a!., 1973), and bull (Beckett et a!., 1974). The magnitude of the corpus spongiosum penis (CSP) pressure associated with coitus and movement of semen down the urethra {{at the time of}} ejaculation has not been determined. Watson (1964) reported from anatomical studies of the bull and ram that the CSP pressure produced by contraction of the bul-bospongiosus (BS) muscles would be trans-mitted across the urethral wall to move the semen down the urethra during ejaculation. Hart (1972) and Hart and Kitchell (1966) reported from studies of the electromyo-graphic (EMO) activity that the action of the BS muscles in the dog was consistent with the idea that they aid in the expulsion of the seminal fluid during ejaculation. Recordings by Kollberg eta!. (1963) of the EMG’s of the BS muscles in man showed that erection can occur without participation of these muscles...|$|R

For many years, the role of testosterone has been perceived {{to play a role in}} the development of prostate cancer and certain cardiovascular diseases (Jones et al., 2013); with its general therapeutic roles being much overlooked. Much of this unprecedented assumption was based upon clinical observations showing the benefit of androgen deprivation in prostate cancer patients, and the perceived reports of higher cardiovascular death amongst people abusing steroid therapies (Jones et al., 2013; Basaria et al., 2010). However, there has been compelling evidence that suggests that testosterone administration within physiological ranges does not contribute to prostate cancer or the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (Morgentaler et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2013; Traish et al., 2009). Recent evidence actually suggests the protective role of androgens in the management of metabolic conditions, such as: obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type- 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (Traish et al., 2009; Morgentaler et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2000). Erectile dysfunction, which is a type of endothelial dysfunction disorder, is defined as the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual performance, and it affects an estimated 30 million American men between the ages of 40 to 70 years old, and this prevalence increases with age (Nehra A, 2007; Barkin J, 2011; Guay A, 2007). The male human erection involves a multifactorial interplay between various mechanisms within the body; encompassing psychological, vascular, neural and endocrine factors (Dean et al., 2005; Castela et al, 2011). The human erection involves the increased inflow of blood into the penile arteries, and the subsequent veno-occlusion, all of which occurs at a perfectly orchestrated hormonal environment (Bivalacqua et al, 1998; Castela et al., 2011). Nitric oxide is released from the endothelium, which dilates penile arteries and relaxes the penile smooth muscles, causing the corpora cavernosa of the penis to fill with blood; the ischiocavernosus and <b>bulbospongiosus</b> <b>muscles</b> then compress the veins, which restricts the egress of blood (Bivalacqua et al, 1998; Castela et al., 2011). Nitric oxide increases cGMP, which decreases intracellular calcium uptake, and increases K+ efflux; these all cause a smooth muscle cell relaxation. The decreased venous outflow from the penis helps maintain erection. In addition to nitric oxide, several other mechanisms are involved in the erectile response. The endothelium, which regulates vascular tone and blood flow, is responsible for the cholinergic smooth muscle relaxation observed by the addition of acetylcholine (Furchgott et al., 1983). Chamness et al. (1995) have shown that androgen differentially affects nitric oxide synthase activity in the male reproductive tract endothelium. Thus, the role of androgens, namely testosterone, is of importance in maintaining erectile function. In addition to affecting nitric oxide synthase activity, testosterone is also shown to affect erectile physiology in many more ways, including its role in activating K+ channels to increase the efflux or inhibit calcium channels via hyperpolarization (Yildiz et al., 2009), and even increasing arterial blood flow to the penis (Aversa et al., 2000). Interestingly, testosterone also modulates endothelial function. Endothelial progenitor cells are responsible for the regeneration of the endothelium. The area of study of these progenitor cells is relatively new, thus, it is important to evaluate how they affect endothelial function. Since erectile dysfunction is a form of endothelial dysfunction, it has been found that patients with erectile dysfunction had significantly lower levels of circulating progenitor cells than patients with a normal erectile function (Baumhäkel et al., 2006). Endothelial cells in the penile arteries play a critical role in regulating the physiological function of the erectile response in humans. Modulation of the endothelium in the penis by androgens, thus, is a critical area of research that must be further addressed. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R

In our study, we describe the gross anatomy of two stri-ated-perineal muscles: the ischiocavernosus (ICm) and the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> (BSm). Both <b>muscles</b> have their origin at the ischiadic arc, but the ICm is inserted into the penile crura and the BSm onto the ligamentum suspensorium of the penis. The moto-neurons of both muscles were identified using retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase coupled to wheat-germ agglutinin. Motoneurons were dispersed in the lower-lumbar and upper-sacral spinal-cord segments, instead of being aggregated in the neuronal nucleus as in other species: the rat, mouse, gerbil, cat, and man. Bilat-eral dennervation of the ICm or BSm or both in sexually experienced male rabbits did not affect copulatory variables measured at 10, 20, and 30 days after surgery. How-ever, muscular dennervation produced extravaginal ejaculations in 42 % of copulatory tests and no ejaculation in 7 % of tests, although male pelvic thrusting occurred. These results suggest the participation of the ICm and BSm perineal muscles in penile orien-tation during copulation but not in seminal emission as described in other mammalian species.

Among the rodent species studied we can highlight the wide variation in the morphology of the male reproductive system. Thus, considering the ecological importance of rodents, and the large number and geographical representation of this animal, as well as shortages regarding the reproductive anatomy, we developed this study with viscacha, a South American histricomorph rodent. As this species has some very peculiar reproductive features, we described the gross anatomy of the perineal muscles {{and the role of}} copulatory behavior. The perineal region of viscacha is composed of five muscles, three of which are arranged in the superficial genitourinary diaphragm, as Musculus ischiocavernosus, M. bulbocavernosus and M. <b>bulbospongiosus,</b> and the <b>muscles</b> that lie at the pelvic diaphragm, M. levator ani and M. retractor penis. Therefore, we emphasize that the study of the pelvic floor in wild animals is of great value, then contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms related to erection and ejaculation or collaborate with studies on the reproduction of animals...|$|R
30|$|The median {{colpotomy}} incision {{is carried}} out in the anterior vaginal wall starting 2 centimetres from the external urethral meatus and extending to the uterine cervix or to the vaginal apex in women who have had a hysterectomy. The urinary bladder is dissected {{all the way to the}} ischial spine. Two small skin incisions are made; one on each side of the linea alba one centimetre cranially and one centimetre laterally from the upper edge of the pubic bone. Additional two small skin-incisions are made in the posterior area of the obturator foramen;one on each side. The anterior/ pre- pubic needle is introduced laterally to the urethra behind the tendons of the <b>bulbospongiosus</b> and ischio-cavenosus <b>muscles</b> to the pubic bone (between the periosteum and tendon) and guided pre pubically along the major labia to the previously made suprapubic incisions. The anterior arms of the mesh are connected bilaterally to the tip of the needle and pulled to the suprapubic incisions. The posterior arms of the mesh are brought around the arcus tendineus of the levator ani muscles close to the ischial spine and connected to the transobtoratory introduced helix tip. The helix is gently pulled Backwards. It is most important to make sure that the sub-urethral segment of the mesh remains tension free, while the anterior mesh arms are fixed to the pre-pubic tendon. The posterior arms are brought around the arcus tendineus of the levator ani muscles. To reinforce the vaginal apex and the paracolpium, the posterior segment of the mesh is fixed bilaterally to the sacro-uterine ligaments with permanent stitches. The vaginal wall is closed using overlapping sutures. A vaginal pack is inserted for 48 hours.A total of 50 women with symptomatic, advanced POP and SUI were assessed. Their Mean age was 65, 3  years (36 – 84  years). The Follow up period was 24, 9  months. Examination schedule: All women were examined one week, 6  weeks, 8  months and 24  months and later after surgery. Nine women (18 %) had recurrence from previous treatments, seven of whom (14 %) after traditional prolapse operation and 2 (4 %) after biomesh implantation. Forty one women(82 %) were treated with Nazca TC primarily. Thirty women (60 %) suffered urinary stress incontinence, twenty nine (58 %) were sexually active. Sixteen women (32 %) had stage IV cystocele whereas 21 (42 %) had stage III cystocele and 13 (26 %) had stage II cystocele. Seven patients out of fifty (14 %) had uterus prolapse stage IV, 18 women (36 %) stage III., 12 (24 %) stage II, and 13 (26 %) had no uterine prolapse.|$|R
