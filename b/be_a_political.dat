5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that there ought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

25|$|David M. Scienceman is an Australian scientist; {{he changed}} his name from David Slade by deed poll in 1972. McGhee (1990) wrote that his change of name from Slade to Scienceman was an {{experiment}} to create a movement of scientifically aware politicians. In a world dominated by scientific achievements and problems, Slade believed that there should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> party that represented the scientific point of view (Cadzow 1984).|$|E
25|$|After {{the wars}} were over, Kamo {{worked in the}} Soviet Customs office, by some {{accounts}} {{because he was too}} unstable to work for the secret police. Kamo died in a 1922 road accident when a truck hit him while he was cycling. The incident is widely believed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> murder ordered by Stalin. Immediately after Kamo died, Stalin sent someone to collect all of Kamo's records and papers so that they would not embarrass Stalin.|$|E
25|$|The party {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> failure owing to its {{inability}} to conduct its activities in public and small size, combined with its extremely short lifespan. Nevertheless, the group has been regarded by intellectual historians as influential as a watershed {{in the process of}} demythologizing belief in the transformative essence of the peasant masses and in its abnegation of traditional Russian rejection of the norms of western constitutionalism as both a vehicle and a goal for change.|$|E

25|$|Following Svatopluk's death, Great Moravia, {{which had}} {{achieved}} its maximum territorial extension, and exercised its greatest influence in his reign, ceased to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> factor in Central Europe. Among the conquered peoples, the Czechs {{were the first}} to withdraw already in 895. Although, at least according to the testimony of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Svatopluk had made a deathbed request to his sons that they remain united, after his death internal disagreements between his sons, Mojmír II and Svatopluk II were fostered by Arnulf. Finally Moravia collapsed {{in the first decade of}} the 10thcentury due to the invasion of the Hungarians.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{after the}} {{approval}} of the constitution, the second democratic election was carried out and the PCP raised its share of the vote to 14.56% and 40 seats. In the same year, the first Avante! Festival took place, and the eighth congress was held in Lisbon from 1114 November. The congress mainly stated the need to continue the quest for socialism in Portugal and the need to defend the achievements of the revolution against what the party considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> step backward, led by a coalition of the Socialist Party and the right-wing Centro Democrático Social, who opposed the agrarian reform process.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{fashionable to}} blame all of Asia's present {{problems}} on corruption {{and the failure}} of Asian values, it is at bottom a case of a bubble bursting, of too many imprudent lenders chasing too many incautious borrowers. But the greed of Mr. Suharto's children ensured that their father would take the lion's share of the blame for Indonesia's financial collapse. The Suharto children's favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> crisis as well. That he allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, is all the more mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.|$|E
25|$|While {{the show}} does derive {{some of its}} humour from {{exploring}} the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of conservative Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more liberal interpretations of Islam (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is {{the simple fact of}} being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood cultural community. Nawaz herself has stated that the show's primary agenda is to be funny, not to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> platform. She has also stated that she views comedy {{as one of the most}} valuable and powerful ways to break down barriers and to encourage dialogue and understanding between cultures.|$|E
25|$|During the group's first meeting, Paul {{clarified}} {{that the}} party would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> party and therefore would not endorse {{a candidate for president}} during elections. While non-partisan, the NWP directed most of its attention to President Woodrow Wilson and the Democrats, criticizing them as responsible for the failure to pass a constitutional amendment. The National Woman's Party continued to focus on suffrage as their main cause. It refused to either support or attack American involvement in the World War, while the rival National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) under Carrie Chapman Catt gave full support to the war effort. As a result, a diverse group of activists such as pacifists and Socialists were attracted to the NWP due to its opposition to an anti-suffrage president.|$|E

(many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.|$|E

His life {{sentence in the}} Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case was decided. He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail. There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper. They argued {{that they should not}} be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in the jail.|$|E
25|$|Queen Juliana {{attempted}} {{to stop the}} marriage, first by sending a member of her staff to Madrid to persuade the Princess not {{to go ahead with}} a marriage that would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> disaster for the monarchy in the Netherlands. It seemed to work and the Queen went on Dutch radio to tell the citizens that Princess Irene had agreed to cancel her engagement and was returning to the Netherlands. When the airplane arrived at Schiphol Airport, the Princess was not on it, and Queen Juliana and her husband, Prince Bernhard were supplied with a Dutch military plane to go to Spain to retrieve their daughter. However, a message was delivered to the Queen from the Dutch government warning that it would resign en masse if she set foot in Spain. It was suggested that Princess Irene was a pawn of General Francisco Franco who tried to maximize the event to his benefit.|$|E

25|$|In 1845, Polk, {{fearful of}} French or British intervention, had sent Lieutenant Archibald H. Gillespie to California with orders to foment a pro-American {{rebellion}} {{that could be}} used to justify annexation of the territory. After meeting with Gillespie, Army captain John C. Frémont led settlers in northern California to overthrow the Mexican garrison in Sonoma in what became known as the Bear Flag Revolt. In August 1846, American forces under Kearny captured Santa Fe, capital of the province of New Mexico. Kearny captured Santa Fe without firing a shot, after the Mexican Governor, Manuel Armijo, fled from the province. At roughly the same time that Kearny captured Santa Fe, Commodore Robert F. Stockton landed in Los Angeles and proclaimed the capture of California. After American forces put down a revolt, United States held effective control of two northern Mexican provinces. However, the Western theater of the war would prove to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> headache for Polk, as a dispute between Frémont and Kearny led to a break between Polk and the powerful Missouri Senator (and father-in-law of Frémont), Thomas Hart Benton.|$|E
25|$|While she-tragedies {{were more}} comfortably tragic, {{in that they}} showed women who {{suffered}} for no fault {{of their own and}} featured tragic flaws that were emotional rather than moral or intellectual, their success did not mean that more overtly political tragedy was not staged. The Exclusion crisis brought with it a number of tragic implications in real politics, and therefore any treatment of, for example, the Earl of Essex (several versions of which were circulated and briefly acted at non-patent theatres) could be read as seditious. Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd of 1682 was a royalist political play that, like Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel, seemed to praise the king for his actions in the meal tub plot. Otway's play had the floating city of Venice stand in for the river town of London, and it had the dark senatorial plotters of the play stand in for the Earl of Shaftesbury. It even managed to figure in the Duke of Monmouth, Charles's illegitimate, war-hero son who was favoured by many as Charles's successor over the Roman Catholic James. Venice Preserv'd is, in a sense, the perfect synthesis of the older politically royalist tragedies and histories of Dryden and the newer she-tragedies of feminine suffering, for, although the plot seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> allegory, the action centres on a woman who cares for a man in conflict, and most of the scenes and dialogue concern her pitiable sufferings at his hands.|$|E

[...] However, Davis feared that Yancey would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> opponent, and wanted him out of the country.|$|E
