Methods: Ten auto body shops in King County, Washington that use waterborne coatings were recruited to participate in this study. Based on reviews of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) from commonly used waterborne <b>basecoats,</b> 14 target compounds were selected to characterize exposures to components of these products. Task-based personal air sampling was conducted on 11 painters when applying <b>basecoats.</b> Sampling results were summarized and compared to MSDSs and historical exposure studies of solvent-based paints. Painters’ work practices were also recorded to determine other possible routes of exposure. Work practices recorded included the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), gun-cleaning procedures, waste disposal, and paint booth maintenance. Results: Breathing zone concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons and polar volatile organic compounds were typically below their respective method limits of quantitation (MLOQ). On average, 11 % (SD= 16 %) of the aromatic hydrocarbon samples and 23 % (SD= 19 %) of the polar compound samples exceeded their respective MLOQs. All analyte concentrations had threshold limit value (TLV) parametric exceedance fractions below 0. 03, and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) odor parametric exceedance fractions below 0. 05. VOC exposures when spraying waterborne paints were up to 56 times lower than historical studies on VOC exposures to solvent-based paints. Procedures for cleaning paint guns and disposing of waterborne paint wastes varied between shops. Several shops disposed of waste in the municipal solid waste stream without chemical characterization, in violation of state regulations. Painters were observed using lacquer thinner to clean their waterborne paint guns, which is not recommended by manufacturers. Painters were also observed handling waterborne waste with inadequate exposure controls. We observed that the air flow rates in spray booths typically failed to meet OSHA requirements. Conclusions: Workers’ exposures to target compounds when applying waterborne <b>basecoats</b> were typically below their respective MLOQs and regulatory limits. The typical PPE worn by painters should be adequate to protect painters from possible exposures. This study also shows that the waterborne paint exposures during spraying are lower than the historical exposures due to spraying solvent-based paints. However, without maintaining adequate airflow in the paint booths and adequate guidelines for all aspects of handling the paints, workers can still be at risk of exposures to waterborne paints and other chemicals used during non-spraying operations. Therefore, more information is needed on the chemical composition of the waste generated from waterborne paint systems to establish best practices for spray gun cleaning and waste disposal...|$|R

The feature of colored pencil drawings is that, though colored pencil drawings are drawn with limited number of colors of pencils, we can express a lot of colors and gentle textures by changing the strengths when drawing strokes and by overlapping strokes of different colors. In order to realize this feature, we determine which colors of pencils to use and how deep to push the pencils (equivalent to the strength when drawing strokes), then draw several types of strokes, such as strokes for outlines, <b>basecoats,</b> and shading, allowing the strokes to overlap each other.

Classification using principal component analysis revealed 14 discrete groups, which could be associated with the country of manufacture, the specific manufacturer and manufacturing plant, the year of manufacture of the vehicle and in some instances the number of layers in the paint system. The model generated from the primer surfacer was significantly more discriminating than a previous model generated from FTIR analysis of clear coats of the same vehicles. Analysis of the primer surfacer also avoids issues of possible environmental degradation and component migration seen with FTIR analysis of automotive clear coats.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in perfluoropolyether (PFPE) resin technology for high solids, weather resistant polyurethanes for automotive (OEM) and heavy duty coatings are presented. In the former case, polyfunctional OH-terminated PFPE resins can be successfully blended with commercially available blocked iso- cyanates leading to high solids (70 – 80 wt. %) monocomponent polyurethanes with high density of cross-linking. Formulations containing PFPE resins and mixed hexamethylene diisocyanate/isophorone diisocyanate (HDI/IPDI) blocked isocyanates were prepared and char- acterized according to OEM specifications; {{the performances of}} fluorinated coatings were {{compared with those of}} reference acrylic solvent-borne coatings. Clearcoats were applied over conventional OEM <b>basecoats</b> (car body painting) and polyester powder coatings (wheels painting). The remarkable improvement of anticorrosion performances, acid and mar resistance and durability of painting system was reached maintaining its good aesthetic aspect. Fluorinated films showed excellent stain release properties conferring to final painting system, the self-cleaning behaviour typical for PFPE coatings. In the latter case, the use of dihydroxy terminated PFPE oligomers having properly selected molecular weights and bimodal molecular weight distribution allowed the preparation of really high solid (80 – 90 wt. % dry) low viscosity formulations with aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrogenated polyisocyanates. The compositions were able to cross-link rapidly even at temperatures below 20 ◦C giving fully transparent, chemically resistant and easy-cleanable coatings. The coating physical properties like hardness, glass transition temperature (Tg) and elongation can be optimized by tuning the hardener composition (HDI/IPDI ratio) as well as the molecular weight of the PFPE.

5000|$|Metallic paints contain {{aluminium}} flakes {{to create}} a sparkling and grainy effect, generally {{referred to as a}} metallic look. This paint is harder to manage than solid paints because of the extra dimensions to consider. Metallic and pearlescent paints must be applied evenly to ensure a consistent looking finish without light and dark spots which are often called [...] "mottling". Metallic basecoats are formulated so that the aluminium flake is parallel to the substrate. This maximises the [...] "flop". This is the difference in the brightness between looking perpendicularly at the paint and that at an acute angle. The [...] "flop" [...] is maximised if the <b>basecoat</b> increases in viscosity shortly after application so that the aluminium flake which is in a random orientation after spraying is locked into this position while there is still much solvent (or water) in the coating. Subsequent evaporation of the solvent (or water), leads to a reduction in the film thickness of the drying coating, causing the aluminium flake to be dragged into an orientation parallel to the substrate. This orientation then needs to be unaffected by the application of the clear coat solvents. The formulation of the clear coat needs to be carefully chosen so that it will not [...] "re-dissolve" [...] the <b>basecoat</b> and thus affect the orientation of the metallic flake but will still exhibit enough adhesion between the coatings so as to avoid delamination of the clear coat. A similar mode of action occurs with pearlescent pigmented basecoats.|$|E

Alexander and Ross could produce an entire landscape in under half an hour on their respective television shows, The Magic of Oil Painting and the long-running The Joy of Painting.

It {{can be caused by}} the coating formulation, as well as variations in the application process. For example, disorientation of the metallic flakes or film thickness variations of the <b>basecoat</b> can lead to various mottle sizes resulting in a non-uniform appearance. The visual perception of mottling is dependent on the viewing distance: Large mottles can be seen in far distance evaluation, while small mottles are more noticeable in close up evaluation. The visual evaluation of mottling is very subjective, as it dependson the illumination conditions, the observing distance and the viewing angle.|$|E
5000|$|Usually sprayed {{on top of}} {{a colored}} <b>basecoat,</b> {{clearcoat}} is a glossy and transparent coating that forms the final interface with the environment. For this reason, clearcoat must be durable enough to resist abrasion and chemically stable enough to withstand UV light. Clearcoat can be either solvent or water-borne. One part and two part formulations are often referred to as 1k and 2k respectively.OEM (original equipment manufacture) clear coats applied to the metal bodies of cars are normally 1K systems since they can be heated to around 140 deg C to effect cure. The clear coats applied to the plastic components like the bumpers and wing mirrors however are 2K systems since they can normally only accept temperatures up to about 90 deg C. These 2 K systems are normally applied [...] "off line" [...] with the coated plastic parts fixed to the painted metallic body. Owing to the difference in formulation of the 1K and 2K systems and the fact they are coated in different locations they have a different effect on the [...] "redissolving" [...] of the metallic base coat. This is most easily seen in the light metallic paints like the silver and light blue or green shades where the [...] "flop" [...] difference is most marked.|$|E

The surface analyses are used to determine the influence of the topcoat composition on the adhesion of pressure-sensitive adhesives. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ions mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) study the automotive topcoats chemistries.

The impact of the different additives families (anti-UV agents and surface levelling additives) on the topcoat surface chemistry is identified.

The establishment of visual appearance and mechanical strength of the multi-layer polymeric films has been investigated by varying both baking time and temperature on a very wide range. Furthermore, two different two-step baking procedures (i. e., with and without full post-curing of the topcoat) were also proposed and comparatively evaluated. Improved trends of average roughness and mechanical strength of the multi-layer films were found at any time progressively higher baking time and/or temperature was set. Accordingly, the overall adhesion between multi-layer films and underlying metal surfaces was found to increase, as well. Nonetheless, experimental results show that even though satisfactory surface roughness and mechanical properties of the multi-layer films can be established over wide enough ranges of baking time and temperature with both baking procedures, an acceptable visual appearance is only achievable if the topcoat is superimposed at least on an almost fully cured <b>basecoat.</b> (C) 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory testing {{on the performance}} of wall claddings using direct-applied (DEFS) and exterior insulation finish systems (EIFS) that incorporate water management features into their design and construc-tion. The work presented in this paper is a continuation of earlier work conducted by the Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) of the National Research Council, Canada (NRCC) and the United States Gypsum Company (USG) evaluating the water penetration and moisture performance of barrier EIFS clad walls (Brown et al., 1997). Direct-applied exterior finish systems (DEFS) are exterior wall claddings that use a water durable substrate, typically cement board, mechanically fastened to the wall framing over a sheathing membrane. A cementitious <b>basecoat</b> and textured acrylic synthetic stucco finish is then applied directly over the substrate. Insulation for the DEFS system is in the stud cavity.

40|$|Metallic and {{pearlescent}} coatings {{are becoming}} increasingly important in automotive, currency, and cosmetic applications. These coatings consist of metallic or dielectric platelets suspended in a binder, and are often applied between a pigmented <b>basecoat,</b> and a transparent topcoat. The scattering properties of these composite coatings vary depending upon the incident and viewing directions, {{as well as the}} wavelength. The complex nature of the scattering arises from the competition between multiple scattering sources: front surface reflection from the topcoat, reflection from the platelets, diffuse scattering from the pigmented undercoat, and scattering between platelets. The complex interplay between multiple scattering sources affects the ability to achieve quality control during the preparation of these coatings. In addition, the topcoat surface morphology, the properties of the pigmented <b>basecoat,</b> and the intrinsic properties, concentration, and angular distribution of the platelets influence the final appearance of the coating. In this paper, we will present models for light scattering from front surface facet reflection, subsurface flake reflection, and diffuse subsurface scattering. Experimental scattering measurements on pearlescent coatings show that the polarization can be well described in different geometry regimes by these different scattering sources. The models can be used to extract the slope distribution function of the flakes from the intensity data, but some aspects of the results behave inconsistently. Comparison is also made between experimental and calculated diffuse reflectance spectra. These results are intended to enable improved characterization of special effect coatings necessary for quality control and appearance modeling applications...|$|E

The plastic substrate consisted of Polypropylene-blend with different fillers such as talc, carbon black and metal flakes. The basecoats analyzed were 2 solid factory coatings (one black and one white), 5 factory coating containing different effect pigments such as metal flakes, Xiralic, and Mica, 1 factory PVD coating and 2 aftermarket basecoats. All samples were provided by a Volvo Cars’ supplier, however, some samples were repainted with the aftermarket coatings.

Water can dissolve and transport deleterious chemicals such as de-icing salts, carbon dioxide, dissolved oxygen, and sulfates into PCCPs through cracks and the concrete surface. These chemicals and water itself all {{have the potential to}} degrade PCCP by chemical and/or physical processes. Surface-applied concrete sealers have demonstrated the ability to increase service life of PCCPs by limiting the ingress of water and deleterious chemicals into concrete. Concrete sealers are being increasingly used by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD). However, little has been done in Idaho to establish either a long-term field observation program or to perform a comprehensive laboratory analysis and evaluation process of suitable compounds. Thus, before proper deployment and long term field evaluation of concrete sealers can be done, an extensive laboratory evaluation process of suitable compounds, laboratory sealer evaluation protocol development, and application/reapplication protocol development needs to be performed. In this research, five surface-applied concrete sealer treatments were evaluated in the laboratory. The sealer treatments are as follows. 1. Silane (water repellent) 2. Epoxy (barrier coating) 3. High molecular weight methacrylate (HMWM) (barrier coating/pore blocker) 4. Silane <b>basecoat</b> with an epoxy topcoat (dual treatment) 5. Silane <b>basecoat</b> with a HMWM topcoat (dual treatment) The treatments were evaluated in the following tests in the laboratory. 1. Water vapor transmission 2. Saltwater absorption 3. Chloride permeability 4. Sealer penetration depth or coating thickness 5. Resistance to alkali 6. Ultraviolet (UV) weathering and cyclic saltwater ponding 7. Freeze-thaw resistance In addition, the same treatments were applied at four field locations near Boise in Southwest Idaho to initiate a long-term field study to be completed in phase II of this study. Only the initial water absorption performance (time zero) was evaluated using core samples in the laboratory. The duration of the initial phase of this study was insufficient for the analysis of the long-term (4 years +) performance of the field site applications. The dual treatments comprised of a silane <b>basecoat</b> and an epoxy or HMWM topcoat consistently exhibited the best performance. Of single sealer treatments, the epoxy, silane, and HMWM had the best performance in descending order. Only the silane exhibited a consistently measurable depth of penetration and was the only treatment that had significant vapor transmission ability. The dual treatments also exhibited the least water absorption for the initial, time zero, field cores extracted from each of the four field sites. Dual treatments offer the advantage of a deep penetrating sealer (silane) combined with a barrier coating type sealer (epoxy or HMWM) able to seal cracks to limit the ingress of water and chemicals. Dual treatments offer the best protection for PCCPs. If vapor transmission is of concern, the silane sealer’s performance consistently surpassed threshold values recommended in the literature and would be recommended...|$|E

The samples were received from a Volvo Cars supplier, so there is limited information of the composition of plastic substrates and coatings available. The free space method was done using a two-port network analyzer. Time-domain clipping and normalization was done on the S-parameters. Complex permittivities for each plastic substrate and coating were calculated from the curve fitting values of a multi-layer dielectric model. Both the obtained radar measurements and thickness measurements were required for the calculation of the permittivities. Thickness measurements were done on the cross-sections of all cut samples using an optical microscope. Effect pigments were observed in both optical microscope and SEM. FT-IR spectroscopy was done on the plastic substrates to obtain information on the compositions. TGA was done on the plastic substrates to measure polymer matrix and filler concentrations. DCS was done on the plastic substrates percent crystallinity was calculated using a reference value for the enthalpy of 100 % crystallinity for Polypropylene, after deducting the fillers. The results from the materials analyses were compared to the calculated permittivities. Reflection losses, were modeled with MATLAB to show the approximate permittivities of the aftermarket basecoats that were difficult to perform curve fittings on. Metal flake content correlated to a greater real permittivity of the basecoats. A non- metallic effect pigment in similar concentrations as the metal flakes also increased real and imaginary permittivity in a <b>basecoat.</b> Talc, and likely carbon black, also increased real permittivity. MATLAB was also used to show that plastic substrate thickness is to minimize unwanted reflections in radar, as well as a low permittivity for the <b>basecoat...</b>|$|E
