5|$|Macedonia's {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, {{but it did not}} take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find their sons and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b> Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia. The commander of JNA forces in {{the first phase of the}} battle, Gen. Aleksandar Spirkovski, was a Macedonian. His ethnicity was probably a significant factor in the decision to replace him with Života Panić, a Serb. In 2005, the Macedonian Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Miroslav Stojanovski, became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.|$|E
5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b> Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Fireheart and Graystripe succeed, finding WindClan under {{a tangle}} of Thunderpaths (a highway interchange). When Fireheart and Graystripe first find the Thunderpaths, they are {{confused}} by the mixed-up scents.

Then they <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{their first}} task as warriors, Fireheart and Graystripe are {{assigned}} to find WindClan, which had been driven out by ShadowClan, and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b> They go to the WindClan camp and search for clues there. On the way, they see some RiverClan warriors hunting on WindClan territory. Graystripe finds the correct scent trail, and they follow it to a makeshift WindClan camp. Fireheart spots Barley's farm a little ways off the trail and the pair hurriedly leaves in fear of the dogs that live on the farm chasing them after they get let out.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{described}} the production as the world's largest home movie, {{due to the}} independence and sense of family. Producer Barrie Osborne {{saw it as a}} traveling circus. Fran Walsh described writing the script for the production as laying the track down in front of a moving train. Jackson also described shooting as like organizing an army, with 2,400 people involved at the height of production. Due to the remoteness of some of New Zealand's untamed landscapes, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters couldn't reach the location to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> in time.|$|E

[...] A rebellious ex-Wellington schoolboy and avowed Communist, Romilly had been invalided home after fighting on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. The young couple were traced to Bilbao; Mitford was despatched to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home,</b> but failed to persuade them, and they were married in May.|$|E
500|$|Rowland was {{assigned}} to the Pathfinder Force that marked targets for other aircraft on strategic bombing missions over Europe. Considered an exceptional pilot, he became a master bomber with No.635 Squadron RAF in 1944. As a master bomber, his role was to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. No.635 Squadron operated Lancasters, a type that, Rowland recalled, [...] "would forgive sprog pilots doing the most outrageous things to it, and would even <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> with quite large bits shot off it".|$|E
500|$|Endurance became beset {{in the ice}} of the Weddell Sea before {{reaching}} Vahsel Bay, and [...] drifted northward, held in the pack ice, throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915. Eventually the ship was crushed and sunk, stranding its 28-man complement on the ice. After months spent in makeshift camps as the ice continued its northwards drift, the party took to the lifeboats to reach the inhospitable, uninhabited Elephant Island. Shackleton and five others then made an 800-mile (1,287km) open-boat journey in the James Caird to reach South Georgia. From there, Shackleton was eventually able to mount a rescue of the men waiting on Elephant Island and <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> without loss of life. On {{the other side of}} the continent, the Ross Sea party overcame great hardships to fulfil its mission. [...] Aurora was blown from her moorings during a gale and was unable to return, leaving the shore party marooned without proper supplies or equipment. Nevertheless, the depots were laid, but three lives were lost [...] before the party's eventual rescue.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{all three}} films was conducted concurrently in many locations within New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks. Filming took place between 11 October 1999 and 22 December 2000, a period of [...] days. Pick-up shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2003. The series was shot at over 150 different locations, with seven different units shooting, as well as soundstages around Wellington and Queenstown. Along with Jackson directing the whole production, other unit directors included John Mahaffie, Geoff Murphy, Fran Walsh, Barrie Osbourne, Rick Porras, and any other assistant director, producer, or writer available. Jackson monitored these units with live satellite feeds, and with the added pressure of constant script re-writes and the multiple units interpreting his envisioned result, he only got around four hours of sleep a night. Due to the remoteness {{of some of the}} locations, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters could not reach the location to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> in time. The New Zealand Department of Conservation was criticised for approving the filming within national parks without adequate consideration of the adverse environmental effects and without public notification. The adverse effects of filming battle scenes in Tongariro National Park meant that the park later required restoration work.|$|E
500|$|The Workshop had a {{reorganization}} during 1995, {{and dismissed}} about 12 {{percent of its}} staff. During 1998, {{for the first time}} in the series' history, they accepted funds from corporations for Sesame Street and its other programs, a policy criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. [...] The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies and financial assistance by PBS. Also during 1998, the Workshop invested $25 million in the cable channel Noggin, initiated during 1999 by the Workshop and Viacom's Nickelodeon. During 2000, the profit the CTW earned from the deal, along with its 1998 revenue caused partly by the [...] "Tickle Me Elmo" [...] craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company's rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, [...] "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home.</b> It protected Sesame Street and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny".|$|E

[...] During a Republican debate, she took a [...] "hawkish" [...] stance on Iran, saying all options should be on the table, including the military one. She said that the U.S. military should be [...] "second to none", and promised more representation to defense contractors from Connecticut, including Sikorsky.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Cohen {{sponsored}} the Cohen Amendment reducing infrastructure funding to Afghanistan. The Afghan Infrastructure Fund {{has been plagued}} with problems, with millions of taxpayer dollars disappearing. When {{another member of the}} House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied “The {{truth of the matter is}} that it has nothing to do with whether we can bring our troops home or not. [...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>home</b> permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E
