40|$|Regulation (EU) No. 528 / 2012 {{requires}} that {{a risk assessment}} is performed for <b>products</b> containing <b>biocidal</b> active substances. The assessment includes the evaluation of residues in food and feed. Through the use of biocides in domestic households by non-professional users food can be exposed. This may occur either via direct exposure of food or upon contact of food items with biocide residues deposited on surfaces. With active participation of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) the Working Group ARTFood (<b>Biocidal</b> <b>Product</b> <b>Committee</b> Adhoc Working Group for the Assessment of Residue Transfer into Foods) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has developed the “Draft Guidance on Estimating Dietary Risk from Transfer of Biocidal Active Substances into Foods – Non-professional Uses” (Draft Guidance Non-Prof Use). The draft document has been published on the ECHA website. The Draft Guidance Non-Prof Use proposes models for estimating consumer exposure to biocidal active substances in their food. In order to facilitate the performance of these exposure estimates the BfR has developed an Excel-based tool for calculating the exposure for various scenarios. Calculations are based on assumptions and default values {{as described in the}} Draft Guidance Non-Prof Use. Calculator and the draft guidance are intended to support competent authorities and industry in the estimation of dietary risk to humans from <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> that are used in domestic environments (households) and could contaminate food...|$|R
50|$|The Biocides Work Area {{provided}} {{scientific and}} technical support for the approval of active substances in <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> as laid down in Directive 98/8/EC (<b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive, BPD) concerning the placing of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> on the market. Currently, these tasks are dealt with by the biocides group within the IHCP. From 2013, coinciding with the coming-into-force of a new <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR), the European Chemicals Agency ECHA will take over the biocides' program.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> such as wood {{preservatives}} and film preservatives in facade coatings, are submitted to a detailed environmental risk assessment under the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012. Laboratory leaching tests for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> that are based either on constant or intermittent water contact, as well as semi-field tests, are listed in a guidance document of the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA. These tests also apply to <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> that are included in construction products [33].|$|R
30|$|CA and IA both {{link the}} {{toxicity}} of individual components (active ingredients, substances of concern, co-formulants) {{to the overall}} toxicity of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The major advantage of such methods is their easy adaptability to different exposure situations, e.g. when the chemical composition of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> changes. They substantially decrease the biotest demands of new <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> if they use known active ingredients and/or co-formulants. Similar to the direct testing of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> for its long-term effects, also the modeling of long-term effects in the environment depends on a sound and complete definition of the underlying exposure scenario.|$|R
30|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can be {{sources of}} active {{substances}} in surface waters caused by weathering of treated articles. Marketing {{and use of}} <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can be limited according to the European <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation if unacceptable risks to the environment are expected. Leaching of active substances from treated articles was observed in field experiments to obtain information on leaching processes and investigate the suitability of a proposed test method.|$|R
30|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are {{mixtures}} {{of one or}} more active substances (a.s.) and various intentionally added substances serving a broad range of functions in the formulated product. The authorization of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> in the European Union (EU) is regulated by the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Product</b> Regulation (BPR) [12], and further specified in guidance documents prepared by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in consultation with the EU member states. For the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> the BPR requests considering cumulative and synergistic effects. The methodology to fulfil this requirement is described in the transitional guidance document on mixture toxicity assessment for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> for the environment [13], which is currently available from the ECHA website. In the near future, it will be incorporated into the BPR guidance structure, namely Volume IV Part B and C Guidance, which will then replace this transitional guidance document.|$|R
50|$|Humans may {{be exposed}} to <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> in {{different}} ways in both occupational and domestic settings. Many <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are intended for industrial sectors or professional uses only, whereas other <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are commonly available for private use by non-professional users. In addition, potential exposure of non-users of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> (i.e. the general public) may occur indirectly via the environment, for example through drinking water, the food chain, {{as well as through}} atmospheric and residential exposure. Particular attention should be paid to the exposure of vulnerable sub-populations, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Also pets and other domestic animals can be exposed indirectly following the application of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, exposure to biocides may vary in terms of route (inhalation, dermal contact, and ingestion) and pathway (food, drinking water, residential, occupational) of exposure, level, frequency and duration.|$|R
30|$|Earlier in 2012 the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers {{adopted the}} new {{regulation}} (EU) No 528 / 2012 on the authorization of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> (BPR)[1]. It will apply from 1 September 2013 and will replace and repeal the BPD and will implement a new EU-wide, harmonized {{system for the}} authorization for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> This system will be applied for low-risk <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> and products that have similar use conditions throughout the EU. All other <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are expected to still be subject to authorization by the individual member states. The BPR provisions will also apply to existing active substances being evaluated under the BPD review program.|$|R
30|$|Marketing {{and use of}} <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can {{be limited}} {{according}} to the European <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR) [7] if unacceptable risks to the environment are expected. However, restrictions depend on reliable knowledge on the expected release into the environment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> include, for example, insect repellents and {{disinfectants}} used in hospitals. The <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR) {{ensures that}} there is enough information about these products so that consumers can use them safely. ECHA is responsible for implementing the regulation.|$|R
50|$|When {{discussing}} biocides {{a distinction}} {{should be made}} between the biocidal active substance and the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The <b>biocidal</b> active substances are mostly chemical compounds, but can also be microorganisms (e.g. bacteria). <b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> contain one or more biocidal active substances and may contain other non-active co-formulants that ensure the effectiveness {{as well as the}} desired pH, viscosity, colour, odour, etc. of the final <b>product.</b> <b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are available on the market for use by professional and/or non-professional consumers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive (BPD) {{also known}} as the Biocides Directive is European Union Directive, (98/8/EC), which {{concerns}} biocides. It is officially known as Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> on the market.|$|R
50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> {{and active}} {{substances}} fall into four categories and twenty-three product-types {{that are all}} regulated by the EU under the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive. The substances have to be authorized before being used or sold on the EU market. Also, all treated products shall only contain authorized active substances. To be authorized, manufacturers or importers need to submit technical documentation on the products. The European Commission created and regularly updates the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive to ensure {{a high level of}} protection of human and animal health, as well as environmental protection.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> {{are usually}} multi-component {{mixtures}} {{of one or}} more active substances plus a range of co-formulants that serve different purposes, as stabilizers, coloring agents, emulsifiers, solvents, diluents, etc. Additionally, metabolites and degradation products might be formed during and after use of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The overall ecotoxicity of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> might hence be significantly different from that of each individual ingredient(s) and therefore needs to be assessed during the product authorization phase. In fact, article 19 (2) of the BPR states that “the evaluation […] shall take into account the following factors: […] cumulative effects, synergistic effects.” [...] "Cumulative effects" [...] {{in the context of the}} BPR relate to effects from the same compound, emitted from different products, while [...] "synergistic effects" [...] relate to the joint action of different chemicals from one product. This is further elaborated in Annex VI (common principles for the evaluation of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products)</b> which states that the risks associated with the relevant individual components of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> shall be assessed, taking into account cumulative and synergistic effects.|$|R
40|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> {{are active}} {{substances}} and preparations containing {{one or more}} active substances, putin a form that is supplied to the user, with aim to destroy, to prevent the action or to exercise control over adifferent effect any harmful organism by chemical or biological means. By definition, these products are susceptible to have harmful effects on humans, animals and theenvironment as the main objective of European legislative regulations {{in this area is}} to ensure the highestlevel protection by restricting the placing on the market and use only those <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> which have anacceptable risk of danger to humans or the environment. The favourable opinion for the placing on the market is made after the evaluation of technicaldocumentation of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> completed by preparing a report of assessment with the formulation of theproposal to issue notice for placing on the market by the National Commission of <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products.</b> ICBMV is designated as an authority competent to assess technical documentations on efficacy,chemistry and toxicity data of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> product type 3 : Veterinary hygiene products...|$|R
30|$|In this context, the {{objective}} {{of the present study was}} to assess the reliability and protectiveness of the CBA by comparing the predicted with the experimentally determined aquatic ecotoxicity of selected <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Additionally, the results of this study aim to inform the debate on the identification of ‘relevant’ components for the mixture assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

3000|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are {{preparations}} containing one or {{more active}} substances, {{with the intention of}} [...] "destroying, deterring, rendering harmless, preventing the action of, or otherwise exerting a controlling effect on, any organism by any means other than mere physical or mechanical” (<b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation, (EU) No 528 / 2012, BPR)[1]. Biocides are hence closely related to agricultural pesticides and are – due to their high biological activity and potential exposure – of inherent environmental concern. In fact, <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are only allowed to be put on the market of the European Union, if it can be convincingly demonstrated that no unacceptable risks for the environment result from their intended use.|$|R
30|$|However, {{only very}} limited {{details on how}} mixture effects should be {{considered}} during the authorization of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> are provided in the current Technical Note for Guidance on Product Evaluation[3]. In fact, there is currently no agreed guidance available among the European Member States on how to assess the mixture effects from the ingredients of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> hindering the mutual recognition of authorizations between member states.|$|R
30|$|The EU Council and Parliament {{recently}} {{agreed on}} a new regulation that will implement a new EU-wide, harmonized system for the authorization for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Such products are in most cases multi-component mixtures {{of one or more}} active substances plus a range of co-formulants that serve different purposes, e.g. as stabilizers or preservatives. They are only allowed on the European market if their intended use does not lead to unacceptable risks for the environment. Consequently, the assessment of possible combination effects is a critically important step during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> However, no specific guidance is at hand on how combination effects should be accounted for during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{classification}} of biocides in the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (EU) 528/2012)(BPR) is {{broken down into}} 22 product types (i.e. application categories), with several comprising multiple subgroups: ...|$|R
30|$|Obviously, if toxic {{compounds}} are {{not considered}} in a component based assessment, the calculated risk will be an underestimation of the actual risk of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product,</b> see[25]. It is, however, impossible to provide a general estimate {{of the magnitude of}} such an underestimation, as this depends on the concentration and ecotoxicological potency of the compounds that are erroneously not included in the assessment. Therefore, special care has to be taken to ensure that all toxic ingredients are included in a component-based assessment of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{changes in}} {{bacterial}} genetic material under {{the action of}} different <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> have been investigated.

30|$|Biocides {{are active}} {{substances}} and products which {{are intended to}} destroy (…) any harmful organism by chemical or biological means. Typical applications are for instance wood preservatives, antifouling products or disinfectants. In the European Union the use of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> is regulated since 1998 by the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Product</b> Directive 98 / 8 /EG (BPD). The BPD was transposed into German law in 2001 by the “Biozid-Gesetz”.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} text is to bridge this gap and suggest a tiered {{approach}} for the adequate consideration of mixture effects during the environmental risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
30|$|Any {{component}} based {{approach requires}} that all “relevant” compounds {{are included in}} the assessment, i.e. biologically active chemicals that are present at sufficiently high concentrations. Within the framework of biocide legislation such compounds are termed “substances of concern”, i.e. constituents of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> other than the active ingredient that have “an inherent capacity to cause an adverse effect on humans, animals or the environment” ([1], Art 2 e). If no ecotoxicological information is at hand for such ingredients, the only risk assessment option is the direct biotesting of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> or the resulting environmental mixture, respectively.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} shortcoming in {{our present}} knowledge required for risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> is {{the assessment of}} human exposure. This knowledge gap has been filled in a preliminary fashion with the TNsG on human exposure to <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> (available from the ECB website). Explicit User guidance has been developed by an expert group for a general approach of the exposure assessment and in appreciable detail for me first two product types wood preservatives and rodenticides. This User guidance is also available from the ECB website. Further additions for other product types are foreseen for the near future...|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} {{potential}} adverse effects, {{and to ensure}} a harmonised risk assessment and management, the EU regulatory framework for biocides has been established {{with the objective of}} ensuring a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment. To this aim, it is required that risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> is carried out before they can be placed on the market. A central element in the risk assessment of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are the utilization instructions that defines the dosage, application method and amount of applications and thus the exposure of humans and the environment to the biocidal substance.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{most of the}} {{biocidal}} {{active substances}} have a relative high toxicity, there are also examples of active substances with low toxicity, such as , which exhibit their biocidal activity only under certain specific conditions such as in closed systems. In such cases, the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> is {{the combination of the}} active substance and the device that ensures the intended biocidal activity, i.e. suffocation of rodents by [...] in a closed system trap. Another example of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> available to consumers are products impregnated with biocides (also called treated articles), such as clothes and wristbands impregnated with insecticides, socks impregnated with antibacterial substances etc.|$|R
30|$|The {{substitution}} {{principle is}} a new element of the legislation on plant protection products (PPPs) in the European Union (EU). It was introduced with the new Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 [[1]], in the following shortly denoted as the PPP Regulation. This replaced the old Directive 91 / 414 /EEC on PPPs [[2]] in June 2011. In parallel, the substitution principle was {{also included in the}} new Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012 on <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> [[3]], which came into force in September 2013. PPPs and <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are collectively denoted as ‘pesticides’ under EU law, as has been defined in Article 3 of Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides in the European Community (EC) [[4]]. As a common rule, pesticides shall not be placed on the market or used unless they have been authorised in accordance with the applicable regulations. In general, ‘substitution’ of pesticides means that an authorisation is refused or withdrawn in favour of an alternative product or a non-chemical control or prevention method which presents a ‘significantly lower risk’, according to Annex IV of the PPP Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 and Article 23 of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012, respectively. In detail, the conditions, rules, and criteria for applying the substitution principle differ for PPPs and for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> In this paper, we focus on substitution under the Regulation for PPPs.|$|R
40|$|In this report, the EU {{legislation}} regulating antifouling {{measures for}} leisure {{boats in the}} Baltic Sea will be presented with particular focus on authorisation of antifouling biocides and on determining {{the extent of the}} Member States’ autonomy in other antifouling related matters. The report outlines the important provisions of applicable legislation in both the regulations concerning harmonization of the authorisation of chemicals and the directives targeting the environmental concerns of the water bodies in the Union. The <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation provides the basis for all <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> authorisation, including procedural provisions and requirements for approval of active substances and authorisation of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> while the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive regulate the marine environment and provide specific environmental quality standards and measures that must be considered in the authorisation process. Provisions in both the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation and the regulation in combination with the water policy directives provide the possibility to impose conditions or restrictions on antifouling biocides based on local environmental conditions, but the environmental concerns must be weighed against the objective of harmonization of the internal market. The particular sensitivity and unique environmental quality of the Baltic Sea constitutes aspects that can and must be taken into consideration in the authorisation process. The water quality directives put further antifouling related obligations on the Member States, which they may achieve through various regulations and actions determined at a national level...|$|R
50|$|The EU {{regulatory}} framework for biocides has for years been defined by the Directive 98/8/EC, {{also known as the}} <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive (BPD). The BPD was revoked by the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation 528/2012 (BPR), which entered into force on 17 July 2012 with the application date of September 1, 2013. Several Technical Notes for Guidance (TNsG) have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the BPR and to assure a common understanding of its obligations. According to the EU legislation, <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> need authorisation to be placed or to remain on the market. Competent Authorities of the EU member states are responsible for assessing and approving the active substances contained in the biocides. The BPR follows some of the principles set previously under the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restrictions of Chemicals) and the coordination of the risk assessment process for both REACH and BPR are mandated to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which assures the harmonization and integration of risk characterization methodologies between the two regulations.|$|R
