5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
25|$|Many stream ciphers {{are based}} on linear-feedback shift {{registers}} (LFSRs), which, while efficient in hardware, are less so in software. The design of RC4 avoids the use of LFSRs and is ideal for software implementation, as it requires only byte manipulations. It uses 256 <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> for the state array, S through S, k <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> for the key, key through key, and integer variables, i, j, and K. Performing a modular reduction of some value modulo 256 {{can be done with}} a bitwise AND with 255 (which is equivalent to taking the low-order byte of the value in question).|$|E
500|$|The April 1975 {{issue of}} the Altair Newsletter, Computer Notes, had a banner {{headline}} [...] "Altair BASIC - Up and Running". The software was to begin shipping on June 23, 1975. The software price was $500, but discounted to $75 with the purchase of an Altair computer with 8k <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> and a serial I/O card.|$|E

50|$|Byte order: With multi-byte CRCs, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} over whether the byte transmitted first (or stored in the lowest-addressed <b>byte</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory)</b> is the least-significant byte (LSB) or the most-significant byte (MSB). For example, some 16-bit CRC schemes swap the <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> the check value.|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>byte</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> {{is stored}} as two {{sequential}} ASCII characters on tape, for example, hexadecimal B5 in memory (181 decimal) would be stored as two sequential ASCII characters [...] "B" [...] and [...] "5" [...] (42 and 35 hexadecimal).|$|R
500|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} {{to have the}} player {{play the role of}} a nephew who had inherited a fortune from his aunt, to be spent only on the world's largest and most profitable theme park. The graphics were drawn and modelled using 3D Studio. Molyneux stated that each person takes about 200 <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> enough for them to have their own personality. The team travelled the world visiting theme parks and taking [...] notes, and sound effects were sampled from real parks. Molyneux explained that they were going for as much realism as possible. There was to be a feature where a microphone is placed on a visitor and so the player could hear what they were saying, and multiplayer support was dropped two weeks prior to release because of a deadline. Multiplayer mode would have let players send thugs to other parks.|$|E
500|$|Carter {{wrote and}} {{organised}} 800,000 lines of code. Richard Ridings (also known as [...] "Daddy Pig" [...] in the Peppa Pig franchise) provided voice-overs {{such as the}} mentor. The music was composed by Russell Shaw and, according to Healey, this came late in development. The prospect of working on Dungeon Keeper motivated artist and former Bullfrog employee Gary Carr to return from The Bitmap Brothers (he had left Bullfrog because of a disagreement with Molyneux on Theme Park), but {{he was assigned to}} Theme Hospital instead. Healey produced 90 per cent of the graphics. Most of the creatures were the team members' ideas, although Molyneux was involved with the Imps. Healey designed the Horned Reaper (who is based on an ex-girlfriend of his), who ultimately become the game's mascot. According to Molyneux, each character takes 1024 <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> The game as it ended up was developed mostly in the final few months: the team started again from scratch long into the development cycle because they felt it played like Command & Conquer. Before the redesign, instead of having Imps dig the gold and minions entering through portals, the game had the player dig gold himself, and use it and mana to create minions. The redesign included the replacement of the 3D graphics engine with a 2D one and the rewriting of the user interface.|$|E

2500|$|The Homebrew Computer Club was {{an early}} {{computer}} hobbyist club in Palo Alto, CA.

He left with a computer kit with only 256 <b>bytes</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> At the April 16, 1975 club meeting Dompier keyed in a small program that played the song [...] "Fool on the Hill" [...] on a nearby AM radio. In the July 1975 Computer Notes, Bill Gates described this as [...] "the best demo program I've seen for the Altair…" [...] Gates could not figure out how the computer could broadcast to the radio.

50|$|As an example, {{a typical}} 1 GiB SDRAM memory module might contain eight {{separate}} one-gibibit DRAM chips, each offering 128 MiB of storage space.

50|$|Four {{registers}} {{are used}} to refer to four segments on the 16-bit x86 segmented memory architecture. DS (data segment), CS (code segment), SS (stack segment), and ES (extra segment).
