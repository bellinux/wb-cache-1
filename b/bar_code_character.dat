40|$|The {{availability}} of camera phones provides {{people with a}} mobile platform for decoding bar codes, whereas conventional scanners lack mobility. However, using a normal camera phone in such applications is challenging due to the out-of-focus problem. In this paper, we present the research effort on the bar code reading algorithms using a VGA camera phone, NOKIA 7650. EAN- 13, a widely used 1 D bar code standard, is taken as an example to show {{the efficiency of the}} method. A wavelet-based bar code region location and knowledge-based bar code segmentation scheme is applied to extract bar code characters from poor-quality images. All the segmented bar code characters are input to the recognition engine, and based on the recognition distance, the <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>character</b> string with the smallest total distance is output as the final recognition result of the bar code. In order to train an efficient recognition engine, the modified Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ) method is designed for optimizing a feature extraction matrix and the class reference vectors. 19 584 samples segmented from more than 1000 bar code images captured by NOKIA 7650 are involved in the training process. Testing on 292 bar code images taken by the same phone, the correct recognition rate of the entire bar code set reaches 85. 62 %. We are confident that auto focus or macro modes on camera phones will bring the presented method into real world mobile use...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- adi it ion ally, zero {{crossings}} {{of the second}} derivative provide edge features for the classification of blurred waveforms. The accuracy of these edge features deteriorates {{in the case of}} severely blurred images. In this paper, a new feature is presented that is more resistant to the blurring process, the image, and waveform peaks. In addition, an estimate of the standard deviation of the blurring kernel is used to perform minor deblurring of the waveform. Statistical pattern recognition is used to classify the peaks as <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> <b>characters.</b> The noise tolerance of this recognition algorithm is increased by using an adaptive, histogram-based technique to remove the noise. In a <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> environment that requires a misclassification rate of less than one in a million, the recognition algorithm showed a 43 % performance improvement over current commercial <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> reading equipment.

The thesis emphasizes radio frequency (RF) tag systems, but also presents an overview and comparison of six other automatic identification technologies (<b>bar</b> <b>codes,</b> optical <b>character</b> recognition, magnetic stripe, smart cards, optical cards, and voice recognition). The dynamics shaping the Army of the future, {{the characteristics of}} that Army, and {{the characteristics of the}} logistics system that will support it are discussed. Given those characteristics, potential logistic uses of automatic identification technologies (AIT) are considered. Recent Army applications are presented and the results and lessons learned evaluated.

40|$|RFID is a fast {{emerging}} {{automatic identification}} system. Its bigger data density, better security, high speed {{and the fact}} that it does not need mechanical contact or line of sight communication have made it preferable to many other identification systems such as <b>bar</b> <b>code,</b> optical <b>character</b> recognition, biometric identification and smart cards. Nevertheless, this fast growing technology faces some difficulties in keeping tags simple and low cost while keeping efficient and reliable communication. This thesis is among the solutions that are proposed to fulfill this goal. So far, readers usually have either linearly or circularly polarized antennas and most tags are linearly polarized. Linearly polarized reader antennas are highly sensitive to the orientation of tags. In addition, circularly polarized reader antennas have fields that rotate across a plane and thus have only 50 % polarization matching with tags. Accordingly, a dual linearly polarized patch antenna is proposed, implemented and tested as a solution to reduce the power loss caused by an arbitrary orientation of RFID tags. Among the RFID technologies, passive UHF RFID, which has a bigger read range and simpler tags, working in UHF frequency, is given emphasis in this project. Thus, background information about reader antennas and dual polarized antennas has been made. In addition, a reader antenna based on a patch antenna operating in European UHF RFID band of 865 MHz- 868 MHz is considered. The modeling softwares CST Microwave Studio and Empire XCcell were used in simulation. Then, the laboratory facility in Electronics department of Tampere University of Technology was used to implement and test the prototype. /Kir 1...|$|R

These <b>bar</b> <b>codes,</b> as input elements, are equivalent to a large number of similar keys for Bloom filter. When the hash functions of Bloom filter have some similar input elements, they may ignore the small differences, resulting in the hash function producing the same output on the similar elements and generating false positives [20]. Because a company’s <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> are easy to focus on one section, this will result in more false positives. However, each <b>bar</b> <b>code</b> is unique, and {{the difference between the two}} <b>bar</b> <b>codes</b> is certain.
