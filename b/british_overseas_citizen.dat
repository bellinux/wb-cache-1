25|$|The High Court {{ruled that}} Xenophon's {{status as a}} <b>British</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>citizen</b> did not fall within s 44(i), so {{that he had been}} validly elected. His {{resignation}} would create a casual vacancy, which would be filled in the usual way.|$|E
25|$|Any Hong Kong BDTCs {{who failed}} to {{register}} as a BN(O) by 1 July 1997 and would thereby be rendered stateless (generally because they were a non-ethnic Chinese and therefore could not automatically acquire Chinese nationality), automatically became a <b>British</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>Citizen</b> under the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August 2017, Nick Xenophon Team {{leader and}} Senator Nick Xenophon {{announced}} that British authorities had confirmed {{that he is}} a <b>British</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>citizen,</b> a lesser form of British nationality. His father was born in Cyprus when it was a British colony and possessed a British passport, with Senator Xenophon inheriting the citizenship from his father. He chose not resign from the Parliament in anticipation of the High Court decision. While Xenophon had made efforts to renounce any Greek or Cypriot citizenship he may have had, he was not aware that he may possess a form of British nationality until a journalist contacted him a few days prior, prompting him to seek clarification from British authorities.|$|E

25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a <b>British</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>citizen,</b> a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 October 2017 the High Court {{handed down}} its single joint judgment. In a {{unanimous}} judgment, the Court interpreted s 44(i) {{according to the}} [...] "ordinary and natural meaning" [...] of its language. [...] On that approach, it firstly affirmed the view taken in Sykes v Cleary {{that the question of}} eligibility is to be determined with reference to the point of nomination. [...] The Court then followed the reasoning of the majority in Sykes v Cleary. [...] It decided that the fact of citizenship was disqualifying, regardless of whether the person knew of the citizenship or engaged in any voluntary act of acquisition. It emphasised that to hold otherwise would introduce an element of subjectivity that [...] "would be inimical to the stability of representative government". It followed that each of Joyce, Ludlam, Nash, Roberts and Waters had been ineligible to be elected. However, Canavan and Xenophon had been eligible. It was determined that Canavan, under Italian law, was not a citizen of Italy. It was found that Xenophon was a <b>British</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>citizen,</b> but that this did not give him the right to enter or reside in the United Kingdom; therefore, for the purposes of s 44(i), he was neither a citizen nor entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen of the United Kingdom. The Court declared the seats of the ineligible members to be vacant; it ordered that the vacancy in the House of Representatives be filled through a by-election and that the vacancies in the Senate be filled by [...] "special counts" [...] (recounts or countbacks) of the ballot papers in each State, subject to supervision by a Justice of the Court. [...] At the directions hearing, the Chief Justice had approved the Commonwealth's undertaking to pay the costs of the referred parties and of Tony Windsor (intervening in the Joyce case).|$|E
