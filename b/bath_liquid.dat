50|$|A {{lambda point}} {{refrigerator}} is a device used to cool liquid helium, typically around a superconducting magnet or for low temperature measurements, from approximately 4.2 K to temperatures near the lambda point of helium (approximately 2.17 K), the temperature at which normal fluid helium (helium I) transitions to the superfluid helium II. Cooling {{is achieved by}} pumping the liquid helium in the bath through a cooling coil via a needle valve and vacuum pump. The reduced pressure in the coil causes some of the helium to evaporate, creating a two-phase system within the cooling coil. The heat removed via evaporation lowers {{the temperature of the}} cooling coil closer to the lambda point. Since the cooling coil is immersed in the liquid helium <b>bath,</b> <b>liquid</b> surrounding the coil is also cooled. The colder, higher density liquid sinks away from the coil toward the bottom of the bath while the warmer, lower density liquid helium rises to the top. Liquid helium typically has poor thermal conductivity, so convective currents associated with a temperature gradient in the bath provide a constant flow of this colder liquid helium toward the bottom of the bath, allowing temperatures below 4.2 K to be realized in the helium bath, typically close to 2.2 K.|$|E

Certain observations made, including a high-pitched sound, exhibited a striking similarity to the so-called ''singing flame'' phenomenon. Such dynamic plume behavior is attributed to the vaporization of the <b>bath</b> <b>liquid</b> due to reaction heat release.

40|$|An oil stream falling {{vertically}} into {{a stationary}} bath {{of the same}} liquid, if its flow speed is above a critical threshold, because of its viscous property, will induce a transition where a “cusp” on the free surface is “cracked” open by the jet.

However, results {{from the present study}} indicate that there is still some puzzling issue of this phenomenon, concerning the stability of the “cusp” before the transition. And this issue becomes more complicated when a constant bath motion is introduced. New “dynamical states” that are not possible when the bath is stationary can arise when energy is continuously supplied into the system by the externally driven constant flow of the <b>bath</b> <b>liquid.</b> Multiple “dynamical states” can exist for the same experimental conditions.

It {{is to be}} used by others to gain new knowledge about the solidification of matter by study of the crystallisation of hard sphere colloid samples that are an established model for the behaviour of some aspects of atoms. In this crystallisation spectrometer, expanded and collimated green laser light is Bragg scattered from the colloidal crystals as they form, and the diffracted light is focused by a liquid filled hollow glass hemispherical lens onto low cost CCD array detectors that are rotated about the optical axis to average the intensities around the whole Debye-Scherrer cone of scattered light. The temperature of the sample is controlled to +/- 0. 1 „a, and because of the ability to change the refractive index of the sample particles with temperature, this is utilised to control the amount of scattering from the sample Also, this spectrometer uniquely exploits the refractive index match of the colloidal particles, the solvent, the <b>bath</b> <b>liquid,</b> and the glass used for both the sample bottle and the hollow glass hemisphere. A unique facility has been incorporated to permit tumbling of the sample prior to the measurement commencing to shear-melt any pre-existing crystals.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to broaden}} our understanding on wrinkling instabilities occurring on floating polymeric sheets, {{and tries to}} establish innovative methods that exploit these patterns in studies on material behavior and interfacial phenomena. We will address three major topics in this thesis including, i) characterization of the conditions required to buckle an annular disc, ii) characterization of wrinkles occurring around a droplet/bubble placed on a membrane that is kept taut at the liquid-air interface, and iii) using wrinkling patterns as a probe to understand the interfacial behavior and dynamics of ultrathin films. The first project in {{this thesis is about}} a thin floating elastic disc wrinkled by a droplet cast at the center. First, we obtain a three dimensional map of the deformed surface using confocal fluorescent microscopy. Then, we study the identical films in an inverted geometry where an air bubble is in contact with the film from its underside. In this configuration, a high-resolution optical profilometer facilitated the topographical analysis, which provided the detailed elasto-capillary measures of the problem. Finally, we study the patterns as a function of boundary conditions and material properties, where physical properties of the sheet, such as molecular confinement and physical aging, also change the size and wavelength of the pattern. The wrinkle patterns are also characterized in response to the change in surface tension of the <b>bath</b> <b>liquid</b> {{with the aid of a}} Langmuir Trough. This experimental set-up also facilitates the pattern formation on annular elastic discs, when variable peripheral forces create contraction within the film. Here, planar capillary forces dictate the controlled boundary conditions and probe a regime of deformation where the wrinkle length and the wavelength are empirically related. We should emphasize that the wrinkling of an annulus does not merely mimic the original droplet experiment, also leading to several remarkable discoveries. First, we observe that, in the studied thickness regime (e. g. the scaled extent and wavelength of wrinkles) observed for a range of thicknesses can be superimposed on another by displacing the data towards the hypothetical threshold required to wrinkle the zero-thickness sheet. We observe another thickness invariant phenomenon when the conditions of fold formation are found similar for films of identical annular aspect ratios. Finally, we study the time-dependent change in wrinkles forming on viscoelastic membranes. The dynamic behaviors of wrinkles are related to the rheological characteristics of polymer molecules of linear architecture confined into thicknesses comparable to their melt radius of gyration. In this study, we have found that the normalized size of wrinkles could be a measure of the stress and strain exerted by a droplet. We also have demonstrated that confinement significantly influences the dynamics of PS films. We close this chapter demonstrating that the wrinkling dynamics is related to the kinematics of the film under the droplet, and generally compares to the stress relaxation experiments performed on bulk samples...|$|E
