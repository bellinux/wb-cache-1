The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we present {{evidence}} that 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) affects agonistic behavior in male lobsters and that male and female animals differ in their aggressive behaviors. Thirty-minute staged fights were conducted between large males exposed to either artificial seawater (ASW) or 20 E and small, anosmic opponents. The nephropores of both combatants were blocked. Fights were videotaped and quantitatively analyzed for aggressive, defensive, avoidance and all behaviors using an ethogram in which behaviors are ranked according to aggressiveness (Mello et al, 1999). ^ Twenty-hydroxyecdysone-exposed male animals performed more defensive <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> ASW-exposed controls, while the small opponents of 20 E-exposed animals performed more aggressive <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> small control counterparts, in response to changes in their large opponent. Lobsters in fights with 20 E-exposed animals performed more <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> lobsters in fights with ASW-exposed animals; the differences in frequency of all behaviors between combatants was less in fights with 20 E-exposed animals. A post-hoc analysis revealed that large ASW-exposed males performed more defensive <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> large ASW-exposed females, and small ASW-exposed males performed more total, aggressive and defensive <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> small ASW-exposed females. The total aggressive intensity in fights with female lobsters was higher than in fights with male lobsters. Our results indicate that 20 E affects the agonistic behavior of {{both male and female}} lobsters. The findings also indicate that the patterns of agonistic behavior are different for males and females, but that it may be incorrect to characterize either sex as more aggressive. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the portrayal of active and passive behaviors {{of male and female}} characters in Walt Disney Studio original animated films. It was hypothesized that males would exhibit more active <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> their female counterparts and that females would exhibit more passive <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> their male counterparts. The results indicated that both of these hypotheses were supported. The study also found that the least likely interaction of male and female characters was when the male character was being passive and the female character was being active. The most likely was male characters performing active behaviors and female characters performing passive behaviors. There was also evidence discovered that newer Disney films portray female protagonists performing more active <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> older Disney films but male characters were not shown to have any differences in behaviors between older and newer films. There is also a discussion how these findings might affect the population viewing the results through cultivation theory and suggestions for further research on the subject...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} factors affecting domestic violence risk behaviors among Thai Muslim married couples in Satun Province. The data were collected from 1, 920 wives as representatives of families, and analyzed using the R program to find out frequencies, percentages, chi-square test, odds ratios, and logistic coefficients. The results revealed that 34. 3 percent of Thai Muslim married couples in Satun Province had domestic violence risk behaviors, and the factors affecting domestic risk behaviors with statistical significance consisted of six variables, namely jealous wives, suspicious wives, drinking husbands, drug abusive husbands, being not ready to have one's own family, and lack of time for discussions. Married couples who had high domestic violence risk behaviors were those with wives who were regularly jealous, and those with wives who were occasionally jealous were 3. 70 times, and 3. 43 times more likely to have risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> those with wives who were never jealous; those with wives who were regularly suspicious, and those with wives who were occasionally suspicious were 3. 19 times, and 1. 76 times more likely to have risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> those with wives who were never suspicious; those with husbands who regularly drank, and those with husbands who occasionally drank were 2. 14 times, and 1. 41 times more likely to have risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> those with husbands who never drank alcohol; those with husbands who regularly used drugs, and those with husbands who occasionally used drugs were 1. 86 times, and 1. 39 times more likely to have risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> those with husbands who never used drugs; married couples who were not ready, and those who were moderately ready to have their own families were 1. 79 times, and 1. 44 times more likely to have risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> those who were very ready to have a family, and married couples who did not have time for discussions, and those who moderately had time for discussions were 1. 72 times, and 1. 47 times more likely to have risk <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> those who had a lot of time for discussions...|$|R

30|$|One {{might even}} further argue that because {{psychological}} states (e.g. intentions, stress) are not tangible in nature, laypeople may actually {{see them as}} being more abstract than biological states, which refer to tangible things such as the physical brain. Furthermore, from a reductionist viewpoint, biological explanations would be considered lower level explanations for <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> psychological explanations for the same behaviors. Within the hierarchy of levels of explanation, psychological explanations are more abstract than biological ones, being relatively lacking in concrete, physically grounded detail (e.g. Dennett, 1971).

25|$|Skinner {{believed}} that effective teaching {{must be based}} on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing <b>behavior</b> <b>than</b> punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of rote learning and punitive discipline in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.|$|E
25|$|The {{potency of}} the {{personal}} self and relational ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and relational ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and relational ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group <b>behavior</b> <b>than</b> previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{males in}} {{competitive}} sports are often advised by their coaches {{not to be}} in intimate relationships based on the premises that they become more docile and less aggressive during an athletic event. The circumstances in which males and females experience aggression are also different. A study showed that social anxiety and stress was positively correlated with aggression in males, meaning as stress and social anxiety increases so does aggression. Furthermore, a male with higher social skills has a lower rate of aggressive <b>behavior</b> <b>than</b> a male with lower social skills. In females, higher rates of aggression were only correlated with higher rates of stress. Other than biological factors that contribute to aggression there are physical factors are well.|$|E

25|$|Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, and Loomis {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} 2001, testing Argyle and Dean's (1965) equilibrium theory's speculation of an inverse relationship between mutual gaze, a nonverbal cue signaling intimacy, and interpersonal distance. Participants were immersed in a 3D virtual room in which a virtual human representation (that is, an embodied agent) stood. The focus {{of this study is}} on the subtle nonverbal exchanges that occur between a person and an embodied agent. Participants in the study clearly did not treat the agent as a mere animation. On the contrary, the results suggest that, in virtual environments, people were influenced by the 3D model and respected personal space of the humanoid representation. The result of the experiment also indicated that women are more affected by the gaze behaviors of the agent and adjust their personal space more accordingly than do men. However, men do subjectively assign gaze behavior to the agent, and their proxemic behavior reflects this perception. Furthermore, both men and women demonstrate less variance in their proxemic behavior when the agent displays mutual gaze <b>behavior</b> <b>than</b> when the agent does not.|$|E

25|$|Productive {{behavior}} {{is defined as}} employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during {{which he or she}} may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee. I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive <b>behavior</b> <b>than</b> job or task performance, including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual <b>behavior</b> <b>than</b> their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E

Sixteen teachers were interviewed for the qualitative study. It was found that: teachers refer more males than females to special education for having a behavior disorder; females {{are more likely to}} be referred to guidance counselor as a means of addressing emotional/behavioral concerns within the school setting; within the classroom males tend to demonstrate more externalizing behaviors and females more internalizing behaviors; and teachers tend to demonstrate more leniency with females in the discipline process. In addition, two findings emerged from the interview process: teachers are aware that girls and boys manage their psychological difficulties in disparate ways, girls seek help from their peer group and guidance counselors whereas males are much less likely to verbalize their difficulties; and teachers perceive girls as managing their psychological difficulties in ways that enable them to obtain support for their problems. For the quantitative study, 60 teachers completed a modified version of the Achenbach Teacher Report Form that contained scales associated with the Internalizing and Externalizing factors. Results indicated that: males experiencing psychological difficulties demonstrate significantly more externalizing <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> females experiencing psychological difficulties; males experiencing psychological difficulties demonstrate significantly more externalizing <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> males referred to special education for having a behavior disorder; females experiencing psychological difficulties demonstrate significantly more internalizing <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> males experiencing psychological difficulties; and males referred to special education demonstrate significantly more internalizing <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> males who are experiencing psychological difficulties. The quantitative results indicate that teachers utilize a gender neutral set of criteria when referring students to special education for a behavior disorder. Consequently, females who demonstrate internalizing behaviors may be overlooked within the current formal special education referral system. ...|$|R
40|$|The initial session {{play therapy}} {{behaviors}} of maladjusted and adjusted children {{were compared to}} investigate the value of children's play for diagnostic purposes. The frequency {{and the intensity of}} 13 categories of play behaviors were considered as factors in discriminating maladjusted children from adjusted children. The 15 children in the maladjusted group had been referred by their parents for counseling but had not been in counseling previously, and their teachers had reported that they had exhibited two or more behaviors indicative of emotional disturbance. The 15 children in the adjusted group were rated by their teachers as exhibiting none of the behaviors Indicating emotional disturbance, and their parents recognized no need for counseling. All subjects were 5 to 9 years of age, and the two groups were matched for age and sex. The Play Behaviors Adjustment Rating Scale (PBARS) was used to rate each child's play behaviors in an initial videotaped 36 -minute play therapy session. The frequency and the intensity were rated for thirteen play categories: exploratory, incidental, creative or coping, dramatic or role, relationship building, relationship testing, self-accepting, self-rejecting, acceptance of environment, nonacceptance of environment, positive attitudinal, ambivalent attitudinal, and negative attitudinal. The results of the chi-square analysis indicated that maladjusted children exhibited significantly more self-accepting and nonacceptance of environment behaviors as well as more intense dramatic or role behaviors and acceptance of environment <b>behaviors</b> <b>than</b> did adjusted children.
