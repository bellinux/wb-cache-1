It was included on Beyoncé's 2009 remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News described the video as a [...] "meaningful one—and {{it comes with}} a twist that requires repeat viewing". She noted that if the video did not exist, she would not have seen the tomboy side of Beyoncé. A writer for Rap-Up commented, [...] "Beyoncé delivers one of the year's best videos with the black and white clip." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! Online praised the video, writing that it has a [...] "serious melodramatic storyline". She further noted that it was [...] "slow and everyone overacts, <b>but</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> catch the end where a major twist will probably change your outlook on the dynamics of male–female relationships forever".|$|E

Le Balafre has come to look for a young arm, on which he may lean, and to find a son, that when he is gone his lodge may not be empty.

"Don't affright yourself, Prince," [...] {{replied the}} Fairy; [...] "you ran a risk in {{fetching}} the Water of the Fountain of Lions for your father, but there's no danger {{in finding out}} this man, who is my brother Schaibar, but is so far from being like me, though we both had the same father, that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks of his resentment for a slight offense; yet, on the other hand, is so good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire. He is made exactly as the Sultan your father has described him, and has no other arms than a bar of iron of five hundred pounds weight, without which he never stirs, and which makes him respected.

6000|$|... [305] This is {{a solemn}} {{period in the}} Christian's pilgrimage. In the Heavenly Footman, Bunyan has given some admirable general directions--'Because I would have you think of them, take all in short in this little bit of paper--1. Get into the way. 2. Then study on it. 3. Then strip and lay aside {{everything}} that would hinder. 4. Beware of by-paths. 5. Do not gaze and stare much about thee; <b>but</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> ponder the path of thy feet. 6. Do not stop for any that call after thee, {{whether it be the}} world, the flesh, or the devil; for all these will hinder thy journey if possible. 7. Be not daunted with any discouragements thou meetest with as thou goest. 8. Take heed of stumbling at the Cross. And, 9. Cry hard to God for an enlightened heart and a willing mind, and God give thee a prosperous journey. Yet, before I do quite take my leave of thee, a few motives. It may be they will be as good as a pair of spurs, to prick on thy lumpish heart in this rich voyage. If thou winnest, then Heaven, God, Christ, glory eternal is thine. If thou lose, thou procurest eternal death.'--(ED).|$|E
6000|$|I {{should like}} to get {{something}} for everybody, {{but that is not}} possible. Luckily, my lessons are less expensive than I expected, and, considering the work, wonderfully cheap. I make good progress, I can say; but the difficulty is great enough to discourage any but a real [...] "grinder" [...] at such work. I have written a scrap for Father, and you will see that I am working away pretty well. I have finished my introductory book, consisting of forty-one fables; and though difficulties present themselves always to really good scholars from time to time, the Bible {{is not one of the}} hardest books, not so hard, e.g. as the Koran. Now I can at any future time, if the opportunity comes, go on with these things, and I hope find them really useful. I know you like to hear what I am doing; <b>but</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> keep it all quiet, let no one know but Father and Joan. You might carelessly tell it to anyone in fun, and I don't wish it to be known. Especially don't let any of the family know. Time enough if I live out my Oxford year, and have really mastered the matter pretty well. Remember this is taken up with a view to elucidate and explain what is so very hard in Hebrew. Hebrew is to be the Hauptsache, this the Hulfsmittel, or some day I hope one of several such helps. It is very important to accustom one's mind to the Denk and Anschauungswerk of the Orientals, which is so different from that of Europeans or their language. How hard are the metaphors of the Bible for this reason!' ...|$|E

The old man set him to keep some rooms clean and scatter sand on the floor, told him where to find food and let him wear {{clothing}} that was there, and forbade him to enter one room. The boy immediately cleaned nothing but his own room, and then, after some days, went into the room. He found a heap of bones and some books; he took one book, found it was magical, and learned shapeshifting from it. He ran away to home, but his father thought he had stolen the fine clothing and sent him off. The boy told him to sell the dog he would find by the door the next day, <b>but</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> take the strap back. The dog appeared, and at his wife's insistence, the father sold it and kept the strap. When the boy appeared again, his father still would not admit him. The boy told him to sell a cow that would appear the next day, and to the king, but he must take its halter and come back by the forest. The cow appeared, and the man sold it, but when the butcher went to kill it, it turned to a dove and flew off. The king sent men after the man, but he had gone by the forest, and they did not find him.|$|E

40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{survey research}} aimed {{to describe what}} agriculture educators {{found to be the}} most effective recruitment topics in urban programs in Arizona, as well as describe demographic data to provide educators with a baseline of information to evaluate their recruitment efforts. All urban agriculture teachers were given a web-based questionnaire and instructed to select the topics used during recruitment activities, then rank their effectiveness using a five-point Likert scale. Results indicate that a wide range of topics are utilized during recruitment and that McClelland's Acquired Needs serves as a strong framework for recruitment with all topics being ranked at moderately effective or higher. Achievement is perceived as more effective than power or affiliation. It is recommended that agriculture educators continue to use topics under all three needs, <b>but</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> emphasize achievement based topics...|$|E
40|$|Using five {{critical}} levels of evaluation, you can improve your school's professional development program. <b>But</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> {{start with the}} desired result—improved student outcomes. Educators have long considered professional development to be their right—something they deserve as dedicated and hardworking individuals. But legislators and policymakers have recently begun to question that right. As education budgets grow tight, they look at what schools spend on professional development and want to know, Does the investment yield tangible payoffs or could that money be spent in better ways? Such questions make effective evaluation of professional development programs more important than ever. Traditionally, educators haven't {{paid much attention to}} evaluating their professional development efforts. Many consider evaluation a costly, time-consuming process that diverts attention from more important activities such as planning, implementation, and follow-up. Others feel they lack the skill and expertise to become involved in rigorous evaluations; as a result, they either neglect evaluation issues completely or leave them to "evaluation experts. "...|$|E
