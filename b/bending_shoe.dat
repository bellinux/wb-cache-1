This constitutive law was implemented in the finite element software CODE-ASTER (Abbas and Baranger 2010). Then, numerical results of the bending behaviour of a simple geometric shoe sole model are compared to experimental measurements obtained with a stereoscopic vision system. Finally, an industrial application of dynamic <b>bending</b> sole <b>shoe</b> is presented and experimental results and simulated load history are compared...|$|R

Farriers may either cold shoe, in which he <b>bends</b> the metal <b>shoe</b> without heating it, or hot shoe, in which he places the metal in a forge before bending it. Hot shoeing can be more time-consuming, and requires the farrier {{to have access to}} a forge; however, it usually provides a better fit, as the mark made on the hoof from the hot shoe can show how even it lies. It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that increasing the longitudinal bending stiffness of sprinting footwear can lead to improved sprinting performance although this {{has not yet been}} established. This study examined the effect of four known shoe stiffness conditions on both sprinting performance and metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) motion. Twelve trained sprinters performed 40 m maximal sprints along an indoor running track, two sprints in each stiffness condition, and high-speed video (600 Hz) recorded two-dimensional MTPJ motion during ground contact. To explore individual responses to the footwear manipulations, three-dimensional (1000 Hz) kinematic and kinetic data were collected during maximal sprinting for two sprinters. At the group-level, increasing <b>shoe</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness elicited no significant differences in sprinting performance or MTPJ motion, with any changes between conditions being subject-specific. In-depth individual analyses revealed that increased shoe stiffness could restrict motion about the MTPJ and there appeared to be a preferred stiffness for best performance.

Manolo Blahnik himself opined that [...] "the secret of toe cleavage, {{a very important part of}} the sexuality of the shoe" [...] is that [...] "You must only show the first two cracks.". In one of his many [...] "InStyle" [...] magazine articles, Samuel Ogden writes about the low cut angle in the <b>bend</b> of the <b>shoe</b> cover. The curve creates a balance between the skin of the lower foot and the beginning of the toes.

In flip-flops you see everything but that is not at all sexy."

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the federal {{judiciary}} has struggled to reconcile {{the conflict between the}} territorial restrictions of International Shoe 2 ̆ 7 s framework for personal jurisdiction and cybersquatting claims filed pursuant to the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA). The International Shoe framework conditions the exercise of personal jurisdiction on a geographic nexus between a nonresident defendant and the forum state. Logically, this rubric is at odds with cybersquatting [...] a form of trademark infringement entirely within the virtual confines of the Internet. In uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy Group, Inc., the Seventh Circuit upheld personal jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation accused of cybersquatting by <b>bending</b> the International <b>Shoe</b> framework beyond its breaking point. Although this opinion will surely become the darling of future plaintiffs in cybersquatting suits, the divergent analyses used by the court majority and concurrence demonstrate why cybersquatting has outgrown the limitations of International Shoe. This Note will argue that the proper means of resolving the disjunction between International Shoe and cybersquatting lies with Congress, rather than the federal courts. Thus, namely, a congressional amendment to the ACPA that provides for nationwide service of process will allow the federal judiciary to continue reaching the equitable decision seen in GoDaddy [...] without setting dangerous precedent that eviscerates the jurisdictional framework of International Shoe...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Composites Part B and the definitive published version is available at [URL] polyurethane (PU) elastomers are used as shoe-sole materials due to many excellent properties but their inelastic deformation is a serious deficiency for such applications. Hence, graphene oxide (GO) was introduced into the synthesized thermoplastic PU to produce a GO/PU composite material with enhanced properties. Plastic behaviour of this composite was assessed in cyclic tensile tests, demonstrating reduction of irreversible deformations {{with the addition of}} GO. Additionally, in order to evaluate mechanical performance of PU and the GO/PU composite under conditions of large-deflection <b>bending</b> typical for <b>shoe</b> soles, finite-element simulations with Abaqus/Standard were conducted. An elastic-plastic finite-element model was developed to obtain detailed mechanical information for PU and the GO/PU composite. The numerical study demonstrated that the plastic area, final specific plastic dissipation energy and residual height for PU specimens were significantly larger than those for the GO/PU composite. Besides, the addition of GO into the PU matrix greatly delayed the onset of plastic deformation in PU in a large-deflection bending process. The average residual height and final specific plastic dissipation energy for PU were approximately 5. 6 and 17. 7 times as large as those for the studied GO/PU composite. The finite-element analysis provided quantification of the effect of GO enhancement on the large-deflection bending performance of PU for regimes typical for shoe soles and {{can be used as a}} basis for optimization of real composite products...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{physical}} burden for teachers in kindergartens {{in relation to the}} occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders among teachers. The main objective was to examine the physical demands of the profession of preschools educational staff. The work is divided into theoretical part and practical part. The research was conducted using qualitative method of semi-structured interviews with kindergartens teachers and LIFT / BEND score calculation. Fifteen teachers from three of kindergartens in the South Bohemian region participated in this research. Data from the interviews were evaluated by encoding method according to Švaříček and Šedivová (2007) and divided into schemes with a description. LIFT/BEND score was calculated according to Kovářová (2006) methodology. The calculation was based on the evaluation of the frequency of lifting, bending and handling of children. Reasearch questions were also answerd during the reasearch. The first research question contains "Is there a difference in the frequency of performing physically challenging activities in relation to the length of work experience in preschool facilities?" It was found that there is no difference between teachers in physical performance in relation to the length the practice. The analysis was performed using the LIFT / BEND score calcutation and testimonies of teachers in the interviews. The majority of teachers with the length of service over 20 years stated that avoids positions and activities that are unpleasant to them, such as kneeling, tying childrens <b>shoes,</b> <b>bending</b> over tables and more. Frequency of activities between younger and older teachers are not much different, but differ in subjective way of carrying out physically demanding tasks. The second research question is: "Is age a significant variable in the occurrence of musculoskeletal diseases?" From the primary perspective can be determined that age gains more musculoskeletal trouble, but according to the testimony of teachers and statistical evaluation, this relationship has not been confirmed. Age of teachers is not prerequisite for the development of musculoskeletal problems. According to nonparametric Spearman correlation this relationship is not statistically significant. From the findings of this research as well as international authors who have examined the relationship between physical load of lifting and bending while performing work in the so-called helping profession, age factor and length of service exhibits no significant importance, and vice versa occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders significantly affects the way of carrying out these activities in terms of their proper implementation. Therefore it should be ensured that teachers recieve education in health during preparations for their future careers...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} the bending stiffness of footwear can be adapted to influence sprinting performance. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} to achieve maximal performance, the mechanical properties of this footwear needs customising to an individual athlete. Due to a lack of detailed biomechanical data, the influence of longitudinal bending stiffness on the dynamics of the lower extremity during sprint running remains largely unexplained and is subject to considerable speculation. Thus, the aim of this work is to develop functional sprint footwear in a range of different longitudinal bending stiffnesses in order to explore the effects on measures of sprinting performance and lower extremity dynamics. Novel mechanical test procedures were developed and benchmark properties of current commercial sprint spikes were ascertained. Bending stiffness data showed considerable variability amongst those sprint spikes aimed at athletes of a higher competitive standard, which indicates that there is no consensus regarding optimum stiffness. A kinematic analysis of barefoot and shod sprinting was undertaken to investigate the influence of sprint footwear on lower extremity kinematics. Medial and lateral sagittal plane data were collected at the start and in the acceleration (10 m) and maximal speed (50 m) phases of a 100 m distance. Metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) angular range and velocity were significantly reduced in sprint spikes compared to barefoot conditions and the magnitude of the controlling affect was larger at 10 m compared to 50 m. Selective laser sintering of nylon was used to produce a number of sprint shoe sole units each of different thickness. These were attached to standard uppers to produce a range of longitudinal bending stiffnesses encompassing those already commercially available. The influence of shoe stiffness on sprinting perfonnance was assessed using specific jump metrics that were selected for use based on their high correlations with sprinting perfonnance during starting and maximal speed sprinting. Results indicated that sprint <b>shoe</b> longitudinal <b>bending</b> stiffness influenced the dynamics of the lower extremity during squat and bounce drop jumps. The relationship between maximal perfonnance and shoe stiffness was specific to the jump metric; best performance was achieved in intermediate stiffness shoes for the squat jumps and high stiffness for bounce drop jumps. Six bespoke pairs of sprint <b>shoes</b> with <b>bending</b> stiffness spanning and exceeding that of current commercial sprint spikes were developed. Results showed that MPJ and ankle joint dynamics were affected by longitudinal bending stiffness during squat and bounce drop jumps. Angular velocities of the MP and ankle joints were significantly reduced with increasing longitudinal bending stiffness. For the squat jump, ankle joint moments increased with <b>shoe</b> longitudinal <b>bending</b> stiffness and reached an individually optimal level within the stiffness range. This was also the case for ankle joint power and mechanical energy. The bounce drop jump saw mechanical energy generation at the MPJ increase with <b>shoe</b> longitudinal <b>bending</b> stiffness. Different levels of longitudinal bending stiffness were required for maximal performance in each jump type. This infers that sprint <b>shoe</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness requirements may vary according to the phase of the race. Furthermore, individual responses to different stiffnesses highlighted the importance of personalising mechanical properties to the requirements of a particular athlete for maximal performance. This research has focused on the use of discrete jump metrics to assess performance and therefore future work should aim to investigate the implications of different stiffness conditions using measures of actual sprinting. Also, further detailed musculoskeletal explorations are required in order to fully understand the precise mechanism by which longitudinal bending stiffness influences performance...|$|R
