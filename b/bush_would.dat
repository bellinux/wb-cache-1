5|$|Since then, Clinton {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{a number of other}} diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009. In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery. Clinton continues to visit Haiti to witness the inauguration of refugee villages, and to raise funds for victims of the earthquake. In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> have had to win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn {{a majority of the}} vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks. They especially feared a repetition of the Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people. Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit. Police seized guns, explosives, bomb-making booklets and 4,000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden, and believed that the suspects were members of the radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam, thought to be linked with al-Qaeda. On June 24 two bombs also exploded. One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people (including the bomber), the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> be staying. Additionally, on June 25, explosives were found in a parked car at Istanbul's main airport.|$|E
50|$|On February 22, 2008, {{officials}} at Southern Methodist University {{reported that the}} final details of the agreement between {{the university and the}} <b>Bush</b> Foundation <b>would</b> be finalized, clearing the way for an official announcement that the George W. <b>Bush</b> Library <b>would</b> be built at SMU. The university soon officially confirmed the signed agreement.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their farm, the Bushes ran a roadside hotel for free. Wayfarers traveling between Cowlitz Landing and Puget Sound liked to stop there. It was open to anyone who came through the area. The <b>Bushes</b> <b>would</b> give visitors a good square meal and gave gifts of grain and fruit grown on the Bush farm.|$|R

25|$|This was {{the first}} college {{football}} game to feature two Heisman Trophy winners in the same starting lineup. USC's quarterback Matt Leinart and running back Reggie Bush won the award in 2004 and 2005, respectively, although <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> later forfeit the award.|$|E

25|$|The first {{independent}} {{recount of}} undervotes {{was conducted by}} the Miami Herald and USA Today.

25|$|The U.S. presidential {{election}} of 2000 between Al Gore and George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> play {{out to a}} great degree in Tallahassee. Bush won the election night vote count in Florida by a little over 1000 votes. Florida state law provided for an automatic recount due to the small margins.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, Bush joined Tenet Healthcare's {{board of}} directors. The {{following}} August, Bush joined investment bank, Lehman Brothers, {{as an adviser}} in its private equity group.

60|$|In the end, it is {{only this}} robust, sap-like faith which keeps man going. He may live on for many generations inside {{the shelter of the}} social {{establishment}} which he has erected for himself, as pear-trees and currant <b>bushes</b> <b>would</b> go on bearing fruit for many seasons, inside a walled garden, even if the race of man were suddenly exterminated. But bit by bit the wall-fruit-trees would gradually pull down the very walls that sustained them. Bit by bit every establishment collapses, unless it is renewed or restored by living hands, all the while.|$|R

25|$|After the summit, <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> seek {{cooperative}} {{relations with}} Gorbachev throughout {{the remainder of}} his term, believing that the Soviet leader was the key to peacefully ending the Soviet domination Eastern Europe. When Lithuania declared independence from the USSR in 1990, Bush avoided criticizing Gorbachev out of the fear of undermining or alienating the Soviet leader. He did, however, pressure Gorbachev to begin negotiations with the Lithuanian government.|$|E
25|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} during Bush's 2000 campaign that <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> appoint Miers {{to the position}} of Attorney General. This was seen as possible with her trusted role as Bush's personal attorney and her many appointments during his tenure as governor. This also recalled William French Smith, who was Ronald Reagan's personal attorney before being named Attorney General. Miers was not chosen and John Ashcroft became Attorney General instead.|$|E

[...] The view {{played an important role in}} situating and designing the house, as did the breezes and the direction of the sun. During the design process, Heymann would outline potential layouts in the ground and the <b>Bushes</b> <b>would</b> stand there visualizing what the house would look like in each setting.|$|R
25|$|Lipstick on a pig: Obama {{used this}} phrase to insinuate that any changes that McCain was advocating from the {{policies}} of George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad. Some called it sexist, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during the Republican convention that {{the only difference between}} a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick.|$|E
25|$|A {{longtime}} Democratic supporter, with {{a history}} of donating to many Democratic campaigns, including regular donations to Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Redstone endorsed Republican George W. Bush over Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, allegedly because he argued that <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> be better for his company and the economy. Despite this public endorsement, he donated money to Kerry during the primaries and was involved in the Rathergate scandal meant to hurt Bush's reelection.|$|E
25|$|Of Harris's {{three primary}} opponents, only Will McBride {{endorsed}} her candidacy {{for the general}} election. In {{the first few days}} after the primary, a number of Republican nominees such as Charlie Crist and Tom Lee went on a statewide unity tour with Gov. Bush. Harris was not invited; Republicans said the tour was only for nominees to statewide offices. Harris claimed <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> campaign with her sometime in the two months before the election, but the governor's office denied this.|$|E

But another footstep had caught the lover's ear, and he was already nearly beyond the sound of the girl's silvery voice. Still Hetty, bent only on her own thoughts and purposes, continued to speak, though the gentleness of her tones prevented the sounds from penetrating far into the woods. On the water they were more widely diffused.|$|R

25|$|Bush asked former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney {{to head up}} a team to help {{select a}} running mate for him, but ultimately, Bush decided that Cheney himself should be the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not {{specifically}} disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both {{of his or her}} votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident of Texas for nearly 10 years—changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Askew was re-elected, with J. H. Williams as {{his running}} mate. He is one of just five Florida Governors to have been elected for two terms (the others were LeRoy Collins, Bob Graham, Lawton Chiles, Jeb Bush, and Rick Scott). Askew was the first Governor to serve two full {{four-year}} terms (Collins was elected to a two-year term followed by a four-year term, Graham resigned shortly {{before the end of}} his second term to become U.S. Senator, and Chiles died in office {{near the end of his}} second term; <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> later become the second Florida Governor to serve two full four-year terms, while Scott is as of 2016 in the midst of his second four-year term).|$|E
25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. <b>Bush</b> <b>would</b> later say that he wished he had never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E
