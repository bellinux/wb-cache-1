Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% <b>by</b> <b>weight)</b> of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E
