5|$|Nevertheless, some Han {{literary}} sources provide crucial information. As {{written by}} Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the belt drive {{was first used}} for a quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the <b>bobbins</b> of weaver shuttles. The invention of the belt drive was a crucial {{first step in the}} development of later technologies during the Song dynasty, such as the chain drive and spinning wheel.|$|E
5|$|The 18th-century caricaturist and satirical poet John Collier, {{who used}} the {{pseudonym}} Tim <b>Bobbins,</b> was born in Urmston in 1708. A self-styled Lancashire Hogarth, his first and most famous work, A View of the Lancashire Dialect, or, Tummus and Mary, appeared in 1746, the earliest significant piece of published Lancashire dialect. A local public house, The Tim Bobbin, is named after him.|$|E

50|$|If {{the tension}} band were {{extremely}} tight and the <b>bobbin</b> could not rotate at all, yarn {{would be taken}} up onto the <b>bobbin</b> by {{the rotation of the}} flyer constantly at a rate of one wrap per revolution of the flyer. In practice, the tension is set such that the <b>bobbin</b> can slip, but with some drag, generating the differential rate of rotation between the flyer and the <b>bobbin.</b> This drag is the force which winds new yarn onto the <b>bobbin.</b>|$|R
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using <b>bobbins</b> or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings. At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were fitted with <b>bobbins</b> to overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bobbins</b> {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} West Yorkshire town of Tackleford, England and focused on the lives of the staff of the fictional City Limit magazine. The webcomic won a few awards, and <b>Bobbins</b> {{discontinuation}} in 2002 was followed by the start of Scary Go Round, which shares most of <b>Bobbins</b> cast.|$|E
50|$|The {{making of}} <b>bobbin</b> lace {{was easier to}} learn than the {{elaborate}} cutwork of the 16th century, and the tools and materials for making linen <b>bobbin</b> lace were inexpensive. There was a ready market for <b>bobbin</b> lace of all qualities, and women throughout Europe soon took up the craft which earned a better income than spinning, sewing, weaving or other home-based textile arts. <b>Bobbin</b> lace-making was established in charity schools, almshouses, and convents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bobbin</b> lacemaking in Italy {{dates back}} to the 16th century when the main centres were Genoa and Milan, {{although}} Venice also made <b>bobbin</b> lace.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bobbin</b> lace: {{also one}} of the popular {{traditional}} items. The most famous Czech <b>bobbin</b> lace products are made in Vamberk, a city in Eastern Bohemia.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, <b>Bobbins</b> and Goats {{produced}} two crossovers starting April Fool's Day. In 2001, Allison started producing <b>Bobbins</b> with vector art, {{resulting in a}} more stiff, but visually clean look.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, <b>Bobbins</b> was {{nominated}} for the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards categories Best Use of Color, Best Site Design and Best Female Character (Shelley Winters). In June the same year, <b>Bobbins</b> was Runner-up best online comic strip in the UK National Comic Awards.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bobbins</b> is a webcomic {{written by}} John Allison. It ran from 21 September 1998 to 3 June 2002, but shifted into reruns with {{commentary}} on 17 May 2002. It has made occasional returns in John Allison's website in between his other comics since 2013. Webcomics portal Keenspot kept the <b>Bobbins</b> archive freely accessible online, but the archives eventually moved to Allison's own site.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bobbin</b> Head is a {{point on}} Cowan Creek {{in the north of}} the suburb of North Turramurra, New South Wales, Australia. It is a [...] "near-urban" [...] part of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. <b>Bobbin</b> Head is easily reached by taking <b>Bobbin</b> Head Road through North Turramurra or Kuringai Chase Road, Mount Colah near Hornsby.|$|R
25|$|The {{transverse}} {{shuttle is}} a method to drive a <b>bobbin</b> on a sewing machine so as to create the lockstitch technique. Transverse shuttles carry the <b>bobbin</b> in a boat-shaped shuttle, and reciprocate the shuttle along a straight horizontal shaft. As the earliest of <b>bobbin</b> drivers, the transverse shuttle was patented by Elias Howe on September 10, 1846.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bobbin</b> lace {{ground is}} the regular small mesh filling the open spaces of {{continuous}} <b>bobbin</b> lace. Other names for <b>bobbin</b> lace ground are net or réseau (French for network). The precise {{course of the}} threads and the resultant shape of the ground are an important diagnostic feature in lace identification, as different lace styles use different grounds.|$|R
25|$|Various tools enable and {{optimize}} fly tying. Skip Morris, {{a professional}} fly tyer, lists the essential tools {{as being a}} vise to hold the hook of the fly to be tied, <b>bobbins,</b> a magnifying glass for delicate work, hackle pliers, hackle gauges, lights, hair stackers, and scissors. Other optional tools are pliers, toothpicks, bodkins, dubbing twisters, blenders, floss <b>bobbins,</b> whip finishers, wing burners and bobbin threaders.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the process}} where each of the <b>bobbins</b> is rewound to give a tighter bobbin.|$|E
25|$|Allison stopped <b>Bobbins</b> in 2002, so {{he could}} focus on his new webcomic, titled Scary Go Round (SGR). Most of the main {{characters}} followed him, and SGR, although originally {{intended to be a}} spin-off focusing on the minor characters Tessa Davies and Rachel Dukakis-Monteforte, eventually ended up with roughly the same cast as the end of <b>Bobbins,</b> though a number of new characters were introduced later.|$|E
5000|$|Bobbin: A small spool {{of thread}} inside the rotary hook housing of a sewing machine. The <b>bobbin</b> thread forms the {{stitches}} {{on the underside}} of the garment. <b>Bobbin</b> thread holds the top embroidery thread to the garment. The <b>bobbin</b> on an embroidery machine works in the same manner and for the same purpose as on a standard sewing machine.|$|R

40|$|It is our {{object to}} study the motion and the safety state of the <b>bobbin</b> {{assuming}} that the moment of inertia of the <b>bobbin</b> is constant and the <b>bobbin</b> is revolving at the angular velocity and the rolling friction is acting between the rotating shaft and the supporting bearing. And we found {{the strength of the}} winding string on the <b>bobbin</b> under the stable condition of the constant angular velocity. Also we found the value of the angular velocity when we added any moment for the rotating shaft...|$|R
25|$|Other {{associated}} costs are thread, stabilizer, purchased designs, needles, <b>bobbins,</b> and other miscellaneous tools and supplies.|$|E
25|$|Silk {{throwing}} (winding). The skeins {{are placed}} on a reel in a frame with many others. The silk is wound onto spools or <b>bobbins.</b>|$|E
25|$|Racks of <b>bobbins</b> {{are set up}} to {{hold the}} thread while it is rolled onto the warp bar of a loom. Because the thread is fine, often three of these would be {{combined}} to get the desired thread count.|$|E
5000|$|The {{double drive}} wheel {{is named after}} its drive band, which goes around the {{spinning}} wheel twice. The drive band turns the flyer, which is the horse-shoe shaped piece of wood surrounding the <b>bobbin,</b> {{as well as the}} <b>bobbin.</b> Due to a difference {{in the size of the}} whorls (the round pieces or pulleys around which the drive band runs) the <b>bobbin</b> whorl, which has a smaller radius than the flyer whorl, turns slightly faster. Thus both the flyer and <b>bobbin</b> rotate to twist the yarn, and the difference in speed continually winds the yarn onto the <b>bobbin.</b> Generally the speed difference or [...] "ratio" [...] is adjusted by the size of the whorls and the tension of the drive band.|$|R
2500|$|Bobbin: A small spool {{of thread}} inside the rotary hook housing of a sewing machine. The <b>bobbin</b> thread forms the {{stitches}} {{on the underside}} of the garment. [...] <b>Bobbin</b> thread holds the top embroidery thread to the garment. The <b>bobbin</b> on an embroidery machine works in the same manner and for the same purpose as on a standard sewing machine.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Janome" [...] (蛇の目) {{literally}} means [...] "snake's eye" [...] and {{was taken}} from the appearance of the latest <b>bobbin</b> design. At the time of brand establishment in 1935, the round <b>bobbin</b> system was the more advanced technology replacing the traditional long shuttle type. As the new round <b>bobbin</b> looks like a snake's eye, Janome was chosen as the company's name.|$|R
25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} rovings <b>bobbins</b> {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new <b>bobbins</b> on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E
25|$|Plying is done {{by pulling}} yarn from two or more <b>bobbins</b> and {{twisting}} it together, {{in the opposite direction}} that in which it was spun. Depending on the weight desired, the cotton {{may or may not be}} plied, and the number of strands twisted together varies.|$|E
25|$|Dyeing: the skeins are scoured again, and {{discoloration}} removed with a sulphur process. This {{weakens the}} silk. The skeins are now tinted or dyed. They are dried and rewound onto <b>bobbins,</b> spools and skeins. Looming, and the weaving process on power looms {{is the same}} as with cotton.|$|E
50|$|To {{make one}} stitch, the machine lowers the {{threaded}} needle through the cloth into the <b>bobbin</b> area, where a rotating hook (or other hooking mechanism) catches the upper thread {{at the point}} just after it goes through the needle. The hook mechanism carries the upper thread entirely around the <b>bobbin</b> case, so that it has made one wrap of the <b>bobbin</b> thread. Then the take-up arm pulls the excess upper thread (from the <b>bobbin</b> area) back to the top, forming the lockstitch. Then the feed dogs pull the material along one stitch length, and the cycle repeats.|$|R
