25|$|Sangiovese's high acidity and {{moderate}} alcohol {{makes it a}} very food-friendly wine {{when it comes to}} food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken. Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and puréed <b>bean</b> <b>soup.</b>|$|E

500|$|Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo {{described}} a typical Harding speech as [...] "an army of pompous phrases moving over {{the landscape in}} search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." [...] H. L. Mencken concurred, [...] "it reminds me of a string of wet sponges, it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale <b>bean</b> <b>soup,</b> of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E

John Bratt, the Keystone Cattle Company, and the Bosler Brothers had penetrated along the south rim of the Sandhills, but it wasn't until the spring of 1879 that the economic importance of the Sandhills were discovered. That year storm-driven cattle from the Newman Ranch disappeared South into the Sandhills area previously avoided by cattlemen. An expedition was organized, with ranch foreman Billy Irwin in charge, to venture into the Sandhills and round-up the scattered cattle. During the roundup of those cattle other wild cattle were found, the wild cattle had grown fat even though untended during several winters. On the fourth week out and running low on provisions, the Newman cowboys camped along a lake where all they had to eat was <b>bean</b> <b>soup.</b> They called the lake <b>Bean</b> <b>Soup</b> Lake, four miles (6km) east of what would later become the headquarters of the Spade Ranch. One of the Newman cowboys on the 1879 round-up, was later Omaha mayor James Dahlman.|$|E

2500|$|On August 10, 1888, Bartlett Richards bought Bennett Irwin's filing near <b>Bean</b> <b>Soup</b> Lake in Sheridan County. The Log House {{from the}} Newman Ranch was {{disassembled}} {{and moved to}} its new location in the Home Valley, making it the first building erected at the newly formed Spade Ranch. During the 1890s, Richards developed his almost [...] in Sheridan and Cherry Counties into manageable units. Ranching activities occurred year round. Following the breeding schedule, spring was calving and round up. Summer activities included harvesting hay to use for cattle feed {{in the fall and}} winter. Additional laborers were often hired to help with this task. During the fall fireguards were plowed to prevent fires from spreading, as the pastures had dried by the summer and cattle were shipped by railroad to markets in Omaha and Chicago. Year round activities included providing beef for the Indian agencies and building fences. Initially, fences created corrals at the ranch headquarters. By the early 1890s, fencing of grazing areas increased. The number of widespread roundups in the area may have increased the desire to fence in areas.|$|E
