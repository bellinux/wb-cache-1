5000|$|DjVu divides {{a single}} image into many {{different}} images, then compresses them separately. To create a DjVu file, the initial image is first separated into three images: a background image, a foreground image, and a mask image. The background and foreground images are typically lower-resolution color images (e.g., 100 dpi); the mask {{image is a}} high-resolution bilevel image (e.g., 300 dpi) and is typically where the text is stored. The background and foreground images are then compressed using a wavelet-based compression algorithm named IW44. The mask image is compressed using a method called JB2 (similar to JBIG2). The JB2 encoding method identifies nearly identical shapes on the page, such as multiple occurrences of a particular character in a given font, style, and size. It compresses the bitmap of each unique shape separately, and then encodes the locations where each shape appears on the page. Thus, instead of compressing a letter [...] "e" [...] in a given font multiple times, it compresses the letter [...] "e" [...] once (as a compressed <b>bit</b> <b>image)</b> and then records every place on the page it occurs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Histogram {{equalization}} is {{a technique}} of improving the global contrast of an image by adjusting the intensity Distribution on a histogram. It allows area of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast without affecting the global contrast. Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values. Histogram Equalization is used to expand the pixel value distribution that increases the perceptional information. The Histogram of an image records the frequency distribution of grey level in that image. The Histogram of an 8 <b>bit</b> <b>image</b> {{can be thought of}} as table with 256 entries, or bins indexed from 0 to 255.
