5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, <b>by</b> <b>satellite</b> analysts at the National Hurricane Center, in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a larger}} press corps in Brussels than Washington D.C.; in 2007 media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels correspondent. However, since the global {{downturn}} by 2010 the press corps in Brussels shrunk by a third. There is one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none for Lithuania. Although {{there has been a}} worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe <b>by</b> <b>Satellite</b> and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies.

5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked <b>by</b> <b>satellite</b> in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|On September10, the Television Infrared Observation Satellite {{observed}} {{an area of}} convection, or thunderstorms, to {{the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands, suggesting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis. At 18:00UTC that day, a tropical depression formed and subsequently moved on a northwest trajectory. By the time the Hurricane Hunters reached the system on September12, winds of hurricane force were recorded, and as such, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau began issuing warnings on Hurricane Esther. It was later estimated that the system attained tropical storm status on September 11, although the National Hurricane Center later noted {{that it could have}} attained hurricane status by this date, thus potentially being one of four simultaneous hurricanes, along with hurricanes Betsy, Carla, and Debbie. The only other such occasions were in 1893 and 1998. This also made Esther the first hurricane to be discovered <b>by</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery, although not the first to be imaged by one.|$|E

5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked <b>by</b> <b>satellite</b> in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E
