5|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, media {{attention}} {{shifted away from}} {{the company and its}} troubles; a little less than a month later Enron announced its intention to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> selling its lower-margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas and electricity trading. This policy included selling Portland General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, for about $1.9 billion in cash and stock, and possibly selling its 65% stake in the Dabhol project in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or lectin, that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The lectin is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs {{in the treatment of}} viral disease.|$|E

5|$|University policy {{prevents}} national fraternities and sororities from directly {{establishing a}} chapter at the university; instead, an interested {{group of students}} must establish an interest group, petition for establishment, and obtain sponsorship {{from one of the}} Greek councils. Once sponsorship is obtained, a group enters the provisional phase of the process; at this point the interest group may contact a national fraternity or sorority to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> establishing themselves as a colony or chapter. Upon successful completion of the provisional phase, the organization is granted full membership in its chosen Greek council.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a variety}} of factors, {{including}} the deterioration of the main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s. Then on October 3, 1860, the board of trustees for the school resolved to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> building a new primary hall to be used by the university. Reverend Alvin F. Waller was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds needed for a building. However, this was unsuccessful and on November 19, 1862, the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, Gustavus Hines, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, J. Lamson, and John H. Moores to prepare plans.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, the Australian government decided {{that it would not}} contribute to the proposed Allied occupation force in Germany and would <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> demobilisation of the AIF as soon as possible. Owing to the large number of soldiers deployed overseas, this process took some time, and it was decided to progressively return men from each battalion, rather than send them home as a formed unit. As numbers dwindled, units were amalgamated for administrative purposes, and as a consequence the 9th and 10th Battalions were merged on 5 February 1919; the final contingent of troops from the 10th Battalion did not return home until September 1919 when they disembarked in Adelaide from the transport Takada.|$|E

5|$|Pfeiffer {{chose to}} <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> {{dissolving}} her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, {{and move into}} semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called, Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.|$|E
5|$|The Thorne Moors Improvement Company {{was set up}} in 1848, {{authorised}} by the Thorne Moor Drainage and Improvement Act. They {{were charged}} with improving parts of the bog. Their activities increased in the 1880s, when they began to lease areas to companies who extracted the peat commercially for use as animal bedding. In order to do this, ditches had to be cut to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> drainage. As the extent of the workings increased, a Dutch company cut canals in the peat. Horses pulled barges from canal paths alongside in order to remove the peat from the moors. Subsequently, a network of small railways were constructed along the canals to transport the peat.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> designation through a {{nomination to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, {{it is only in}} cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations {{as to whether or}} not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{maintenance}} of I-84 in downstate New York was {{transferred from the}} New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA). The monies for that purpose came from tolls levied on I-190 in downtown Buffalo. Under the laws authorizing the Thruway construction, the tolls were to be removed once the original bonds {{used to pay for}} the construction were paid off, which occurred in 1996; however, the tolls would remain for ten more years. Attorney Carl Paladino brought a lawsuit against the state in 2006 to force the removal of the tolls. On October 30, 2006, the Thruway Authority voted to both <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> returning {{maintenance of}} I-84 to NYSDOT and to remove the tolls on I-190 in Buffalo. Collection of the tolls stopped that day. Both major candidates in the 2006 New York gubernatorial election, Democrat Eliot Spitzer and Republican John Faso, had pledged to remove the tolls on I-190 if elected. While the toll barriers in Buffalo have since been demolished, the tolls further north on the two Grand Island bridges still remain.|$|E
5|$|The 2/15th Battalion {{returned}} to Australia in mid-March 1944 aboard the Klipfontein. After docking in Brisbane, a 42-day leave period followed before the battalion came together again at Ravenshoe to <b>begin</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> rebuilding {{in preparation for}} the next phase of the war. Between June and August, training progressed from individual instruction up to brigade-level exercises as the unit was re-constituted for its next campaign. During training it experienced a high turnover of personnel and a large influx of reinforcements, including several officers, was received in the middle of 1944 from the disbanded 62nd Battalion, a Queensland-based Militia battalion that had previously been assigned to Merauke Force. A long period of training followed the battalion's return to Australia in early 1944, as there was a degree of uncertainty about the Australian Army's role in future operations in the Pacific after the US military assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the theatre. Nevertheless, in the final months of the war the 2/15th took part in efforts to recapture North Borneo as part of Operation Oboe Six. After a battalion-level exercise in early 1945, the 2/15th sailed from Australia aboard the Charles Lummis in early May.|$|E
