40|$|AbstractInternet {{technology}} has influenced everyday life {{during the past}} few decades because of its capability to assist and enhance operational and managerial performance in both non-business and business industries. Furthermore, security issues have become more common nowadays in internet technology particularly on internet banking systems due to the harmful impact on confidentiality, integrity and privacy of the bank and its customers. In the previous research, we investigated the internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> system of 16 selected Australian banks. The findings from that research revealed that there were deficiencies in internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> in all 16 of the selected Australian banks which were likely to affect the confidentiality of the existing and potential customers of the banks. The aim of this paper was to further the scope of the research by investigating internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> in another country. It examined 12 Thai commercial banks and compared the results/findings obtained from the previous research paper to generate a feasible guideline for Thai commercial banks. The investigation revealed that there was a distinct lack of internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> information provided on all the selected Thai banks’ websites as compared to the selected Australian banks which provided better internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> information...|$|R

This study provides perspectives of users and nonusers on internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> {{with a view to}} understanding trust and security factors in relation to adoption and continuous usage. Perception of internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> influenced usage intentions. Nonusers viewed internet banking to be insecure but users perceived it to be secure with perceived ease of use influencing continuous usage. Perception of internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> was positively influenced by trust in the internet banking system, trust of the provider, threat awareness, availability of information and education but showed a negative relationship with age. The study suggests that internet <b>banking</b> <b>security</b> strategy may consider the generation gap in adoption and should continuously aim at securing customers’ trust of the providers’ online brand’s security, including the provision of security information and education...|$|R

40|$|Many {{central banks}} {{around the world}} are faced with the {{challenge}} of implementing their policy goals in the presence of surplus liquidity in domestic banking systems. Surplus liquidity can impair the central bank's ability to control its operational target and impact on its profitability, potentially affecting its ability to operate in an independent manner. Within the range of instruments available, the issuance of central <b>bank</b> <b>securities</b> is one policy option that has been used effectively by a number of central banks. In this handbook we look at the characteristics of central <b>bank</b> <b>securities</b> and how the fit into the broader monetary operations framework of a central bank. We then look at alternative instruments available to a central bank, before considering {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these different options. It concludes by considering means of co-ordinating central <b>bank</b> <b>securities</b> with the issuance of central government securities and briefly looks at methods of auction employed to issue such <b>securities.</b> Issuing central <b>bank</b> <b>securities...</b>|$|R
