5000|$|While {{known as}} the Marquess of Tavistock, he wrote [...] "Parrots and Parrot-like Birds". He was a founder member and first President of the Foreign Bird League. He was {{successful}} in breeding many species, including the Tahiti <b>Blue</b> <b>Lorikeet</b> and Ultramarine Lorikeet. Both of these are recognised as the world's first breedings in captivity. The Marquess disposed of his birds upon succeeding to the Dukedom in 1939.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ultramarine}} lorikeet is endangered. It {{is now one}} of the 50 rarest {{birds in}} the world. The <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet</b> is classified as vulnerable. The introduction of European rats to the small island habitats of these birds is a major cause of their endangerment. [...] Various conservation efforts have been made to relocate some of these birds to locations free of predation and habitat destruction.|$|R
5000|$|The Society {{publishes the}} {{quarterly}} French language bulletin Te Manu, which {{is sent to}} all members. [...] It is involved in surveys and conservation programs regarding the critically endangered Polynesian ground dove, Marquesan imperial pigeon, Tuamotu kingfisher, Tahiti monarch, Fatu Hiva monarch; the endangered Phoenix petrel, Tuamotu sandpiper, Marquesan ground dove, Polynesian imperial pigeon, Rimatara lorikeet, ultramarine lorikeet, Marquesan kingfisher, Marquesan monarch, {{as well as the}} <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet</b> and Tahiti petrel.|$|R
50|$|Vini is a genus {{of birds}} endemic {{to the islands}} of the {{tropical}} Pacific. There are five extant species of these small lorikeets ranging from eastern Fiji through Samoa, French Polynesia, and as far east as Henderson Island. All members of the genus have exceptional bright plumage, particularly the unusual all over blues of the <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet</b> and the ultramarine lorikeet. The collared lory (Phigys solitarius) is sometimes considered {{to be in this}} genus.|$|R
500|$|... is a blue-haired {{girl who}} is the second Mew Mew to be {{introduced}} in the series. Infused with the genes of a <b>Blue</b> <b>Lorikeet,</b> [...] Minto grows a bird's tail {{and a pair of}} bird wings when she transforms into Mew Mint. Initially depicted as spoiled, snobbish, and self-centered because of her wealth due to her being born into a rich family, she is shown to be an empathetic person who cares deeply about her friends as the series progresses. In the beginning, Minto called Ichigo a Vulgar person. Minto idolizes fellow Mew Mew Zakuro Fujiwara. Minto owns a pet Pomeranian named Miki.|$|R
2500|$|The eggs of parrots are white. In most species, {{the female}} {{undertakes}} all the incubation, although incubation is shared in cockatoos, the <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet,</b> and the vernal hanging parrot. The female {{remains in the}} nest for {{almost all of the}} incubation period and is fed both by the male and during short breaks. [...] Incubation varies from 17 to 35 days, with larger species having longer incubation periods. The newly born young are altricial, either lacking feathers or with sparse white down. The young spend three weeks to four months in the nest, depending on species, and may receive parental care for several months thereafter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>lorikeets</b> {{feed on the}} nectar and pollen {{of coconut}} palms (Cocos nucifera), Guettarda speciosa, Pemphis acidula, bay cedar (Suriana maritima), beach {{mulberry}} (Morinda citrifolia), Heliotropium foertherianum, Scaevola spp and Musa. On Rangiroa they fed mostly on coconut flowers during one three week study. They feed silently in small groups, and use their brush-like tongue to lap up nectar and pollen. Where flowers had not fully opened, they will use their bills to open them. After all the flowers on one tree have been fed at, they will {{move to the next}} tree, calling as they go. They also feed on insects among leaves and on the forest floor, and on leaf shoots and soft fruits.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet</b> (Vini peruviana) {{is a small}} lorikeet from French Polynesia and the Cook Islands. It is {{also known}} as the Tahiti lorikeet, violet <b>lorikeet,</b> Tahitian lory, <b>blue</b> lory, nunbird, and the indigo lory. It was {{formerly}} found on 23 islands around Tahiti, but now restricted to perhaps eight islands: Motu, Manuae, Tikehau, Rangiroa, Aratua, Kaukura, Apataki, Aitutaki, and possibly Harvey Island and Manihi. Its plumage is mainly dark blue and it has a white area over its upper chest, throat and face. The first captive breeding in the UK was by the Marquess of Tavistock in the 1930s. He was awarded a silver medal by the Foreign Bird League for this achievement.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet</b> is 18 cm {{long with}} a short rounded tail. Its plumage is mainly dark blue {{and it has a}} white area over its upper chest, throat and lower face. Erectile {{feathers}} on the top of its head show light blue streaks. Its beak is orange and its irises are yellow-brown. It has orange legs. Adult males and females have identical external appearance. The juvenile lacks the white plumage of the adult and has a dark grey-blue face and lower parts. The juvenile also has a black bill, dark brown irises, and its legs are orange brown. Blue plumage, which is shares with the related ultramarine lorikeet, is very unusual in the parrot order.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{also present}} in the Cook Islands, where {{it is one of}} a small number of landbirds on the island of Aitutaki. Dean Amadon, writing in 1942 after the Whitney South Seas Expedition, thought that it might have been {{introduced}} to the Cooks. [...] David Steadman, who studied the extinct species of the areas, wrote in 1991 that it might have been but that he could find no evidence of this. Had it been native there it would have coexisted with Kuhl's lorikeet; today no Vini lorikeets are sympatric. He later concluded that it was probably introduced, as extensive excavations of fossils had found remains of Kuhl's lorikeet as well as two other species of extinct Vini lorikeet, but no fossils of the <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Kurämoó, or <b>Blue</b> <b>Lorikeet</b> (Vini peruviana), {{is listed}} by IUCN as {{threatened}} (Collar & Andrew 1988). Formerly, the species was widespread on the Society and Tuamotu Islands, {{but it became}} extinct on Tahiti, Moorea and other large islands in the Society Group early this century and is now also extinct on many other islands on which it once occurred (Forshaw 1978). Today, in French Polynesia, it apparently survives only on two small islands in the Society Group and several in the Tuamotu Group (Forshaw 1978, Kuhn 1989). Elsewhere it is only on Aitutaki Island, Cook Islands, where, although Forshaw believed numbers to be low, other visitors have described it as common (Holyoak 1980, Child 1981). Observations reported here were made between 14 and 18 February 1991. The main objective of the visit to Aitutaki was to make preliminary observations on the distribution, abundance and habitat preferences of Kuramoo and to investigate the feasibility of further research on the species...|$|R
5|$|One {{building}} at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security {{in the months after}} the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the <b>blue</b> <b>lorikeet</b> (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|R

50|$|The {{ripeness}} of bunya nuts was signaled by {{the onset}} of bark loss in stands of sugar and white gums. Messages were sent to relatives and nearby tribes to meet up and feast on the harvested nuts at bush clearing set in the mountains as Baroon Pocket, a site described as a paradise in the wilderness by a German missionary who saw it, and one now flooded out by the Baroon Pocket Dam. This intertribal feasting was reciprocated by the coastal peoples who, when the <b>Blue</b> Mountain <b>lorikeets</b> {{showed up on the}} Brisbane river, who alert hinterland tribes like the Dalla that mullet (and flounder, bream and whiting) were now running in the bay, ready for fishing. The Dalla would camp on the shores of Moreton Bay and join the culling, which included huge quantities of oysters, so plentiful that they were dredged up by the ton to be burnt for lime when whites settled there.|$|R
50|$|The Good Zoo is a 30 acre {{facility}} that houses over 80 species of animals. The zoo was dedicated {{in memory of}} a seven-year-old boy, Phillip Mayer Good, who loved nature. He {{was the son of}} Barbara and Larry Good of Wheeling. As of 2017, the Good Zoo's collection includes cheetahs, river otters, spectacled bears, zebras, kangaroos, wallabys, tamarins, lemurs, ostriches, llamas, goats, barn owls, bald eagles, red pandas, gorals, white-naped cranes, a small gang of meerkats and many other animals from all over the globe. It includes a train, which travels through the ostrich exhibit and all throughout the zoo, and a discovery lab, with an indoor South American rainforest exhibit. The zoo also features an aviary, which houses two subspecies of the rainbow <b>lorikeet,</b> the <b>blue</b> mountain (Swainson's) <b>lorikeet,</b> and the green-naped lorikeet. The Good Zoo is the only AZA accredited zoo in West Virginia.|$|R
