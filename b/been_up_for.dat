5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had <b>been</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of NOC governance, the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented. The NEP aimed to {{eradicate}} poverty irrespective of race by expanding the economic pie so that the Chinese share of the economy would not be reduced in absolute terms but only relatively. The aim was for the Malays to have a 30% equity share of the economy, {{as opposed to the}} 4% they held in 1970. Foreigners and Chinese held much of the rest. The NEP appeared to be derived from Article 153 and could be viewed as being in line with its wording. Although Article 153 would have <b>been</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> review in 1972, fifteen years after Malaysia's independence in 1957, due to the May 13 Incident it remained unreviewed. A new expiration date of 1991 for the NEP was set, twenty years after its implementation.|$|E

The three groups are staggered so {{that one of them}} <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election every two years, rather than having all 100 seats <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election at once.

25|$|Historically, the Lower East Side was an {{immigrant}} neighborhood, including Germans, Irish, Italians, and Hispanics; Essex Crossing was envisioned during the neighborhood's period of gentrification, but {{this part of}} the Lower East Side is an area alternatively known as SPURA, which has <b>been</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> development since the mid-1960s.

Some original SPURA land was eventually developed, but five lots remain vacant to this day. As SPURA was the largest tract of undeveloped New York City-owned land in Manhattan south of 96th Street, deciding what the “appropriate redevelopment” of SPURA would be had stalled the process and kept it undeveloped.|$|E
