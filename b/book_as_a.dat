5|$|In October 2005, Gordon and Levin {{met with}} Warner Bros. {{to develop the}} film there again. Tim Burton at one point {{expressed}} interest in directing the film but ultimately turned it down. Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on 300, Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen. Screenwriter Alex Tse drew from his favorite elements of Hayter's script, but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic. Similar to his approach to 300, Snyder used the comic <b>book</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> storyboard. Following negotiations, Paramount, which had already spent $7 million in their failed project, earned the rights for international distribution of Watchmen and 25% of the film's ownership.|$|E

5|$|Reviewing the book, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} the <b>book</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> graduate-level text {{based more}} on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway breed {{comes from}} the cattle native to the {{south-west}} region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd <b>book.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, although black {{is still the most}} common colour for Galloways, they can also be red and several shades of dun. In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed.|$|E

Rockmill began by asking chefs she knew personally to donate bacon recipes, and then contacted others across the United States. In some cases, she adapted the original recipes in collaboration with the chefs.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} a <b>book,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> topological space, was defined by C. A. Persinger and Gail Atneosen in the 1960s. As part of this work, Atneosen already {{considered}} embeddings of graphs in books. The embeddings he studied used the same definition as embeddings of graphs into any other topological space: vertices are represented by distinct points, edges are represented by curves, {{and the only way}} that two edges can intersect is for them to meet at a common endpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in Greenwich Village, New York. The main character, Mike de Wolf, is a {{struggling}} pianist. His friend, Horace Hackett, {{is an author}} and popular pulp fiction writer.

Hackett writes under stress, as he is facing a deadline. Hackett attempts to persuade his book publisher that he has almost finished writing his latest novel, while in actuality he has already depleted his advance payment prior to coming {{up with an idea}} for a story. Hackett's publisher pressures him and he rapidly decides to place his friend Mike as the central character in his story.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the <b>book</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E
