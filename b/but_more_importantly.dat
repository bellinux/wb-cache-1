5|$|The Employment Development Centres {{continuously}} seek {{to increase}} their diversity of contract work, in-house industries, social enterprises and job placements into open employment for persons with intellectual disability. These efforts go towards providing income for the trainees {{to pay for their}} own transport, food and leisure. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> with jobs to do, persons with intellectual disability can hold their heads high in society as ‘contributors’.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the sluice gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the sluice gates was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has not made a commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E

25|$|Pictish {{is thought}} to have {{influenced}} the development of modern Scottish Gaelic.

25|$|Although most {{psychology}} researchers consider {{meaning in}} {{life as a}} subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life. Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings <b>but,</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> on whether a person's goal striving and life {{as a whole is}} meaningful according to some objective normative standard.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the removal of the {{external}} keel, when the first trials were held the two airships were able to turn more quickly than their predecessors; <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> it was discovered during the lift and trim tests that the disposable lift was more than 8tons. This was significantly better than any previous British airship, and allowed a greater bomb load to be carried as well as more fuel for increased range.|$|E

Dave Farrall won the Batting with 385 runs @ 48.13, Will Hawker taking the bowling with 20 wickets @12.15. Young wicket keeper Dan Parry won the fielding with 8 wickets. The team was superbly led by Craig Kinsey, giving a mix of youth and experience to further develop the club going forward.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{promises}} of Selman Reis, Habesh did not provide much revenue for the Ottomans, partly because the spice trade was not very profitable, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> because the rich hinterlands were unconquered, with the Ottomans holding only the dry and hot coasts. Given that Yemen often cost more in upkeep than it sent to Constantinople as taxes, and that Habesh had much less {{in the way of}} agricultural taxes (but just as high a salary for the beylerbeyi), the province was probably very unprofitable.|$|E
25|$|Frederick & Nelson, a Seattle, Washington-based {{department}} store founded in 1890, was also acquired in 1929, {{with its own}} 1914 downtown Seattle building at Pine Street and Fifth Avenue. Frederick & Nelson retained its name, though their logo was soon rewritten in Field's iconic script. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> for Field's history, Frederick & Nelson created Frango mints, a Seattle tradition then and now, that later became identified with Marshall Field's {{and the city of}} Chicago. The candy kitchen at the State Street flagship store soon began producing the confections.|$|E

Natural gas is found {{offshore}} of Campo, and a Kribi-based plant has been processing this since the 1980s. Perhaps the region's most lucrative resource is oil. This, too, is found off the coast of Campo. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the South Province is located at the terminus of the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, which was completed in June 2004. The pipe's mouth is located just south of Kribi, a fact that promises to bring in high revenues for both Cameroon and the province.|$|E
25|$|The interdynastic rivalry and {{seasonal}} raids into each other's territory notwithstanding, the rulers in the Deccan and South India patronized all three religions - Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. The religions vied {{with each other}} for royal favor, expressed in land grants <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> in the creation of monumental temples, which remain architectural wonders. The cave temples of Elephanta Island (near Mumbai or Bombay, as it was known formerly), Ajanta, and Ellora (in Maharashtra), and structural temples of Pattadakal, Aihole, Badami in Karnataka and Mahaballipuram and Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu are enduring legacies of otherwise warring regional rulers.|$|E
25|$|After Archimedes, Hellenistic {{mathematics}} {{began to}} decline. There {{were a few}} minor stars yet to come, but {{the golden age of}} geometry was over. Proclus (410-485), author of Commentary on the First Book of Euclid, {{was one of the last}} important players in Hellenistic geometry. He was a competent geometer, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> he was a superb commentator on the works that preceded him. Much of that work did not survive to modern times, and is known to us only through his commentary. The Roman Republic and Empire that succeeded and absorbed the Greek city-states produced excellent engineers, but no mathematicians of note.|$|E

25|$|For a {{long time}} Bonatti was accused and vilified by {{a part of the}} {{climbing}} community but over time the growing amount of evidence in support of his version of the facts proved his honesty. Reinhold Messner, in June 2010, said: Bonatti {{was one of the greatest}} climbers of all time – the last true Alpinist, an expert in all disciplines. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> Walter was a marvellous, tolerant, loving person. He leaves a great spiritual testament: he was a clean man vilified for 50 years over what happened on K2, but in the end everyone accepted that he was right.|$|E
25|$|A major crisis {{among the}} Arab nationalists took {{place with the}} failed {{establishment}} of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920. With the disastrous outcome of the Franco-Syrian War, the self-proclaimed Hashemite kingdom with its capital in Damascus was defeated and the Hashemite ruler took refuge in Mandatory Iraq. The crisis saw the first confrontation of nationalist Arab and Jewish forces, {{taking place in the}} Battle of Tel Hai in March 1920, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> the collapse of the pan-Arabist kingdom led to the establishment of the local Palestinian version of Arab nationalism, with the return of Amin al-Husseini from Damascus to Jerusalem in late 1920.|$|E
25|$|Interpreters were {{recruited}} and {{examined by the}} respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: US, UK, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, {{as well as in}} special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced consecutive interpreters, others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>importantly</b> a broad sense of culture, encyclopædic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.|$|E
