25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} one of Yeardley Smith's {{favorite}} episodes. She says, [...] "I don't actually remember {{a lot of the}} episodes because they all blend in together for me, and I don't have a really good memory anyway, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> this one and thinking that it was terrific." ...|$|E
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
60|$|There {{were other}} noble deeds of mine. I could not {{remember}} {{them at the time}} in their entirety. I seemed to have done a good many. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>remember</b> the rummage sale to which I sent all my old clothes, including a coat that had got mixed up with them by accident, and that I believe I could have worn again.|$|R
60|$|I {{talked with}} her a little, and found her sensible, vivacious, and firm-textured, rather than soft and sentimental. She paid me some compliments; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> paying her any.|$|R
60|$|Somewhere upon my way {{the road}} forked, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> {{whether that was}} near Shaphambury or {{near the end of}} my walk. The {{hesitation}} between two rutted unmade roads alone remains clear in my mind.|$|R
500|$|As a child, Stephen {{was often}} sickly and afflicted by {{constant}} colds. [...] When {{the boy was}} almost two, his father wrote in his diary that his youngest son became [...] "so sick that we are anxious about him." [...] Despite his fragile nature, Crane was an intelligent child who taught himself to read {{before the age of}} four. His first known inquiry, recorded by his father, dealt with writing; at the age of three, while imitating his brother Townley's writing, he asked his mother, [...] "how do you spell O?" [...] In December 1879, Crane wrote a poem about wanting a dog for Christmas. Entitled [...] "I'd Rather Have –", it is his first surviving poem. Stephen was not regularly enrolled in school until January 1880, but he had no difficulty in completing two grades in six weeks. Recalling this feat, he wrote that it [...] "sounds like the lie of a fond mother at a teaparty, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that I got ahead very fast and that father was very pleased with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Julie Fernandez, {{who later}} {{appeared}} in BBC television programmes Eldorado and The Office, {{was invited to}} a BBC studio to appear on Jim'll Fix It. She recalled her experience in a radio interview: [...] "I was in my wheelchair, but I just remember [...] hands being everywhere and just lingering those two, three, four seconds slightly too long in places they shouldn't [...] It was in a busy room full {{of people in a}} studio so it was quite discreetly done and you don't kind of realise what's happening at the time, especially when you're 14 and it's the first time you've ever been in a studio and you're very excited. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> feeling uncomfortable and he had these huge rings on his fingers." ...|$|E
2500|$|She remembered {{having a}} {{photographic}} memory as a child, {{making it easy}} to memorize songs, as well as get her through school tests. She got her first taste of singing solo at a fire hall, where she soaked up the crowd's appreciation. [...] "Sometimes I think that I cheated my own family and my closest friends by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them. But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child—that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E
30|$|Hindsight may be rose-coloured, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> {{anxiety about}} using my fledgling language, which grew quite rapidly in confidence. I {{grew into a}} warm sense of {{belonging}} as a competent non-native speaker, {{with a sense of}} linguistic and professional agency.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the bankers}} subscribed five {{thousand}} dollars, and I {{think the other}} one subscribed half as much, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> with certainty now whether that was the figure or not. We got designs made--some of them came from Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a fever upon me." [...] Findlayson {{was still}} looking uneasily across the water. [...] "It seemed that the island was full of beasts and men talking, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember.</b> A boat could live in this water now, I think." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E

60|$|It was in Benares that I {{saw another}} living god. That makes two. I believe I have seen {{most of the}} greater and lesser wonders of the world, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> that any of them {{interested}} me so overwhelmingly as did that pair of gods.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} {{witnessed}} these rude sports in vessels of the King; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> {{to have known}} any more serious result than the settlement of some ancient quarrel, or some odd freak of nautical humour, which has commonly proved as harmless {{as it has been}} quaint." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact I don't know which of them thought of it because <b>I</b> never inquired. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>remember</b> {{afterwards}} how Anscombe had tossed with a lucky penny when it was a question whether we should or should not run for the wagon during our difficulty by the Oliphant's River; also when I asked him the reason for this strange proceeding he answered that Providence might inhabit a penny as well as anything else, and that he wished to give it--I mean Providence--a chance. How much more then, he may have argued, could it inhabit a flash of lightning which has always been considered a divine manifestation {{from the time of the}} Roman Jove, and no doubt far before him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> {{something}} about his saying {{he wanted to go}} to Whitechapel--I think it was--or Whitehall, I forget which, but I'm sure it was white something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leviticus {{is a book}} I {{never read}} but once, for we do not read it in our New England schools. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that the Jews were {{commanded}} to let one of two goats go, from which practice it has, I believe, been called a scape-goat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Kepher, [...] "those pirates must mourn their loss. I almost {{wonder that}} they did not follow you. Indeed, I thought that you might be other folk, for, strangely enough, as I slept in the sand last night, a certain spirit from the Under-world visited me in my dreams, and told me to search for one Asti and another lady who was with her--I cannot {{remember}} the name of that lady. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> the name of the spirit, for he told it to me; it was Mermes." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are several}} other stages, <b>I</b> believe, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> what they are. But {{he has been}} through them. Throughout the long course he was {{perfecting}} himself in holy learning, and writing commentaries upon the sacred books. He was also meditating upon Brahma, and he does that now.|$|R
500|$|President Grant: [...] "I <b>did</b> not <b>remember</b> {{about these}} dispatches at all until since the {{conspiracy}} trials have commenced. I have heard General Babcock's explanation of {{most or all}} of them since that. Many of the dispatches may have been shown to me at the time, and explained, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather doubt your word, Mr. Bullen," [...] the colonel's wife said; [...] "you {{were always}} very {{ready to make}} {{yourself}} pleasant, and do our errands, and to make yourself generally useful and agreeable; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> that you ever ventured upon making a compliment before. You must have learnt the art somehow." ...|$|R
60|$|How I got {{my daily}} bread I can hardly remember. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that I was often {{unable to get}} myself a dinner. Young men {{generally}} now have their meals provided for them. I kept house, as it were. Every day I had to find myself with the day's food. For my breakfast I could get some credit at the lodgings, though that credit would frequently come to an end. But for all that I had often breakfast to pay day by day; and at your eating-house credit is not given. I had no friends on whom I could sponge regularly. Out on the Fulham Road I had an uncle, but his house was four miles from the Post Office, and almost as far from my own lodgings. Then came borrowings of money, sometimes absolute want, and almost constant misery.|$|E
60|$|I do not now {{remember}} what form my views concerning dreams took at the time. I don't remember now what my notion about dreams was then, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> telling a dream {{by way of}} illustrating some detail of my speech, and I also remember that when I had finished it Rev. Dr. Burton made that doubting remark which contained that word I have already spoken of as having been uttered by my mother, in some such connection, forty or fifty years before. I was probably engaged {{in trying to make}} those people believe that now and then, by some accident, or otherwise, a dream which was prophetic turned up in the dreamer's mind. The date of my memorable dream was about the beginning of May, 1858. It was a remarkable dream, and I had been telling it several times every year for more than fifteen years--and now I was telling it again, here in the club.|$|E
60|$|We {{entered a}} low, old-fashioned room, walked {{straight}} into from the street, and found there Mrs. Heep, {{who was the}} dead image of Uriah, only short. She received me with the utmost humility, and apologized to me for giving her son a kiss, observing that, lowly as they were, they had their natural affections, which they hoped would give no offence to anyone. It was a perfectly decent room, half parlour and half kitchen, but not at all a snug room. The tea-things were set upon the table, and the kettle was boiling on the hob. There was a chest of drawers with an escritoire top, for Uriah to read or write at of an evening; there was Uriah's blue bag lying down and vomiting papers; there was a company of Uriah's books commanded by Mr. Tidd; there was a corner cupboard: {{and there were the}} usual articles of furniture. I don't remember that any individual object had a bare, pinched, spare look; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that the whole place had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she retorted, [...] "I, too, {{find your}} sudden {{attraction}} {{for me a}} little remarkable. On those few occasions when you did honour us at the club before you left for Berlin, you were agreeable enough, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> that you once asked me to dine with you. There was no Captain Baring then." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the thirteenth}} day we set forward, taking our new gentleman with us. At parting, the negro king sent two savages with a present to him of some dried flesh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> what it was, {{and he gave}} him again three silver birds which our cutler helped him to, which I assure you was a present for a king.|$|R
6000|$|... "What was that?" [...] {{asked the}} baronet, who was {{completely}} mystified by the indomitable gravity of Captain Truck, whose character {{might be said}} to be actually formed by the long habit of treating the weaknesses of his fellow-creatures with cool contempt. [...] "We hear many good things at our club; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> the mistake of the Irishman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{think that}} in [...] "Tom Sawyer" [...] I starved Injun Joe {{to death in the}} cave. But that may have been to meet the exigencies of romantic literature. I can't {{remember}} now whether the real Injun Joe died in the cave or out of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that the news of his death reached me at a most unhappy time--that is to say, just at bedtime on a summer night when a prodigious storm of thunder and lightning accompanied by a deluging rain that turned the streets and lanes into rivers, caused me to repent and resolve to lead a better life. I can remember those awful thunder-bursts and the white glare of the lightning yet, and the wild lashing of the rain against the window-panes. By my teachings I perfectly well knew what all that wild riot was for--Satan had come to get Injun Joe. I had no shadow of doubt about it. It was the proper thing when a person like Injun Joe was required in the under world, and I should have thought it strange and unaccountable if Satan had come for him in a less impressive way. With every glare of lightning I shrivelled and shrunk together in mortal terror, and in the interval of black darkness that followed I poured out my lamentings over my lost condition, and my supplications for just one more chance, with an energy and feeling and sincerity quite foreign to my nature.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} eight when I wrote the lines with which this day begins. Feeling strangely restless and uneasy, I left my rooms and walked round {{to spend the}} evening with Agatha and her mother. They both remarked that I was pale and haggard. About nine Professor Pratt-Haldane came in, and we played a game of whist. I tried hard to {{concentrate}} my attention upon the cards, but the feeling of restlessness grew and grew until I {{found it impossible to}} struggle against it. I simply COULD not sit still at the table. At last, in the very middle of a hand, I threw my cards down and, with some sort of an incoherent apology about having an appointment, I rushed from the room. As if in a dream I have a vague recollection of tearing through the hall, snatching my hat from the stand, and slamming the door behind me. As in a dream, too, I have the impression of the double line of gas-lamps, and my bespattered boots tell me that I must have run {{down the middle of the}} road. It was all misty and strange and unnatural. I came to Wilson's house; I saw Mrs. Wilson and I saw Miss Penclosa. I hardly recall what we talked about, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> that Miss P. shook the head of her crutch at me in a playful way, and accused me of being late and of losing interest in our experiments. There was no mesmerism, but I stayed some time and have only just returned.|$|E
6000|$|A very {{distinguished}} man once assured {{a mother}} of my acquaintance {{that she would never}} know {{what it meant to be}} hurt until she was hurt through her children. Children are extremely cruel without intending it; and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the reason is that they do not conceive their elders as having any human feelings. Serve the elders right, perhaps, for posing as superhuman! The penalty of the impostor is not that he is found out (he very seldom is) but that he is taken for what he pretends to be, and treated as such. And to be treated as anything but what you really are may seem pleasant to the imagination when the treatment is above your merits; but in actual experience it is often quite the reverse. When I was a very small boy, my romantic imagination, stimulated by early doses of fiction, led me to brag to a still smaller boy so outrageously that he, being a simple soul, really believed me to be an invincible hero. I cannot remember whether this pleased me much; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>remember</b> very distinctly that one day this admirer of mine, who had a pet goat, found the animal in the hands of a larger boy than either of us, who mocked him and refused to restore the animal to his rightful owner. Whereupon, naturally, he came weeping to me, and demanded that I should rescue the goat and annihilate the aggressor. My terror was beyond description: fortunately for me, it imparted such a ghastliness to my voice and aspect as I under the eye of my poor little dupe, advanced on the enemy with that hideous extremity of cowardice which is called the courage of despair, and said [...] "You let go that goat," [...] that he abandoned his prey and fled, to my unforgettable, unspeakable relief. I have never since exaggerated my prowess in bodily combat.|$|E
60|$|The Count, at this, glanced {{downward}} to {{the straps}} of his pantaloons, and then taking {{hold of the}} end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> that he said any thing in the way of reply.|$|R
40|$|In June 1999 I {{was about}} to fly to the Cayman Islands for a week of scuba diving when I got the call from my attorney. He told me Id better sit down. He said it had just been {{announced}} on the news that I was being investigated {{in the deaths of}} five of my patients, years before, and there was talk of charging me with murder. At that moment I could barely remember the details of the deaths, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>remember</b> the general circumstances. I was incredulous. I had treated patients in the manner taught in medical school and residency. I thought my care was state of the art. I had worked in a pain clinic and read the medical literature in the palliative care and pain treatment fields. I had always been interested in the issues of medical ethics, and I studied assiduously when we had our required senior year medical ethics course...|$|R
60|$|And {{suddenly}} I {{found myself}} at the cross drives where I had seen Beatrice {{for the first time}} after so many years. It is strange, but so far as I can recollect I had not thought of her once since I had landed at Plymouth. No doubt she had filled the background of my mind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> one definite, clear thought. I had been intent on my uncle and the financial collapse.|$|R
