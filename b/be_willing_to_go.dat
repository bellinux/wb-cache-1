500|$|In 1960, {{with little}} {{work to be}} found in the comic book field due to a {{downturn}} in the industry, he went to work as an assistant to John Prentice on the Alex Raymond-created comic strip Rip Kirby for a three-year period. According to Williamson: [...] "The reason that I was called in to help him out was that John had decided to go to Mexico and Mac , John's prior assistant, didn't want to go... The deal was: would I <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Mexico?... and I said 'Si!'..." [...] It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson, as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods. According to Prentice: [...] "...he was terrific. He's the best guy I ever had by far." [...] During that time, Williamson assisted John Cullen Murphy on the Big Ben Bolt boxing strip and Don Sherwood on the strip Dan Flagg. He produced some sample pages for a proposed Sunday strip version of Modesty Blaise.|$|E
500|$|However, McClellan soon {{received}} a miraculous break of fortune. Union soldiers accidentally found {{a copy of}} Lee's orders dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. They delivered the order to McClellan's headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, and said, [...] "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home." [...] He telegraphed President Lincoln: [...] "I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, {{and that he will}} be severely punished for it. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. ... Will send you trophies." ...|$|E
500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{out on a date}} with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E

500|$|The FEPC made {{a series}} of {{unsuccessful}} attempts to convince the PTC management and the union leadership to change their stance and to allow promotions of black employees to non-menial jobs. The PTC eventually conceded that it would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with the government's request and [...] "employ Negroes, provided they are acceptable to fellow-workers", but the PRTEU leadership, particularly Frank Carney, staunchly resisted. On November 17, 1943, the FEPC issued a directive requiring that PTC end its discriminatory employment practices and allow blacks to hold non-menial jobs. The directive also required the PTC to review all job applications from June 1941 and redress earlier employment abuses based on racial discrimination. The union immediately protested and requested a public hearing, which took place on December 8, 1943. At the hearing the union tried to make the argument that hiring blacks who had applied for the non-menial positions since June 1941 but were denied would adversely affect the seniority rights of the presently employed white workers. Malcolm Ross rejected that argument, pointing out that the seniority rights only begin when an employee is actually hired for a particular job. On December 29, 1943, FEPC issued a second directive, reinforcing the first one.|$|E
2500|$|Democratic National Committee chairman, former Democratic Presidential Candidate, and 79th Governor of Vermont Howard Dean {{called the}} project [...] "a real affront {{to people who}} lost their lives" [...] and wrote [...] "the {{builders}} have to <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> beyond what is their right {{and be willing to}} talk about feelings whether the feelings are 'justified' or not."

2500|$|Kendricks lobbied {{strongly}} in 1970 {{to have the}} Temptations go on [...] "strike" [...] - no performances, no recordings - until Berry Gordy and the Motown staff would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over all group finances with independent accountants. Otis Williams and Franklin strongly opposed this idea, and regular group infighting between Kendricks, Otis Williams, and Franklin grew from this disagreement. After a November 1970 Copacabana engagement, one final confrontation between the three caused Kendricks to walk out in-between shows and not return. Both Kendricks and Williams then agreed that Kendricks would be leaving the group. [...] Kendricks later stated that he actually considered leaving as early as 1965, but remained with the Temptations and unsuccessfully attempted to get permission to record a solo album without leaving the group.|$|E

50|$|The mesolimbic pathway is {{involved}} in motivation cognition. Depletion of dopamine in this pathway, or lesions at its site of origin, decrease {{the extent to which}} an animal <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> obtain a reward (e.g., the number of lever presses for nicotine or time searching for food). Dopaminergic drugs are also able to increase the extent an animal <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> get a reward, and the firing rate of neurons in the mesolimbic pathway increases during anticipation of reward. Mesolimbic dopamine release was once thought to be the primary mediator of pleasure, but is now believed to have only a minor role in pleasure perception.|$|R
2500|$|Cook {{never worked}} for a Major League {{baseball}} team; he described the relationship between himself and baseball franchises in the forward to Percentage Baseball: [...] "I would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> as far as pretending to understand why none of four competent and successful executives of second-division ball clubs were most reluctant to employ probabilistic methods of any description... {{but they did not}} even want to hear about them!" [...] Though Cook himself was never hired by a Major League team, his work influenced Major League Baseball personnel such as Tal Smith, Ewing Kauffman and Davey Johnson, as well as future sabermetricians like Palmer. [...] Percentage Baseball also influenced Eric Walker, who worked for the San Francisco Giants and Sandy Alderson's Oakland Athletics. [...] Cook's slide rule, which he used during his research for Percentage Baseball, was donated upon request to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Earnshaw Cook {{died of a heart attack}} in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} July, Sutcliffe {{was one of}} ten players named who would tour Australia {{in the winter of}} 1924–25 under the {{leadership}} of Arthur Gilligan. [...] The fee for this tour was £400 plus bonuses awarded on merit and additional expenses allowed of £1 10s per week on the sea voyages and £2 per week in Australia. [...] Hobbs, however, declined the invitation because he was reluctant to leave his family and his sports goods business for several months. [...] But, after approaches were made to entice him onto a short private tour of South Africa, with his wife also invited, it became apparent that Hobbs might <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Australia if his wife could accompany him. [...] This was duly arranged, although Hobbs typically insisted on going as an [...] "extra team member" [...] so that none of those already selected would lose their place. [...] The importance of this to Sutcliffe was that his partnership with Hobbs could continue at the very highest level of cricket where the presence of Hobbs was ultimately the key factor in Sutcliffe's major success on the tour, which established him as a world-class player.|$|E
2500|$|The Army of the Potomac reached Frederick, Maryland, on September 13. There, Cpl. Barton Mitchell of the 27th Indiana Infantry {{discovered}} a mislaid {{copy of the}} detailed campaign plans of Lee's armySpecial Order 191wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically, thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, [...] "Now I know what to do!" [...] He waved the order at his old Army friend, Brig. Gen.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the Siege storyline, Doom was with the Cabal {{discussing}} the current problems with the X-Men and both Avengers teams. Doom demands that Osborn at once reverse his course of action against his ally Namor, to which Osborn refuses, saying that he and Emma Frost had [...] "crossed the line" [...] with him. Doom, loathing Thor and the Asgardians all the more due to his recent defeat at their hands, claims that he will support Osborn's [...] "madness" [...] should Namor be returned to him, but Osborn refuses. Osborn's mysterious ally, the Void, violently attacks Doom, and an apparently amused Loki tells the Hood that he should go, as there is nothing here for either of them, which the Hood, now loyal to Loki due to his hand in the restoration of his mystical abilities, agrees. However, it is revealed that [...] "Doctor Doom" [...] who had been involved with the Cabal was actually an upgraded Doctor Doombot, which releases swarms of Doctor Doombot nanites against the Cabal, tearing down Avengers Tower and forcing its denizens, such as the Dark Avengers, to evacuate. Osborn is rescued by the Sentry, who destroys the body. When Osborn contacts the real Von Doom, Victor informs him not to ever strike him again or he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further.|$|E
