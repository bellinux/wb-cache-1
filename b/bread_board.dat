He struck the high-road that led past the Staminal <b>Bread</b> <b>Board</b> and was just about to clamber over the barbed wire on his left and make his way through the trees to the crest that commanded the Black Strand garden when he perceived a man in a velveteen coat and gaiters strolling towards him. He decided not to leave the road until he was free from observation. The man was a stranger, an almost conventional gamekeeper, and he endorsed Mr. Brumley's remark upon the charmingness of the day with guarded want of enthusiasm. Mr. Brumley went on for some few minutes, then halted, assured himself that the stranger was well out of sight and returned at once towards the point where high-roads were to be left and adventure begun. But he was still some yards away when he became aware of that velveteen-coated figure approaching again. [...] "Damn!" [...] said Mr. Brumley and slacked his eager paces.

30|$|Ronkainen and Abrahamsson [P 16] also {{observe that}} experimenting cannot be avoided as the {{hardware}} constraints affect the code in an unpredictable {{way and that}} the amount of the embedded software generated with experimenting is significant. In addition, it is pointed out that as the development progresses and more teams are getting involved (as the product gets more and more integrated), the embedded software has to become more rigid as all the changes made in the later stages of development ripple further and further to other teams and developers. This requires changing practices during the project, which is not supported at the moment. This discussion was on constrained embedded software development, but in this study, we also looked for ways to develop embedded products including hardware. This idea is suited well to the embedded product development where later stage changes have a huge impact on the project. One of the ways in reducing the impact is proposed by Punkka[24] where SW and HW co-design is emphasized. The point is in starting early with what you can and using, e.g., <b>bread</b> <b>boards</b> and evaluation boards and rapidly build a demo or a prototype of the product by experimenting. This should help the problem with later stage changes as the development needs to become more rigid only after demo and prototype rounds. At this point, most of the uncertainty and the whole product-related changes should have been done, and required changes would not ripple down too far.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Developments {{in systems}} {{engineering}} concepts {{and in the}} regulatory environment necessitated improvements to the processes used by Denel Aviation {{for the development of}} electronic equipment and software for use on board aircraft. A project was undertaken to improve the existing systems and software development processes. Shortcomings in the existing development processes used by the organisation were identified. A set of process requirements was determined, referring to general characteristics of airborne electronic equipment and to regulatory standards. A process model, the Airborne Electronic System Development Process (AESDP) to be used by Denel Aviation, was developed. This proposed process model was designed to support incremental and iterative development. The process employs a strict requirements based development methodology in accordance with the standards and recommended best practises. Important aspects of the proposed model include the following: (i) verification of requirement implementation commences in the definition stages of the project and (ii) a parallel (in time) <b>bread</b> <b>boarding</b> process is used to validate requirements and test implementation strategies and trade-offs - this is done without using the rigorous configuration management and other control process applicable to the life cycle data of the item under development. The process model represents hierarchical development, i. e. system (or product), software and hardware layers. The organisational context of the model was delineated, project stages and decision gates were identified and different development “threads” and associated activities were described. Requirements for detailed methods and procedures associated with theses activities were identified. The process model that resulted from this work, was approved by Denel and SAAB and is currently being applied to manage the upgrade of the Oryx helicopter fleet of the South African air force.

40|$|A 30 kW class arcjet Power Conditioning Unit, PCU, {{was built}} and tested during this Phase 2 SBIR contract. The PCU is an {{improved}} version of two previously developed PCU's. All of these units are 3 -phase, 20 kHz buck regulators with current mode feed back to modulate the duty cycle {{to control the}} arcjet current at any selected operating point. The steady state control can assure arcjet stability despite the negative dynamic resistance of the arc discharge. The system also has a circuit to produce a high voltage start pulse to breakdown the gas and initiate the arc. The start pulse is formed by temporarily switching a short current path across the output terminals with a special solid state switching array. The switches then open rapidly, and the energy stored in the output inductors of the buck regulator produces a pulse of approximately 2500 V for approximately 500 nsec. The system was tested and modified until the transition to steady operation occurred after start up with a very small surge current overshoot. The system also can withstand a direct short circuit across the output without damage. The automatic feed back control simply reduces the duty cycle to hold the current at the set point. When the short is removed the full power output is immediately restored. This latest version arcjet PCU is conduction cooled to remove waste heat by conduction to the base plate. This unit is closer to flight a type of design than the previous functional <b>bread</b> <b>boards.</b> Waste heat is small because the PCU has a very high efficiency, 296 percent. The PCU was extensively tested with resistor loads to simulate operation with an arcjet. The unit was tested with ammonia arcjets at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Approximately 400 hours of testing were completed, with several starts. Many hours were also demonstrated with resistive loads. Some testing with hydrogen arcjets was also carried out at NASA LeRC.

40|$|On 20 September 2015, to {{coincide}} with the harvest moon and take part in a revival of Peterborough's 8, 000 year-old agricultural heritage thousands of people descended on the town of Peterborough for an extraordinary public art event: Act thirty-nine of Lucy + Jorge Orta's ongoing series 70 x 7 The Meal. For the occasion the artists proposed an immense table setting for 500 guests, in Peterborough’s Cathedral Square. They designed bespoke dinner services of commemorative limited edition Royal Limoges porcelain and a silk jacquard table runner woven with gold thread for an ‘offering table’. On the offering table were giant <b>bread</b> <b>boards</b> carved by residents of the local prison HMP Peterborough and hundreds of loaves of bread baked by local residents, which the artists had cast into aluminium. As with all Acts, seven ambassadors invited seven others, and so on, thereby creating a chain reaction that ensured a diverse mix of guests were drawn together. Along side a public lottery, volunteers from Peterborough’s Soup Kitchen catered for hundreds of spontaneous passers-by. The menu, prepared by chef Lee Clarke, included ingredients sourced by Peterborough farmers, city allotments and community growing projects. Five hundred loaves of bread were baked with provocative messages inserted inside, to stimulate conversations between diners. Preceding the Harvest weekend, public engagement activities included: bread making workshops, food tasting by local chefs, recipe sharing, urban gardening, corn dolly and flower arranging, Morris dancing, music, performances, art exhibitions, sound recordings, sharing of song, stories, traditions relating to the cultural importance of food. The project connected local residents with local food growers, producers and distributors, to re-establish a sense of pride in local production, especially as the region is considered the ‘bread basket’ of England. One of the ambitions of 70 x 7 The Meal was to reinstate the farmers market, an important economic and social gathering from the twelfth century until the 1960 s, and the lasting impact was the social benefits of bridging links to the culturally diverse communities in Peterborough, many of whom are engaged in agricultural production, raising awareness of organic, locally sourced and healthy eating, as well as ancient traditions that historically have broken down cultural barriers and bind people together. As a result of the resounding success, Harvest was awarded the Love British Food 2015 Harvest Heroes award, in acknowledgement of people who organise the most imaginative and inclusive celebrations of local food and the harvest...|$|R

40|$|Confirmation of the {{existence}} of complex behavior and synchronization of non-identical chaotic systems as reported in literature attracts much interest in secure communication, but practical implementation is still challenging. In this work, the dynamics of coupled non-identical circuits comprising periodically forced Duffing and Van der Pol oscillators is investigated via electronic simulation using Multism software and hardware implementation on electronic circuits board. After complete synchronization is achieved between the Duffing (Transmitter) and Van der Pol (receiver) circuits through the variation of the coupling resistor of the controller, its application to secure communication is therefore demonstrated experimentally and via multism. The results from the electronic simulation and hardware implementation on <b>bread</b> <b>board</b> using analog components are in good agreement with the numerical results in literature.
