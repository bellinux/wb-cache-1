5|$|The bell of the Nishi-Arai Daishi Temple in Tokyo {{was removed}} in 1943, to be melted down {{as part of}} the Japanese war effort. The crew of the USS Pasadena found it on a scrap heap and took it with them to the US as a war trophy, {{donating}} it to the city of Pasadena; the city council returned the <b>bell</b> <b>to</b> Tokyo in 1955. A similar story accompanies the bell of Manpuku-ji, which was taken to the United States on the USS Boston after the war; in this case, however, the Sendai authorities allowed the <b>bell</b> <b>to</b> remain in Boston as a symbol of friendship between the two cities. The Boston bell is the last WWII bonshō in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, Tadeusz Skarbek-Malczewski {{noticed that}} three of the <b>bells</b> {{returned}} <b>to</b> Warsaw belonged in fact to the Cathedral of Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine: consequently, he championed the idea to get these orphan <b>bells</b> <b>to</b> Bydgoszcz. Finally, in November 1923, those <b>bells</b> arrived <b>to</b> Bydgoszcz, one of them being handed over to Łabiszyn.|$|R

5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, public defender Blane Williams had urged <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> accept a plea bargain. At trial he rested the defense case without calling any {{witnesses}} or offering any evidence. The {{six members of}} Bell's jury were all white. The 150-person jury pool included black citizens, who make up 10percent of the parish's population, {{but none of the}} 50potential jurors who showed up was black. Williams did not challenge the composition of the jury pool.|$|E
5|$|Bonshō have {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as musical instruments in modern compositions. The recorded sound of temple bells was used in Mayuzumi Toshiro's piece Olympic Campanology, used to open the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. A temple bell is also used in performances of Jacob Druckman's piece Lamia, {{in which it is}} rung while placed on top of a kettledrum. Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple <b>bell</b> <b>to</b> replace the now common sound of the orchestral tam-tam.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the appellate}} ruling, on September 21, 2007, Judge Mauffray denied {{the request for}} <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> be {{eligible}} for bail pending possible further appeal. On September 26, Parish Attorney Walters announced that the prosecution would not appeal the appellate ruling, but would try Bell as a juvenile. Bell was released on $45,000bond, subject to electronic monitoring and {{under the supervision of}} a probation officer.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, the {{shortage}} of pig iron persuaded <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> install its own blast furnace for smelting mill cinder; this was a key decision, enabling the firm to expand. Only two years later, in 1844, the firm installed a second furnace at Walker for Cleveland Ironstone from Grosmont, six years before the boom in Cleveland iron when Vaughan and Marley discovered ironstone in the Eston Hills in 1850. From 1849, Losh, Wilson and Bell were subcontractors on the Newcastle-Gateshead High Level Bridge, responsible for constructing the bridge approaches.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth century, the World Peace Bell Association was set up in Japan, with the purpose of funding and casting temple <b>bells</b> <b>to</b> be placed around the world as symbols of peace.

5|$|In December 1966, the Army asked <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> {{prepare a}} {{detailed}} deployment concept combining the light defense of Nth Country {{with the point}} defense of Hardsite. On 17 January 1967, this became the I-67 project, which delivered its results on 5 July. I-67 was essentially Nth Country but with more bases near Minuteman fields, armed primarily with Sprint. The wide-area Zeus and short-range Sprint bases would both be supported by the PAR network.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} different deployment concepts {{under the}} Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|Normal diving {{decompression}} procedures {{range from}} continuous ascent for no-stop dives, where the necessary decompression occurs during the ascent, which is {{kept to a}} controlled rate for this purpose, through staged decompression in open water or in a <b>bell,</b> <b>to</b> decompression from saturation, which generally occurs in a decompression chamber {{that is part of}} a saturation system. Decompression may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration differential of the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable oxygen content.|$|E

5|$|On October 11, 2007, Mauffray {{found that}} Bell had {{violated}} {{the terms of}} his probation for previous convictions. The judge sentenced <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the 1946 {{championship}} game, Bell {{was notified}} that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal. Filchock was sanctioned by <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> play in the game but Hapes was suspended. At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing. However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|After Washington's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, {{and the city}} {{prepared}} for what {{was seen as an}} inevitable British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The bell was hastily taken down from the tower, and sent by heavily guarded wagon train to the town of Bethlehem. Local wagoneers transported the <b>bell</b> <b>to</b> the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, now Allentown, where it waited out the British occupation of Philadelphia under the church floor boards. It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the bell was placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding the}} Volunteers to a three-and-out {{to open the}} second half, the Alabama {{offensive}} responded with their first of three third-quarter touchdowns with a two-yard AJ McCarron touchdown run. On the following Tennessee drive, the Alabama defense stopped quarterback Matt Simms on a fourth-and-one to give the Crimson Tide offense {{the ball on the}} Volunteers' 39-yard line. On the next play, McCarron threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Kenny <b>Bell</b> <b>to</b> extend the Alabama lead to 20–6. Trent Richardson then scored his first touchdown of the game on the following Alabama possession on a 12-yard run to cap a six-play, 63-yard drive. Cade Foster scored early in the fourth quarter with his 45-yard field goal, and after a Dont'a Hightower interception, Richardson scored his second touchdown of the day on a one-yard run to make the final score 37–6.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} week of June 1945, Howe was back in Sydney, and almost {{immediately}} it was decided to send her for a refit in Durban. It was here that she saw out the remainder of the war. She was relocated back to Portsmouth by January 1946. In 1951, Howe was placed in reserve and towed to Devonport. She was ordered scrapped in 1957. On 27 May 1958, Howe was towed to Inverkeithing to be broken up by Thos W Ward. The Royal Navy presented the ship's <b>bell</b> <b>to</b> St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. In 2012, it was reported that parts from one of the gun turrets may still exist, having been re-used as a turntable at Dounreay nuclear laboratory.|$|E
