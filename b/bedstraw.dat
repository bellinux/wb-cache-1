Tasting menu dishes include asparagus {{which comes from}} the nearby Wye Valley, while turbot from Cornwall is used. There are foraged items included in the menu, such as hedge <b>bedstraw</b> and pennywort. Charlock is served with crab, while hogweed is used in an asparagus based dish. He uses foams on dishes, including on a Jerusalem artichoke starter comprising caramelized artichokes with goat's curd, trompette mushrooms and Parmigiano-Reggiano.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
50|$|Timarcha tenebricosa is monophagous, the larva feed {{exclusively}} on <b>bedstraws,</b> especially species with tender leaves (Galium verum, Galium mollugo). Eggs are laid in spring on <b>bedstraws.</b> Larvae are quite large (up to 20 mm) blue-black in color. Pupa overwinter.|$|R
25|$|Their larvae usually feed on <b>bedstraws</b> or madders (Rubia) {{but have}} been {{recorded}} on other Rubiaceae and Centranthus, Stellaria, and Epilobium.|$|R
50|$|As of 2013 {{there are}} around 630 species of Galium. Rubiaceae {{is the family}} that Galium obtusum is placed. The order of this species falls in Rubiales {{and there are two}} {{subspecies}} Galium obtusum Bigelow subsp. filifolium (Wiegand) Puff and Galium obtusum Bigelow subsp. obtusum. Galium obtusum is the first species to diverge in lineage. This plant has very different leaves when compared to other <b>bedstraws</b> as its leaves are rounded at the ends, most other <b>bedstraws</b> have leaf tips forming sharp apices meaning that they form a point at the leafs end.|$|R

25|$|The drier {{areas of}} heath have a grassy character, with typical species being {{matgrass}} (Nardus stricta) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Common tormentil (Potentilla erecta), dovesfoot cranesbill (Geranium molle), heath <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium saxatile), heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia) and heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) {{have also been}} recorded, as has the locally rare bird's-foot (Ornithopus perpusillus) and shepherd's cress (Teesdalia nudicaulis).|$|E
25|$|Large shrubs such as red-osier dogwood, beaked willow, saskatoon, chokecherry and pincherry, {{along with}} the smaller shrubs {{including}} prickly rose, snowberry, beaked hazelnut and high bush cranberry, form a dense entangled understory. Dense shrubbery is a typical feature in aspen-dominated forests. Common herbs found in the woodlands include: Lindley’s aster (Aster ciliolatus), northern <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium boreale), pea vine, Western Canada violet (Viola canadensis), dewberry and bunchberry. Mosses appear {{at the base of}} trees and on the ground.|$|E
50|$|The four-angled stems with whorls of bristly {{leaves and}} tiny flowers are {{reminiscent}} of the <b>Bedstraws</b> and other related Rubiaceae, but Sherardia is distinguished by its mauve/pink flowers that are organized in clusters and having a long corolla tube.|$|R
50|$|Larva pale brown, darker {{along the}} sides; the dorsal and subdorsal lines pale, dark-edged; spiracular line ochreous yellow.The larva feeds {{on a range}} of plants: It has been {{recorded}} on <b>bedstraws,</b> docks, hawkweeds, heather, lettuce, plantains and willows as well as grasses such as Poa. This species overwinters as a very small larva.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, the dried, matted {{foliage of}} the plant was once used to stuff mattresses. Several of the <b>bedstraws</b> were {{used for this purpose}} because the {{clinging}} hairs cause the branches to stick together, which enables the mattress filling to maintain a uniform thickness. The roots of cleavers {{can be used to make}} a permanent red dye.|$|R
25|$|The fell is {{actively}} managed by Durham County Council, {{in an effort}} to maintain a broad range of heathland species, including such desirable species as heath <b>bedstraw,</b> Galium saxatile, and common tormentil, Potentilla erecta. Bracken is particularly troublesome because it crowds out the heather and associated species. The County Council has used a combination of burning and selective herbicides to control the bracken, and in 2007 embarked on a three-year trial of a more environmentally-friendly method, using heavy horses to pull a roller that crushes the bracken.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} of the town, between Little Ponton and Saltersford, the River Witham flows through marshes and water meadows. These support a variety of plant species {{including}} vetches, cowslip, Primula veris, Lady's <b>bedstraw</b> {Galium verum}, and orchids, including the Southern Marsh Orchid, and wildlife, including herons, ducks, geese, water vole, and the now critically endangered white clawed crayfish. This area has notable populations of dragonflies, especially Aeshna grandis, Anax imperator, Libellula quadrimaculata and Calopteryx splendens, that are also found on Grantham Canal, which runs through The Vale of Belvoir {{to the west of the}} town. Wildlife can also be found in the town's Wyndham and Dysart Parks.|$|E
25|$|In more upland areas, drier {{habitats}} include calcareous grassland, {{which is}} very rare in a Northern Ireland context covering only 0.1% of the total land area, and which in only ten years, between 1990–2000, underwent a 7% decrease in coverage. Calcareous grassland is species rich, typified by blue moor-grass, wild-mountain thyme, lady's <b>bedstraw,</b> fairy flax and lady's-mantle as well as fescue grasses, sweet vernal grass, bent grass, crested dog's-tail grass, carnation sedge Cyperaceae and devil's-bit scabious on the thin layer of soil which covers the limestone rock. Within this type of habitat, limestone pavement can also often be found, which can promote an even greater diversity of species.|$|E
5000|$|In the British Isles the are one or {{two generations}} annually, with adults seen at any time from May to September. These moths are nocturnal. Larvae feed on <b>bedstraws</b> (Galium mollugo, Galium verum) and various legumes such as clovers (Trifolium medium, Trifolium pratense), trefoils, lucerne (Medicago sativa) [...] and meadow vetchling, {{primarily}} in June and July and from mid-August through September, though in Ireland and northern Britain larvae occur in July and August. The species overwinters as a pupa. This species flies both {{during the day and}} also at night when it is attracted to light.|$|R
25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s <b>Bedstraw</b> (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E
500|$|Scarce plants {{found at}} the warren include knotted {{pearlwort}} (Sagina nodosa), and slender <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium pumilum). Butterflies recorded here include the small blue (Cupido minimus), marbled white (Melanargia galathea), dingy skipper (Erynnis tages), grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), [...] small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene), and wall brown (Lasiommata megera).|$|E
500|$|... {{grassland}} {{communities and}} two of the woodland types have a restricted distribution in Britain, as does the calcareous grassland/acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. These support species, four of which are considered nationally rare while seven of the plant species present are considered notable. Plants of interest include the nationally rare Cheddar pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus), <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium fleurotii), dwarf sedge (Carex humilis) and dwarf mouse-ear (Cerastium pumilum). Rose Wood and King's Wood are ancient woodland sites. King's Wood has coppiced hazel and nationally important small leaved lime. The nationally rare purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum) occurs at Rose Wood.|$|E
500|$|On {{the slopes}} of Kilham Hill are {{the remains of a}} shielling, which {{provided}} shelter for shepherds watching over the sheep as they grazed. [...] In summer the hillside is a profusion of purple and blue as wild thyme, cross-leaved heath and harebells come into bloom; foxgloves have colonised the stony ground. [...] A stone cairn crowns the summit, and was found to conceal a Bronze Age cist containing burnt bones. [...] From the summit, there are views over the Milfield Plain, Glendale and the Till Valley, and to Eildon Hill, Yeavering Bell and the Cheviot Hills. [...] Buzzards, kestrels, lapwings and curlews are common, while bilberry, tormentil and heath <b>bedstraw</b> carpet the soil.|$|E
500|$|The Whitebrook, {{formerly}} known as The Crown at Whitebrook, is a restaurant with rooms in Whitebrook, [...] south-south-east of Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales, near the River Wye and the border with England. The building is thought to date from the 17th century and by the 19th century it {{was used as a}} roadside inn. Its restaurant was run by Chef Patron James Sommerin until 2013; it gained a Michelin star in 2007. It contains eight double rooms and a [...] garden. On 7 March 2013, it closed because of financial difficulties; at the time it had the longest held Michelin star in Wales. Critics praised the food under Sommerin, but have criticised the difficulty in finding the restaurant. It re-opened in October 2013 under new chef and owner Chris Harrod, and regained the Michelin star in 2014. Harrod serves a menu using locally produced meat and vegetables along with foraged ingredients such as charlock, hedge <b>bedstraw</b> and pennywort.|$|E
500|$|Leaving Oldbridge, the Way {{follows the}} road for {{approximately}} [...] before turning onto a boreen. To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the field, water from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed to be a place where locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath <b>bedstraw</b> and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre. Crossing the Glendasan River, it passes the remains of the Monastic City, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E
2500|$|Wet {{woodland}} (also called carr) on the low-lying swampy limestone {{areas within}} Lough Leane's floodplain is about [...] in size. This {{is one of}} the most extensive areas of this woodland type in Ireland. The dominant canopy species here are alder (Alnus glutinosa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), downy birch (Betula pubescens), and willow (Salix spp.). The areas that are periodically covered by water are rich in species including grasses, rushes, sedges, and flowers such as marsh <b>bedstraw,</b> meadow sweet, and water mint.|$|E
60|$|Cases of {{variation}} {{similar to those}} now adduced among butterflies might be increased indefinitely, but it is as well to note that such important characters as the neuration of the wings, on which generic and family distinctions are often established, are also subject to variation. The Rev. R.P. Murray, in 1872, laid before the Entomological Society examples of such variation in six species of butterflies, and other cases have been since described. The larvae of butterflies and moths are also very variable, and one observer recorded in the Proceedings of the Entomological Society for 1870 no less than sixteen varieties of the caterpillar of the <b>bedstraw</b> hawk-moth (Deilephela galii).|$|E

60|$|At Northchapel Mr. Hoopdriver {{consulted}} his map {{and took}} counsel and weighed his course of action. Petworth seemed a possible resting-place, or Pullborough; Midhurst seemed too near, and any {{place over the}} Downs beyond, too far, and so he meandered towards Petworth, posing himself perpetually and loitering, gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no names--for {{he had never heard}} of any--dropping them furtively {{at the sight of a}} stranger, and generally 'mucking about.' There were purple vetches in the hedges, meadowsweet, honeysuckle, belated brambles--but the dog-roses had already gone; there were green and red blackberries, stellarias, and dandelions, and in another place white dead nettles, traveller's-joy, clinging <b>bedstraw,</b> grasses flowering, white campions, and ragged robins. One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. In the lanes the trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges. Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly dun oxen. Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so. Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings--those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust--and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water. But instead he sat in a manly attitude, smoking a cigarette, for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come glittering round the corner. For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was present through it all, mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it, a touch that made this second day quite different from the first, an undertone of expectation, anxiety, and something like regret that would not be ignored.|$|E
60|$|To many persons it {{will seem}} {{impossible}} that such beautiful and detailed resemblances as those now described--and {{these are only}} samples of thousands that occur {{in all parts of}} the world--can have been brought about by the preservation of accidental useful variations. But this will not seem so surprising if we keep in mind the facts set forth in our earlier chapters--the rapid multiplication, the severe struggle for existence, and the constant variability of these and all other organisms. And, further, we must remember that these delicate adjustments are the result of a process which has been going on for millions of years, and that we now see the small percentage of successes among the myriads of failures. From the very first appearance of insects and their various kinds of enemies the need of protection arose, and was usually most easily met by modifications of colour. Hence, we may be sure that the earliest leaf-eating insects acquired a green colour as one of the necessities of their existence; and, as the species became modified and specialised, those feeding on particular species of plants would rapidly acquire the peculiar tints and markings best adapted to conceal them upon those plants. Then, every little variation that, once in a hundred years perhaps, led to the preservation of some larva which was thereby rather better concealed than its fellows, would form the starting-point of a further development, leading ultimately to that perfection of imitation in details which now astonishes us. The researches of Dr. Weismann illustrate this progressive adaptation. The very young larvae of several species are green or yellowish without any markings; they then, in subsequent moults, obtain certain markings, some of which are often lost again before the larva is fully grown. The early stages of those species which, like elephant hawk-moths (Chaerocampa), have the anterior segments elongated and retractile, with large eye-like spots to imitate the head of a vertebrate, are at first like those of non-retractile species, the anterior segments being as large as the rest. After the first moult they become smaller, comparatively; but it is only after the second moult that the ocelli begin to appear, and these are not fully defined till after the third moult. This progressive development of the individual--the ontogeny--gives us a clue to the ancestral development of the whole race--the phylogeny; and we are enabled to picture to ourselves the very slow and gradual steps by which the existing perfect adaptation has been brought about. In many larvae great variability still exists, and in some there are two or more distinctly-coloured forms--usually a dark and a light or a brown and a green form. The larva of the humming-bird hawk-moth (Macroglossa stellatarum) varies in this manner, and Dr. Weismann raised five varieties from a batch of eggs from one moth. It feeds on species of <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium verum and G. mollugo), and as the green forms are less abundant than the brown, it has probably undergone some recent change of food-plant or of habits which renders brown the more protective colour.|$|E
