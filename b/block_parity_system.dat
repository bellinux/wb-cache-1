It is shown that without parity projection, shape {{transitions in}} mixed <b>parity</b> <b>systems</b> {{are very similar}} to those in positive <b>parity</b> <b>systems,</b> both requiring a finite interaction strength for the onset of deformation. The shape-phase diagram in mixed <b>parity</b> <b>systems,</b> however, changes significantly after parity projection, with the critical point for the onset of octupole deformation moving to zero strength. Shape transitions in the Lipkin model are shown to exhibit the same features, indicating that this is a direct consequence of parity projection in finite, mixed <b>parity</b> <b>systems</b> independent of the nature of interacting particles.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{halftone}} image data hiding method called Data Hiding in <b>Block</b> <b>Parity</b> (DHBP), which hides {{data in the}} block-sum parity. DHBP assumes that the original multi-tone image is available and the halftoning method is ordered dithering. DHBP can hide a relatively large amount of invisible watermarking data in halftone images while retaining good visual quality. In DHBP, one bit of information is hidden in a block of size MxN by forcing the parity of {{the sum of the}} MN pixels to be even or odd according to the data bit to be embedded. To alter the parity, one out of the MN pixels is chosen by minimizing the local image intensity change. Some custom-made quality measures are proposed to evaluate DHBP.

Even after Sikkim’s merger with India (16 th April, 1975) this issue continues to be a source of contention among different communities and political parties in Sikkim.

Due to the introduction of a new generalized floating exchange rate system by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that stretched a smaller role of gold in the international monetary system in 1978, this fixed <b>parity</b> <b>system</b> as a monetary co-operation policy was terminated.

40|$|Hiding data in binary {{images can}} {{facilitate}} the authentication and annotation of important document images in digital domain. A representative {{approach is to}} first identify pixels whose binary color can be flipped without introducing noticeable artifacts, and then embed one bit in each non-overlapping block by adjusting the flippable pixel values to obtain the desired <b>block</b> <b>parity.</b> The distribution of these flippable pixels is highly uneven across the image, which is handled by random shuffling in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the problem of data embedding for binary images and investigate the incorporation of a most recent steganography framework known as the wet paper coding to improve the embedding capacity. The wet paper codes naturally handle the uneven embedding capacity through randomized projections. In contrast to the previous approach, where {{only a small portion}} of the flippable pixels are actually utilized in the embedding, the wet paper codes allow for a high utilization of pixels that have high flippability score for embedding, thus giving a significantly improved embedding capacity than the previous approach. The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated on several representative images. We also analyze the perceptual impact and capacity-robustness relation of the new approach...|$|R

40|$|In Cu_ 2 O parity {{is a good}} {{quantum number}} and thus the exciton {{spectrum}} falls into two parts: The dipole-active exciton states of negative parity and odd angular momentum, which {{can be observed in}} one-photon absorption (Γ_ 4 ^- symmetry) and the exciton states of positive parity and even angular momentum, which can be observed in two-photon absorption (Γ_ 5 ^+ symmetry). The unexpected observation of D excitons in two-photon absorption and of F excitons in one-photon absorption has given evidence that the dispersion properties of the Γ_ 5 ^+ orbital valence band is giving rise to a coupling of the yellow and green exciton series. In this paper we show that the even and odd <b>parity</b> exciton <b>system</b> can be consistently described within the same theoretical approach. However, the Hamiltonian of the even <b>parity</b> <b>system</b> needs, in comparison to the odd exciton case, modifications to account for the very small radius of the 1 S exciton. In the presented treatment we take special care of the central-cell corrections, which comprise a reduced screening of the Coulomb potential at distances comparable to the polaron radius, the exchange interaction being responsible for the exciton splitting into ortho and para states, and the inclusion of terms in the fourth power of p in the kinetic energy. Since the yellow 1 S exciton state is coupled to all other states of positive parity, we show how the central-cell corrections affect the whole even exciton series. The close resonance of the 1 S green exciton with states of the yellow exciton series has a strong impact on the energies and oscillator strengths of all implied states. The consistency between theory and experiment with respect to energies and oscillator strengths for the even and odd exciton system in Cu_ 2 O is a convincing proof for the validity of the applied theory...|$|R
