50|$|Meiringen is {{the only}} {{airfield}} with fully operational cavernes. The caverne at Meiringen was extended and refurbished for about 120 million Swiss Francs to comply {{to the needs of}} the current Swiss airforce F/A-18 fighters. Because of the weight of these aircraft hanging them in overhead cranes would be enormously expensive so that was not considered a viable option. Instead an extra tunnel had to be built. The tunnels are connected by some linking tunnels and extra dispersals were added on the opposite walls of each tunnel making it possible to operate 22 F/A-18s. The aircraft are able to roll in and out at the same time without the need of moving parked aircraft. A linking tunnel constructed directly before the <b>main</b> <b>blast</b> doors makes it possible to refuel and rearm an aircraft immediately after its mission without opening the <b>main</b> <b>blast</b> doors. A very important issue when a unit is working under CBRN conditions. The Meiringen caverne ammo storage has an extra tunnel to the outside.|$|R

40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} the physically based QinetiQ Porter-Gould (P-G) {{model for the}} mechanical response of PBXs {{over a number of}} years and applying it to the solution of real scenarios involving impact and <b>blast.</b> The <b>main</b> difficulty with these models is predicting the intermediate strain rate regime where the relaxation time for the polymer is of the same order as the duration of the loading (e. g. as in a Hopkinson bar test). The other main issue is the ability of the model to predict the stress/strain data as a function of temperature up to and through the glass transition temperature. The paper presents predictions from the QinetiQ P-G model compared to quasi-static compression and Hopkinson bar compression test data and discusses the results in terms of requirements for future developments of the model. © 2007 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCleaning {{technology}} {{is an important}} factor in the field of production technology as well as service and recycling. Blasting with solid carbon dioxide (dry ice blasting – dib) is generally based on compressed air, which is a flexible but energy consuming acceleration method. To improve the mechanical acceleration by rotational wheel <b>blasting,</b> the <b>main</b> removal mechanisms of dib, mechanical and thermal, have been investigated separately. Based on the developed methods both mechanisms can be characterized independently of the target type. The presented results show a promising approach to determine the size of the mechanical removal mechanism's impact force. Obviously it depends primarily on the blasting pressure, one of the main influencing process factors. Cleaning applications – substrate and the adherence of the residues – show different resistance against thermal stress as well as against mechanical impact. Because of this, an overall benchmark independently of the application had to be defined in order to compare the blasting efficiency of both blasting technologies and the results...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{effect of}} change of {{explosive}} type on fragmentation is investigated. Two blast tests in which ANFO {{is used in}} the first and BARANFO 50 {{is used in the}} second one as the <b>main</b> <b>blasting</b> agent were conducted at Lafarge Yibita � Lalahan Quarry. Both blasts were carried out at the same bench of the quarry having the same structural geology and same surface blast design parameters. The only varying parameter is the blasting agent. Both tests were monitored by continuous velocity of detonation recorder. Digital images were acquired from the muckpile after each blast test by using the same image sampling technique. Images were analyzed by using SPLIT software and size distributions of muckpiles obtained from both blasts were determined. SPLIT is a digital image processing software developed to compute size distribution of rock fragments from digital images. As a result of this research, it was shown that finer fragmentation is obtained by utilizing BARANFO 50 as the <b>main</b> <b>blasting</b> agent at a constant blasthole pattern. It is also shown {{that it is possible to}} expand the blasthole pattern as an alternative if the previous coarser fragmentation is preferred. Moreover, comparison of explosives should not be performed based solely on the purchase price. Since fragmentation affects all post-blast mining operations (loading, hauling, crushing, grinding, etc.), explosive performance should also be assessed by fragmentation evaluation using softwares which are proven to be accurate similar to SPLIT. 1...|$|R

40|$|Composite column {{as a key}} {{structural}} member can be subjected to a blast load {{as a result of}} an accident or a terrorist threat. In this paper, a method for assessing the blast resistance of a composite concrete-filled column is proposed. Moreover, different methods of enhancing composite member resistance to explosions are investigated. The blast situation is modeled in the FEM software using the CONWEP tool. This empirical formulation is relatively cheap from the computational point of view, as well as precise enough, hence it was chosen for this work purposes. Material models are based on well known elasto-plastic with linear hardening concepts. Important phenomenons are also taken into account, such as: contact formulation between the column components, strain rate dependence, damage initiation and evolution. Simulations are conducted for the most common type of explosion – surface <b>blast.</b> Its <b>main</b> feature is the effect of reflection of the ground surface and hence, amplification of the blast wave after the charge ignition. Results are presented in terms of minimum TNT mass equivalent required for a column member failure. Key words: composite column, blast loading, failure assessment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract–The sound {{production}} from the Morávka fireball has been examined in detail {{making use of}} infrasound and seismic data. A {{detailed analysis of the}} production and propagation of sonic waves during the atmospheric entry of the Morávka meteoroid demonstrates that the acoustic energy was produced both by the hypersonic flight of the meteoroid (producing a cylindrical blast wave) and by individual fragmentation events of the meteoroid, which acted as small explosions (producing quasi-spherical shock waves). The deviation of the ray normals for the fragmentation events was found to be as much as 30 ° beyond that expected from a purely cylindrical line source <b>blast.</b> The <b>main</b> fragmentation of the bolide was confined to heights above 30 km with a possible maximum in acoustic energy production near 38 km. Seismic stations recorded both the direct arrival of the airwaves (the strongest signal) as well as air-coupled P-waves and Rayleigh waves (earlier signals). In addition, deep underground stations detected the seismic signature of the fireball. The seismic data alone permit reconstruction of the fireball trajectory to a precision on the order of a few degrees. The velocity of the meteoroid is much less well-determined by these seismic data. The more distant infrasonic station detected 3 distinct signals from the fireball, identified as a thermospheric return, a stratospheric return, and an unusual mode propagating through the stratosphere horizontally and then leaking to the receiver...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of Information Theory {{to the analysis}} of genomic sequences and, specifically, transcription factor binding sites, {{is one of the most}} successful attempts at modeling the behavior and evolution of these genomic elements. As such, information theory models lie at the core of many transcription factor binding site search and motif discovery tools, such as the widely used Virtual Footprint and MEME. Nonetheless, the use of information theory methods has some caveats that are not usually taken into account explicitly. Many of these caveats are usually ineffectual, but they be a significant in certain cases, in the same way as a default minimum word-size in BLAST can have unanticipated consequences. With <b>BLAST,</b> the <b>main</b> problem faced by uninitiated users is that they need to understand the particulars of the algorithm in order to understand what the effects of parameter changes, like minimum word-size, might be. The algorithmic basis of BLAST may not be very difficult to understand, but the algorithm has a relatively large number of fine-tuning tweaks that can easily befuddle any user. In the case of Information Theory-based methods, algorithms are kept relatively simple, yet the assumptions on which they rely and the whole concept of Information Theory can be difficult to grasp or just plain counterintuitive to uninitiated users.
