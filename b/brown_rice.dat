25|$|The {{seeds of}} the rice plant are first milled using a rice huller to remove the chaff (the outer husks of the grain). At {{this point in the}} process, the product is called <b>brown</b> <b>rice.</b> The milling may be continued, {{removing}} the bran, i.e., the rest of the husk and the germ, thereby creating white rice. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> helps to prevent the disease beriberi.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Eugen Baumann {{observed}} iodine in thyroid glands. In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman {{worked with}} natives of Java, who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed {{the symptoms of}} beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them <b>brown</b> <b>rice,</b> discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as thiamine.|$|E

25|$|In some countries, {{a popular}} form, {{parboiled}} rice (also known as converted rice) {{is subjected to}} a steaming or parboiling process while still a <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, {{and the color of}} the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as <b>brown</b> <b>rice.</b> Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially thiamine) to move into the endosperm, so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.|$|E
25|$|Raw rice may {{be ground}} into flour for many uses, {{including}} making {{many kinds of}} beverages, such as amazake, horchata, rice milk, and rice wine.

25|$|Proteins are {{composed}} of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced keenwa), <b>brown</b> <b>rice,</b> corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic is a Group 1 carcinogen. The {{amount of}} arsenic in rice varies widely with the {{greatest}} concentration in <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> and rice grown on land formerly used to grow cotton, such as in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. White rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, which account collectively for 76 percent of American-produced rice, had higher levels of arsenic than {{other regions of the}} world studied, possibly because of past use of arsenic-based pesticides to control cotton weevils. Jasmine rice from Thailand and Basmati rice from Pakistan and India contain the least arsenic among rice varieties in one study. China has set a limit of 150 ppb for arsenic in rice.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole <b>brown</b> <b>rice</b> is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 37, 15, 1991 Egg white and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin-binding proteins, which are required for storage of free riboflavin in the egg {{for use by the}} developing embryo.|$|E
