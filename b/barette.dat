6000|$|March 14th, '86.--Mr. Laurence Barrette and Mr. and Mrs. Hutton [...] {{were here}} a little while ago, {{and we had a}} very {{interesting}} visit [...] from them. Papa said Mr. <b>Barette</b> never had acted so well before [...] when he had seen him, as he did the first night he was staying with [...] us. And Mrs. ---- said she never had seen an actor on the stage, [...] whom she more wanted to speak with.|$|E
50|$|Rugby {{was first}} played in France in 1879 - {{at the same}} time as <b>barette</b> was codified and began to expand. This appears to have created fertile ground for rugby to expand, which it did - {{especially}} in the main barette-playing areas of the south-west. As rugby expanded so <b>barette</b> declined.|$|E

50|$|The {{battle was}} a chase at this point, neither side could {{accurately}} fire {{on each other}} and when Diron moved in for a second attempt at boarding, he was repulsed {{in the same manner}} as the first. Barrete's last maneuver prevented the Americans from boarding but he ultimately steered his ship out of the wind so Decatur was able to overhaul Dominica and carry out a third attempt at boarding. It was about 3:30 pm when Captain Diron ordered his boarders to prepare for going over the side. At the last moment, Diron moved his ship so that the bow sprit of Decatur was heading directly for Dominicas stern. The two ships collided and Diron's jib boom pieced <b>Barette's</b> mainsail. The Americans were then able to board and gain control of Dominicas deck, forcing her colors down and ending the fight.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Barette</b> {{could not}} be thrown or punched forward, though it could be kicked or carried in the hands.|$|E
50|$|However, by {{the early}} 1930s the revival was over and after the Second World War the <b>barette</b> had {{virtually}} disappeared.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>Barette</b> crossed one of {{the sidelines}} the ball would be thrown into what was almost {{identical}} to a rugby line-out.|$|E
50|$|John Davenport <b>Barette</b> (May 14, 1862 - July 16, 1934) was an Army {{officer and}} later an American Brigadier general active during World War I.|$|E

5000|$|Simone Weil - French philosopher, Christian mystic, {{and social}} activist - is widely {{reported}} to have [...] "played rugby", though the sport she was playing was almost certainly <b>barette.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{would result}} in a [...] "scrum" [...] - a circle of players [...] "into which the <b>Barette</b> is dropped so that it rolls on the ground". The scrum would then kick the ball until it emerged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barette</b> {{was born}} in Thibideauville, La Fourche Parish, Louisiana. He {{attended}} Iowa State University {{for a year and}} then entered the United States Military Academy. He graduated from the Academy number nine of thirty-nine in the class of 1885.|$|E
50|$|Following the UN's {{defeat in}} the 1960 general {{election}} <b>Barette</b> resigned as UN leader on September 15, 1960. The caucus elected Yves Prévost as interim leader the following day. He resigned on January 11, 1961 and was succeeded as interim leader by Antonio Talbot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barette,</b> Barrette or Barrette Acquitaine {{was a form}} of football, {{originating}} in the south-west of France. Very similar in outward appearance to rugby union, it was codified in the 1880s and evolved into a popular women's team sport in the 1920s before disappearing shortly before the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|HMS Dominica was a {{schooner}} {{under the}} command of the young Lieutenant George Wilmot <b>Barette.</b> She had a crew of 88 men and was armed with twelve 12-pounder guns, two long 6-pounders, one brass 4-pounder and one 32-pounder. The British vessel was escorting the packet ship Princess Charlotte.|$|E
5000|$|La <b>Barette,</b> or [...] "the football", {{was played}} {{for many years}} prior to the nineteenth century in {{southern}} and central France. Also known as hien in Picardy, Artois and Brittany, and sometimes soule or shul its name comes from the name for the ball - the [...] "barette".|$|E
50|$|Petardi's {{first major}} role {{was in a}} mini series {{alongside}} Québécois stars Remy Girard, Gildor Roy, Michel <b>Barette,</b> Patrick Labbe and Chantal Fontaine. He has also starred in many television shows such as La vie and RentaGoalie, the latter garnering him 3 Gemini Award Nominations. He performed in films such as Rub & Tug, which {{was presented at the}} Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E
50|$|The Americans {{had five}} dead and fifteen wounded. Lieutenant <b>Barette</b> was mortally wounded but {{continued}} fighting with sword in hand until he died. In all, thirteen Royal Navy sailors {{were killed in}} action, forty-seven others were wounded, five mortally. Dominica and Decatur were both heavily damaged but Decatur managed to bring Dominica into Charleston, South Carolina a few days later. Captain Diron was made a hero for {{being one of the}} few privateer commanders to make a prize out of a Royal Navy warship during the war. Diron was already well known before the battle and Dominicas demise added to his notoriety. <b>Barette</b> was also reported by the Americans as having defended his ship until death in a most gallant fashion and when the survivors were released after the war, they said that they were treated well by Diron and his crewmen. The British never surrendered in the battle and were defeated by force alone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{treasure}} {{could have}} belonged to the sixth Pontus king, Mithridates Philopator Philadelphus. The contents were: [...] "a pure gold king's crown, 15 gold buttons, four gold bracelets with human and animal figures on it, 18 broken gold bracelets, a gold <b>barette,</b> two gold earrings, 10 big gold necklaces, a gold ring with a gem, 24 necklaces, 424 beads, a glass bowl, four earthenware, three kerosene lamps and an earthenware plate." ...|$|E
50|$|Diron {{approached}} cautiously {{but none}} of the vessels were flying colours. For over an hour the three vessels sailed side by side almost at gunshot distance as Diron attempted to ascertain the identity of the other vessels and to position his ship off Dominicas starboard bow. At 12:30 pm the Americans learned that their prey was a schooner-of-war when Lieutenant <b>Barette</b> raised the British flag and attempted to flee with the merchantman.|$|E
5000|$|Yvan Ponton and Yvon <b>Barette</b> (who played forward Jean-Guy Drouin and goaltender Denis Lemieux, the two French-Canadian {{players in}} the film) dubbed their own voices for the film's {{translated}} French version. The film is one of few mainstream American films that was translated in colloquial Québécois French and not Standard French. Heavy use of French-Canadian language and foul language has made {{this version of the}} film a cult classic in French Canada, where lines from the movie such as [...] "Dave est magané" [...] ("Dave's a mess") and [...] "Du hockey comme dans le temps" [...] (lit., [...] "like hockey from the times" [...] - [...] "Old Time Hockey") are common catch phrases.|$|E
50|$|The combatants fought {{at such a}} short {{distance}} from each other that Diron could hear <b>Barette</b> shouting to his men, telling them to take better aim and to fire into Decaturs hull. Their next salvos smashed two shot-holes through Decaturs hull, killing two men and also damaging the ship's sails and rigging. This, the most damaging British broadside of the battle, stopped an attempt at boarding and temporarily disabled Decatur, whose crew had quickly to repair the rigging. After repairs the Americans responded with fire from the Long Tom and began scoring more hits on Dominica. Many of the cannonballs landed on deck so the British tried to flee but Decatur was a fast ship and remained in Dominicas wake.|$|E
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Dannii {{returning}} home from a date. She then takes off her dress, slips into an oversized T-shirt, and then has a girls' night out with her girlfriends at her house, drinking, dancing, and playing around. Dannii's date calls her and she begins {{to get ready for}} her next date. She takes off her shirt and lies on her bed, daydreaming about her and her date being intimate. Dannii's girlfriends then help her get dressed, in the same blue dress, and they start dancing and playing around a final time before Dannii notices the doorbell. She puts her <b>barette</b> back in her hair, answers the door, and starts making out with her date, just like {{in the beginning of the}} video.|$|E
5000|$|In 1901 Puddicombe {{returned}} to Ottawa where {{he began a}} private music studio. The following year he founded the Canadian Conservatory of Music which was located on Bay Street in Ottawa. He served as the school's director for the next 35 years. His brother-in-law, the multi-talented Donald Heins, was enlisted {{as a member of}} the faculty and became an instrumental part of the school's success. Heins notably established the school's symphony orchestra in 1903 and served as its director through 1927. In 1910 the orchestra was restructured to become Ottawa's first professional symphony orchestra. Other notable teachers that Puddicombe enlisted were Annie Jenkins and Herbert Sanders. Among his notable pupils were Yvon <b>Barette,</b> Joseph Beaulieu, Gladys Ewart, Johana Harris, and Hélène Landry.|$|E

5000|$|In Sydney in 1921, two women's teams {{played a}} game of rugby league in front a crowd of 30,000 — a {{photograph}} appeared in The Times in 1922 — but pressure from authorities ensured {{that they did not}} play again. Throughout the 1920s a popular form of women's football game very similar to rugby called [...] "barette" [...] was played across France. The game had only minor differences to the full game (games were 10-a-side and had some minor restrictions on tackling) and there were national championships throughout the decade. It received support from several male rugby players and film also exists of a game being played in 1928. Both <b>barette</b> and the full game of rugby featured in several newspaper cartoons and many photographs exist. For reasons unknown the game appears to fade away in the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian Conservatory of Music was a music {{conservatory}} in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada {{that was}} actively providing {{higher education in}} music {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. Founded by Harry Puddicombe in 1902, the school was located on Bay Street. The building was designed by Edgar Lewis Horwood.Puddicombe's brother-in-law, Donald Heins, founded the conservatory's student orchestra in 1903 which eventually became Ottawa's first professional orchestra in 1910, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra (no relation to the current orchestra of that name). Some of the schools notable pupils and faculty members include composers Joseph Beaulieu, Gladys Ewart, Johana Harris, Bill Richards, and Herbert Sanders; and pianists Yvon <b>Barette,</b> Annie Jenkins, and Hélène Landry. The school closed in 1937, when the school's building was confiscated by the municipality of Ottawa to meet the expanding public school systems needs. The pianist Davenport Kerrison also used the name the [...] "Canadian Conservatory of Music" [...] to refer to his private music studio during the latter part of the 19th century.|$|E
