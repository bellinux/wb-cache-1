5|$|By {{utilizing}} a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they proposed {{to establish a}} fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per , then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not come about.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that Cicero had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not occur. Lastly, the intelligence might have made the Germans believe that there was no danger of attack in the Balkans, which may have been the most potentially damaging information gleaned by Cicero for the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{would be}} {{automatically}} included in any British {{declaration of war}} due to its lack of diplomatic powers, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not stop the colonial government from attempting to demonstrate its loyalty and legislative independence through supportive parliamentary motions and gestures. The Southern Rhodesian parliament unanimously moved to support Britain {{in the event of}} war during a special sitting on 28 August 1939.|$|E

5|$|Veerapandiya Kattabomman was re-released in 1984 during Ramachandran's {{tenure as}} Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The film was granted tax {{exemption}} {{by the state}} government and was commercially successful at that time as well, running for 30 weeks in theatres. In 2012, following the commercial success of the digital re-release of Karnan, Raj Television Network announced that they would re-release Veerapandiya Kattabomman in 3D in early 2013, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not materialise.|$|E
5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed {{the push}} for a parkway along the New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with {{ultimate}} PIP planner, Robert Moses, to establish and design the parkway. The plan originally {{was to have the}} PIP stretch from the Garden State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later. Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not stop the PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August28, 1958, the final piece of the PIP was completed between exits5 and9 in southern Rockland County.|$|E

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through that initiative, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduated nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not meet the country's need. At this point, {{it was clear that}} nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs. The need for additional federal aid for the recruitment of nurses became apparent when the U.S. Army and Navy called for 2,500 new nurses each month during the fiscal year 1943.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, Hesperus and the 14th Escort Group escorted a {{group of}} {{surrendered}} German U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lough Foyle. On 27 May, the ship and her sister Havelock escorted the exiled Norwegian government back to Oslo and remained there until 1 June. Ten days later, she began service as an aircraft target, a role that lasted for the next year. Hesperus was approved for scrapping on 18 February 1946 and was placed in Category C reserve in May. She was towed to Grangemouth for scrapping, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not begin until 17 May 1947. Hesperuss ensign was preserved in Yeovil Parish Church.|$|E
5|$|While {{discussing}} the 2006 remix of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts {{at a dinner}} party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio {{to listen to the}} demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working on the tracks in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working on the tracks in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on via e-mail.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt saw the Economic Bill of Rights as {{something}} that would, at least initially, be implemented by legislation, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not exclude either the US Supreme Court's development of constitutional jurisprudence or amendments to the US Constitution. Roosevelt's model assumed that federal government would take the lead, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not prevent states improving their own legislative or constitutional framework beyond the federal minimum. Much of the groundwork had been laid {{before and during the}} New Deal but left many of the Second Bill of Rights' aspirations incomplete. Internationally, the same economic and social rights were written into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.|$|E

25|$|Other {{approaches}} to the chronology of Jesus have been suggested over the centuries, e.g. Maximus the Confessor, Eusebius, and Cassiodorus asserted that the death of Jesus occurred in AD31.
