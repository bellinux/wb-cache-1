5|$|In {{a similar}} reaction, pentaisopropylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 can be {{synthesised}} from pentamethylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 in 80% yield. These reactions {{demonstrate that the}} acidity of the methyl hydrogens in a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complex can <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> increased {{by the presence of}} the metal centre. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds with potassium hydroxide deprotonating a methyl group and the resulting carbanion undergoing nucleophilic substitution with methyl iodide to form a new carbon–carbon bond.|$|E

This led to a decision in 2012 to withdraw the entire fleet from service {{and replace them with}} M5000's. All of the T-68 and T-68As were withdrawn between April 2012 and April 2014.|$|E

5|$|A {{theodolite}} can <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> {{more accurate}} if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a revision of}} the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini {{on the basis of}} nuclear and mitochondrial data. They showed that the springbok and the gerenuk (Litocranius walleri) form a clade with saiga (Saiga tatarica) as sister taxon. The study pointed out that the saiga and the springbok could <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> {{different from the rest of}} the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study even suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.|$|E
5|$|RML ordered Magdalena in 1946. Her keel {{had been}} laid by 8 October when Harland and Wolff applied for a {{passenger}} certificate for the ship. In 1947 {{it was reported that}} delivery would be delayed until the end of 1948 and that the cost of building her would <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> higher than the estimated cost when the order was placed. She was built to replace , which had been sunk in 1940. Magdalena was the first passenger ship built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast {{after the end of the}} war and the third-largest being built in the United Kingdom at that time.|$|E

Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor.

5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E
5|$|The only {{disagreements}} {{were over}} {{the size and}} range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved {{not to be the}} barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed. The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time {{it was clear that the}} two aircraft would <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus engines, being developed for the TSR-2, allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears {{to be influenced by}} its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to <b>be</b> <b>considerably</b> reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.|$|E
