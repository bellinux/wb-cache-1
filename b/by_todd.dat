5|$|Hoshino based Allen's {{characterization}} on Robin, the shorter-haired female {{protagonist of}} her one-shot comic Zone.

In the anime television series, Allen was voiced by Sanae Kobayashi. The voices were recast for the 2016 anime television series D.Gray-man Hallow, with Ayumu Murase replacing Kobayashi. In the English adaptation of the anime series, Allen has been voiced <b>by</b> <b>Todd</b> Haberkorn.|$|E

5|$|Having {{completed}} work on Oblivion in 2006, Bethesda Game Studios {{began work}} on Fallout 3. It was during this time that the team began planning their next The Elder Scrolls game.

5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass <b>by</b> <b>Todd</b> Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed Kansas to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E
