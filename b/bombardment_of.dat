5|$|In February 1915, Agamemnon {{was ordered}} to {{participate}} in the Dardanelles Campaign. She departed Portland on 9 February, and joined the British Dardanelles Squadron at Mudros 10 days later. That was {{the second day of the}} opening <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman Turkish forts guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles and the ship immediately joined the attack. She also took part in the subsequent <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> the inner forts later in February. Agamemnon was hit by seven 240-millimetre (9.4-inch) shells in ten minutes on 25 February and was holed above the waterline, suffering three dead.|$|E

5|$|Joined by Howe and re-designated Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet {{was again}} {{involved}} in operations in late March 1945, when it launched {{attacks on the}} Sakishimo-Gunto airfields, a task it repeated in early May. On 4 May 1945 King George V led battleships and cruisers in a forty-five-minute <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> Japanese air facilities in the Ryukyu Islands. As the Allies approached the Japanese homeland, King George V was dispatched in mid-July to join the US battleships in a <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> industrial installations at Hitachi. King George V fired 267 rounds from her 14-inch guns during this operation. The task force {{then moved on to}} Hamamatsu in southern Honshu, where it carried out a further <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> aviation factories. During the Okinawa campaign, the battleship supported four fast carriers of the British Pacific Fleet. Her last offensive action was a night <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> Hamamatsu on 29 and 30 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|SMS Árpád  was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} {{built by}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the early 20th century. She was launched on 11 September 1901 as the second of three s. Along with her sister ships, she participated at the <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> Ancona during World War I. Due to a shortage of coal, she was soon decommissioned after the <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> Ancona and used as harbor defense ship {{for the remainder of}} the war. After the war, all of the Habsburg-class battleships were ceded to Great Britain as war prizes. She was scrapped in Italy in 1921.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> 19 February, Gaulois bombarded Turkish forts {{covering}} {{the mouth of}} the Dardanelles, although Charlemagne did not participate that day. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but was only lightly damaged. The two ships traded positions during the <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> 25 February, although Charlemagne was not damaged. On 2 March, the French squadron bombarded targets in the Gulf of Saros, {{at the base of the}} Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Turkish guns while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. Gaulois was hit by one shell during this attack that failed to detonate. Admiral Guépratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Turkish fortifications.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the flight}} of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau, Habsburg was {{transferred}} to the IV Division along with her sisters when the first new s came into service in 1912. After Italy entered World War I on the side of France and Great Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Navy bombarded several Italian port cities along the Adriatic coast. Habsburg took part in the <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> Ancona on 23 May 1915. During the attack on the Italian port city, Habsburg bombarded the town's train station, the St. Stefano military camp and Ancona coastal batteries. The <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> Ancona was Habsburgs only combat operation.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E

5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E

5|$|The lightest {{mendelevium}} isotopes (245Md to 247Md) {{are mostly}} produced through <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> bismuth targets with heavy argon ions, while slightly heavier ones (248Md to 253Md) {{are produced by}} bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter ions of carbon and nitrogen. The most important and most stable isotopes {{are in the range}} from 254Md to 258Md and are produced through <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> einsteinium isotopes with alpha particles: einsteinium-253, -254, and -255 can all be used. 259Md is produced as a daughter of 259No, and 260Md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium-254 and oxygen-18. Typically, the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore {{can be used as a}} target for longer. Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium, femtogram quantities of mendelevium-256 may be produced.|$|E
5|$|The longer-lived {{isotopes}} of polonium, 208Po and 209Po, can {{be formed}} by proton or deuteron <b>bombardment</b> <b>of</b> bismuth using a cyclotron. Other more neutron-rich and more unstable isotopes can be {{formed by the}} irradiation of platinum with carbon nuclei.|$|E
