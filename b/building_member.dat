5000|$|The building, {{located at}} 1019 South Perry Street, {{across from the}} Governor's Mansion, was {{the home of the}} bar's Center for Professional Responsibility. In the fall of 1992, work was {{completed}} on a $3.5 million addition to the bar headquarters <b>building.</b> <b>Member</b> donations covered {{a little more than a}} third of the cost. The addition provided 32000 sq ft, including space for the Center for Professional Responsibility. The original headquarters building was also refurbished and included an office for the state bar president and three conference rooms that are used by state bar committees or can be reserved for use by state bar members. [...] A portion of the previously unoccupied third floor of the bar addition was built out in 1999 to add office space for several of the bar’s newest programs. Also, a state-of-the-art video conference room was added on the third floor, and is available for use by bar committees and sections. Attorneys may use this facility for client teleconferences and tele-depositions for a reasonable charge. A major refurbishment of the first and second floors of the facility was completed in 2002 with the addition of more parking across the street from the bar center. In 2008, additional office space was created on the third floor as part of a $626,000 build-out of that floor and renovations for the first and second floors. [...] The State Bar Center features various public recognitions of lawyers, judges and non-lawyers illustrating dedicated service to the profession, judicial excellence and the public service character of the legal profession. It is decorated with original works of art created by such prominent Alabama artists as Jake Waggoner, Barbara Gallagher, Russ Baxley, Roger Brown, and Nall, to cite a few examples.|$|E

In this article, we apply theory from the field of social psychology to understand how online communities develop member attachment, an important dimension of community success. We implemented and empirically tested two sets of community features for <b>building</b> <b>member</b> attachment by strengthening either group identity or interpersonal bonds. To increase identity-based attachment, we gave members information about group activities and intergroup competition, and tools for group-level communication. To increase bond-based attachment, we gave members information about the activities of individual members and interpersonal similarity, and tools for interpersonal communication. Results from a six-month field experiment show that participants ’ visit frequency and self-reported attachment increased in both conditions. Community features intended to foster identity-based attachment had stronger effects than features intended to foster bond-based attachment. Participants in the identity condition with access to group profiles and repeated exposure to their group’s activities visited their community twice as frequently as participants in other conditions. The new features also had stronger effects on newcomers than old-timers. This research illustrates how theory from the social science literature can be applied to gain a more systematic understanding of online communities and how theory-inspired features can improve their success...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies wind-induced {{interference}} effects on {{a row of}} five square-plan tall buildings arranged in close proximity. Mean and fluctuating wind loads are measured on each <b>building</b> <b>member</b> and wind-induced dynamic responses of the building are estimated with the high-frequency force-balance technique. The modifications of building responses from interference over a practical range of reduced velocities are represented by an envelope interference factor. Wind tunnel experiments and response analysis are carried out under all possible angles of wind incidence, at four different building separation distances, and for two arrangement patterns of buildings in the row, that is the parallel and diamond patterns. It is found that building interference leads to amplified dynamic responses in many cases but reduction in responses also occurs at some wind incidence. For a building row of the parallel pattern, five distinct wind incidence sectors of different levels and mechanisms of interference effect can be identified. The largest values of envelope interference factors can reach 2. 4 for the torsional responses. When the row of tall buildings is arranged in the diamond pattern, increase in wind excitation occurs at many wind angles due to a "wind catchment" effect. The interference factors have larger peak values, reaching 2. 1 in the sway directions and above 4 in torsion. However, all large amplifications of building responses do not occur in the situations of peak resonant dynamic responses of the single isolated building. Thus, the design values of peak dynamic responses of a tall building are not significantly magnified when placed in a row. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|E
40|$|If {{concrete}} {{is used as}} {{a building}} material the tensile strength of the reinforcement {{is one of the most}} important material properties. Traditionally concrete is reinforced with steel rebars. Textile reinforced concrete (TRC) represents a new and innovative building material, in which the reinforced is made out of technical textiles. Technical textiles are made out of AR-glass or carbon. Even the glass is considered to be alkali-resistant, the AR-glass reinforcement shows a certain loss of tensile strength over the live time of a <b>building</b> <b>member.</b> This strength loss can be up to 40 % during an exposure time of 50 years. This loss of strength is mainly caused by an alkaline attack of the glass network due to the high alkalinity of the pore solution of concrete. Due to the requirements of the load-bearing capacity as well as the handling during the production of TRC building members, the reinforcement structures used meanwhile are impregnated with polymers. As polymers there are two different kinds used – water-based dispersions, e. g. SBR-dispersions, or reactive coatings, e. g. epoxy resins. The polymer-impregnation cannot only increase the load-bearing capacity but can also decrease the loss of strength of AR-glass. In order to quantify the long term loss of strength of such polymer-impregnated AR-glass reinforcement structures within the presented thesis a prediction model, called the "hull-model", was developed. The model is based on intensive laboratory research, which covers investigations of the single components of TRC (concrete, AR-glass reinforcement and polymers) as well as the compound material. Based on these laboratory investigations the deterioration mechanisms, which lead to a reduction of the tensile strength, could be identified. The physical as well as chemical processes, which lead to an decrease of the tensile strength, represent the basics of the model. The parameters of the model can all be determined by (comparatively simple) laboratory investigations. One of the main parameters, which affect the long-term loss of strength, is the diffusion coefficient of the polymer used to impregnated the AR-glass. In general the polymer-impregnation with epoxy resin leads to a reduction of the long-term loss of strength by the factor of 2. The model also allows identifying the main parameters, which affect the long-term loss of strength of polymer-impregnated AR-glass. The diffusion coefficient of the polymer as well as the shape of the reinforcement both affects the long-term loss of strength dramatically. Low diffusion coefficients (such as typical for prepreg-epoxy systems) as well as compact reinforcement cross-sections minimize the strength loss...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{important}} potential for a development of a building system, if the present AACblock plants are completed with high performance concrete and pre-stressing technique. This can be done as a continuation of a present AAC production or in a site factory. Hybrid cooperation between AAC and concrete {{is not a new}} technology. Traditionally, AAC is covered with rendering. The wetted material is first sprayed with cement slurry after which comes lime/cement-based rendering which strengthens the wall and supplies a mechanical protection. AAC blocks can be used as infill members in concrete deck plates and concrete framed walls (Hellers, 1993), in which the shrinkage of the surrounding concrete locks completely the cured blocks into a stable composite. A good cooperation between AAC and concrete is a requirement for the pre-stressed hybrid. This combination has been investigated with reference to bond and moisture content. The interface must have sufficient bond to supply shear strength to the structural member. Also, the concrete should be suitable for pre-stressing which requires a minimum strength class K 40. Here, K 60 is applied in order to reduce creep and avoid creep failure of the AAC. A production layout for the purpose is suggested. This research consists of three parts: 1 - Hybrid concrete elements The principal formulation of hybrids, built on cooperation between two concrete materials, a weak AAC and a strong HPC poured on top, shows that this combination unites the most favourable qualities of the two concretes into a structural element with rational building technology. Load-bearing capacity is good, and the fire protection is excellent. Through pre-stressing of the structural concrete, a crack-free behaviour is guaranteed up to the service limit, and deflection from dead weight (incl. floor covering and possibly half the service load) be eliminated. The most important structural elements needed in a building system could be taken as hybrids. In drawings, different members like floor- roof- and wall members, window and door lintels are shown. 2 - Production system for hybrids AAC blocks form a bed containing the pre-stressing steel in slits and on which high performance concrete is poured. Pre-stressing brings the two concretes together. This is especially important for the shear capacity of a <b>building</b> <b>member,</b> by which extra dowels can be omitted. The pre-stressing force is anchored by plates directly against the cured AAC blocks. A special pre-stressing bed is not required. The production is arranged {{in such a way that}} necessary equipment (trays, form strips, wedges, locks) are circulated within twenty-four hours. The necessary manpower for this facility is analysed. Normally 8 men are needed per shift. A detailed conceptual production layout for a hybrid production plant is included for discussion. See figure 6. 2 (suggested production layout). 3 - Application in building The hybrid members are united at joints and through seams. Continuity over connections is achieved by filling seams with mortar grout. Reinforcement may be included to achieve ductility. By a similar method, it is possible to make connections between horizontal and vertical building members. Common connection details are shown in the report. This building method replaces the equivalent method with concrete or AAC members, and it is in fact a coordination between these two. The maximum span of floor members is up to 9 m. It makes the system suitable for modern residential house production, but also suitable for office buildings, industrial halls and other applications. See attached drawings, part 2 and part 3.
