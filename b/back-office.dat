40|$|There are {{apparently}} very few incentives for government managers to imple-ment Privacy-Enhanced Identity Management Systems {{on a large}} scale in an eGovernment architecture. In this paper we explain why this is understandable to some extent and introduce a less far-going alternative – provisionally – called Privacy-Friendly Identity Management. We conclude with a brief analysis of one important driver to choose for “Privacy-Friendly Identity Management Systems”: risk manage-ment. 1 Identity Management in eGovernment There are probably as many definitions of the term eGovernment as there are people working in that field. The definition used in Belgian federal eGovernment runs as follows: “eGovernment is the continuous optimization of service deli-very and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, internet and new media”. 1. This optimization relies on a number of important principles, inter alia, treating information as a strategic resource for all government activities and the integration of backoffices. 2 From a technical perspective the integration of <b>back-offices</b> is typically looked for through a (cross-border) “Service Oriented Architecture”(SOA). In practice, identity management components are often integrated as basic service components of such a SOA in eGovernment. These services are then compiled with other services to so-called value-added services. 3 Depending on the goals of the eGovernment project, it is usually good to start with a risk assessment of the organization’s activity...|$|R
40|$|Getting to work, keeping appointments, {{and taking}} {{advantage}} of employment support services require suitable transportation. Many low-income Californians do not own cars and, outside of large metropolitan areas, public transit services are often sparse or non-existent, {{making it difficult for}} jobless individuals to make the transition from welfare-to-work. The challenges are especially great for those trying to get from central-city residences to suburban jobs, so-called reverse commuters, since public transportation services have traditionally been aligned in the opposite direction. Propelling the growth in reverse commuting has been a number of powerful megatrends. Topping the list has been decentralization of employment, spawned by such factors as cheaper real estate prices on the outskirts and telecommunication advances that have allowed suburban <b>back-offices</b> to easily communicate with central-city core offices. Spatial mismatches have been blamed for the persistent problem of concentrated unemployment in California’s inner cities. Those with minimal education and work skills are increasingly isolated from the many entry-level and service-sector jobs in the suburbs. Many inner-city residents with suburban jobs work late-hour shifts and on weekends, periods when many buses and trains do not operate. This study: (1) defines the existing reverse-commute marketplace in California; (2) identifies and evaluates existing public transportation services in terms of their success and responsiveness in serving reverse-commute and job-access demands; (3) examines unmet mobility needs; and (4) proposes policy initiatives and strategies that hold promise for significantly improving reverse-commute services throughout the state...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Hemorrhages of {{confidential}} patient health data create {{privacy and}} security concerns. While the US HIPAA legislation on privacy and security {{went into effect}} over five years ago, healthcare information security remains a significant concern as organizations migrate to electronic health records. The recent HITECH legislation aimed at accelerating this migration contained mandates for greater security, including the addition of new requirements on breach reporting. We examine a recently collected sample of inadvertently disclosed files found on internet-based file-sharing networks. We characterize the security risk of these files and also present evidence of the threat by analyzing user-issued searches. Our analysis indicates that the threat and vulnerability for the healthcare sector continued, even as HITECH became effective. Keywords-Healtcare information, data leaks, security Inadvertent disclosures of private customer information have occurred in nearly every industry from banking to healthcare. Such leaks directly impact customers through embarrassment, fraud, and identify theft. In the healthcare sector, data hemorrhages have multiple consequences [1]. In some cases, the losses translate to privacy violations and social stigma. In other cases, criminals exploit the information to commit fraud or medical identity theft. The fragmented nature of the US healthcare system results in data hemorrhages from many different sources including acute-care hospitals, physician groups, ambulatory healthcare providers, medical laboratories, insurance carriers, <b>back-offices</b> of health maintenance organizations, and outsourced service providers such as billing, collection, and transcription firms. In this paper, we examine the recent Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) legislation and its potential impact on the security of protected health information (PHI).

2500|$|The Charga-Plate, {{developed}} in 1928, {{was an early}} predecessor of the credit card and {{was used in the}} U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a 2½" [...] × 1¼" [...] rectangle of sheet metal related to Addressograph and military dog tag systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper [...] "charge slip" [...] positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an inked ribbon against the charge slip. Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co. Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today. In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase.
