To relief the constipation, the opioid patch was removed, and then the PSH was recurred at 3  days after cessation of the patch. Therefore, the opioid patch (fentanyl propanamide, 25  mcg/hr) was reapplied and PSH was subsided again.

40|$|Contractions {{elicited}} by CaCl 2 on isolated rat stomach strip preparations {{have been}} reported to be potentiated by interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta). We have investigated whether this effect can be reduced by the putative IL- 1 <b>beta</b> <b>antagonist,</b> alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha MSH). Additionally, the effects of alpha MSH on the specific binding of IL- 1 beta to B- and T-cells have been investigated to further clarify its inhibitory activities. Both alpha MSH and its carboxyl terminal tripeptide concentration dependently reduced the potentiation of CaCl 2 -induced contractions caused by IL- 1 beta but not those caused by leukotriene D 4, the parent molecule being approximately 250 times more active. Additionally, both peptides potently and selectively reduced 125 I-IL- 1 beta binding to the T-cell sub-clone EL 4 - 6. 1 but not to the B-cell sub-clone 1 H 7.

We also demonstrate by means of microdialysis that administration of Pr-IIGL abolished A beta(1 - 42) induced increases in extracellular aspartate and glutamate concentrations in the MEN, which coincide with a significant preservation of cholinergic MBN neurons and their cortical projections. This neuroprotective effect was associated with preserved exploratory behavior in an open-field paradigm, and improved memory retention in a step-through passive avoidance task.

40|$|Membrane {{potential}} and flavoprotein redox state have been measured simultaneously and continuously in brown adipose tissue {{in order to}} determine how nerve stimulation and adrenergic agonists control its metabolic activity. Both trains of nerve impulses and addition of noradrenaline evoke two temporally distinct cell depolarizations. The first rapid depolarization precedes the increase in flavoprotein reduction. With nerve stimulation, at the time of maximum flavoprotein reduction the cell has repolarized or hyperpolarized. The second slow depolarization follows flavoprotein reduction. Phentolamine, an alpha antagonist, selectively blocks the first depolarization, but not the flavoprotein reduction. However the time of maximum flavoprotein reduction is delayed. Propranolol, a <b>beta</b> <b>antagonist,</b> delays the first repolarization until the end of nerve stimulation and inhibits the transient hyperpolarization, second depolarization and flavoprotein reduction. Isoproterenol, a beta agonist, or the fatty acid octanoate produce only a transient hyperpolarization and subsequent slow depolarization following flavoprotein reduction. Thus brown adipose tissue contains both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of alpha receptors produces an early membrane depolarization. Stimulation of beta receptors leads to an increase in metabolic activity which then appears to produce slow changes in membrane potential...|$|E

Production of CXCL 8 was exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by co-treatment with the beta(2) agonist sabutamol (IC(50) = 1. 1 nM). The inhibitory effect of salbutamol was beta receptor-mediated since the effect was prevented by the <b>beta</b> <b>antagonist</b> sotalol. Salbutamol also elevated intracellular levels of cAMP (EC(50) = 82 nM) but the relationship to the inhibition of CXCL 8 secretion was not clear-cut since much higher concentrations of salbutamol were required to elevate total cellular cAMP than inhibit CXCL 8 production. However, the effect of salbutamol {{is likely to be}} mediated by elevation of cAMP since forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, mimicked the effects of salbutamol while the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2 ', 5 '-dideoxyadenosine inhibited the effects of salbutamol. Potentiation of cAMP production by co-treatment with the phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor rolipram only marginally enhanced the inhibitory effect of salbutamol on CXCL 8 production. Taken together, these data suggest that elevation of cAMP production is required for the inhibitory effect of salbutamol on CXCL 8 production by keratinocytes and that low threshold levels of cAMP are sufficient to mediate this effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytokine}} interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) is {{a potent}} hyperalgesic agent in the rat whereas IL- 1 alpha is relatively inactive (Ferreira et al., 1988). IL- 1 beta induced a dose-dependent increase in the sensitivity of rat paws to mechanical stimulation following intra-plantar injection but this effect was not reduced by indomethacin (1. 0 mg kg- 1, p. o.), at a dose known to inhibit completely prostaglandin synthesis in the rat (Salmon et al., 1983). Prostaglandin (PG) E 2 enhanced sensitivity to both mechanical pressure and increased temperature but IL- 1 beta enhanced only sensitivity to pressure. These observations indicate that IL- 1 beta sensitized pressure-sensitive but not temperature-sensitive sensory neurones, through a prostaglandin-independent mechanism. Hyperalgesia induced by IL- 1 beta but not PGE 2, was inhibited by the neuropeptide melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha MSH) and its analogue [Nle 4, D-Phe 7] alpha MSH which are known to antagonize IL- 1 responses in other systems (Holdeman & Lipton, 1985; Cannon et al., 1986). IL- 1 beta-induced hyperalgesia was also reduced by the putative IL- 1 <b>beta</b> <b>antagonist</b> Lys-D-Pro-Thr (Ferreira et al., 1988) but alpha MSH and its analogue were 10 - 50 times more potent...|$|E

The histology of the tumours was squamous cell carcinoma in two cases, adenocarcinoma in one, carcinoid tumour in one, and large cell carcinoma in one. The regional blood volume and extravascular tissue density were also measured using PET. Regions of interest were drawn for both non-tumour and tumour lung tissue. RESULTS: The mean (SD) blood volume was 0. 142 (0. 025) ml/ml in tumour regions and 0. 108 (0. 010) ml/ml in normal lung regions [...] a difference of 31 %.

In membranes of differentiated HL- 60 cells, propranolol activated high-affinity GTP hydrolysis with a half-maximal effect at 0. 19 mM and a maximum at 1 mM. There was a close correlation between the log Q values (logarithm of the octanol: water partition coefficient) of <b>beta</b> AR <b>antagonists</b> and the logarithm of their effectiveness at activating GTPase (EC 3. 6. 1. -) in HL- 60 membranes. The lipophilic LA, tetracaine, was also an effective activator of GTPase in HL- 60 membranes, whereas more hydrophilic LAs were less stimulatory (bupivacaine and lidocaine) or even inhibitory (procaine). Propranolol and tetracaine also stimulated binding of guanosine 5 '-O-[3 -thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) to HL- 60 membranes, but their stimulatory effects on GTP[gamma S] binding were smaller than on GTP hydrolysis. The stimulatory effects of propranolol and tetracaine on GTPase and GTP[gamma S] binding were inhibited by pertussis toxin. Propranolol and tetracaine effectively activated GTP hydrolysis of a reconstituted mixture of bovine brain Gi/Go-proteins, but the concentrations of substances needed for GTPase activation were higher than in HL- 60 membranes. Procaine showed stimulatory effects on the GTPase of Gi/Go-proteins. Our data show that <b>beta</b> AR <b>antagonists</b> and LAs activate pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, presumably through interaction with the C-terminus of their alpha-subunits. Apparently, the lipophilic domain of <b>beta</b> AR <b>antagonists</b> and LAs is more important for G-protein activation than the basic domain.

Unlike astressin and photo astressin, ATB- [His 12]Svg((12 - 40)) showed high selective binding to mCRF(2 beta) (K-i = 3. 1 +/- 0. 2 nM) but not the rCRF(1) receptor (K-i = 142. 5 +/- 22. 3 nM) and decreased Svg-stimulated cAMP activity in mCRF(2 beta) -expressing cells in a similar fashion as aSvg- 30.

40|$|The {{effects of}} alpha 1 -adrenergic {{agonists}} on the waveforms of action potentials and voltage-gated ionic currents {{were examined in}} isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes by the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique. After "puffer" applications of either of two alpha 1 agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, action-potential durations were increased. In voltage-clamped cells, phenylephrine (5 - 20 microM) or methoxamine (5 - 10 microM) reduced the amplitudes of Ca 2 +-independent voltage-activated outward K+ currents (Iout); neither the kinetics nor the voltage-dependent properties of Iout were significantly affected. The effects of phenylephrine or methoxamine on Iout were larger and longer-lasting at higher concentrations and after prolonged or repeated exposures; in all experiments, however, Iout recovered completely when puffer applications were discontinued. The suppression of Iout is attributed to the activation of alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors, as neither beta- nor alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists had measurable effects on Iout; in addition, the effect of phenylephrine was attenuated {{in the presence of}} the alpha antagonist phentolamine (10 microM), but not {{in the presence of the}} <b>beta</b> <b>antagonist</b> propranolol (10 microM).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of cell-membrane expressed TLRs and the signaling molecule MyD 88 in a murine model of OA induced by knee menisectomy (surgical partial removal of the medial meniscus [MNX]). METHODS: OA was induced in 8 - 10 weeks old C 57 Bl/ 6 wild-type (WT) female (n= 7) mice and in knockout (KO) TLR- 1 (n= 7), - 2 (n= 8), - 4 (n= 9) - 6 (n= 5), MyD 88 (n= 8) mice by medial menisectomy, using the sham-operated contralateral knee as a control. Cartilage destruction and synovial inflammation were evaluated by knee joint histology using the OARSI scoring method. Apoptotic chondrocytes and cartilage metabolism (collagen II synthesis and MMP-mediated aggrecan degradation) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Operated knees exhibited OA features at 8 weeks post-surgery compared to sham-operated ones. In menisectomized TLR- 1, - 2, - 4, and - 6 deficient mice, cartilage lesions, synovial inflammation and cartilage metabolism were {{similar to that in}} operated WT mice. Accordingly, using the same approach, we found no significant protection in MyD 88 -deficient mice in terms of OA progression as compared to WT littermates. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of TLRs or their signalling molecule MyD 88 did not impact on the severity of experimental OA. Our results demonstrate that MyD 88 -dependent TLRs are not involved in this murine OA model. Moreover, the dispensable role of MyD 88, which is also an adaptor for IL- 1 receptor signaling, suggests that IL- 1 is not a key mediator in the development of OA.

We show that 1) a variety of <b>beta</b> AR <b>antagonists</b> with ISA, including alprenolol and cyanopindolol, enhance cyclic AMP accumulation in S 49 lymphoma cells if cells are also incubated with the diterpene forskolin; 2) beta AR blockers with ISA stimulate cAMP accumulation {{in the presence of a}} water-soluble analog of forskolin but not in the presence of 9, 11 -dideoxyforskolin (which does not activate adenylyl cyclase); 3) the potentiation by forskolin is not unique to S 49 cells but is also observed in BC 3 H 1 smooth muscle-derived cells; 4) stimulation of cAMP accumulation by beta-blockers with ISA occurs in S 49 cells in three additional settings that do not involve the use of forskolin, after pretreatment with pertussis toxin to inactivate the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein, after pretreatment with [D-Trp 8]-somatostatin to sensitize adenylyl cyclase, and using a radioimmunoassay to quantitate levels of cellular cAMP. We conclude that <b>beta</b> AR <b>antagonists</b> with ISA can weakly stimulate intracellular cAMP accumulation, but this stimulation is not easily detected.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether activation of cardiac beta 2 -adrenoceptors increases contractility in humans and whether this is affected by long-term <b>beta</b> 1 -adrenoceptor <b>antagonist</b> treatment. Background. Coexistence of beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the human heart is generally accepted. The functional importance of cardiac beta 2 -adrenoceptors for increases in contractility in humans, however, has not been completely established. Methods. We studied 1) the beta-adrenoceptor subtype mediating positive inotropic effects of the beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline in vitro (on right atrial and left ventricular preparations from nonfailing human hearts) and increases in contractility (by measurement of systolic time intervals) in vivo in seven healthy male volunteers; and 2) in vivo whether long-term treatment of volunteers with the <b>beta</b> 1 -adrenoceptor <b>antagonist</b> bisoprolol affects terbutaline-induced increases in contractility. Results. In vitro terbutaline caused a concentration-dependent increase in atrial and ventricular adenylate cyclase activity and force of contraction. Terbutaline effects were antagonized only by the <b>beta</b> 2 -adrenoceptor <b>antagonist</b> ICI 118, 551, indicating that they were mediated by beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation. In vivo intravenous infusions of terbutaline (dose range 25 to 300 ng/kg body weight per min for 15 min) dose dependently increased heart rate and shortened the pre-ejection period and heart rate-corrected electromechanical systole (QS 2) time. These effects are mediated predominantly by beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation because they were only marginally affected by the <b>beta</b> 1 -adrenoceptor <b>antagonist</b> bisoprolol (1 × 10 mg orally), either given 2 h before infusion or long term for 3 weeks. Conclusions. Stimulation of cardiac beta 2 -adrenoceptors in humans causes not only in vitro but also in vivo positve inotropic effects.

In fact, selective alpha v <b>beta</b> 3 <b>antagonists</b> offer new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of several human pathologies like osteoporosis, restenosis and diseases involving neovascularization such as rheumatoid arthritis, tumour induced angiogenesis and methastasis. Purpose of this account is to summarize the recent developments in the field of non peptidic alpha v <b>beta</b> 3 <b>antagonist...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{electrostatic potential}} (MEP) of 32 beta-adrenoceptor ligands, mainly antagonists, {{was calculated by}} the STO- 3 G ab initio quantum mechanical method. The MEP of phenylethanolamines (PEAs) features a negative minimum in the meta region (designated M 1) which is topographically equivalent to a minimum (designated M 2) found {{in the vicinity of}} the aromatic ring in all (aryloxy) propanolamines (AOPAs). In these compounds, a second negative zone located beyond the meta position and designated M 3 is found in all <b>beta</b> 1 -selective <b>antagonists</b> and in some nonselective and <b>beta</b> 2 -selective <b>antagonists.</b> The <b>beta</b> 1 -selective <b>antagonists</b> feature in the para position an additional zone which is positive (P 4) in the full antagonists and negative (M 4) in the antagonists displaying intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). The MEP-based pharmacophoric models of PEAs, AOPAs, and oxime ethers show common elements and lead to a proposed general model for beta-adrenoceptor ligands...|$|R
40|$|Bitemporal {{injections}} of puromycin that primarily affect the hippocampal-entorhinal area induce amnesia of aversive maze-learning in mice for 3 days after training but are ineffective 6 {{or more days}} after training. At these later times, additional puromycin sites covering widespread forebrain areas are necessary to induce amnesia, a result that we attribute to the cerebral spread of the engram during the 6 -day period. We have reported that blockade of about 60 % of cerebral beta-adrenergic receptors by a single, subcutaneous injection of (-) -propranolol, a nonselective beta-receptor antagonist, inhibited engram spread for 60 - 90 days, at which time engram spread spontaneously occurred. In the present experiments using single doses of antagonists that appeared to block 60 % of beta 2 - or beta 1 -adrenergic receptors, {{it was found that}} the selective <b>beta</b> 2 <b>antagonist</b> ICI 118, 551 was without effect on engram spread, whereas the selective <b>beta</b> 1 <b>antagonist</b> betaxolol inhibited the spread for at least 3 months. Propranolol's effect consequently appears to be accounted for by its blockade of beta 1 receptors...|$|R
40|$|The beta-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol, {{terbutaline}} and clenbuterol, {{were investigated}} for {{their effect on}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine-mediated (5 -HT) hyperactivity. 2 The lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol (5 mg/kg) enhanced the behaviours induced by quipazine (25 mg/kg), including headweaving, forepaw treading and hind-limb abduction and thus increased automated activity recording. Clenbuterol (5 mg/kg) also enhanced the hyperactivity syndrome produced by the 5 -HT agonist, 5 -methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine (2 mg/kg) and the combination of tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg) and L-tryptophan (50 mg/kg). Salbutamol and terbutaline potentiated quipazine-induced hyperactivity only when given at the higher dose of 20 mg/kg. 3 The effect of clenbuterol in enhancing quipazine hyperactivity was blocked by the centrally acting <b>beta</b> 1 -adrenoceptor <b>antagonist,</b> metoprolol (5 mg/kg), but not by the <b>beta</b> 2 -adrenoceptor <b>antagonist,</b> butoxamine (5 mg/kg) or the peripherally acting <b>beta</b> 1 -adrenoceptor <b>antagonist,</b> atenolol (5 mg/kg). 4 Clenbuterol (5 mg/kg) did not enhance the circling responses produced by methamphetamine (0. 5 mg/kg) in unilateral nigrostriatal-lesioned rats. 5 The results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor agonists in common with some established antidepressant treatments produce enhancement of 5 -HT-mediated behavioural responses...|$|R
