40|$|The fillet of {{the gear}} tooth is highly {{stressed}} in operation; so for heavily loaded gears, the fillet geometry must be controlled. The manufacturer's task is to, within acceptable tolerances, produce the gear to the designer's specifications {{regardless of the}} manufacturing method. Most often gear cutting tools are used that work under generating conditions. The tool will form the gear tooth; so to produce the specified gear geometry and, especially, the fillet geometry, this tool must be conjugated to the same basic rack as the gear to cut. However, this gives a risk that the tooth tip of the tool will be undercut, and if this occurs the tool will not cut the intended gear fillet. In this report, novel analytical equations are derived, which predict the limit when the tool tip will be undercut. It is shown that if the gear tooth should be conjugated to the standard basic rack with a circular fillet, which is the normal case, very large tool-tooth numbers are needed for pinion shaper cutters and gear skiving cutters to avoid this type of undercut. However, the minimum tooth number to achieve a smooth continuous tool-tooth profile is reduced by modifications to the fillet of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> <b>profile...</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the influence of design features of the flexspline in a harmonic drive, such as the relative radial deformation, the relative coating thickness and the design features of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth <b>profile,</b> on stress values in the bottom lands of a toothed ring. Design/methodology/approach: In numerical calculations, the software developed at the Faculty of Transport of the Silesian University of Technology was used. The program automatically generates a profile of the flexspline and a boundary elements mesh {{on the grounds of the}} flexspline and working tool assigned parameters. In the analysis of the state of stress, the boundary element method (BEM) was applied. Findings: A decreased value of the curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth <b>profile</b> results in a change in the width of the tooth bottom land, shortening of the transition curve in the tooth base and a reduction of the tooth thickness at its base, which in turn leads to increased values of stress. Yet, the influence of the relative curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth <b>profile</b> on the stress value is insignificant. The increase of the torque and relative coating thickness for different value of the curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> tooth <b>profile</b> cause an increase of stress in the bottom lands of the toothed ring. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents strength calculations for the teeth in toothed ring of a flexspline of a double harmonic drive by means of boundary elements method (BEM). The results of numerical calculations correspond in terms of their quality to the results presented in the literature, which were calculated by finite element method (FEM).

40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted gear drives, the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the gear}} drives can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur gear drives with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the gear drive can be achieved by changing the tooth thickness of <b>basic</b> <b>racks</b> on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given spur gear drive that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R
40|$|After an {{extensive}} {{research on the}} fundamental theory, the theoretical basis for the Logix gearing will be presented in this paper. This includes the theory for gear meshing with high degree of contact. In comparison to previous studies, the theory {{of this paper is}} more restricted going beyond third order parameters into the fourth order, the teeth profile had one order of contact higher than that of the Logix gearing. So that further improved the contact strength of tooth profile. A large category of gearings with high order of contact was presented, while the Logix gear is only one of them, or the special example in realization of my theory. In the Logix gearing, the zigzag curvature center curve of media rack does not always lay about the pitch line and does not extend along the pitch line continuously and steadily. It goes forward and returns. So that, in terms of properties of the transverse engagement, the Logix gearing has not much improvement over the traditional Novikov gearing (in which the transverse engagement is temporally). In my gearing the curvature center of <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> extend along the pitch line continuously and steadily. The transverse engagement factor is larger than that of Logix gearing...|$|R

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis has been developed to predict and measure the cutting forces in the gear hobbing process. A review of past {{research in this area}} has highlighted the need to adopt a different approach to modelling the process in order to predict the cutting forces. The hobbing process has been described using six different co-ordinate systems and the kinematic relationships between these systems established. A single <b>rack</b> <b>profile</b> has been used to represent the profile of a single cutting tooth from the hob which was then extended to simulate the hob itself. When the hob gashes pass through the cutting region surfaces are generated which, if mapped on a regular grid can give the basis to estimate the depth of cut, i. e. the instantaneous chip thickness produced by that particular tooth. The instantaneous cutting forces generated by that tooth then can be estimated by using the concept of a specific cutting force of the workpiece material. The estimation of cutting forces acting on a single tooth space was used to predict the cutting forces produced during machining of a full gear, by assuming that the forces acting in a particular tooth space are equal to those acting on the adjacent tooth space at an equivalent instant in the cutting cycle. In order to validate predicted results, a Churchill PH 1612 hobbing machine was retrofitted with a CNC control system at Newcastle University, utilising a programmable multi axis controller (PMAC). A specially made single toothed gear, and a full gear were machined, and cut on this machine, and the cutting forces measured in real time using a 3 -axis dynamometer. The force signals produced by the dynamometer were measured utilising a 12 -bit ADC card. Code, written in C, was developed to perform the many functions needed for the overall control of the machine, but additionally was used to capture both the cutting forces and axis position data. The results of the simulation and modelling have shown very good agreement with those obtained experimentally. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This Work Presents The Possibilities Of Percentage Of Reduction In The Root Fillet Stress Of Spur Gear By Introducing Circular Stress Relieving Feature Of Various Sizes At Different Locations. Two Categories Of Systematic Analyses Are Carried Out Using Finite Element Model Of Spur Gear. In The First Category Of Analyses Emphasize Is Given To Determine The Maximum Root Fillet Stress Which Is Required As Reference To Determine The Stress Reduction Factor. In Addition To This, The Effect Of Number Of Teeth, Pressure Angle, And <b>Basic</b> Parameters Of <b>Rack</b> Cutter On Root Fillet Stress Is Investigated. In Second Category Which Is The Prime Focus Of This Work; The Effect Of Introducing Geometric Stress Relief Feature Is Carried Out. Circular Stress Relief Feature Of Different Size At Strategic Locations On A Spur Gear Tooth Are Introduced. This Reduces The Root Fillet Stress. The Magnitude Of The Load Shared By A Gear Tooth Depends On The Position Of The Point Of Contact Of Teeth Engagement Along The Line Of Action. It Also Depends On Contact Ratio. High Contact Ratio Gear Teeth Pairs Are Subjected Low Load In Comparison Low Contact Ratio Gear For Transmitting Same Amount Of Torque. A Tooth Is Released From The Load As Soon As It Disengages With The Mating Gear Tooth And It Is Taken By The Next Conjugate Tooth. Therefore The Gear Teeth Are Subjected Varying (Fatigue) Load. If A Gear Fails By Bending Fatigue, The Failure Is Catastrophic And Occurs With Little Or No Warnings. The Maximum Root Fillet Tensile Stress Is One Of The Key Factors Which Determine The Fatigue Life Of The Gear. Therefore The Magnitude Of The Maximum Value Of The Root Fillet Tensile Stress Can Be Treated As The Index Of Fatigue Life Of Gear. Even Slight Reduction In Root Fillet Stress Leads To A Large Increase In Fatigue Life Of The Gears Designed For The Stress Level Above Endurance Limit. This Type Of Design Consideration Is Very Common, Where Safety And Light Weight Are The Principal Design Criteria. Therefore For All The Reasons Cited Above, This Work Is Of More Practical Importance. The Program Is Coded In ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL). It Automates The Task Of Creation Of Model, Meshing, Applying Boundary Conditions, Choosing The Appropriate Density Of The Mesh Depending On The Stress Gradient.
