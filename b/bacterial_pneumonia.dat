5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, {{if a child}} (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be getting}} better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial infection that causes <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the bacterial species that causes strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It can also cause other infections.|$|E
5|$|Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the lung tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. One major cause of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is tuberculosis. Chronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus {{that can lead to}} an aspergilloma forming in the lung.|$|E

5|$|In fast-progressing cases, {{mortality}} {{was primarily}} from pneumonia, by virus-induced pulmonary consolidation. Slower-progressing cases featured secondary <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias,</b> {{and there may}} have been neural involvement that led to mental disorders in some cases. Some deaths resulted from malnourishment.|$|R
40|$|Lower {{respiratory}} infections (LRIs) {{are estimated}} to cause approximately 4 million deaths each year, the majority in previously healthy young children from low-income countries. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias</b> are likely {{to account for the}} major proportion of deaths but because accurate diagnosis is difficult, their precise contribution is difficult to estimate. Effective protection against two of the most important pathogens (H. influenzae type B and S. pneumoniae) is now available even for young infants. The high cost of these interventions is however likely to prohibit their use in areas likely to benefit most. Case management which can be effective at reducing mortality and which is relatively cheap at present is likely therefore to remain the principal means of tackling <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias</b> globally. Antibiotic resistance to cheap drugs and possibly HIV infection pose a potentially enormous threat to this strategy with the prospect of an increasing global death toll with an even more inequitable distribution of disease as we begin the new century...|$|R
5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia</b> can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E
50|$|Stomatococcus {{mucilaginous}} {{has been}} linked to Bronchiectasis, showing that an inhibition of the COX-2 inhibitor is largely related to an increased production of PGE2, which {{has been shown to be}} immunosuppressive in animal models of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias</b> and sepsis. The inhibition of COX-2 improved survival in mice, suggesting that the pathogenic effects of S. mucilaginous are related to the induction of COX-2 It is also closely associated with Bacteremia, sepsis, and endocarditis.|$|R
40|$|With an {{objective}} of improving diagnostic value of sputum in <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias,</b> 50 uncomplicated &#x 2032;community&#x 2032; acquired cases were studied using Gram staining of sputum along with bedside inoculation with/without dilution of the specimen. Gram staining of sputum samples collected before treatment revealed pneumococcal infection in 46 &#x 0025; cases. The results were however inconclusive on samples sent by routine procedure involving logistic delay. Cultural analysis of sputum processed by three different techniques showed that bedside inoculation of sputum after dilution {{to be the}} most efficient technique yielding Streptococcus pneumoniae in 34 &#x 0025; cases, Gram positive cocci in lesser number (20 &#x 0025;), Gram negative rods (GNR) in 18 &#x 0025; cases. Sputum samples processed bedside without dilution yielded a lower number of pneumococci and other Gram positive cocci (24 &#x 0025; &#x 0026; 16 &#x 0025; cases respectively). Routine processing of sputum, involving logistic delay yielded a high number of Gram negative rods (62 &#x 0025;), indicating their overgrowth. Thus bedside inoculation of sputum after dilution coupled with direct Gram staining serves as a simple and yet valuable laboratory aid in the diagnosis of uncomplicated &#x 2032;community&#x 2032; acquired <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a {{diagnostic}} procedure by which cells and other components from bronchial and alveolar spaces are obtained for various studies. One {{of the main}} advantages of BAL {{is that it can}} be done as a day care procedure. Material obtained by BAL can give a definite diagnosis in conditions such as infections and malignancies. Aims: The aims and objective of this study were to assess the utility of BAL as {{a diagnostic}} tool to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the material obtained from BAL in various infections and neoplastic lesions to study the limitations of BAL in certain lung disorders. Materials and Methods: This study was done in a tertiary care center in Hyderabad. Bronchoscopy was done as an outpatient procedure and lavage fluid obtained analyzed. This is a prospective study done from January 2012 to Jun 2013. Ninety-one BALs were analyzed for total and differential count, microbiological examination and cytological evaluation. Cases selected included nonresolving pneumonias, diffuse lung infiltrates, infiltrates in immunosuppressed hosts and ventilator-associated pneumonias. Results: Bronchoalveolar lavage was done in 91 cases over a period of 1 ½ years. Definite diagnosis was not given in 7 cases. Four cases were inadequate. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 22 cases, fungal infections in 7 cases. Thirty-eight cases of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias</b> were diagnosed, Klebsiella was the most common organism. Malignancy was diagnosed in 13 cases. Conclusion: Definite diagnosis can be made in tuberculosis, fungal infections, <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias</b> and in malignancies...|$|R
25|$|As swine {{influenza}} is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required. Instead, veterinary efforts {{are focused on}} preventing {{the spread of the}} virus throughout the farm, or to other farms.

25|$|Complications with measles are {{relatively}} common, ranging from mild complications such as diarrhea to serious complications such as pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia),</b> bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), otitis media, acute brain inflammation (and very rarely SSPE—subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), and corneal ulceration (leading to corneal scarring). Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus. The death {{rate in the}} 1920s was around 30% for measles pneumonia.

40|$|We are {{currently}} {{in the midst of}} the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic, and a second wave of flu in the fall and winter could lead to more hospitalizations for pneumonia. Recent pathologic and historic data from the 1918 influenza pandemic confirms that many, if not most, of the deaths in that pandemic were a result of secondary <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias.</b> This means that a second wave of 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic influenza could result in a widespread shortage of antibiotics, making these medications a scarce resource. Recently, our University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Scarce Resource Allocation Committee (SRAC) added antibiotics to a list of resources (including ventilators, antivirals, vaccines) that might become scarce during an influenza pandemic. In this article, we summarize the data on <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias</b> during the 1918 influenza pandemic, discuss the possible impact of a pandemic on the University of Michigan Health System, and summarize our committee’s guiding principles for allocating antibiotics during a pandemic. The current influenza pandemic began with thesimultaneous emergence of a new strain of H 1 N 1 influenza in Mexico and in the U.

25|$|In adults, {{the disease}} is more severe, though the {{incidence}} is much less common. Infection in adults is associated with greater morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia),</b> bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), hepatitis, and encephalitis. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with chickenpox develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to chickenpox are in adults. Inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis, can occur in immunocompromised individuals, although the risk is higher with herpes zoster. Necrotizing fasciitis is also a rare complication.|$|E
25|$|Typically, a virus {{enters the}} lungs through the {{inhalation}} of water droplets and invades the cells lining the airways and the alveoli. This leads to cell death; the cells {{are killed by}} the virus or they self-destruct. Further lung damage occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. White blood cells, particularly lymphocytes, activate chemicals known as cytokines which cause fluid to leak into the alveoli. The combination of cell destruction and fluid-filled alveoli interrupts the transportation of oxygen into the bloodstream. In addition to their effects on the lungs, many viruses affect other organs. Viral infections weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to bacterial infection (including <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia).</b>|$|E
500|$|This huge {{death toll}} {{was caused by}} an {{extremely}} high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected {{to be caused by}} cytokine storms. Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, [...] "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred". The majority of deaths were from <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> a common secondary infection associated with influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, by causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Four infants in whom {{excessive}} secretion of {{antidiuretic hormone}} {{was associated with}} pulmonary infections are reported. Severe hyponatraemia was noted in 3 of them; in the fourth, fluid restriction may have prevented this complication. In several reports associations have been noted between the excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and disorders encountered in the neonatal period and in later childhood. Those in which pulmonary disorders have been implicated include viral and <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias,</b> 1 - 5 pneumo-thorax and atelectasis, 6 acute asthmatic attacks, 7 8 and lung distension during continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) administration and mechanical ventilation 9 (although some of the neonates in the last-mentioned series also had intra-cranial disease) ...|$|R
50|$|Pleural empyema is a {{collection}} of pus in the pleural cavity caused by microorganisms, usually bacteria. Often it happens {{in the context of a}} pneumonia, injury, or chest surgery. It is one of various kinds of pleural effusion. There are three stages: exudative, when there is an increase in pleural fluid with or without the presence of pus; fibrinopurulent, when fibrous septa form localized pus pockets; and the final organizing stage, when there is scarring of the pleura membranes with possible inability of the lung to expand. Simple pleural effusions occur in up to 40% of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias.</b> They are usually small and resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy. If however an empyema develops additional intervention is required.|$|R
30|$|Our {{experimental}} model {{demonstrated that}} intrapulmonary administration of SPA caused lung injury consistent with injury characteristic of ARDS of pulmonary origin, possibly due to direct alveolar epithelial injury. Both viral and <b>bacterial</b> <b>pneumonias</b> cause alveolar injury {{in part through}} apoptosis and necrosis of alveolar types I and II cells [38, 39]. SPA-induced ARDS may therefore represent a useful experimental model of these clinical causes of ARDS. SPA causes interstitial edema, intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, and a neutrophilic alveolitis, rather than the microvascular congestion and less severe alveolar damage characteristic of extrapulmonary causes of ARDS. It is, therefore, reasonable to compare experimental ARDS induced by SPA with other models that cause a primarily alveolar injury, such as saline lavage, injurious mechanical ventilation, hyperoxia, or acid aspiration.|$|R
