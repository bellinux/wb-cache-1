25|$|Kolata {{suggests}} that, {{like the}} later Inca, {{the inhabitants of}} Tiwanaku may have practiced similar rituals and rites {{in relation to the}} dead. The Akapana East Building has evidence of ancestor burial. The human remains at Akapana East seem to be less for show and more for proper burial. The skeletons show many cut marks that were most likely made by defleshing or excarnation after death. The remains were then <b>bundled</b> <b>up</b> and buried rather than left out in the open.|$|E
25|$|When {{the forces}} of Maramba from the east and Prado from the west converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898, the siege began. The arrival of General Makabulos {{strengthened}} the rebel forces until the Spaniards, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later. Armed poorly, the Filipinos were no match at the very start with Spanish soldiers holed inside the Church. They just became mere sitting ducks to Spanish soldiers shooting with their rifles from a distance. But the tempo of battle changed when the attackers, under Don Vicente Prado, devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing. This happened when they rolled trunks of bananas, <b>bundled</b> <b>up</b> in sawali, that enabled them to inch {{their way to the}} Church.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} storyboard, the Lich's lair was not {{specifically designed to}} be a subway. This was added later by the background designers. The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be [...] "specific undead from [...] ". However, Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino, a character designer for the series, with stylizing the corpses. Ristaino designed them to resemble [...] "east coast commuters [...] <b>bundled</b> <b>up</b> for winter." [...] He strove to make them look like people you might see on a subway, such as a bike messenger, a couple, man in a [...] "goofy hat", and a man wearing a suit. Originally, when the Lich set off his bomb, the storyboard featured a simple mushroom cloud. Ian Jones-Quartey, one of the series' storyboard revisionists, however, added a face to the blast. Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke. The series' staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card.|$|E
500|$|Many of Potter's tales {{appealed to}} girls, but Mr. Tod {{had a strong}} {{following}} among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight {{at the end of}} the book accompanied by [...] "dreadful bad language". Six-year-old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:I am sorry to tell you they are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight [...] Mr. Tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of his brush [...] and five bad bites, especially one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock [...] he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet <b>bundled</b> <b>up</b> in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock ate them. He is a nasty person. He will go on living in Mr. Tod's comfortable house till springtime [...] then he will move off into the woods & live out doors [...] and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously [...] & there will need to be a big spring cleaning!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} protect Cheesequake State Park and lessen the {{interference}} of private industrial land, the state chose the preferred alignment. [...] This alignment would end up seizing 19 residential homes and 19 commercial businesses to build the new freeway. Along with the right-of-way exception and construction costs, the estimated cost for building the Route74 Freeway would be about $64.7 million (1970 USD). Although the freeway in plans were supposed to cross the Garden State Parkway around milepost 119, there were no set plans for an interchange between the two highways. [...] However, the studies from Parsons Brinckerhoff did put forth {{that this could be}} possible in the future. Also, the new freeway did not serve access to the New Jersey Turnpike, the route was to begin just a mile south of Route 18's interchange. <b>Bundled</b> <b>up</b> with Route74 were two other expressways, {{the construction of a new}} expressway on U.S. Route 9 itself, and a spur route off of Route74 further east. The connecting freeway were later added to the state legislation in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|However, Allen Rosenshine, a {{copywriter}} {{who went}} on to lead BBDO, called the show a [...] "total fabrication", saying that [...] "if anybody talked to women the way these goons do, they’d have been out on their ass". George Lois, who worked at Doyle Dane Bernbach for a year, before starting his own ad agency in 1960, said [...] "Mad Men is nothing more than the fulfilment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s <b>bundled</b> <b>up</b> nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters... is glamorous and vintage....nlike the TV 'Mad Men,' we worked full, exhausting, joyous days: pitching new business, creating ideas, [...] "comping" [...] them up, storyboarding them, selling them, photographing them, and directing commercials. And our only 'extracurricular activity' was chasing fly balls and dunking basketballs on our agency softball and basketball teams!" [...] Andrew Cracknell, author of The Real Mad Men: The Renegades of Madison Avenue and the Golden Age of Advertising, also thought the show lacked authenticity, stating, [...] "One thing of which they all are all equally contemptuous", in regards to the industry's elite, [...] "is the output of Sterling Cooper. But then they have every right. None of them would ever have wanted to work for Draper and none of his departments would have got a job at any of their agencies. Particularly Draper himself.
