50|$|Savanna and the Sahel {{habitats}} are of two types. One is {{the southern}} Guinea savanna which has rich and dense vegetation of over 50 tree species. The {{other is the}} Sudan Savanna which is contiguous to the Guinea savanna on the north bank of the Gambia River. These areas are dry woodlands with soils of laterite formations. The local tree species include silk <b>cotton</b> (<b>Bombax</b> costatum), dry-zone mahogany (Khaya Senagalensis) in deeper soil areas and African rosewood (Guibourtia coleosperma). Short grasses and shrubs are seen thinly spread in the Sahelian habitats.|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{energy at}} a {{frequency}} of 2450 MHz {{was used to}} irradiate <b>Bombax</b> ceiba <b>cotton</b> (kopak fi bers) samples for different intervals of time. These samples were stud- ied using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method which gives information about {{the structure of the}} fi ber on a scale of about 700 Å. Using this method, variation in scattered intensity with angles from 0. 3 ° to 2. 5 ° has been measured for the fi bers of cotton with and without microwave irradiation and compared with that predicted by the linear paracrystalline model. In these samples, exponential distribution of phase lengths of the measured and predicted scattering is in good agreement with each other except for a very small range of angles on the low-angle side of the peak intensity. The method enabled quantitative parameters describing morphology of the two phases, amorphous and crystalline, consistent with the SAXS intensity distribution. For a given type of distribution function, fi ve parameters describing the model were chosen on a stepping procedure so that the fi nal parameters give the best fi t between the calculated distribution from the model and that observed experimentally. This was done by minimizing the statistical goodness-of- fi t parameter chi-square. It is observed that there are signi fi cant changes in the distribution of phase lengths due to microwave irradiation of fi ber...|$|R
40|$|As carrion feeders {{vultures}} play {{an important}} ecological role.   Counts and qualitative assessments were done over three seasons to assess the richness and abundance of vultures in Uttar Pradesh during 2010 – 11.   Of nine species found in India, Uttar Pradesh has six: Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus (45. 9 %), Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris (25. 4 %), Indian Vulture (Long-billed Vulture) Gyps indicus (16. 8 %), White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis (10. 3 %), Red-headed Vulture (King Vulture) Sarcogyps calvus (0. 8 %) and Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis (0. 7 %).   We observed a total of 1993 adults and 91 juveniles, with the Tarai region having the greatest species richness and abundance.   Nesting tree species included Silk <b>Cotton</b> <b>Bombax</b> ceiba, Teak Tectona grandis, Haldu Haldina cordifolia and Sissoo Dalbergia sissoo.   A qualitative assessment indicated that the vulture population had declined in the past 10 – 15 years, with the main causes being the use of diclofenac, shortage of food and habitat loss.   Disposal of dead animals was mainly done by removing carcasses to village outskirts, where dogs, crows and egrets compete with vultures.   Such {{a small number of}} avian scavengers in a large area like Uttar Pradesh should be protected by ensuring safe and sufficient food, recovery from accidents and rehabilitation, and a protected environment. </p...|$|R
