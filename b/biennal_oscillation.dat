40|$|The Quasi <b>Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation,</b> the {{downward}} propagating easterly and westerly wind {{regimes in the}} equatorial stratosphere, has been investigated according to robust statistics providing {{the reliability of the}} examined harmonics. The amplitude-to-noise ratio is found to be highest in correspondence of the 28 - month harmonic for each examined height; the relative amplitude and phase values are found, respectively, to decrease and increase with the height and to take about a year to descend from 15 to 70 hPa with a progressive lag of about 1 month/km. At the top of the stratosphere, easterlies dominate, while at the bottom, westerlies {{are more likely to be}} found...|$|E
