5|$|A {{study of}} three {{different}} European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged. Adult survival rate varied from 83 to 92%, with no significant difference detected <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> Survival of first-year birds was, at 77%, {{lower than that of}} adults.

5|$|They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being {{consistently}} {{smaller than}} males. The size difference <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> is proportionally {{greater in the}} larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females, enabling gender to be told from tracks.|$|E
5|$|No {{discernible}} {{variation in}} size or appearance in green and golden bell frogs between different geographic areas is found. Fluctuations {{in size and}} appearance between different populations are outweighed by variations within the populations themselves. Females {{are more likely to}} be found away from breeding sites, while the opposite applies for males. Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E

5|$|Sexual dichromatism (different {{coloration}} patterns <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females)</b> {{can be seen}} in most {{brown lemur}} species, but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes. This lack of sexual dimorphism is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines. Some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic, with males bearing a larger sagittal crest (a ridge of bone {{on the top of the}} skull to which jaw muscles attach) and canine teeth. Lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism, but males are typically no more than 20percent larger than females.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> or between {{a mother and}} kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that}} of the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% {{of the day}} feeding, 53% resting, and 19% traveling, {{although}} {{differences in}} resting and feeding durations have been observed <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> with females resting less and feeding more. They are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, resting usually occurs around midday. When resting, ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying prone over a branch or sunbathing in a supine position with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of suspensory behavior, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} social {{differences}} <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females {{both within and}} outside their core areas, but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with only a couple of conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.|$|E
5|$|Phenotypic traits can be {{displayed}} in one sex and desired {{in the other}} sex, causing a positive feedback loop called a Fisherian runaway, for example, the extravagant plumage of some male birds such as the peacock. An alternate theory proposed by the same Ronald Fisher in 1930 is the sexy son hypothesis, that mothers want promiscuous sons to give them large numbers of grandchildren and so choose promiscuous fathers for their children. Aggression between {{members of the same}} sex is sometimes associated with very distinctive features, such as the antlers of stags, which are used in combat with other stags. More generally, intrasexual selection is often associated with sexual dimorphism, including differences in body size <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> of a species.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the differences among selected factors that have influenced the appointment of <b>female</b> <b>and</b> selected <b>male</b> superintendents in Georgia. Participants were all sixteen superintendents (100 percent of the <b>female</b> population) <b>and</b> sixteen selected <b>male</b> superintendents. Techniques for matching the population included controlling for the following: number of students served by the district, number of schools in the district, being appointed or elected to the superintendency, school board selection process, number of school board members, and geographical location. A thirty-three item survey, developed by the researcher, was used to collect the data for the study. The statistical procedure used was the t test, and the level of significance was preestablished at. 05 The major findings of the study were: (1) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> superintendents regarding the number of birth or adopted children which they have, (2) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> superintendents regarding the age at which their first administrative position was received, (3) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> superintendents regarding the number of years served in their present position, (4) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> superintendents regarding the age at which they received the rank of superintendent, (5) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> superintendents regarding the number of years which they served as principals, (6) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> superintendents regarding the level of their central office experience, and (7) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> superintendents regarding the number of years served as central office administrator prior to their superintendenc...|$|R
5|$|The vulture is {{minimally}} sexually dimorphic, with {{no difference}} in plumage and little in size <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> The juvenile vulture has a dark bill and eyes, and a downy, gray neck that soon begins to turn the orange of an adult. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around {{five or six years}} of age. Jack Eitniear of the Center for the Study of Tropical Birds in San Antonio, Texas reviewed the plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were the first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards, followed by wing feathers, until the full adult plumage was achieved. The final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in the otherwise white lesser wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of antbirds is {{soft and}} not brightly coloured, {{although}} it is occasionally striking. The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism – differences in plumage colour and pattern <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> – is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male dot-winged antwren is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts. In some genera, such as Myrmotherula, species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male. Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in bluish-slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white patch is on the shoulder.|$|E
