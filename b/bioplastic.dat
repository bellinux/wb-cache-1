Because such material could be easily detected, fibers from the shroud were examined at the National Science Foundation Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence at the University of Nebraska. Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry examination failed to detect any form of <b>bioplastic</b> polymer on fibers from either non-image or image areas of the shroud. Additionally, laser-microprobe Raman analysis at Instruments SA, Inc. in Metuchen, New Jersey, also failed to detect any <b>bioplastic</b> polymer on shroud fibers.|$|E
40|$|Wheat starch-gluten mixture was {{converted}} into a <b>bioplastics</b> like material (<b>bioplastics)</b> under processing at an elevated temperature. The density of the <b>bioplastics</b> was 1. 24 - 1. 26 g/cm^ 3 depending on the ratio of starch to gluten. The color difference of the <b>bioplastics</b> was altered with the starch-gluten ratio. Endothermic peak by differential scanning calorimetry was considerably decreased {{with the increase of}} the ratio of gluten to starch. It was revealed that the physical characteristics of the <b>bioplastics</b> were dependent on the starch-gluten ratio and that wheat starch and gluten interacts at their interface with the increase of the glass-transition temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{this work}} was to obtain <b>bioplastics</b> from mixtures of wheat gluten and glycerol by two different processes and evaluate their respective rheological properties. The mixtures and their respective <b>bioplastics</b> were obtained through direct batch mixing under approximately adiabatic and isothermal conditions. The <b>bioplastics</b> showed high values for the storage (G') and loss (G") moduli, suggesting a stronger protein network formed in both processes.

40|$|Increase in {{consumption}} of conventional plastics lead to environmental problems. Therefore, some efforts {{are needed to}} overcome it, one of them by using <b>bioplastics.</b> However, in Indonesia, companies engaged in <b>bioplastics</b> sector are still rarely found. Without the readiness of the <b>bioplastics</b> industry in Indonesia, development of <b>bioplastics</b> which ends to solve environmental problems cannot be realized.

In other words, <b>bioplastics</b> in Indonesia has not yet experiencing a transition to replace conventional plastics. Precisely, technology in regime level experiencing change by developing additive plastic. However, there are several things that hinder further development of the niche, which include the high price of <b>bioplastics</b> and implementation of regulations related with incentives and disincentives and there is no coordination and shared vision between actor in niche level...|$|R
25|$|However, <b>bioplastic</b> {{development}} begins from a {{very low}} base and, as yet, does not compare significantly with petrochemical production.

40|$|It {{is almost}} {{impossible}} to remember a world without plastics; however, environmental concerns over the origin, use and disposal of plastics have created a substantial effort into finding alternative solutions to these issues. Recycling is aimed at reducing the amount of virgin material required; biodegradable polymers are intended to solve the disposal and ultimate fate of polymers, while research into finding sustainable sources for polymer production is aimed at reducing the reliance on petrochemical sources. Although <b>bioplastics</b> sound like the perfect solution to these problems, <b>bioplastics</b> sound like the perfect solution to these problems, <b>bioplastics</b> also have some drawbacks; most importantly the perceived competition with food production. As a result, attention is shifting to second generation <b>bioplastics</b> manufactured from non-potential food sources. However, one of the challenges for <b>bioplastics</b> is to be successfully integrated into common synthetic plastic processing routes, such as extrusion and injection moulding...|$|R

50|$|Petroleum {{is often}} still {{used as a}} source of {{materials}} and energy in the production of <b>bioplastic.</b> Petroleum is required to power farm machinery, to irrigate crops, to produce fertilisers and pesticides, to transport crops and crop products to processing plants, to process raw materials, and ultimately to produce the <b>bioplastic.</b> However, it is possible to produce <b>bioplastic</b> using renewable energy sources and avoid the use of petroleum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bioplastic</b> - polymer {{structures}} {{based on}} processed biological materials rather than petrochemicals.

50|$|Genetic {{modification}} (GM) is also {{a challenge}} for the <b>bioplastics</b> industry. None of the currently available <b>bioplastics</b> - which can be considered first generation products - {{require the use of}} GM crops, although GM corn is the standard feedstock.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution {{the rise of the}} global economy depends on using more amounts of fossil fuels. Currently oil is the leading feedstock for the production of various kinds of plastic products, from packaging materials to machine parts. However, even this advanced technology, such as plastic, awarded several Nobel prizes, has its drawbacks. The big disadvantage is their very slow degradation (tens to thousands of years), thereby the accumulation of waste is increasing. Another disadvantage is its production from non-renewable materials (oil). Therefore, the developed economies, including the European Union (EU), are trying to find new alternatives to conventional plastics using biotechnology manufacturers to called <b>bioplastics,</b> which are made from renewable materials. This thesis deals with the use of <b>bioplastics</b> in the market. Using the questionnaires is creating survey of market among producers of <b>bioplastics</b> and consumers, combined with a personal interview with the promoters of <b>bioplastics.</b> Results processed by this methodology showed that the biggest factor, which influence the promotion of <b>bioplastics,</b> is too high price. This is the main reason why the public is so little informed about them. If the price of production decreases, promotion and use of <b>bioplastics</b> will be probably to increase...|$|R
40|$|Plastics {{have been}} widely used in our daily life due to their {{relatively}} low cost and practical uses. However, plastics are hardly degraded and thus creating lots of environmental problems. <b>Bioplastics</b> have been developed in order to replace the conventional plastics since they are easily degraded and environmentally friendly. In this research, chitosan-banana starch <b>bioplastics</b> were made with the ratio of 70 : 30 in the presence of 30 % glycerol as the plasticizer. ZnO with varying concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 % were added into the biopolymer mixtures before casting in order to improve their mechanical properties. It turned out that 3 % ZnO significantly increased the <b>bioplastics</b> tensile strength up to ~ 36 MPa. Vice versa, elongation and swelling percentage were decreased as ZnO concentrations increased. <b>Bioplastics</b> prepared with 3 % ZnO were degraded within relatively short time in 90 min. These chitosan-banana starch <b>bioplastics</b> reinforced by ZnO seems quite promising to substitute some commercial conventional plastics...|$|R

5000|$|Thermoplastic starch {{currently}} {{represents the}} most widely used <b>bioplastic,</b> constituting about 50 percent of the bioplastics market. Simple starch <b>bioplastic</b> can be made at home. [...] Pure starch is able to absorb humidity, and is thus a suitable material for the production of drug capsules by the pharmaceutical sector. Flexibiliser and plasticiser such as sorbitol and glycerine can also be added so the starch can also be processed thermo-plastically. The characteristics of the resulting <b>bioplastic</b> (also called [...] "thermo-plastical starch") can be tailored to specific needs by adjusting the amounts of these additives.|$|E

Thermomechanical relaxation of cottonseed protein <b>bioplastics</b> associated with protein denaturation, moisture absorption and broad glass transitions (Tg) were observed from DSC and DMA measurements. It was shown that variation of the aldehyde influences the storage modulus at very low temperature (below Tg). From measurements of the water fusion point, enthalpy, vaporisation, and weight loss, three water states in the water-absorbed <b>bioplastics</b> are suggested; namely strongly-bound-to-polymer, weakly-bound-to-polymer and bulk-like water. The water content and unreacted cross-linking agents are influential factors in controlling formation of the different water states, whilst the selection of different aldehydes {{was found to be}} negligible.
