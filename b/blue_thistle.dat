6000|$|After a cool, {{pleasant}} {{night we}} set out at 6.30 a.m. (February 21st), across the broad Sayl, towards a bay in the mountains bearing north-north-west, {{the mouth of the}} Wady Zennárah. Entering the block, we made two short cuts to save great bends in the bed. The first was the Sha'b el-Liwéwi', the Weiwî of Wallin (p. 304)--wild riding enough; the path often winding almost due east, when the general direction was north-north-east. We saw, for the first time, pure greenish-yellow chlorite outcropping from the granite. The animals were apparently hibernating, and plants were rare; we remarked chiefly the sorrel and the <b>blue</b> <b>thistle,</b> or rather wild artichoke, the Shauk el-Jemel, a thorn loved by camels (Blepharis edulis), which recalled to mind the highlands of Syria. The second short-cut, the Wady el-Ga'agah, alias Sawáwín, was the worse of the two: the deep drops and narrow gutters in the quartz-veined granite induced even the Shaykhs to dismount before attacking the descents. This is rarely done when ascending, for their beasts climb like Iceland ponies. One of M. Lacaze's most effective croquis is that showing monture and man disappearing in the black depths of a crevice. Some of the hill-crests were weathered with forms resembling the artificial. At the mid-day halting-ground we saw a stone-mother nursing a rock-child, which might still be utilized in lands where [...] "thaumaturgy" [...] is not yet obsolete.|$|E
40|$|Eryngium articulatum is a fibrous-rooted {{perennial}} from a short simple crown, 12 to 40 in. (30 - 100 cm) tall, with spreading flower stalks above, {{and covered}} with a bluish waxy coating. The basal petioles are elongate, hollow, and swollen, and often lack leaf blades. The petioles of the stem leaves get progressively shorter towards the top of the plant until they are lacking. The stem leaves are mostly to 1 - 1 / 8 in. (1 - 3 cm) wide, commonly more or less elliptic, and toothed with small spines or remotely fringed with spines. The flower heads are mostly in. (1 - 1. 5 cm) wide, with bluish tinged bracts and calyx lobes, and blue corollas. The calyx lobes are 1 / 8 in. (3 - 5 mm) long, and taper to a sharp point that rolls inward. The fruit is ovoid 1 / 16 in. (2 - 3 mm) long, densely covered with scales (that are minutely textured with a network of small cavities on the surface), and abruptly tipped by a slender point. Identification Tips: Eryngium articulatum is the only Eryngium species in the Pacific NW that bears a blue inflorescence. E. articulatum is a conspicuous plant, appearing like a <b>blue</b> <b>thistle</b> (due to the bluish waxy coating and the many spines) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} thistle stalks, as an {{inexpensive}} sorbent {{for the removal}} of methylene blue (basic dye) from synthetic aqueous solutions, has been studied in batch conditions. The influence of some parameters such as: contact time, initial dye concentration, sorbent dose and agitation speed on dye sorption kinetics, has been studied. Dye uptake was time contact, initial dye concentration, sorbent dose and agitation speed dependent. The main parameters that play an important part in removal phenomenon were initial cadmium concentration and sorbent mass. Agitation speed showed a restricted effect on the dye removal kinetics. Two simplified kinetic models including a first-order and a pseudo second-order rate equation were selected to describe the dye sorption kinetics. Methylene blue sorption process followed a pseudo second – order rate kinetics. A multiple-stage diffusion of methylene <b>blue</b> onto <b>thistle</b> stalks particles was observed indicating that intraparticle diffusion was not a fully operative mechanism for this system and reflects some degree of boundary layer control. From these first results obtained under the investigated experimental conditions, the thistle stalks tested were shown to be promising sorbent material for removal/sorption of methylene blue from synthetic aqueous solution...|$|R
