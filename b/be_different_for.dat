He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

25|$|The {{orientation}} {{of an object}} (i.e. the alignment of its axes with the observer's axes) may <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> different observers.

25|$|Although PAHs {{clearly are}} {{aromatic}} compounds, {{the degree of}} aromaticity can <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> each ring segment. According to Clar's rule (formulated by Erich Clar in 1964) for PAHs the resonance structure with {{the largest number of}} disjoint aromatic п-sextets—i.e. benzene-like moieties—is the most important for the characterization of the properties.|$|E

25|$|The Krull {{dimension}} of a module over a possibly non-commutative ring {{is defined as}} the deviation of the poset of submodules ordered by inclusion. For commutative Noetherian rings, this {{is the same as the}} definition using chains of prime ideals. The two definitions can <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> commutative rings which are not Noetherian.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{the mirror}} coating can be measured using a reflectometer and for a particular metal it will <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to infrared light.|$|E

25|$|This {{phrase is}} {{ambiguous}} {{in that it}} can be interpreted as the noun 'boy' referring to a particular individual or to a different individual for each instance of 'tree' under the quantifier 'every'. The interpretation that a single boy climbed all the trees takes a wide scope, while the other interpretation that for every tree there is a boy, who maybe <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> each tree takes a narrow scope.|$|E
25|$|Different {{manufacturers}} of infrared remote controls use different protocols to transmit the infrared commands. The RC-5 protocol {{that has its}} origins within Philips, uses, for instance, a total of 14 bits for each button press. The bit pattern is modulated onto a carrier frequency that, again, can <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> different manufacturers and standards, {{in the case of}} RC-5, the carrier is 36kHz. Other consumer infrared protocols include the various versions of SIRCS used by Sony, the RC-6 from Philips, the Ruwido R-Step, and the NEC TC101 protocol.|$|E
25|$|Ajaan Mun {{asserted}} {{that the practice of}} jhana was still possible even in modern times, and that meditative concentration was necessary on the Buddhist path. Ajaan Mun stated that one's meditation topic must be keeping in line with one's temperament — everyone is different, so the meditation method used should <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> everybody. Ajaan Mun said the meditation topic one chooses should be congenial and enthralling, but also give one a sense of unease and dispassion for ordinary living and the sensual pleasures of the world.|$|E

25|$|The kernel has {{full access}} to the system's memory and must allow {{processes}} to safely access this memory as they require it. Often {{the first step in}} doing this is virtual addressing, usually achieved by paging and/or segmentation. Virtual addressing allows the kernel to make a given physical address appear to be another address, the virtual address. Virtual address spaces may <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> different processes; the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address may be different memory from what another process accesses at the same address. This allows every program to behave as if it is the only one (apart from the kernel) running and thus prevents applications from crashing each other.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s once {{electromagnetism}} {{was better}} understood, interest turned {{again to the}} problem of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> light of different colors, and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow. At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as Maxwell, Heaviside and Hertz unsuccessfully attempted to solve these problems by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws.|$|E
25|$|Although both major trait {{models are}} descriptive, only the three-factor model offers a {{detailed}} causal explanation. Eysenck suggests that different personality traits {{are caused by}} {{the properties of the}} brain, which themselves are the result of genetic factors. In particular, the three-factor model identifies the reticular system and the limbic system in the brain as key components that mediate cortical arousal and emotional responses respectively. Eysenck advocates that extraverts have low levels of cortical arousal and introverts have high levels, leading extraverts to seek out more stimulation from socializing and being venturesome. Moreover, Eysenck surmised that there would be an optimal level of arousal, after which inhibition would occur and that this would <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>for</b> each person.|$|E
