5|$|After {{displaying}} {{skills in}} exhibition {{games with the}} Philippine Team, he {{caught the attention of}} Filipino basketball aficionados, awarding him the title as the next <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> in Philippine basketball. Hence, he did not disappoint as he averaged 17.1 points and 12.8 rebounds during his stint with the Philippine Basketball League's (PBL) Magnolia.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> were considering experimental acts.|$|E
25|$|In December 1967, Cetera arrived {{early for}} a show to watch a band called The <b>Big</b> <b>Thing.</b> Impressed by their use of a horn section {{combined}} with rock and roll, Cetera left The Exceptions to join The <b>Big</b> <b>Thing</b> within two weeks. The <b>Big</b> <b>Thing,</b> which soon changed their name to The Chicago Transit Authority (and eventually shortened it to Chicago) released their self-titled debut album The Chicago Transit Authority on Columbia Records in 1969. Cetera shared lead vocal on three of the eleven songs on the album, with his tenor voice complementing the baritone voices of the two other lead singers in the group, keyboardist Robert Lamm and guitarist Terry Kath.|$|E

25|$|Following the departures of Roger Taylor and Andy Taylor, Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor {{continued}} on as Duran Duran, recording and releasing Notorious (1986) and <b>Big</b> <b>Thing</b> (1988). The group added guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and drummer Sterling Campbell and recorded the album Liberty (1990), but the band's success {{had begun to}} wane in the late-1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> {{for me at the}} time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

50|$|Lists of <b>Big</b> <b>Things</b> around Australia vary {{regarding}} {{the number of}} objects in each state, and what is included, but a 2004 {{book on the subject}} listed 118 <b>Big</b> <b>Things,</b> or groups of <b>Big</b> <b>Things,</b> in Australia, with Queensland having the most at 41, followed by New South Wales with 32. Of Queensland's <b>Big</b> <b>Things,</b> 23 were purely private commercial efforts - advertising shops, service stations, motels and caravan parks, restaurants, museums and the like - and six others were aimed at drawing people to a private tourist attraction. Eight places were structures that could be entered, including the Big Pineapple and the Big Macadamia at the Big Pineapple complex.|$|R

25|$|In 2005, Parker {{formed a}} band called The Dee Dee Dums, (which {{would become the}} basis of Tame Impala) {{featuring}} current Tame Impala member Dominic Simper, and Luke Epstein. The Dee Dee Dums achieved some local acclaim, getting second place at the 2005 AmpFest and winning third place later that year in the state final of The Next <b>Big</b> <b>Thing.</b> In October 2006 Epstein was replaced by drummer Sam Devenport, Epstein going on to play with Sugarpuss. They later {{went on to win}} the Western Australia state final of the National Campus Band Competition.|$|E
25|$|After Missing Persons, Cuccurullo had his {{greatest}} success as guitarist for Duran Duran for fifteen years. Replacing original guitarist Andy Taylor in 1986, he {{performed on the}} albums Notorious ('86) and <b>Big</b> <b>Thing</b> ('88), and was the sole guitarist on the global tours that followed. Becoming an official member in 1989, he appeared on the group's next four studio albums, including being the co-writer of hit singles Ordinary World and Come Undone, {{both of which were}} included on the Duran Duran (Wedding Album) that garnered platinum sales. In 1995 Cuccurullo founded TV Mania, where Neil Carlill was a guest a few years later. Cuccurullo left Duran Duran in 2001 due to a reunion of the group's original members.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Kath {{joined a}} cover band called the Missing Links, taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago {{on a regular}} basis. Parazaider's friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath's compatriot, James William Guercio (who later became Chicago's producer) was lead guitarist {{in one of two}} road bands {{performing}} on The Dick Clark Show with the Missing Links. Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the lower range of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider's parents' basement and changed its name to The <b>Big</b> <b>Thing.</b> With the addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. In mid-1969, the name was shortened to Chicago.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the success}} of the premiere exhibition, {{originally}} scheduled to just last the summer, <b>Big</b> <b>Things</b> was held over until May 2003, when it was immediately followed by <b>Big</b> <b>Things</b> 2, shown from May 6, 2003 to April 30, 2004. <b>Big</b> <b>Things</b> 2 featured work by the same artists as in the first showing, minus Kagan.
