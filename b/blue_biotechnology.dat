40|$|Phytoplankton is {{acknowledged}} to {{be a very}} diverse source of bioactive molecules. These compounds play physiological roles that allow cells to deal with changes of the environmental constrains. For example, the diversity of light harvesting pigments allows efficient photosynthesis at different depths in the seawater column. Identically, lipid composition of cell membranes can vary according to environmental factors. This, together with the heterogenous evolutionary origin of taxa, makes the chemical diversity of phytoplankton compounds much larger than in terrestrial plants. This contribution is dedicated to pigments and lipids synthesized within or from plastids/photosynthetic membranes. It starts with a short review of cyanobacteria and microalgae phylogeny. Then the bioactivity of pigments and lipids (anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, anti-cancer, anti-obesity, anti-allergic activities, and cardio- neuro-, hepato- and photoprotective effects), alone or in combination, is detailed. To increase the cellular production of bioactive compounds, specific culture conditions may be applied (e. g., high light intensity, nitrogen starvation). Regardless of the progress made in <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnologies,</b> the production of bioactive compounds is still limited. However, some examples of large scale production are given, and perspectives are suggested in the final section...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms hold a high {{inherent}} value proved by {{the large}} number of applications in which they have been used. Public Culture Collections have the mandate to conserve microbial diversity and associated data and to make it available to the scientific community. Nevertheless, resources and information are currently fragmented and miss harmonized levels of quality rendering suboptimal exploitation of the available microbial diversity. MIRRI (www. mirri. org), Microbial Resources Research Infrastructure, is a pan-European distributed research infrastructure in its preparatory phase, which aims to support research and development in all fields of <b>biotechnology</b> (<b>blue,</b> green, red and white). Currently, more than 30 public culture collections and research institutes from 19 European countries collaborate to establish this infrastructure. MIRRI will coordinate offer and expertise and will provide a single entry point to resources, databases, training and expertise in the field of microbiology. MIRRI will also support users dealing with microbial resources in issues such as Biosecurity, Intellectual Property Rights, Access and Benefit Sharing, etc., facilitating legal compliance. Moreover, MIRRI aims to apply a holistic approach to data management, improving interoperability of data sets to facilitate generation of knowledge from data. Tailor-made solutions for biotech companies and participation in projects to sustain the bioeconomy will also be part of the MIRRI action plan...|$|R
50|$|The {{colors of}} {{biotechnology}} is a classification system used {{to organize the}} different subspecialities that comprise biotechnology. There are approximately ten branches, with green, yellow, white and <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> the most significant.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> {{is based}} on the {{exploitation}} of sea resources to create products and industrial applications. This branch of biotechnology is the most used for the industries of refining and combustion principally on the production of bio-oils with photosynthetic micro-algae.|$|E
50|$|Biotechnology {{has become}} {{widely used in}} many {{industrial}} and academic activities and the following classifications have become established. Red Biotechnology - Medical, Health care and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology. White Biotechnology - Biotechnology for industrial products. Green Biotechnology - Biotechnology applied to environmental issues. <b>Blue</b> <b>Biotechnology</b> - Biotechnology based on marine organisms. The northeast of England has strengths in all these areas.|$|E
50|$|Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, {{founded in}} 1974, is a private, {{non-profit}} center for global oceanography, ocean science education, and technology transfer. The Laboratory’s research ranges from microbial oceanography to the large-scale biogeochemical processes that drive ocean ecosystems and global environmental conditions, and is {{organized around the}} three core themes of <b>Blue</b> <b>Biotechnology,</b> Ocean Biogeochemistry and Climate Change, and Ocean Health. The Laboratory's 60,000 square-foot, shore-based campus is located in East Boothbay, Maine, on the Damariscotta River estuary. In December 2012, the campus became the first LEED Platinum certified laboratory in Maine and one of seven in the New England area.

NCBB scientists work with the reservoir of microbial organisms in the natural environment and those preserved in cultures. The NCBB houses the world’s first microbial single cell genomics facility (SCGC), the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA), containing one of the world’s first combined collections of marine algae, bacteria, archaea, and viruses; a flow cytometry laboratory; a bioreactor facility; and a laboratory focused on the oceanic deep biosphere.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> {{in which}} aquatic environments provide the {{inspiration}} for various products such as food additives, aquaculture, biosensors, green chemistry, bioenergy, and pharmaceuticals, holds enormous promise. Large-scale efforts to sequence aquatic genomes and metagenomes, as well as campaigns to isolate new organisms and culture-based screenings, are helping to push the boundaries of known organisms. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can complement 16 S gene sequencing {{in the effort to}} discover new organisms of potential relevance to <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> by facilitating the rapid screening of microbial isolates and by providing in depth profiles of the proteomes and metaproteomes of marine organisms, both model cultivable isolates and, more recently, exotic non-cultivable species and communities. Proteomics has already contributed to <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> by identifying aquatic proteins with potential applications to food fermentation, the textile industry, and biomedical drug development. In this review, we discuss historical developments in <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> the current limitations to the known marine biosphere, {{and the ways in which}} mass spectrometry can expand that knowledge. We further speculate about directions that research in <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> will take given current and near-future technological advancements in mass spectrometry...|$|E

40|$|Marine biology made in {{the last}} four decades giant leaps. Several {{scientific}} and technological breakthroughs shaped research in the marine environment. Thanks to the revelation of the enormous width and complexity of sea life, marine biotechnology began a fast path of development that involved both the public and the private domain. Although there exist some studies on the dimensions and the evolution of the industry, few and scattered is the knowledge about the firms and the dynamics that characterize the sector. The authors carry out a first investigation of the private organizations that belong to <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> through the construction of an ad hoc sample of firms.

30|$|Blue Growth {{prospects}} {{appear to}} profit most from a sustainable growth scenario—as stable economic growth {{combined with a}} growing environmental awareness and actions provide an excellent context for the majority of economic functions analysed. The long-term orientation of actors in this scenario contributes to a stable investment climate, particularly favourable for <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> offshore wind and ocean renewable energy. Added to this scenario can be a flourishing deep sea and short sea shipping (replacing substantial parts of road transport), enhanced port facilities and capacities, a strongly increasing (sustainable) tourism sector and high investment levels in technologies for exploitation of marine biodiversity. An increasing role of the seas and oceans in human food production (sustainable aquaculture), intensified monitoring activities and intensified international coordination of the use of marine space also fit well in this scenario. In this scenario, expectations are particularly high for offshore wind, ocean renewable energy, <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> and marine aquatic products. Within several of these domains, Europe is in a leading position when it comes to technology and innovation: it has generated around half of the reviewed patents in offshore wind and some 25  % of the reviewed patents in ocean renewable energy sources. A strong performance can also be recorded in sustainable innovations for marine aquatic products. Furthermore, Europe is well placed to lead not only in the transformation of traditional maritime economic activities, e.g. green shipping, sustainable tourism, sustainable aquaculture, but also promoting more sustainable forms of business within oil and gas or marine mineral mining. Playing out the card of sustainable maritime innovations is likely to produce growth and jobs in a world which is increasingly aware of sustainability. This card is however less likely to be played successfully in a world which is short-term oriented and where Europe moves from crisis to crisis.|$|E
30|$|Within {{the boom}} and bust scenario, {{prospects}} {{are expected to be}} considerably less favourable—due above all to a short-term horizon of all actors, more risk-averseness, a low level of environmental awareness and restricted public and private investment budgets. Fluctuating transport volumes result in obsolete fleets and port facilities. Extraction of oil and gas from the deep seas continues, though without the necessary investments, because commodity price fluctuations add to uncertainty. Coastal tourism and cruise tourism will be relatively stable, with a focus on northern Europe due to climate change effects. Only limited investments are expected in developing new technologies, with dimmed prospects for offshore wind, ocean renewable energy and <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> as a consequence. Public resources for maritime monitoring activities will be limited. Especially in this scenario, additional policy support is likely to be needed.|$|E
40|$|New {{opportunities}} for sustainable economic development {{have emerged from}} the transdisciplinary collaboration of aquaculture and biotechnology. As {{a response to the}} European Commission’s call for a European Bioeconomy, SEAFARM, a five-year program pending funding from FORMAS, aims to develop a sustainable aquaculture as a milieu for and in support of further research in <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology</b> in five collaborating institutions in Sweden. This thesis aims to explore aquaculture technologies, notably IMTA and long-line systems, established and emerging seaweed-based products, the proposed Kostefjorden site, a case study of a similar project in Scotland, BioMara, and some other technological and socio-economic hurdles that will affect the SEAFARM cultivation - all to enable the development of two economically viable but contrasting scenarios for the cultivation. Scenario ONE represents a BioMara inspired cultivation optimised for the industrial production of biofuel feedstock, while scenario TWO explores the potential of a small-scale and diverse IMTA cultivation. These scenarios were cross-referenced against the scenario context criteria. The final result indicated scenario TWO, the small-scale diversified IMTA, would be a more adaptable and economically resilient option, delivering a greater variety of species for biotechnological scrutiny, potential for a diverse and specialised range of products and revenues, while also optimising the conditions necessary for the pursuit of SEAFARM research objectives, notably through the development of the first IMTA in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|Marine and {{freshwater}} ecosystems {{have been}} widely exploited throughout history as vast sources of food and valuable natural products. The diversity of aquatic organisms {{has led to the}} isolation of more than 24000 bioactive compounds with applications in strategic industries such as pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic sectors. Moreover, the biochemical composition and growth characteristics of microalgae and seaweeds suggest their capability to overcome some bottlenecks of the production of energy compared to terrestrial feedstocks. The potential of <b>blue</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> especially in the European context, is reflected in the increasing market and the numerous international programs and initiatives focused on the promotion of research and partnerships to empower technological advances in the field. The development of sustainable processes for the balanced exploitation of marine resources requires the use of management tools to measure the performance of the systems according to environmental and socio-economic criteria. The standardized methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is widely applied in the field of microalgal biofuels and has also been used to evaluate active ingredients. Therefore, this doctoral thesis focuses on the application of LCA methodology to analyze the environmental performance of valuable bioactive molecules and commodity products throughout the whole production chain. Key social and economic indicators have been included in the evaluation of some processes to consider a holistic perspective that takes into account all the dimensions of sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|Nature is {{constantly}} surprising us {{with examples of}} outstanding features, being them of chemical, morphological or biological nature, inspiring scientists towards innovative routes. In particular, marine environment has been receiving growing attention {{and the advent of}} marine (<b>blue)</b> <b>biotechnology</b> is strongly contributing to it, in much extent approaching its health (red) counterpart, fostering new therapeutic proposals. Several marine biomaterials are currently being proposed for the sustained delivery of bioactive compounds, often triggered by external stimuli, which may be combined with polymeric matrices for cell culture, {{on the development of the}} so-called functional biopolymers. Chitosan and alginate are the most common examples, but other marine origin materials start to find their place, namely the sulfated polysaccharides from seaweeds (p. e. carrageenans) and collagens extracted from marine organisms. Nevertheless, the challenges faced are still high: one benefits from the knowledge acquired with other biopolymers and from keen scientists, but thrilling examples of marine functional biomaterials for cartilage regeneration are still scarce, particularly when considering their in-vivo performance. Those are needed to act as landmarks and inspiration for further developments, namely to instigate the investment of the private biomedical industry to take them into clinics. Current pathologies of articular cartilage are daring us to find ultimate therapeutic solutions and we expect to contribute to the needed discussion with the present chapter, pointing examples of marine functional biomaterials and proposing possible paths to be followed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the development, {{implementation}} and operation of SmartBay - a subsea cabled observatory and supporting infrastructure to stimulate the development of marine technology in Ireland. Blue Growth is the long term strategy of the European Union to support sustainable growth in the marine sector and offers great potential for innovation. The development of Ocean Technologies currently presents a number of challenges globally in terms of costs, reliability and longevity of infrastructure {{in the development of}} Renewable Energy, <b>Blue</b> <b>Biotechnology,</b> Water, and Environmental Monitoring & Management as well as more established markets such as Oil and Gas, Shipping and Security and Fishing and Aquaculture. We discuss the rationale behind the development of SmartBay in terms of addressing these challenges and focus particularly in the area of marine renewable energy technology development The design and installation phases of SmartBay are discussed. Costs were minimised, whilst maximising the range of features and applications that the infrastructure can provide to scientific and commercial users. The scientific subsea instrument node is also described in detail, along with the advanced supporting cyber-infrastructure that ensures the data is collected, processed archived and displayed as per end user requirements. The facility provides access to state of the art marine assets and resources for Researchers, Designers, Innovators and Entrepreneurs within Ireland and the EU and is a unique catalyst in the attraction of inward investment and venture capital investment. The SmartBay infrastructure platform centres on a core technology or service, the provision of high quality, time-series marine data. This is essential for a broader, interdependent ecosystem of businesses to develop and supply complementary value-added products and applications to wide multidisciplinary set of users. SmartBay’s role as a key technology node in broader European initiatives Ocean Observation initiatives like the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water column observatory (EMSO), which has been established as a European Research Infrastructure consortium (ERIC) is also discussed.

40|$|Travaux d'un groupe de réflexion au sein de l'Europole Mer sur le thème des biotechnologies marines. Marine (= <b>blue)</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> i. e. the {{utilization}} of marine bio-resources as a target or source of biotechnologicalapplications, is a field with massive potential for innovation and economic growth. In a context of rapid climate change and increasing pressure on natural resources, renewed interest in marine biotechnology has been promoted by application of recent methodological and technological advances, notably in bioprocessing and in the various –omics domains, {{to the study of}} marine biodiversity. Marine biological resources potentially represent a sustainable raw material for exploitation in diverse fields, including nutrition, health, agriculture, aquaculture, energy, environment, and cosmetics. Marine biotechnology is now recognized as a strategically important domain at European, national and regional levels. The present document, compiled by the Marine Biotechnology Working Group of the “Europole Mer”, aims to survey the skills, actors and principal infrastructures related to marine biotechnology in the Brittany and Pays de la Loire regions in the west of France in order to identify strengths and weaknesses and propose strategies to stimulate the future development of this strategic domain. Marine biotechnology {{is an integral part of}} the Smart Specialization Strategies of both of these maritime regions, which have more than 3000 km of coast and numerous assets for becoming a hub of excellence for marine biotechnology. These include high quality, internationally renowned research laboratories and university courses in marine biology and engineering (bioprocessing), a strong inter-regional technology transfer ecosystem, and a dynamic and diversified network of mainly small-sized private-sector companies. However, marine biotechnology would benefit from greater inter-regional coherence and synergy between actors. This could be achieved by undertaking specific actions in the following domains:••communication: implement a mutualized and offensive communication strategy;research: further support fundamental research and research infrastructures; finance proof-of-concept studies to bridge the gap between public-sector and private-sector research;training: develop multidisciplinarity in existing training; identify the skills needed at each level of the value chain and propose targeted vocational training courses to fill gaps; involve academic, technology transfer, and industry actors in molding the future training landscape;technology transfer : develop a national strategy for the development of marine biotechnology activities, identify the Technology Readiness Level of projects and provide support accordingly; support the implantation of public-private laboratories, demonstrator facilities and science parks...|$|E
