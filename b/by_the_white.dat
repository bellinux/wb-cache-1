5|$|The {{program was}} founded on the Monterey Peninsula, California, in 1958 by Dr. Béla H. Bánáthy, a Hungarian {{immigrant}} who taught at the language school. In the 21st century, there are two programs in California: one in Concord, sponsored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Stag Association, and one in Monterey, sponsored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Stag Leadership Development Academy. Bánáthy drew from his youth experience at the 1933 World Jamboree in Gödöllő, Hungary; he named the program after the mythological white stag used as an emblem at the jamboree. Years later, in June 1951 Bánáthy met two other Hungarians teaching at the Army Language School. They had all escaped Hungary before Soviet occupation, Joe Szentkiralyi and Paul Sujan, who had also attended the 1933 World Jamboree. They were initially assisted by a local American Scouter, Fran Peterson.|$|E

5|$|A {{gauging station}} was {{constructed}} on Buffalo Creek near Lewisburg in September 1913. In the early 1900s, the main {{industries in the}} creek's watershed included agriculture, furniture factories, flour mills, and brick works. The tributary Spruce Run was also used as a water supply <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Deer Mountain Water Company and the main stem was used as power for some small gristmills. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Lewisburg (3085 people), Mifflinburg (1559 people), Mazeppa (185 people), Cowan (150 people), Buffalo Roads (142 people), and Kelly Point (97 people). The Pennsylvania Railroad also went through {{the southern part of}} the watershed during the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the refugees were besieged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the Lahti area.|$|E

50|$|During their seven-month {{military}} campaign in Åland, the Germans lost six men. Three {{of them were}} killed on 9 March as the icebreaker Hindenburg struck a mine off Eckerö and sunk. Two sailors drowned on 11 April when the SMS Rheinland grounded between the islands of Lågskär and Flötjan. Swedish casualties were one man as an infantry sergeant committed a suicide in April. The number of killed Russians is not clear but at least two soldiers died in the clashes against <b>the</b> Finnish <b>Whites.</b> One Russian and one Finnish Red was shot <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> in late March as they were captured near the island of Vårdö.

5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of Tampere and Viipuri, won <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites,</b> and <b>the</b> Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> and <b>the</b> German forces. Both <b>the</b> Reds and <b>Whites</b> engaged in political terror. A {{high number of}} Red POWs died due to malnutrition and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – perished in the conflict.|$|R
5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|As of 1940, Buckles {{had been}} {{employed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Star, American President, and W.R.

He was captured in January 1942 by Japanese forces, and spent the next three years and two months as a civilian internee in the Santo Tomas and Los Baños prison camps.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{organization}} in Central California and the group in Northern California continue to develop and present summer camps for youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults. The program will observe its 60th anniversary in 2018. Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 420 participants in 2015, including 33 youth from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, up from 70 in 2006. The group sponsored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Stag Association has attracted between 40 and 83 campers from 2010 to 2014. The two programs have operated continuously since the program's founding entirely on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.|$|E

5|$|Britain's {{remaining}} {{colonies in}} Africa, except for self-governing Southern Rhodesia, were all granted independence by 1968. British {{withdrawal from the}} southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year Mau Mau Uprising. In Rhodesia, the 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> minority resulted {{in a civil war}} that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy briefly met fellow scout Joseph Szentkiralyi. Hungarian Sea Scouter Paul Ferenc Sujan's {{camp was}} visited by Baden-Powell, who asked to taste {{some of his}} soup. American Maury Tripp {{attended}} the Jamboree from Saratoga, California. These four Scouts would later play instrumental roles in forming the White Stag program on the Monterey Peninsula.

5|$|Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust {{were reduced}} to reserve in March 1918 in Sevastopol.

The British wrecked their engines between 22–24 April 1919 when they left the Crimea in order to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. Later, they were captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War, but were abandoned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. The ships were then scrapped in 1922–23, although they were not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.|$|E

25|$|The Russian fleet in Helsinki panicked {{when the}} Germans marched against Helsinki. They managed {{to secure a}} deal with the Germans, which allowed them to {{withdraw}} to Russia. However, only the largest ships managed to return to Russia, due to the harsh ice conditions of the Gulf of Finland. Numerous vessels were left behind to be seized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> and <b>the</b> German troops. On April 13, Prozorlivy was conquered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> and she was transferred to the Finnish navy, along with her five sister ships (Ryany (later S1), Poslishny (S3), Rezvy (S4), Podvizhny (S5) and No 212 (S6)).|$|R
50|$|During the Civil War, a {{partisan}} detachment headed by Fyodor Usaty fought on {{the territory of}} the settlement. This group defended the island of Putyatin from attacks <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Whites</b> and <b>by</b> Japanese interventionists.|$|R
5|$|It {{was placed}} in reserve in March 1918 and was {{captured}} by the Germans at Sevastopol in May. They handed the ship over to the Allies in December 1918 after the Armistice. The British wrecked its engines on 19 April 1919 {{when they left the}} Crimea to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using it against the White Russians. Thoroughly obsolete by this time, the ship was captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War, but was abandoned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. Borets za svobodu was scrapped beginning in 1923, although it was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.|$|E

The undead monster is immune to Jon's sword, continuing to attack even after being run through and losing an arm. As Mormont enters, Jon throws a lantern at the wight, setting the wight ablaze and finally destroying it. The next morning, Mormont and the Night's Watch burn the two bodies, and Sam tells them that he read that corpses touched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Walkers are reanimated and can only be killed by fire.|$|E

The Captain's Mate, hunting seals with a rifle, mistakes Aba (passed out on the ice) for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with a harpoon (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his village with his children.|$|E
