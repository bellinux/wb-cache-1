25|$|Navarro {{voted against}} {{a bill that}} would have charged health {{insurance}} companies between $300 and $800 for ambulance transport, similar to what is done in the District of Columbia, Prince George's County, and Fairfax County. County Executive Isiah Leggett, who supported the <b>bill,</b> <b>said</b> the fees would have helped close the budget gap and help fund improvements to the county's emergency services. Opponents of the bill were skeptical that insurance companies would pay the fees and wondered if the fees would reduce emergency service calls.|$|E
500|$|On June 10, 2014, the House voted 426–0 to {{pass the}} Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 4810; 113th Congress), {{a bill that would}} allow United States {{veterans}} to receive their healthcare from non-VA facilities under certain conditions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would cost about $620 million over the 2014–2016 period. Rep. Jeff Miller, who sponsored the <b>bill,</b> <b>said</b> that the wait times veterans were forced to face was [...] "a national disgrace." ...|$|E

[...] For example, [...] "the scene where I (Ken Jeong) say 'Good job' to Michael and he says 'Nice job, Bill... not' was improvised."

500|$|For the Express, {{head coach}} Bill Jones was {{replaced}} by his brother Tony Jones, who assumed the position of interim head coach until February 20, 2016. At this time, Bill was reinstated into the NBL Canada, with Tony remaining with Windsor as an assistant coach. <b>Bill</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "What happened in that Game 7 was not Bill Jones. It happened {{in the heat of}} the moment and is something I'll probably regret for the rest of my life." [...] Magley said that his concern with the future of the Express organization helped him make the decision to reinstate Jones, who he believed would help the team's fan support grow.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. <b>Bill</b> <b>said</b> that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E
500|$|On May 21, 2014, in {{a vote of}} 390–33, the House of Representatives {{passed the}} Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4031; 113th Congress). The bill would give the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the {{authority}} to remove or demote any individual from the Senior Executive Service upon determining that such individual's performance warrants removal or demotion. The House members who sponsored the bill argued that, although federal workers can be fired, the process is extremely lengthy, sometimes taking years, and that the officials who are [...] "under scrutiny for neglecting veterans actually received {{tens of thousands of}} dollars in bonuses and positive performance reviews." [...] Florida Republican Representative Jeff Miller, who sponsored the <b>bill,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "this bill would simply give the VA Secretary the authority to fire or demote VA Senior Executive Service employees based on performance, similar to the authority the Secretary of Defense already has to remove military general officers from command or how I am able to fire someone who works for me on my staff." ...|$|E

500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. <b>Bill</b> <b>said</b> that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E

2500|$|Fired: Claire, for {{limiting}} {{the scope of}} her team's project, and therefore its chances of success, {{as a result of}} a desire to adhere to her self-admitted [...] "nobler motives". It is worth mentioning that before the final boardroom scene, Claire had struggled to pick two people, saying she would go back in on her own. In addition, after Claire was fired, <b>Bill</b> <b>said</b> he [...] "wasn't done yet" [...] and strongly implied that a double firing would take place: but eventually allowed Christopher and Susanne to return to the house.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2007, Bachmann {{voted against}} the College Cost Reduction and Access Act that would raise the maximum Pell grant from $4,310 to $5,200, lower {{interest}} rates on subsidized student loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent, raise loan limits to $30,500 from $7,500, disfavor married students who file joint tax returns, provide more favorable repayment terms to students who fail to use their education to prosper financially and favor public sector over private sector workers with much more favorable loan forgiveness benefits. Supporters of the <b>bill</b> <b>said</b> [...] "it would allow more students to attend college". Bachmann said her opposition was because [...] "it fails students and taxpayers with gimmicks, hidden costs and poorly targeted aid. It contains no serious reform of existing programs, and it favors the costly, government-run direct lending program over nonprofit and commercial lenders." [...] The bill passed the House and was signed by President Bush.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley and Brent {{separated}} from the group and walked to García's, a popular restaurant-store close to the border. Kilroy stopped at the steps of a house on Álvaro Obregón {{to say good-bye to}} the girl from Miss Tanline. He then waited for Bill to walk towards him. Bill then ran to a nearby alley to urinate while Kilroy waited for him. By the time Bill came out and caught up to the other two near García's, Kilroy had vanished. [...] "Hey, Mark, stop fucking around", <b>Bill</b> <b>said,</b> but Kilroy was nowhere to be found. His friends searched for him for hours, even after the establishments had closed and the streets had cleared at around 4:30a.m. CT. They then crossed the border thinking Kilroy may have crossed to Brownsville and was perhaps waiting near their parked car. His friends did not find him near their car and waited a few minutes in Brownsville before heading to South Padre Island. They thought that Kilroy probably left to the hotel with someone else. They woke up the next day at the hotel and Kilroy's whereabouts were still unknown. His friends then contacted the police to report him missing.|$|E

2500|$|The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007 (...) was {{essentially}} the same bill as H.R. 328 introduced previously in the same Congress. This bill would still have added two additional seats to the House of Representatives, one for the District of Columbia and a second for Utah. The bill passed two committee hearings before finally being incorporated into a second bill of the same name. The new bill (...) passed the full House of Representatives in a vote of 214 to 177. The bill was then referred to the Senate (...) where it passed in committee. However, the bill could only get 57 of the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster and consequently failed {{on the floor of}} the Senate. Following the defeated 2007 bill, voting rights advocates were hopeful that Democratic Party gains in both the House of Representatives and the Senate during the November 2008 elections would help pass the bill during the 111th Congress. Barack Obama, a Senate co-sponsor of the 2007 <b>bill,</b> <b>said</b> during his presidential campaign that he would sign such a bill if it were passed by the Congress while he was President.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} {{printing}} a short {{article on the}} attack, The New York Times published a longer report that conveyed a scene of indifference from neighbors who failed to come to Genovese's aid, saying 37 or 38 witnesses saw or heard the attack and did not call the police. The incident prompted inquiries into {{what became known as}} the bystander effect or [...] "Genovese syndrome". Some researchers have questioned this version of events, offering alternative explanations as to why neighbors failed to intervene and suggesting that the actual number of witnesses was far fewer than reported. In 2015, Genovese's younger brother, <b>Bill,</b> <b>said</b> that the police were indeed summoned twice but did not respond because they believed it was a domestic dispute, and blamed The New York Times for faulty reporting. Bill's 2015 film The Witness showed an interview with neighbor Sophia Farrar, who was around Kitty's age; Farrar said in the film that she ran down to the stairwell when she heard Kitty's screams and held her as she was dying. In 2016, another movie called simply '37' referring to the number of neighbors that heard or saw parts of the murder covered the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Iron Tail was an {{international}} personality and appeared {{as the lead}} with Buffalo Bill at the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France and the Colosseum in Rome, Italy. In France, as in England, Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail were feted by the aristocracy. [...] Iron Tail was one of Buffalo Bill’s best friends and they hunted elk and bighorn together on annual trips. On one of his visits to The Wigwam, Buffalo Bill asked Iron Tail to illustrate in pantomime how he played and won a game of poker with U.S. army officials during a Treaty Council in the old days. [...] "Going through all the forms of the game from dealing to antes and betting and drawing a last card during which no word was uttered and his countenance like a statue, he suddenly swept the table clean into his blanket and rose {{from the table and}} strutted away. It was a piece of superb acting, and exceedingly funny.” Buffalo Bill regarded Chief Iron Tail {{as one of the greatest}} men he ever knew. McCreight and Buffalo Bill grieved over the death of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, Buffalo <b>Bill</b> <b>said</b> he was going to put a granite stone on Chief Iron Tail's grave with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Chief Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento.|$|E
5000|$|One chief from Ba Province, {{who spoke}} to the Fiji Times on {{condition}} of anonymity on 29 June, gave qualified support for the <b>bill</b> but <b>said</b> that the amnesty provisions were unacceptable.

2500|$|The New York Times {{has noted}} that [...] "while some environmentalists enthusiastically {{supported}} the legislation, others, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, opposed it." [...] Friends of the Earth, an international environmental organization, announced its opposition to ACES as they believed the bill was too weak. They cited support from Shell Oil Company and Duke Energy {{as evidence of the}} bill's shortcomings. They also objected to the removal of the EPA’s existing authority to use the Clean Air Act to counter emissions of greenhouse gases. Environmental organizations critical of the <b>bill</b> <b>said</b> the bill fell short by allowing for 85 percent or more of pollution permits to be given away free of cost to the electricity sector. A coalition of environmental groups released a statement saying that [...] "to craft a bill that allows for 2 billion tons of offsets per year — roughly equivalent to 27 percent of 2007 U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — is to allow for continued and dangerous delay in real action by our country {{at a time when the}} world is looking to the U.S. for leadership on climate change." [...] Critics of the bill were concerned about it not going far enough, and claimed that there were too many concessions made to special interests in rewriting the bill. Thus, making the bill weak and potentially harmful to the economy and environment.|$|E
2500|$|Both Mexican and U.S. {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} Kilroy's disappearance {{was some sort}} of foul play. They speculated that Kilroy could have been a victim of drug-related violence or of robbery-killing, but they were short on leads to make any firm conclusions. When Kilroy's friends reported the disappearance, Customs agents went with them to Matamoros to help retrace their steps. Texan officials contacted the U.S. consulate in Matamoros and asked investigators to carry out a search with Kilroy's description in Matamoros jails and hospitals. Investigators then hired a hypnotist {{to see if he could}} figure out some clues. Under hypnosis, Bradley stated that he saw a young Hispanic man wearing a blue plaid shirt and with a visible scar across his face talking to Kilroy before he disappeared. He recalled that the man walked up to Kilroy and told him, [...] "Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?" [...] though <b>Bill</b> <b>said</b> he was not sure if Kilroy responded back. However, none of the friends were able to precisely recall the exact moment or place where Kilroy disappeared. Investigators deduced by this story that Kilroy was kidnapped for robbery or ransom. The first option seemed the most likely because his abductors had not called for a payment. They believed that Kilroy's body was probably dumped in a remote location. Helicopters and terrain vehicles of the United States Border Patrol were called to look on the Rio Grande River, but his body was not found.|$|E
2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I {{had a lot to}} do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. <b>Bill</b> <b>said</b> at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it."
