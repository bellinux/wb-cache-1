5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled <b>broths</b> to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the <b>broths</b> {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the <b>broths</b> in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such <b>broths</b> came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E

40|$|Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain VPI 4330 - 1 {{was used}} as the test {{organism}} in an evaluation of the bactericidal effect of anaerobic <b>broth</b> exposed to air. The test organism, grown under anaerobic conditions in Trypticase soy <b>broth,</b> was diluted in buffered salt solution, and about 2 × 104 cells were suspended in 10 ml of an aerated <b>broth.</b> Ninety percent of the cells were killed within 15 min in actinomyces <b>broth</b> and within 50 min in Trypticase soy <b>broth.</b> All cells survived for 2 h in fluid thioglycolate medium. Addition of DABCO [1, 4 -diazabicyclo (2. 2. 2) octane] or mannitol to Trypticase soy <b>broth</b> did not influence the death rate of the organism, whereas superoxide dismutase decreased the death rate.

25|$|Pasteur {{performed}} {{several experiments}} to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then {{he closed the}} flask, and no organisms grew in it. In another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable liquid. Air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the <b>broths</b> unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such <b>broths</b> came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.|$|E

25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two <b>broths,</b> made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both <b>broths</b> are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E

25|$|Pouchet {{stated that}} air {{everywhere}} could cause spontaneous generation of living organisms in liquids. In the late 1850s, he performed experiments {{and claimed that}} they were evidence of spontaneous generation. Francesco Redi and Lazzaro Spallanzani had provided some evidence against spontaneous generation in the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively. Spallanzani's experiments in 1765 suggested that air contaminated <b>broths</b> with bacteria. In the 1860s, Pasteur repeated Spallanzani's experiments, but Pouchet reported a different result using a different broth.|$|E

2500|$|In the lab {{he came up}} {{with the}} {{following}} simple way to obtain [...] "optically pure" [...] air, i.e. air that has no visible signs of particulate matter. He built a square wooden box with a couple of glass windows on it. Before closing the box, he coated the inside walls and floor of the box with glycerin, which is a sticky syrup. He found that after a few days' wait the air inside the box was entirely particulate-free when examined with strong light beams through the glass windows. The various floating-matter particulates had all ended up getting stuck to the walls or settling on the sticky floor. Now, in the optically pure air there were no signs of any [...] "germs", i.e. no signs of floating micro-organisms. Tyndall sterilised some meat-broths by simply boiling them, and then compared what happened when he let these meat-broths sit in the optically pure air, and in ordinary air. The <b>broths</b> sitting in the optically pure air remained [...] "sweet" [...] (as he said) to smell and taste after many months of sitting, while the ones in ordinary air started to become putrid after a few days. This demonstration extended Louis Pasteur's earlier demonstrations that the presence of micro-organisms is a precondition for biomass decomposition. However, the next year (1876) Tyndall failed to consistently reproduce the result. Some of his supposedly heat-sterilized <b>broths</b> rotted in the optically pure air. From this Tyndall was led to find viable bacterial spores (endospores) in supposedly heat-sterilized <b>broths.</b> He discovered the <b>broths</b> had been contaminated with dry bacterial spores from hay in the lab. All bacteria are killed by simple boiling, except that bacteria have a spore form that can survive boiling, he correctly contended, citing research by Ferdinand Cohn.
