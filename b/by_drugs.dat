5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the world}} the term {{physician}} refers to a specialist in internal medicine or one of its many sub-specialties (especially {{as opposed to a}} specialist in surgery).

25|$|Varicella can be lethal {{to adults}} with {{impaired}} immunity.

25|$|This {{inhibition}} of MAO-A allows DMT to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes {{in the stomach}} and small intestine, and eventually cross the blood–brain barrier (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without RIMAs or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> like phenelzine and tranylcypromine, DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.|$|E

AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly have paid billions of dollars in federal settlements over allegations that they paid doctors to promote drugs for unapproved uses. Some prominent medical schools have since tightened rules on faculty acceptance of such payments by drug companies.|$|E

25|$|The cells {{which are}} {{actively}} undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> or radiation.

Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.|$|E
