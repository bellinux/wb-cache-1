We classify a circuit as carrying either type of traffic based on the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average of its number of cells. We evaluate our proposal by simulating traffic using several methods and show that Torchestra provides up to 32 % reduction in delays for interactive traffic compared to the Tor traffic prioritization scheme of Tang and Goldberg and up to 40 % decrease in delays when compared to unprioritized To...|$|R

We consider that “a visualization is worth a million triples”, and in this paper, we propose a novel approach that mines the content of datasets and automatically generates visualizations. Our approach is directly based on the usage of SPARQL queries that will detect the important categories of a dataset and that will specifically con-sider the properties used by the objects which have been interlinked via owl:sameAs links. We then propose to associate type of visualization for those categories. We have implemented this approach into a so-calle...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of full text downloads of articles in Elseviers ScienceDirect covering all disciplines reveals large differences in download frequencies, their skewness, and their correlation with Scopus-based citation counts, between disciplines, journals, and document types. Download counts tend to be two orders of magnitude higher and less skewedly distributed than citations. A mathematical model based on the sum of two exponentials does not adequately capture monthly download counts. The degree of correlation at the article level within a journal {{is similar to that}} at the journal level in the discipline covered by that journal, suggesting that the differences between journals are to a large extent discipline specific. Despite the fact that in all study journals download and citation counts per article positively correlate, little overlap may exist between the set of articles appearing {{in the top of the}} citation distribution and that with the most frequently downloaded ones. Usage and citation leaks, <b>bulk</b> <b>downloading,</b> differences between reader and author populations in a subject field, the type of document or its content, differences in obsolescence patterns between downloads and citations, different functions of reading and citing in the research process, all provide possible explanations of differences between download and citation distributions.

In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed– usually fully encrypted– across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.|$|R

It {{consists}} of volunteer-operated routers {{from all around the}} world that serve hundreds of thousands of users every day. Due to congestion and a low relay-to-client ratio, Tor suffers from performance issues that can poten-tially discourage its wider adoption, and result in an overall weaker anonymity to all users. We seek to improve the performance of Tor by defining different classes of service for its traffic. We recognize that although the ma-jority of Tor traffic is interactive web browsing, a relatively small amount of <b>bulk</b> <b>downloading</b> consumes an unfair amount of Tor’s scarce bandwidth. Furthermore, these traffic classes have different time and bandwidth constraints; therefore, they should not be given the same Quality of Service (QoS), which Tor offers them today. We propose and evaluate DiffTor, a machine-learning-based ap-proach that classifies Tor’s encrypted circuits by application in real time and subsequently assigns distinct classes of service to each application. Our experiments confirm that we are able to classify circuits we generated on the live Tor network with an extremely high accuracy that exceeds 95 %. We show that our real-time clas-sification in combination with QoS can considerably improve the experience of Tor clients, as our simple techniques result in a 75 % improvement in responsiveness and an 86 % reduction in download times at the median for interactive users. 1...|$|R
