3000|$|Curcumin is a {{medicinal}} agent that exhibits anti-cancer properties and <b>bioactive</b> <b>pigment</b> in Turmeric {{has a huge}} therapeutic value. It has a keto-enol moiety that gives rise to many of its chemical properties. A recent study has shown that keto-enol tautomerisation at this moiety is implicated the effect of curcumin. The tautomerisation of curcumin in methanol, acetone and acetonitrile are used in nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H, 13 C) spectroscopy. It was characterized using UV, IR and Raman spectral values. The molecular electrostatic potential surface of the Curcumin has been visualized in electropositive potential {{in the region of}} the CH 3 + group and most electronegative potential in the two oxygen atom has very strong binding group. In the following, the modality of structural and thermo dynamical parameters, electrophilicity (ω), chemical potential (μ), chemical hardness (η) and electronic charge transfer confirms the local reactivity. The rate constant of tautomerisation of curcumin shows strong temperature dependence. Molecular electrostatic potential and Temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties like ([...] C_p,m^ 0, S_m^ 0, and H_m^ 0) [...] is increase with increase in temperature for monomer and dimer of various electrical fields.|$|E
40|$|Our recent {{publication}} {{showed that}} a small <b>bioactive</b> <b>pigment</b> epithelium derived factor (PEDF) peptide (P 78 -PEDF) prevents the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, its effects on the progression of established DN were not clear. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the effect of P 78 -PEDF in the progression of DN and to compare the effects of P 78 -PEDF and an ACE inhibitor (ACEi), a standard of care in DN. Experiments were conducted in Ins 2 (Akita) mice treated with P 78 -PEDF or captopril starting at 6 wks of age for 12 wks (early treatment) or starting at 12 wks of age for 6 wks (late treatment). We first established the optimal dose of the P 78 -PEDF peptide to ameliorate DN in Ins 2 (Akita) mouse for a 6 wk study period and found that the peptide was effective at 0. 1 - 0. 5 µg/g/day. We next showed that early or late treatment with P 78 -PEDF resulted in protection from DN as indicated by reduced albuminuria, kidney macrophage recruitment, histological changes, inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic markers (kidney TNF-α, fibronectin, VEGFA and EGFR), and restored nephrin expression compared with vehicle-treated Ins 2 (Akita) mice. Interestingly, only early but not late treatment with captopril was as effective as P 78 -PEDF in reducing most DN complications, despite its lack of effect on nephrin, VEGFA and EGFR expression. These findings highlight the importance of P 78 -PEDF peptide as a potential therapeutic modality in both the development and progression of diabetic renal injury...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been reported that some strains of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea produce the purple <b>bioactive</b> <b>pigment</b> violacein {{as well as the}} antibiotic compound indolmycin, hitherto only found in Streptomyces. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the relative role of each of these two compounds as antibacterial compounds in P. luteoviolacea S 4054. Using Tn 10 transposon mutagenesis, a mutant strain that was significantly reduced in violacein production in mannose-containing substrates was created. Full genome analyses revealed that the vio-biosynthetic gene cluster was not interrupted by the transposon; instead the insertion was located to the maeA gene encoding the malic enzyme. Supernatant of the mutant strain inhibited Vibrio anguillarum and Staphylococcus aureus in well diffusion assays and in MIC assays at the same level or even more pronounced as the wild type strain. The mutant strain killed V. anguillarum in co-culture experiments as efficiently as the wild type. Using UHPLC-UV/Vis analyses, we quantified violacein and indolmycin, and the mutant strain only produced 7 - 10 % the amount of violacein compared to the wildtype strain. In contrast, the amount of indolmycin produced by the mutant strain was about 300 % that of the wildtype. Since inhibition of V. anguillarum and S. aureus by the mutant strain was similar to that of the wild type, it is concluded that violacein is not the major antibacterial compound in P. luteoviolacea. We furthermore propose that production of violacein and indolmycin may be metabolically linked and that yet unidentified antibacterial compound(s) may be play a role in the antibacterial activity of P. luteoviolacea...|$|E

40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common complications of diabetes. A plethora of literature indicates that oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. One could thus hypothesise that antioxidant therapies may be protective for diabetic retinopathy. Anthocyanins are important natural <b>bioactive</b> <b>pigments</b> responsible for red-blue colour of fruits, leaves, seeds, stems and flowers in a variety of plant species. Apart from their colours, anthocyanins are known to be health-promoting phytochemicals with potential properties useful to protect against oxidative stress in some degenerative diseases. They also have a variety of biological properties including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer, and cardio-protective properties. Some reports further suggest a therapeutic role of anthocyanins to prevent and/or protect against ocular diseases but more studies are needed to examine their potential as alternative therapy to diabetic retinopathy. The present article reviews the available literature concerning the beneficial role of anthocyanins in diabetic retinopathy...|$|R
40|$|Discoveries of tumor-resistant {{pharmacological}} {{drugs have}} mainly resulted from screening of natural products and their analogs. Some are also discovered incidentally when studying organisms. The great biodiversity of microorganisms {{raises the possibility}} of producing secondary metabolites (e. g., mevastatin, lovastatin, epothilone, salinosporamide A) to cope with adverse environments. Recently, natural plant pigments with anti-tumor activities such as beta-carotene, lycopene, curcumin and anthocyanins have been proposed. However, many plants have a long life cycle. Therefore, pigments from microorganisms represent another option {{for the development of}} novel anti-tumor drugs. Prodigiosin (PG) is a natural red pigment produced by microorganisms, i. e., Serratia marcescens and other gram-negative bacteria. The anti-tumor potential of PG has been widely demonstrated. The families of PG (PGs), which share a common pyrrolylpyrromethene (PPM) skeleton, are produced by various bacteria. PGs are <b>bioactive</b> <b>pigments</b> and are known to exert immunosuppressive properties, in vitro apoptotic effects, and in vivo anti-tumor activities. Currently the most common strain used for producing PGs is S. marcescens. However, few reports have discussed PGs production. This review therefore describes the development of an anti-tumor drug, PG, that can be naturally produced by microorganisms, and evaluates the microbial production system, fermentation strategies, purification and identification processes. The application potential of PGs is also discussed. (C) 2011, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights reserved...|$|R

Turmeric powder {{derived from the}} rhizome of Curcuma longa is commonly used as a spice, food preservative and food colouring agent. It also {{has a long history}} of therapeutic uses. The compound shows yellow colour in Turmeric are three curcuminoids namely curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxy curcumin. Curcumin [1, 7 -bis(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl)- 1, 6 -heptadiene- 3, 5 -dione], a yellow <b>bioactive</b> <b>pigment</b> is the major component of Turmeric. Curcumin shows some biological activities exhibiting anti-inflammatory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], antifungal, anticarcinogenic, antibacterial [6], antiprotozoal wound healing, antispasmodic, anticoagulant, antitumor and hepatoprotective activities [7, 8, 9, 10]. Antioxidant and wound-healing gives by curcumin, its anticancer and anti-viral attributes, its effect on lymphocytes, platlet aggregation, detoxification mechanism. Curcumin is a potential anticancer drug it show its effect through molecular targets and it also cure colon cancer. The water-soluble extract turmerin, inhibits HIV infected T cell proliferation. It has also been studied extensively as a chemo preventive agent in several cancer cells [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. From the figure the acceptor site is the active region to cure cancer cells and also some tumors. Structurally curcuminoids are linear 1, 7 -diaryl- 1, 6 -heptadiene- 3, 5 -diones which exist in tautomeric forms as α,β unsaturated 1, 3 -diketo form and enol form. The proton-transfer of dissociation is associated with radical-scavenging mechanisms of curcumin. The curcumin structure containing enol form supposes to be more stable than diketo form. Curcumin has a potential singlet oxygen quencher at low conditions. The compound has an effect in protecting skin against UV light. The results indicate that unsaturation in the side chain a methoxy group on benzene ring and keto-enol in the curcumin molecule structural. The theoretical also reported wherein DFT and TD-DFT calculations help to find out keto-enol equilibrium of curcumin in solution state and low pKa value for the dissocation of enol proton. Quanta methods are useful in determining the effect of inter molecular interactions on the vibrational spectra. The pervious study explain the understanding of hydrogen bonding that conform spectroscopic approach (FT-IR, FT-Raman) with quantum chemical methods (DFT). Density Functional theory is useful in vibrational assignment, hydrogen bonding, High chemical reactivity (Homo-Lumo) and NMR. The delocalisation of π-electron is further supported by red-shifted UV–visible absorption maximum of keto-enol tautomer of curcumin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As shade adapted organisms the conchocelis of Pyropia contain high {{concentrations}} of photosynthetic pigments, making the conchocelis a potential source for the extraction of <b>bioactive</b> <b>pigments</b> such as phycoerythrin, phycocyanin and carotenoids. The pigment content of Pyropia conchocelis in response to environmental factors is poorly known. Investigations were performed on the production of carotenoid pigments {{as a function of}} environmental variables by the conchocelis phase of Alaskan Pyropia species: Pyropia abbottiae, P. hiberna,P. tortaandP. sp. Conchocelis fragments were cultured under different irradiance, and nutrient concentrations for up to 60 days. Results indicate that carotenoid pigments were significantly affected by irradiance, nutrient concentrations and culture age, with some interactions of these factors. Carotenoid pigment content varied in a similar manner for each species. Light had the most obvious influence on carotenoid content. For all four species, the highest carotenoid content (3. 4 - 7. 0 mggdw- 1) generally occurred at 0 - 10 µmol photonsm- 2 s- 1. Higher irradiances, low nutrients and longer culture age generally caused a decline of carotenoid pigment content. There were significant differences in carotenoid pigment content for different species. P. abbottiae and P. sp. produced higher pigment content than the other two species. Maximal carotenoid content for P. abbottiae was 7. 0 mggdw- 1. P. torta contained the least carotenoid pigment under all culture conditions. Carotenoid pigments remained highest under continuous darkness for as long as 60 days for all tested species. Th...|$|R

The present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, antimicrobial and radio-protective properties of carotenoid pigments isolated from ultraviolet (UV) -C resistant Micrococcus spp. The UV-C resistant Micrococcus roseus and Micrococcus luteus were isolated from the soil samples of Savandurga hills region, Karnataka (India), and their pigments were identified as carotenoids based on spectral analysis. The UV-protective efficacies were determined by cling-film assay. Further, the antioxidant activities of pigments were evaluated by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay, and antibacterial activities by disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays. The optimum growth and pigment production by M. roseus and M. luteus were observed at temperature ranged between 35 °C and 37 °C, pH 7. 0 - 8. 0, NaCl 5. 0 - 7. 0 %, and sucrose as major carbon and KNO 3 as major nitrogen sources.

As a result of this novel alimentary habit, the <b>bioactive</b> algal red <b>pigment</b> caulerpin has been detected in its tissues. However, this may not be an isolated case: other fish species have also been reported to feed on C. cylindracea, although the possible accumulation of caulerpin in their tissues has not yet been investigated. In this report, we analysed stomach contents and caulerpin levels in the native sparid species Spondyliosoma cantharus, Sarpa salpa, and Diplodus vulgaris, and in the scarid Sparisoma cretense, along with the Lessepsian siganid Siganus luridus. C. cylindracea was found in the stomachs of all but one fish species, the exception being S. cretense, in which prey items could not be determined due to the high degree of digestion. Chemical analysis of fish tissues revealed that only S. cantharus and S. salpa accumulated caulerpin, while no traces of the compound were detected in the other species. Despite intense research efforts on natural products obtained from C. cylindracea, a complete picture of the impacts caused by fish including this alga in their diet has not been elucidated.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{color of}} the edible portion of fruits and {{vegetables}} reflects the presence of <b>pigmented</b> <b>bioactive</b> compounds, (eg, carotenoids, anthocyanidins, and flavonoids). Which fruit and vegetable color groups contribute most to the beneficial association of fruit and vegetables with stroke incidence is unknown. Therefore, we examined associations between consumption of fruit and vegetable color groups with 10 -year stroke incidence. Methods—This was a prospective, population-based cohort study, including 20 069 men and women age 20 to 65 years and free of cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Participants completed a validated, 178 -item food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for stroke incidence using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, lifestyle, and dietary factors. Results—During 10 years of follow-up, 233 incident cases of stroke were documented. Fruits and vegetables were classified into 4 color groups. Medians of green, orange/yellow, red/purple, and white fruit and vegetable consumption were 62, 87, 57, and 118 g/d, respectively. Green, orange/yellow, and red/purple fruits and vegetables were not related to incident stroke. Higher intake of white fruits and vegetables was inversely associated with incident stroke (Q 4, > 171 g/d, versus Q 1, = 78 g/d; HR, 0. 48; 95 % CI, 0. 29 – 0. 77). Each 25 -g/d increase in white fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a 9 % lower risk of stroke (HR, 0. 91; 95 % CI, 0. 85 – 0. 97).
