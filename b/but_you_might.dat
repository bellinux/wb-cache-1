500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Boucher {{wrote that}} the book belongs [...] "pretty much to the private-eye school" [...] of fiction. He praised the first part, saying that Fleming [...] "manages to make baccarat clear even to one who's never played it and {{produced}} as exciting a gambling sequence as I've ever read. But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader {{through a set of}} tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You should certainly begin this book; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well stop when the baccarat game is over." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} derived from a dream Cox had in which he saw a group of protesters, {{one of whom was}} holding up a sign reading [...] "Let the blind lead those who can see but cannot feel". [...] Upon waking, Cox wrote down the phrase on a {{notebook}} beside his bed. [...] He described the concept to Out magazine as being [...] "like you are able to see, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not know the right direction to go in. But somebody who can’t see might—just by instinct—lead you that way." [...] The arrangement of the tracks on Let the Blind Lead is chronological, presented in the order in which they were recorded.|$|E

I {{want to know how}} you can dedicate yourself to your forthcoming positions in the musical world, when you can't dedicate yourself right now to what you're doing in a simple little march. ... The world is full of people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right—most of the time. Nobody's perfect! When are you going to start to demand of yourself what I demand of myself? When {{are you going to be}} as uncompromising with what you do as I am uncompromising in what I hear and what I insist on? When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day. And I don't only mean 5 minutes of 10; I mean 10 minutes out of 10; I mean 60 minutes out of an hour, 24 hours a day, at least all of your waking hours. ... I don't want it just about right! To me, just about right is terrible! ... Now, nobody's killed when you play a half-note as a dotted quarter. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>might,</b> from learning to play a half-note a full half-note, make the difference in the lives of 50,000 little kids. ... You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know—a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is—they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.” ...|$|E

60|$|MILLIKEN.--And a {{very good}} player, too. <b>But</b> I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlewomen," [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Spence, {{as though}} {{puzzled by the}} word, [...] "gentlewomen, yes. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have been born anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Mrs. Simpson. [...] "I’m much obliged. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have spared {{yourself}} the trouble. I should know my husband anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Forester, [...] "I don't {{think you}} would; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> get killed. The risk {{would be too}} great for the benefit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} guide, [...] "perhaps there ain't. <b>But</b> as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> hear them talkin' about hermits here, I thought I'd tell you just {{what sort of}} things they are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha!' cried Jem, 'you {{have not}} gone and precipitated matters! I thought you could never amaze me again; <b>but</b> even <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have felt she was a being to merit rather more time and respect!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am straitened {{for nothing}} except breath. <b>But</b> <b>you,</b> who <b>might</b> be in a spacious palace, with the wide green country around you, find this a narrow prison. Nevertheless, I cannot say, 'Go.'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{could not}} prevent his accosting you, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have {{prevented}} his giving {{all this trouble}} to papa. You know we should never allow it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Fleetwood Mac version {{includes}} a verse that begins [...] "Now {{you are here}} today, <b>But</b> easily <b>you</b> <b>might</b> just go away." [...] It is omitted from Welch's solo version, which otherwise has the same lyrics.|$|R
6000|$|She gave me such {{a desolate}} look, and {{answered}} {{in a tone of}} utter dejection, [...] "Oh, I didn't know, <b>but</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not want me.

6000|$|... "Mad? You know I'm not mad! <b>But</b> I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be {{a little}} {{sympathetic}} sometimes, Olive!" [...] said her friend, kissing her.|$|R
60|$|P. It is {{your own}} poor pettifogging nature then, which you desire to have {{represented}} before you?--not human nature in its height and vigour? <b>But</b> surely <b>you</b> <b>might</b> find the former with all its joys and sorrows, more conveniently in your own houses and parishes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} you can be of any use--I don't know that I ought to speak to <b>you.</b> <b>But</b> I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> perhaps save me from--save my taking a false step." ...|$|R
