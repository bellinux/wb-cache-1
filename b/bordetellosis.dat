40|$|Bordetella avium causes {{an upper}} {{respiratory}} tract disease (<b>bordetellosis)</b> in avian species. Commercially raised turkeys are particularly susceptible. Like other pathogenic members of the genus Bordetella (B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica) that infect mammals, B. avium binds preferentially to ciliated tracheal epithelial cells and produces similar signs of disease. These similarities prompted us to study <b>bordetellosis</b> in turkeys as a possible nonmammalian model for whooping cough, the exclusively human childhood disease caused by B. pertussis. One impediment to accepting such a host-pathogen model as relevant to the human situation is evidence suggesting that B. avium does not express {{a number of the}} factors known to be associated with virulence in the other two Bordetella species. Nevertheless, with signature-tagged mutagenesis, four avirulent mutants that had lesions in genes orthologous to those associated with virulence in B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica (bvgS, fhaB, fhaC, and fimC) were identified. None of the four B. avium genes had been previously identified as encoding factors associated with virulence, and three of the insertions (in fhaB, bvgS, and fimC) were in genes or gene clusters inferred as being absent or incomplete in B. avium, based upon the lack of DNA sequence similarities in hybridization studies and/or the lack of immunological cross-reactivity of the putative products. We further found that the genotypic arrangements of most of the B. avium orthologues were very similar in all three Bordetella species. In vitro tests, including hemagglutination, tracheal ring binding, and serum sensitivity, helped further define the phenotypes conferred by the mutations. Our findings strengthen the connection between the causative agents and the pathogenesis of <b>bordetellosis</b> in all hosts and may help explain the striking similarities of the histopathologic characteristics of this upper airway disease in avian and mammalian species...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella avium causes <b>bordetellosis</b> in birds, {{a disease}} similar to {{whooping}} cough caused by Bordetella pertussis in children. B. avium agglutinates guinea pig erythrocytes via an unknown mechanism. Loss of hemagglutination ability results in attenuation. We report {{the use of}} transposon mutagenesis to identify two genes required for hemagglutination. The genes (hagA and hagB) were adjacent and divergently oriented and had no orthologs in the genomes of other Bordetella species. Construction of in-frame, unmarked mutations in each gene allowed examination {{of the role of}} each in conferring erythrocyte agglutination, explanted tracheal cell adherence, and turkey poult tracheal colonization. In all of the in vitro and in vivo assays, the requirement for the trans-acting products of hagA and hagB (HagA and HagB) was readily shown. Western blotting, using antibodies to purified HagA and HagB, revealed proteins of the predicted sizes of HagA and HagB in an outer membrane-enriched fraction. Antiserum to HagB, but not HagA, blocked B. avium erythrocyte agglutination and explanted turkey tracheal ring binding. Bioinformatic analysis indicated the similarity of HagA and HagB to several two-component secretory apparatuses in which one product facilitates the exposition of the other. HagB has the potential to serve as a useful immunogen to protect turkeys against colonization and subsequent disease. Bordetella avium is the causative agent of <b>bordetellosis,</b> a...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella avium causes an upper-respiratory-tract disease called <b>bordetellosis</b> in birds. <b>Bordetellosis</b> shares {{many of the}} {{clinical}} and histopathological features of disease caused in mammals by Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica. In this study we determined several parameters of infection in the domestic turkey, Meleagris galapavo, and compared these in vivo findings with an in vitro measure of adherence using turkey tracheal rings. In the in vivo experiments, we determined the effects of age, group size, infection duration, and interindividual spread of B. avium. Also, the effect of host genetic background on susceptibility was tested in the five major commercial turkey lines by infecting each with the parental B. avium strain and three B. avium insertion mutants. The mutant strains lacked either motility, the ability to agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes, {{or the ability to}} produce dermonecrotic toxin. The susceptibilities of 1 -day-old and 1 -week-old turkeys to B. avium were the same, and challenge group size (5, 8, or 10 birds) had no effect upon the 50 % infectious dose. Two weeks between inoculation and tracheal culture was optimal, since an avirulent mutant (unable to produce dermonecrotic toxin) persisted for a shorter time. Communicability of the B. avium parental strain between confined birds was modest, but a nonmotile mutant was less able to spread between birds. There were no host-associated differences in susceptibility to the parental strain and the three B. avium mutant strains just mentioned: in all turkey lines tested, the dermonecrotic toxin- and hemagglutination-negative mutants were avirulent whereas the nonmotile mutants showed no loss of virulence. Interestingly, the ability of a strain to cause disease in vivo correlated completely with its ability to adhere to ciliated tracheal cells in vitro...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 303 {{isolates}} of Bordetella bronchiseptica recovered from 11 host species {{were characterized by}} the electrophoretic mobilities of 15 metabolic enzymes, and 21 distinctive multilocus genotypes (electrophoretic types) were distinguished {{on the basis of}} allele profiles at the enzyme loci. The population structure of B. bronchiseptica is clonal, and its genetic diversity is limited in comparison with most other pathogenic bacteria, perhaps reflecting a relatively recent origin of the species. Electrophoretic types mark clones which are, in many cases, nonrandomly associated with host species. Clones differing only slightly in overall chromosomal genetic character may have pronounced differences in virulence potential. There was considerable variation among individual clones and clone families in degree of host specificity and among various species of hosts in the diversity of clones causing disease. The diversity of clones infecting dogs was an order of magnitude greater than that of clones infecting pigs. Most <b>bordetellosis</b> in pigs in the United States and Japan was found to be caused by strains of a single multilocus genotype...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella avium {{continues}} to be an economic issue in the turkey industry as the causative agent of <b>bordetellosis,</b> which often leads to serious secondary infections. This study presents a broad characterization of the antibiotic resistance patterns in this diverse collection of B. avium strains collected over the past thirty years. In addition, the plasmid basis for the antibiotic resistance was characterized. The antibiotic resistance pattern allowed the development of a novel enrichment culture method that was subsequently employed to gather new isolates from diseased turkeys and a healthy sawhet owl. While a healthy turkey flock was shown to seroconvert by four weeks-of-age, attempts to culture B. avium from healthy turkey poults were unsuccessful. Western blot of B. avium strains using pooled serum from diseased and healthy commercial turkey flocks revealed both antigenic similarities and differences between strains. In sum, the work documents the continued exposure of commercial turkey flocks to B. avium and the need for development of an effective, inexpensive vaccine to control spread of the disease. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Bordetella avium is the {{etiologic}} agent of turkey coryza or <b>bordetellosis,</b> a respiratory disease responsible for substantial economic losses to the turkey industry. At present, identification of this bacterium relies on isolation and biochemical testing. Although a PCR {{for the detection}} of B. avium was proposed {{a number of years ago}} (P. H. Savelkoul, L. E. de Groot, C. Boersma, I. Livey, C. J. Duggleby, B. A. van der Zeijst, and W. [*]Gaastra, Microb. Pathog. 15 : 207 - 215, 1993), lack of analytical verification precludes its use as a diagnostic tool. Furthermore, a number of details pertaining to the reaction conditions used are missing or unclear. In the present study we have identified an optimal set of PCR conditions for use with the previously described primer pair and determined the limit of detection under these conditions to be approximately 20 pg. Assay sensitivity is 100 %, based on an analysis of 72 B. avium isolates from diverse geographic locations and covering a time span of at least 25 years. Evaluation of a separate group of 87 bacterial isolates from poultry, comprising both gram-positive and gram-negative commensals and pathogens representing 11 genera, demonstrated an assay specificity of 98. 8 %. Reproducibility is 100 % using either purified genomic DNA or boiled cell lysates less than 3 days old. Sequence analysis of the B. avium PCR amplicons identified only three occasional sequence polymorphisms. These data indicate the B. avium PCR assay can provide clinically significant results...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella avium causes <b>bordetellosis,</b> {{an upper}} {{respiratory}} disease of birds. Commercially raised turkeys are particularly susceptible. We report {{here on the}} use of a recently described B. avium bacteriophage, Ba 1, as a tool for investigating the effects of lysogeny and phage resistance on virulence. We found that lysogeny had no effect on any of the in vivo or in vitro measurements of virulence we employed. However, two-thirds (six of nine) spontaneous phage-resistant mutants of our virulent laboratory strain, 197 N, were attenuated. Phage resistance was associated, in all cases, with an inability of the mutants to bind phage. Further tests of the mutants revealed that all had increased sensitivities to surfactants, and increased amounts of incomplete (O-antigen-deficient) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to 197 N. Hot phenol-water-extracted 197 N LPS inactivated phage in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Acid hydrolysis and removal of lipid A had little effect upon the ability of isolated LPS to inactivate Ba 1, suggesting that the core region and possibly the O antigen were required for phage binding. All of the mutants, with one exception, were significantly more sensitive to naive turkey serum and, without exception, significantly less able to bind to tracheal rings in vitro than 197 N. Interestingly, the three phage-resistant mutants that remained virulent appeared to be O antigen deficient and were among the mutants that were the most serum sensitive and least able to bind turkey tracheal rings in vitro. This observation allowed us to conclude that even severe defects in tracheal ring binding and serum resistance manifested in vitro were not necessarily indicative of attenuation and that complete LPS may not be required for virulence...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella avium is the causative {{agent of}} <b>bordetellosis,</b> which {{remains to be}} the cause of severe losses in the turkey industry. Given the lack of {{vaccines}} that can provide good protection, developing a novel vaccine against B. avium infection is crucial. In this study, we constructed a eukaryotic expression plasmid, which expressed the outer membrane protein A (ompA) of B. avium, to prepare a B. avium recombinant ompA-DNA vaccine. Three concentrations (low, middle, and high) of Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharides (TPPPS), a known immunomodulator, were used as adjuvants, and their immune conditioning effects on the developed DNA vaccine were examined. The pure ompA-DNA vaccine, Freund's incomplete adjuvant ompA-DNA vaccine, and the empty plasmid served as the controls. The chickens in each group were separately inoculated with these vaccines three times at 1, 7 and 14 days old. Dynamic changes in antibody production, cytokine secretion, and lymphocyte count were then determined from 7 days to 49 days after the first inoculation. Protective rates of the vaccines were also determined after the third inoculation. Results showed that the pure DNA vaccine obviously induced the production of antibodies, the secretion of cytokines, and the increase in CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood, as well as provided a protective rate of 50 % to the B. avium-challenged chickens. The chickens inoculated with the TPPPS adjuvant ompA-DNA vaccine and Freund’s adjuvant ompA-DNA vaccine demonstrated higher levels of immune responses than those inoculated with pure ompA-DNA vaccine, whereas only the ompA-DNA vaccine with 200 mg/mL TPPPS completely protected the chickens against B. avium infection. These findings indicate that the B. avium ompA-DNA vaccine combined with TPPPS is a potentially effective B. avium vaccine...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} Bordetella avium for virulence factors {{common to}} Bordetella pertussis, including pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, adenylate cyclase, dermonecrotic toxin, and tracheal cytotoxin. B. avium produced a dermonecrotic toxin and a tracheal cytotoxin. The dermonecrotic toxin of B. avium is a 155, 000 -molecular-weight, heat-labile protein which was lethal for mice, guinea pigs, young chickens, and turkey poults and produced dermonecrosis when injected intradermally into guinea pigs, chickens, and turkey poults. High-pressure liquid chromatography of B. avium culture supernatant fluid revealed {{the presence of}} a tracheal cytotoxin chemically identical to that produced by B. pertussis. B. avium isolates were negative for B. pertussis-like filamentous hemagglutinin and pertussis toxin when assayed with antibody against B. pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin and pertussis toxin. Furthermore, B. avium failed to induce the clustered CHO cell morphology characteristic of pertussis toxin. Adenylate cyclase assays indicated that B. avium does not produce an extracytoplasmic adenylate cyclase, even after passage through embryonated turkey eggs. Since production of virulence proteins by B. pertussis is regulated by growth in media containing nicotinamide or MgSO 4 or by growth at reduced temperatures, we determined the effect of these supplements and growth conditions on production of dermonecrotic toxin by B. avium. Production of dermonecrotic toxin in B. avium was not altered by growth in media containing 100 microM FeSO 4 or 500 micrograms of nicotinamide per ml or by growth at 25 or 42 degrees C, but production was significantly decreased by growth in media containing 20 mM MgSO 4 and slightly reduced by growth in media containing 500 micrograms of nicotinic acid per ml. These studies revealed that B. avium is similar to B. pertussis in that both species produce a dermonecrotic toxin and a tracheal cytotoxin and production of dermonecrotic toxin is regulated by nicotinamide and MgSO 4. The presence of dermonecrotic toxin and tracheal cytotoxin in all Bordetella species indicates that these products may be important virulence factors in <b>bordetellosis...</b>|$|E
