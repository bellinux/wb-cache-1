5|$|Hurricane Epsilon was {{the final}} of fifteen {{hurricane}}s within the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November29 about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions unfavorable for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} week of September, a cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States and stalled over the Atlantic Ocean. By September 8, a weak frontal wave began {{developing}} along the cold front. Late on September 9, convection increased over the broad low pressure area, and the overall system intensified <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> upper-level low. Subsequently, the system abandoned its frontal features as its appearance became more circular. With persistent but limited convection near and {{to the west of the}} center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375mi (604km) west-southwest of Bermuda; it was considered subtropical because the upper-circulation was believed to have been cold-core. Operationally, advisories on the system were not initiated until 21hours later.|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in {{civilian}} clothes, where {{they met with}} Generale di Brigata Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy. While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, but {{he was unable to}} negotiate political matters. On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> olive tree at Cassibile, Sicily. In October, Smith traveled to Washington for two weeks to represent Eisenhower in a series of meetings, including one with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York, on 10 October.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted over a weak, but well-defined low-level circulation about 1130km (700mi) {{southeast of}} Diego Garcia. It quickly developed banding features, and organized into a tropical disturbance. Located <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> anticyclone, the system experienced weak vertical wind shear and favorable outflow. With a subtropical ridge to its south, the disturbance tracked quickly westward. Early on February 20, Météo-France (MFR) classified the system as Tropical Depression Ten, {{and later in the}} day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the convection improved significantly in organization. It strengthened further, attaining tropical storm status by 0000UTC on February 21, and six hours later the MFR named the system Gamede while it was about 785km (490mi) south-southwest of Diego Garcia, or about 995km (620mi) northeast of Rodrigues.|$|E
5|$|There were a {{total of}} twelvetropical storms during the season, fiveof which were unnamed. Of all the storms, fourwere hurricanes. Compared to the average {{activity}} from the previous two decades, the season's activity was below normal despite average sea surface temperatures and a normal number of tropical waves. Instead, the inactivity {{was the result of}} the subtropical ridge being located further south than normal, which decreased the atmospheric instability across much of the basin. Such a pattern was different from the more active 1954 and 1955 seasons. Several tropical depressions formed that did not attain tropical storm status, many of which formed <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> unfavorable upper-level trough.|$|E

5|$|Late on December 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather that was located within the South Pacific convergence zone to the northwest of Apia, Samoa. Located <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> anticyclone, the system maintained deep convection near its elongated but well-defined circulation center. Early the next day, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, (RSMC Nadi), started to monitor the area of disturbed weather as Tropical Depression 04F. Over the next two days, the depression moved towards the west, conditions surrounding the depression barely changed {{and as a result}} the depression steadily intensified. Early on December 5, the system had convective bands spiraling into and wrapping tightly around the low level circulation center. As a result of this, the JTWC started advisories on Tropical Cyclone 05P, with winds equivalent to a tropical storm. At 0200UTC, RSMC Nadi reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it as Daman. During that day Daman passed over Rotuma island while gradually intensifying further.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Olga {{were from the}} {{interaction}} of a cold front and a small weather disturbance in the north Atlantic Ocean, producing an extratropical low east of Bermuda on November22; five other tropical cyclones and gales formed {{earlier in the season}} in the same manner. The low gradually intensified, developing an area of convection east of the center and producing a large area of gale force winds. By 0000UTC on November24, the system organized enough to be classified as Subtropical Storm Two, while located about 900mi (1450km) east-southeast of Bermuda. Subsequently, the convection markedly increased and became more concentrated, with hints of an eye feature. Within 12hours of becoming a subtropical, it is estimated the cyclone transitioned into Tropical Storm Olga; however, it was not purely tropical, due to being positioned <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> upper-level low. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not initiate advisories until nine hours later, referring it as Subtropical Storm Two for two more days.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{subsequent}} few days, wind shear caused the convection to wax and wane over Eline's center, limiting the thunderstorms {{to the southern}} periphery. The track shifted more to the west-northwest. On February11, Eline had weakened into a minimal tropical storm according to the MFR, about 1110km (690mi) south of Diego Garcia, and the JTWC operationally downgraded it to a tropical depression. Later that day, however, a decrease in shear allowed thunderstorms to refire. On February13, a weakness in the ridge caused the storm to {{turn back to the}} west-southwest. Moving back <b>beneath</b> <b>an</b> anticyclone, conditions became more favorable for strengthening, allowing outflow and a central dense overcast to form, with the beginnings of an eye feature. Eline quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm late on February13. At 00:00UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded Eline to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). The MFR held off upgrading the storm, due to a passing trough increasing wind shear again. On February14, Eline passed about 85km (55mi) south of St. Brandon, and shortly thereafter resumed its strengthening after the shear dropped. Later that day, the storm bypassed Mauritius about 180km (110mi) to the northwest, with the small structure sparing the island from the strongest winds. Early on February16, Eline attained tropical cyclone status, with 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), while passing about 160km (100mi) northwest of Réunion. This was nine days after it had weakened to tropical storm status the first time.|$|E
