5|$|As a child, Olga was {{described}} as a simple and chubby little girl with a broad face and big blue eyes. Unlike her younger sister, Vera, she had a calm temperament, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> extremely shy. For example, when interrogated by her tutors during lessons, she burst into tears and ran from the classroom.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa {{served in}} the Pacific during World War II. The {{majority}} of her service was in escorting convoys, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> deployed in support of landings around Hollandia and the Wakde in New Guinea. She was attacked on 20 January 1943 by six Japanese bombers. In the short, sharp action which followed, the ship's crew utilized Tulsas 3 in (76 mm) main gun and 20 mm (0.79 in) antiaircraft battery to drive off the attackers with no damage to their ship, while dodging 12 bombs. She was decommissioned on 6 March 1946, and then struck from the navy list on 17 April. In October 1946, she {{was turned over to}} the War Shipping Administration to be broken up. Her 300 lb (136.08 kg) bell was placed in the Naval and Marine Corps Training Center in Tulsa, and fell from its mooring in 1953. This incident led to research on the safety of such heavy bells being used.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} {{isolated}} individuals or small groups were noted in Charleston, Columbia, Orangeburg and Sumter. Other individually traveling {{teachers of the}} religion include Lorol Schopflocher (1933) and Stanwood Cobb (1934) - Cobb stayed for seven talks across some of March and April, and a study group was established thereafter with two established Bahá'ís among the group and they met at the only female physician's home in North Augusta, Marie Kershaw. William and Christine Bidwell, friends of Kershaw having recently moved to the area from Miami where they had joined to the religion, were among {{a total of about}} 17 with more or less identification with the religion and a year later elected their first local spiritual assembly (it bridged North August and Augusta.) Klebs was somewhat distant from the group <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> having medical problems and members of the group tried to help her, as well as the Eliot assembly during her summer there in 1938. She died January 1939 in Augusta.|$|E

[...] She was called [...] "the black woman's poet laureate", and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans. [...] Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl, as described in Caged Bird. [...] According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, literature also affected Angelou's sensibilities as the poet and writer she became, especially the [...] "liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon".|$|E

500|$|Obama {{campaigned for}} her husband's {{re-election}} in 2012. [...] Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active {{than she had}} been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid. By {{the time of the}} election cycle, she had developed a more open public image, some viewing her as the most popular member of the Obama administration, as her poll numbers having never dropped below 60% since entering the White House and an Obama senior campaign official even dubbed her [...] "the most popular political figure in America". The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was using her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was viewed as a polarizing figure, having both [...] "sharp enmity and deep loyalty" [...] from Americans, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> seen as having improved her image since the time of the last election when her husband initially ran for the presidency. It was commented by Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast that her style changed {{over the course of the}} campaign to sensitive and economical.|$|E
500|$|Allegra was {{the product}} of a {{short-lived}} affair between the Romantic poet and her starstruck teenage mother, who was living in reduced circumstances in the household of her stepsister and brother-in-law. Clairmont wrote to Byron during the pregnancy begging him to write back and promise {{to take care of her}} and the baby; however, Byron ignored her pleas. After her birth, she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin. A few months later the Shelleys and Clairmont took the baby back as an [...] "adopted" [...] child. Clairmont bonded with her baby daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close, physical connection with little Allegra, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep the baby with her. The Shelleys were fond of Allegra, but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley had fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Clairmont leaked out. William Godwin, Mary's father and Clairmont's stepfather, had immediately leaped to that conclusion when he learned of Allegra's birth. In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra, but was fond of his baby sister Clara. She saw her son's reaction to Allegra, who was no blood relation to him, as [...] "an argument in favor of those who advocate instinctive natural affection". In addition, the Shelleys were constantly in debt and Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister, who had too close a relationship with her husband, to leave her house.|$|E

Her {{scholarly}} work was often cited by the Court and in legislative debate. Law professor Sylvia A.

2500|$|Whistler's {{lover and}} model for The White Girl, Joanna Hiffernan, also posed for Gustave Courbet. Historians {{speculate}} that Courbet's erotic painting {{of her as}} L'Origine du monde led to {{the breakup of the}} friendship between Whistler and Courbet. During the 1870s and much of the 1880s, he lived with his model-mistress Maud Franklin. [...] Her ability to endure his long, repetitive sittings helped Whistler develop his portrait skills. He not only made several excellent portraits of her <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a helpful stand-in for other sitters.|$|E
2500|$|A small {{minority}} of modern authors consider it possible that Kelly was not {{a victim of the}} same killer as the other Whitechapel murders.

The mutilations inflicted on Kelly [...] were far more extensive than those on other victims, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the only one killed in the privacy of a room instead of outdoors. Her murder was separated by five weeks from the previous killings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this new}} location, the local {{residents}} occasionally hurled s at the pupils, calling them [...] "dirty Jerries". When the 1944 film Henry V was showing {{at the local}} cinema, Essinger did not let Bunce Courtians go, in part because she'd been warned that the first newsreel reports from Bergen-Belsen concentration camp would be shown and she didn't want her pupils to realize why they had not heard from their parents, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> worried that harm would come to them {{at the hands of}} some of the locals.|$|E

2500|$|Highsmith {{described}} {{herself as}} a social democrat. She believed in American democratic ideals and in [...] "the promise" [...] of U.S. history, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{highly critical of the}} reality of the country's 20th-century culture and foreign policy. Tales of Natural and Unnatural Catastrophes, her 1987 anthology of short stories, was notoriously anti-American, and she often cast her homeland in a deeply unflattering light. Beginning in 1963, she resided exclusively in Europe. She retained her United States citizenship, despite the tax penalties, of which she complained bitterly while living for many years in France and Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 {{she was a}} {{guest speaker}} at the Library of Congress, giving a speech {{entitled}} [...] "Dare to be Creative!"

2500|$|In fact, the two {{carriers}} then {{operating with}} the Pacific Fleet, Enterprise and Lexington, were on missions to deliver fighters to Wake and Midway Islands, which were intended {{in part to}} protect the route used by planes (including B-17s) bound for the Philippines.

In fact, Enterprise had been scheduled to be back on December 6, but was delayed by weather.

2500|$|Wray {{never said}} {{anything}} to suggest that she knew why she had been called into this meeting, other than that {{it had something to}} do with Paulette Goddard, who was lined up to play Lucrezia Borgia, and that there was some connection to Dalton Trumbo's troubles. Dalton Trumbo's troubles were that The Hollywood Reporter had publicly named him and a dozen or so other industry professionals as communist sympathizers, and that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) had seized upon this list as the starting point for their investigation into communist influence in Hollywood. [...] Paulette Goddard was a rising star at Paramount and the studio was heavily invested in her, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> at risk of being swept into the HUAC's investigation by virtue of her marriage to actor Burgess Meredith, whose communist affiliations were a matter of record.|$|E
2500|$|Gilman {{argued that}} women's {{contributions}} to civilization, throughout history, have been halted {{because of an}} androcentric culture. She believed that womankind was the underdeveloped half of humanity, and improvement was necessary to prevent {{the deterioration of the}} human race. Gilman believed economic independence {{is the only thing that}} could really bring freedom for women, and make them equal to men. In 1898 she published Women and Economics, a theoretical treatise which argued, among other things, that women are subjugated by men, that motherhood should not preclude a woman from working outside the home, and that housekeeping, cooking, and child care, would be professionalized. [...] "The ideal woman," [...] Gilman wrote, [...] "was not only assigned a social role that locked her into her home, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> expected to like it, to be cheerful and gay, smiling and good-humored." [...] When the sexual-economic relationship ceases to exist, life on the domestic front would certainly improve, as frustration in relationships often stems from the lack of social contact that the domestic wife has with the outside world.|$|E
2500|$|Empress Dowager Hu was {{considered}} intelligent, capable of understanding many things quickly, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> overly lenient and tolerant of corruption. [...] For example, in winter 515, the corrupt governor of Qi Province (岐州, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Yuan Mi (元謐) the Prince of Zhao, provoked a popular uprising when he killed several people without reason, {{and while he}} was relieved from his post, as soon as he returned to the capital Luoyang, Empress Dowager Hu made him a minister because his wife was her niece. [...] In Yuan Xu's childhood, Empress Dowager Hu's power, during these few years, were unchallenged, and while she tolerated—and, in certain circumstances, encouraged—criticism, including rewarding such officials as Yuan Kuang (元匡) the Prince of Dongping and Zhang Puhui (張普惠) for their blunt words, she was slow to implement suggestions that would curb corruption. [...] Empress Dowager Hu was a devout Buddhist, and during this part of the regency, she built magnificent temples in Luoyang. [...] One she built, dedicated to her father Hu Guozhen, whom she had created the Duke of Qin, after his death in 518, was particularly beautiful. [...] Because of her influence, Emperor Xiaoming also became a dedicated Buddhist.|$|E
