[...] "I find it hard to keep warm on dark days," [...] he explained. [...] "I guess my old heart is getting tired," [...] and as he spoke I thought of the strain which that brave heart had undergone in its eighty years of action, on the battlefield, along the river, in the logging camps, and throughout all the stern, unceasing years of labor on the farm. His tireless energy and his indomitable spirit came <b>back,</b> <b>filling</b> my mind with pictures of his swift and graceful use of axe and scythe, and when I spoke of the early days, he found it difficult to reply--they were so beautiful in retrospect.|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not come}} to herself, as it were, for several minutes, and then feeling she 'could no longer bear the cab, stopped it, and got out. Where was she? Bond Street! She began, idly, {{wandering}} down its narrow length; the fullest street by day, the emptiest by night. Oh! it had been horrible! Nothing said by any of them--nothing, and yet everything dragged out--of him, of Leila, of herself! She seemed to have no pride or decency left, {{as if she had been}} caught stealing. All her happy exhilaration was gone, leaving a miserable recklessness. Nothing she did was right, nothing turned out well, so what did it all matter? The moonlight flooding down between the tall houses gave her a peculiar heady feeling. [...] "Fey" [...] her father had called her. She laughed. 'But I'm not going home,' she thought. Bored with the street's length; she turned off, and was suddenly in Hanover Square. There was the Church, grey-white, where she had been bridesmaid to a second cousin, when she was fifteen. She seemed to see it all again--her frock, the lilies in her hand, the surplices of the choir, the bride's dress, all moonlight-coloured, and unreal. 'I wonder what's become of her!' she thought. 'He's dead, I expect, like Cyril!' She saw her father's face as he was marrying them, heard his voice: [...] "For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part." [...] And the moonlight on the Church seemed to shift and quiver-some pigeons perhaps had been disturbed up there. Then instead of that wedding vision, she saw Monsieur Barra, sitting on his chair, gazing at the floor, and Chica nursing her doll. [...] "All mad, mademoiselle, a little mad. Millions of men with white souls, but all a little tiny bit mad, you know." [...] Then Leila's face came before her, with that look in her eyes. She felt again the hot clasp of Fort's fingers on her wrist, and walked on, rubbing it with the other hand. She turned into Regent Street. The wide curve of the Quadrant swept into a sky of unreal blue, and the orange-shaded lamps merely added to the unreality. 'Love and Chinese lanterns! I should like some coffee,' she thought suddenly. She was quite close to the place where Lavendie had taken her. Should she go in there? Why not? She must go somewhere. She turned into the revolving cage of glass. But no sooner was she imprisoned there than in a flash Lavendie's face of disgust; and the red-lipped women, the green stuff that smelled of peppermint came <b>back,</b> <b>filling</b> her with a rush of dismay. She made the full circle in the revolving cage; and came out into the street again with a laugh. A tall young man in khaki stood there: [...] "Hallo!" [...] he said. [...] "Come in and dance!" [...] She started, recoiled from him and began to walk away as fast as ever she could. She passed a woman whose eyes seemed to scorch her. A woman like a swift vision of ruin with those eyes, and thickly powdered cheeks, and loose red mouth. Noel shuddered and fled along, feeling that her only safety lay in speed. But she could not walk about all night. There would be no train for Kestrel till the morning--and did she really want to go there, and eat her heart out? Suddenly she thought of George. Why should she not go down to him? He would know what was best for her to do. At the foot of the steps below the Waterloo Column she stood still. All was quiet there and empty, the great buildings whitened, the trees blurred and blue; and sweeter air was coming across their flowering tops. The queer [...] "fey" [...] moony sensation was still with her; so that she felt small and light, as if she could have floated through a ring. Faint rims of light showed round the windows of the Admiralty. The war! However lovely the night, however sweet the lilac smelt-that never stopped! She turned away and passed out under the arch, making for the station. The train of the wounded had just come in, and she stood in the cheering crowd watching the ambulances run out. Tears of excited emotion filled her eyes, and trickled down. Steady, smooth, grey, one after the other they came gliding, with a little burst of cheers greeting each one. All were gone now, and she could pass in. She went to the buffet and got a large cup of coffee, and a bun. Then, having noted the time of her early morning train, she sought the ladies' waiting-room, and sitting down in a corner, took out her purse and counted her money. Two pounds fifteen-enough to go to the hotel, if she liked. But, without luggage--it was so conspicuous, and she could sleep in this corner all right, if she wanted. What did girls do who had no money, and no friends to go to? Tucked away in the corner of that empty, heavy, varnished room, she seemed to see the cruelty and hardness of life as she had never before seen it, not even when facing her confinement. How lucky she had been, and was! Everyone was good to her. She had no real want or dangers, to face. But, for women--yes, and men too--who had no one to fall back on, nothing but their own hands and health and luck, it must be awful. That girl whose eyes had scorched her--perhaps she had no one--nothing. And people who were born ill, and the millions of poor women, like those whom she had gone visiting with Gratian sometimes in the poorer streets of her father's parish--for the first time she seemed to really know and feel the sort of lives they led. And then, Leila's face came back to her once more--Leila whom she had robbed. And the worst of it was, that, alongside her remorseful sympathy, she felt a sort of satisfaction. She could not help his not loving Leila, she could not help it if he loved herself! And he did--she knew it! To feel that anyone loved her was so comforting. But it was all awful! And she--the cause of it! And yet--she had never done or said anything to attract him. No! She could not have helped it.|$|E

50|$|The town of Hempstead {{grew and}} {{expanded}} around this excavation until within a radius of 3500 feet there were 2200 homes and four public schools. In 1945 the town enacted Ordinance No. 16 {{in an attempt}} to regulate mining excavations within its limits. This ordinance provided that such pits must be enclosed by a wire fence and must comply with berm and slope requirements. Goldblatt complied with this ordinance but in 1956 the town sought an injunction against further excavation as being in violation of a zoning ordinance. The town's zoning case failed because Goldblatt was found to be conducting prior non-conforming use on the premises. In 1958 the town amended Ordinance No.16 to prohibit any excavating below the water table and to require <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> of any excavation below that level. This amendment also made the berm, slope and fence requirements more stringent.|$|E
50|$|Water gushing {{downward}} through strudel produces scour depressions in the seabed. This {{occurs at}} shallow water levels, within the two-meter bathymetry contour, {{and up to}} 8 meters. The depth of these depressions may reach 6 meters or more. This depends {{on a number of}} factors: seabed properties, water depth, flow velocity, flow duration and size and shape of the orifice. The width of individual strudel scours are generally in the order of 10-20 meters. An excavation rate of 2.5 km−2y−1 has been reported, as well as complete <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> by sediments within 2-3 years. Such rapid filling rates imply that most strudel scours are recent events. Strudel scours present risks to submarine pipelines if water action removes the soil from below a pipe segment such that it becomes a free span. The consequences include: vortex-induced oscillation, lateral buckling and overstress due to self-weight. Moreover, the presence of a pipeline may conceivably promote the generation of strudel because of the heat generated by this structure, which may thin and thus weaken the ice above it.|$|E

50|$|Mundee {{signed for}} Division Two club Brentford on non-contract terms on 12 August 1993. The move reunited Mundee with Stuart Morgan, then Brentford's youth team manager, whom Mundee had played under {{earlier in his}} career at Weymouth. Mundee had been a {{transfer}} target of former manager Phil Holder during the 1992-93 season, but the move broke down. Mundee began life at Griffin Park under David Webb as a right <b>back,</b> <b>filling</b> in for the injured Brian Statham. After a training ground bust-up between Mickey Bennett and Joe Allon (which resulted in a broken jaw for Allon), Mundee was moved up front. The high-point of Mundee's Brentford career came in a home match against Bristol Rovers in January 1994, in which he scored a hattrick in a 4-3 defeat. He finished the 1993-94 season as Brentford's second-leading goalscorer, with 13 goals. Now behind the 'FT Index' (Nicky Forster and Robert Taylor) in the pecking order up front, Mundee was a regular off the bench {{in the first half}} of the 1994-95 season, before finally breaking into the starting line-up in November 1994. He made 45 appearances and scored five goals during a frustrating season, in which the Bees finished second in Division Two, only to be forced to settle for a playoff place due to the reduction in size of the Premier League and its effect on the league pyramid. Brentford lost on penalties to Huddersfield Town in the semi-finals, with Mundee missing his spot kick.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} Wednesday O'Callaghan was on {{the bench}} as Stoke struggled to break down a resolute Hull City and with time running out and Stoke winning a corner Durban decided to bring O'Callaghan on for his début. From the resulting corner he headed past Eddie Blackburn to make him an instant hero (fastest debut goal). He ended the 1977-78 season with six goals and was top-scorer in 1978-79 with 16 as Stoke won promotion to the First Division. With Stoke making a slow start in 1980-81 Durban moved O'Callaghan, who had lost his place to the younger Lee Chapman, to centre <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> in for the injured Denis Smith. He adapted well and his partnership with Mike Doyle saw Stoke in to a final mid-table position of 11th. He began the 1981-82 season in defence before reverting to forward in January 1982 where he scored five goals and he again scored five in 1982-83. He struggled under Richie Barker's long ball tactics in 1983-84 and he handed in a transfer request but Barker was sacked and replaced by Bill Asprey and so O'Callaghan stayed at Stoke. Under Asprey Stoke staged a relegation survival but in 1984-85 Stoke were awful and {{well on their way}} to an embarrassing relegation so O'Callaghan moved on to Oldham Athletic for £30,000 after making 294 appearances for Stoke scoring 47 goals. In the first match of the 1985-86 he suffered an adductor muscle strain which caused him to retire on the advice of doctors.|$|E
50|$|The Martz variant is a {{much more}} robust offense with a more complex playbook. It {{is a much}} more {{aggressive}} passing offense, frequently deploying pre-snap motion and shifts, with the run often forgotten. There is much less of a focus on play action. The Martz variant favors an elusive feature back, such as Marshall Faulk, who can catch the ball, over the power runners the Turner scheme favors. Martz credits his influences on his variation of the offensive system to Sid Gillman and Don Coryell. Martz learned the so-called 3 digit system the offense is famous for with how the plays are called from Turner when they were both in Washington. The Rams set a new NFL record for total offensive yards in 2000, with 7,335. 5,492 of those were passing yards, also a new NFL team record. Martz tends to favor a 3 WR set with more elusive players, a third receiver and the Half <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> the role of middle receivers that TEs & FBs fulfill in the Turner offense. The Martz offense works best with two elite WRs with top speed. Unlike the Turner variant, due to the complexity of the Martz offense, the QBs who execute it best are often the more intelligent QBs who intuitively get what Martz is trying to do, not the elite athlete whose team's personnel department might favor drafting with a high draft pick. Whether it is due to the personality of the coach or the nature of the scheme, the Martz variant has historically had problems when teams shut down the run and make the team one-dimensional. Additionally, the QBs sometimes take a lot of hits in this system.|$|E

40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>filling</b> of mine voids is {{mandatory}} to avoid subsequent ground stability {{problems in the}} form of subsidence. Mill tailings and river sand are being extensively used since a long time as mine <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> materials. However strict regulation and unavailability of river sand has created a huge problem for mining industry in India. The need to develop alternative engineering material which can substitute sand has gained prominence. Large quantities of fly ash discharged from coal-fired power stations are a major problem {{not only in terms of}} scarcity of land available for its disposal, but also in psychology as well as environmental aspects. Amount of fly ash available can be recycled, mainly by adding fly ash to cement. However, the addition of fly ash to cement is limited because the production rate of cement is limited, and also the concentration of fly ash in cement is limited. In the present study three fly ash composite materials (FCMs) were developed from the fly ash obtained from a nearby captive thermal unit. The main constituent of the composite were fly ash, lime, gypsum and cement. Detailed physical and engineering properties were determined for the FCMs. Significant increases in the compressive strength were obtained after 28 days of curing time and it was observed that the fly-ash composite developed has potential to be used as substitute to sand for <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> the mine voids...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a task scheduling algorithm for grid services with improved resource utilization, fault tolerance capability and to avoid deadlocks. The algorithm simulated using GridSim toolkit, which is used to measure the effectiveness of scheduling and related algorithms in grid environments with reduced complexity than the real imple-mentation. Two advanced methods, Two Phase Commit Protocol with novel <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> Technique (TPCNBF) and Two Phase Commit Protocol with novel <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> technique and task migration (TPCNBFM) were developed to schedule the tasks. The backfilling technique is used to improve resource utilization and fault tolerance in job scheduling. Two phase commit protocol prevents deadlocks in task scheduling. Fault tolerance in task scheduling is improved by task migration to protect tasks from any resource failure. TPCNBF and TPCNBFM methods give higher performance improvement than the current method called Cost Driven Work Flow Scheduling (CDWFS). In this method, the scheduling is based on deadline and the resource status. The experimental results showed that the TPCNBF and TPCNBFM have less makespan, cost, high success rate and throughput. The new algorithm can be used to schedule computing intensive tasks in grid services like Astronomy, high energy physics with deadlock avoidance, fault tolerance and improved resource utilization...|$|E
