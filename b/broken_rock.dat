It {{occupies}} talus piles (collection of <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> pieces at the base of cliffs, volcanoes, or valley shoulders, accumulated due to periodic rockfall from adjacent cliff faces) with larger stones and rocky areas although it does not inhabit swampy montane tundra or talus lacking vegetation. It may also live in burrows under tree roots or in old moss-scree.|$|E
25|$|Regolith is a {{layer of}} loose, {{heterogeneous}} superficial material covering solid rock. It includes dust, soil, <b>broken</b> <b>rock,</b> and other related materials and is present on Earth, the Moon, Mars, some asteroids, and other terrestrial planets and moons.|$|E
25|$|Hydrothermal breccias usually form at shallow crustal levels (<1nbsp&km) between 150 and 350nbsp&°C, when seismic or {{volcanic}} activity causes a void to open along a fault deep underground. The void draws in hot water, and as {{pressure in the}} cavity drops, the water violently boils. In addition, the sudden opening of a cavity causes rock {{at the sides of}} the fault to destabilise and implode inwards, and the <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> gets caught up in a churning mixture of rock, steam and boiling water. Rock fragments collide with each other and the sides of the void, and the angular fragments become more rounded. Volatile gases are lost to the steam phase as boiling continues, in particular carbon dioxide. As a result, the chemistry of the fluids changes and ore minerals rapidly precipitate. Breccia-hosted ore deposits are quite common.|$|E

25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> (fault breccia and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities. The metal content {{is believed to have}} been leached out of rocks of the Skiddaw Group, or the underlying granite batholith. The mineralisation of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (barium sulphate) in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E

500|$|A snake {{of forest}} or woodland, {{it is the}} only one of Africa's cobras that will live in high forest. The forest cobras are snakes that are well adapted to many environments and the habitat of the forest cobra is {{strongly}} dependent on what part of its African range the snake originates from. Forest cobras originating in the southern African regions are typically found in savanna and grassland, but they can also be found in <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> country. They are mainly found in the tropical and subtropical rainforest regions of west and central Africa. It also inhabits mangroves in western Africa. The banded form of forest cobra in west Africa lives in savanna and grassland (but usually along streams) and well vegetated areas, especially riverine forest, up to latitude 14 N. The species' preferred habitat are lowland forest and moist savanna where it favours coastal thickets. This snake seems to be highly adaptable and will readily move into drier areas if it can. In western Kenya, the forest cobra has been found in wide stretched grassland areas. The population of forest cobras in Uganda are almost always found close to water. The brown colour phase occurs in coastal and high altitude forest, woodland and thicket, and grassland areas (i.e. Nyanga, Zimbabwe). Due to its secretive habits, and fondness for living in holes, it often persists in quite well-inhabited areas, common in and around many central African towns, even long after most vegetation has gone. They are also found on fruit plantations where they live in the trees. It occurs through a wide altitude range, from sea-level to forested mountains at [...] above sea-level.|$|E
2500|$|General fill {{material}} {{should be free}} of organics, meet minimum California bearing ratio (CBR) results and have a low plasticity index. The lower fill generally comprises sand or a sand-rich mixture with fine gravel, which acts as an inhibitor {{to the growth of}} plants or other vegetable matter. The compacted fill also serves as lower-stratum drainage. Select second fill (sieved) should be composed of gravel, decomposed rock or <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> below a specified particle size and be free of large lumps of clay. Sand clay fill may also be used. [...] The roadbed must be [...] "proof rolled" [...] after each layer of fill is compacted. [...] If a roller passes over an area without creating visible deformation or spring the section is deemed to comply. (pp. 70–72 [...] ) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Russian River, {{with its}} mouth {{at the north}} end of Goat Rock Beach, is Sonoma County's largest watercourse, both in flow rate and lineal extent. Immediately beyond the Russian River {{discharge}} to the Pacific Ocean is the coastal town of Jenner. North of the mouth of the Russian River is Jenner Beach. Goat Rock protrudes into the Pacific at the south end of Goat Rock Beach. Visitors can access the base of Goat Rock via a low lying isthmus of land which has been appropriated by the State as a parking area. The almost sheer cliffs of Goat Rock are virtually impossible to scale or to circumnavigate; in fact, signage is posted prohibiting either activity. [...] There is considerable sloughing of <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> from these vertical surfaces of Goat Rock. Blind Beach is situated immediately south of Goat Rock Beach, the two beaches being separated by Goat Rock itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The gas seepage {{characteristics}} of four kinds of <b>broken</b> <b>rocks</b> of different gradations {{and the relationship}} between the capping height and the porosity were studied by means of the simulation experiment and the theoretical analysis. The results show that the air flow in the capping layer composed of <b>broken</b> <b>rocks</b> is in the non-Darcy state which can be described as Forchheimer equation and Ergun equation. Moreover, {{on the basis of the}} experimental data, the relational expressions between the permeability, the non-Darcy β factor and the porosity were determined. Through the numerical fitting, the equation of the minimum capping height and the porosity was ultimately derived, which provided the basis and the reference for the determination of capping height and the air leakage control of mine...|$|R
