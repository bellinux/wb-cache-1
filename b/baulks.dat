Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from <b>baulks</b> of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections.|$|E

The soldiers at one double slipway, he discovered, had plotted with bandits to wreck heavy imperial barges {{so that they}} could steal the spilled grain. In 984 Qiao installed a pair of sluice-gates two hundred and fifty feet apart, the entire structure roofed over like a building. By siting two staunch gates so close by one another, Qiao had created a short stretch of canal, effectively a pound-lock, filled from the canal above by raising individual wooden <b>baulks</b> in the top gate and emptied into the canal below by lowering <b>baulks</b> in the top gate and raising ones in the lower.|$|E
25|$|In 1802 {{there was}} a partial failure, {{probably}} due to the sides bowing and transferring too much weight to the base where they joined to the deck. After remedial work it failed again in 1812 and was reinforced with timber <b>baulks.</b> Although plans were prepared for replacement in stone, it survived until 1930, when the bottom plates were replaced by a wooden base, which was sealed by puddling.|$|E

500|$|For the {{permanent}} way Brunel {{decided to use}} a light bridge rail continuously supported on thick timber <b>baulks,</b> known as [...] "baulk road". Thinner timber transoms were used to keep the <b>baulks</b> the correct distance apart. This produced a smoother track and the whole assembly proved cheaper than using conventional sleepers for broad-gauge track, although this advantage was lost with standard- or mixed-gauge lines because of the higher ratio of timber to length of line. More conventional track forms were later used, although baulk road could still be seen in sidings {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the {{permanent}} way was a departure from that of London's previous tube railways, which used track laid on timber <b>baulks</b> across the tunnel with {{the bottom of the}} tube left open. This approach caused what the BS's management regarded as an unacceptable level of vibrations. They resolved this by mounting the sleepers on supports made of sand and cement grout, with the sleeper ends resting on comparatively soft broken stone ballast underneath the running rails. A drain ran parallel with the rails underneath the middle of the track. The rails themselves were unusually short– only [...] long– as this was the maximum length that could be brought in through the shafts and then turned horizontally to be carried into the tunnels. Power was supplied through third (positive) and fourth (negative) rails laid in the middle and outside of the track, as used on the District Railway.|$|E

The table usually has a slate base, covered in green baize. At one end of the table (the <b>baulk</b> end) is the <b>baulk</b> line, which is 29 in from the <b>baulk</b> cushion (the short cushion at the <b>baulk</b> end). A semicircle of radius 11+1/2 in, called the D, is drawn behind this line, centred on the middle of the line. The cushion {{at the other end of}} the table is known as the top cushion.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Baulk</b> road used a {{lightweight}} form of bridge rail. The rail was continuously {{supported by a}} <b>baulk</b> of timber running longitudinally. Because of the continuous support the rail {{did not need to}} behave as a girder and so could be lighter. The <b>baulk</b> road was pioneered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the Great Western Railway which was built to a gauge of [...] The length of convention sleepers would therefore have to be 50% longer and hence more expensive.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1993 deck renovation, two 18-inch-deep troughs were {{discovered}} recessed into the granite deck stones running {{the entire length}} of the viaduct and spaced at standard gauge width ( [...] inches). [...] The troughs contained longitudinal <b>baulks</b> and were part of the original construction. [...] The [...] supported the rails without the need for transoms as the gauge was maintained by the longitudinal troughs. [...] This is the only known instance of transomless <b>baulks</b> recessed in granite slabs; the original tracks before and after the viaduct used <b>baulks</b> making the B originally a baulk railroad. [...] A 1910 photo taken atop the viaduct shows dirt between the cross ties and tracks, so this material may have been used before traditional gravel ballast.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Baulks</b> {{were used}} to support strap rails or bridge rail. [...] These early rails would have been {{replaced}} with flanged T-rails by 1840. [...] These photos show <b>baulks</b> at Canton Junction in 1871. [...] An 1829 report from the Massachusetts Board of Directors of Internal Improvements describes how the railroad from Boston to Providence was to be built. [...] The report states, [...] "It consists of one pair of tracks composed of long blocks of granite, about one foot square, resting upon a foundation wall extending to the depth of ' {{below the surface of}} the ground, and 2' wide at the bottom". [...] The report also calls for using horse-drawn wagons and carriages at 3 MPH on the rail line, not steam locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|... 28 September 1887. An {{up train}} derailed {{just on the}} Londonderry side of the Bann bridge at Coleraine. During his investigation, Colonel Rich found that the track was old and the ballast to be of poor quality.

5000|$|<b>Baulking</b> Green was a {{chestnut}} gelding British steeplechaser, sired by Coup de Myth out of Nicotine Nelly by Irish Trout. [...] He was foaled in 1952, {{and throughout}} his racing {{career in the}} 1960s he was owned by Jim Reade. He was usually ridden by George Small, and after the 1962 season was trained by Tim Forster. He raced in point-to-points and hunter 'chases; {{to be eligible for}} these races, he was qualified with the Old Berkshire Hunt. During his career, <b>Baulking</b> Green drew attention to the tiny village of <b>Baulking,</b> Oxfordshire (until 1974 part of Berkshire).|$|R

2500|$|Wooding up {{could be}} dangerous, as the wood was split into large <b>baulks</b> and {{generally}} {{had to be}} carried up a narrow gangplank on to the steamer. [...] Loss of life could occur if a crew man fell into the river while wooding up. [...] In an accident in early October 1878, most of the crew of Orient were thrown into the water while wooding up when a wharf depot gave way. [...] No one was drowned, but one crewman sustained injuries from being struck by {{a large piece of}} wood.|$|E
2500|$|... 1860 - 25 {{years after}} its construction, the {{increased}} traffic between Boston and Providence made the need for double tracking necessary. [...] The roadbed was built wide enough to accommodate two sets of tracks, but only one set was originally installed. [...] To accommodate the second track the granite parapets were removed. [...] The parapets were 36" [...] high × 12" [...] wide topped with 8" [...] high × 18" [...] wide coping for a total height of 3'-8". [...] The Dedication Stone was tossed off the viaduct and lay broken in a field for 18 years. [...] The Dedication Stone is the only known remnant of the parapets. [...] It is not known if any stones fell into the river during this renovation. [...] These stones {{may have been used}} in railroad projects or as mile markers or building foundations and walls in Canton. [...] The granite parapets were replaced with a heavy cantilevered wooden fence fastened to transverse wooden floor beams. [...] A hard pine curb was bolted {{at the edges of the}} deck to retain the new ballast. [...] The deck troughs and <b>baulks</b> were abandoned at this time, and the troughs were filled in with stone. [...] The timber approach structures would have been removed at this time to accommodate the double tracking. [...] Although the viaduct was able to accommodate two sets of tracks it was not the original design intent due to a single set of longitudinal troughs, the weak deck arches, and the narrow width of the deck - the outer rails of each set of tracks are above the deck's edge.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{disastrous}} {{failure of the}} mid-June convoys, it was wondered if Malta could hold out on the meagre supplies rescued from [...] "Harpoon" [...] and [...] "Vigorous" [...] until another convoy could be organised. Escorting merchant ships in the brilliance of a Mediterranean moonlit period was courting inevitable disaster. This situation limited operations {{in the immediate future}} to the moonless period in July or August between the 10th and 16th of those months. July passed as the Ohio could not be fitted-out in time. Once the due planning had been carried out it was decided to begin the operation in August. Ohio steamed down to Dunglass on the Clyde and loaded 11,500 tons of kerosene and diesel fuel oils. She was the only ship carrying these supplies which were so vital to Malta's survival. Before she sailed special strengthening was given to the tanker to protect her against the shock of bombs exploding near her. In the previous convoy, the tanker Kentucky had been sunk with only a few hours' repair work needed on a steam pipe, which had been broken by the force of such explosions. The Ministry was determined that this should not happen again, and so Ohios engines were mounted on rubber bearings, to reduce shock, and all steam pipes were supported with steel springs and <b>baulks</b> of timber. While the merchant ships were gathering in the Clyde Estuary, the naval forces had already reached Scapa Flow. Admiral Syfret joined [...] there on 27 July and held a convoy conference on 2 August; the same day, all leave had been stopped. At eight o'clock that evening, two hours before dusk, the convoy sailed. The fourteen ships, led by [...] formed up, it was dark {{by the time they reached}} the open sea.|$|E

For <b>baulk</b> road this meant laying an additional longitudinal between the existing two (one rail was common to both gauges), but this significantly increased the cost and complexity of the track compared to cross-sleepers.|$|R
