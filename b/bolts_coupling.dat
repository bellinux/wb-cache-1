50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on necks. Real bolted joints (i.e., using <b>bolt</b> <b>coupled</b> with a nut) exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars. However, at least one aftermarket manufacturer offers a replacement for Fender neckplates and screws that uses captive inserts—embedded in the guitar body {{by means of an}} external self-tapping thread — and M4 machine screws. The maker claims this permits a higher fastening torque than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|R

40|$|Early {{failures}} {{occurred with}} two sizes of wheel bolts used for attaching front wheels and dual rear wheels to heavy truck hubs. Failure resulted in fracture of the bolts, {{and was a}} response to the material and process specification which produced a steel microstructure highly susceptible to hydrogen-assisted stress cracking.

The structural analysis procedure will be presented: creating the 3 D model, configuring the mesh, applying the restraints, applying the loads (torque), applying the interaction conditions (driving flange-bolts and nuts, bolts and nuts-driven flange), running {{the numerical analysis}} and results visualization. Two different systems will be analyzed: {{the first is a}} six <b>bolts</b> flange <b>coupling</b> working in nominal conditions, the second is a five <b>bolts</b> flange <b>coupling</b> working in some failure conditions with only five bolts distributed in a six holes flange coupling. In certain conditions the flange coupling design allows the same torque to be transmitted by six, but also by only five bolts. However, the non-uniformity of the five bolts distribution around the six holes flanges will generate some other unwanted phenomena. In this case all the stress and deformations will be non-symmetrically and for the flange coupling that is a rotating coupling this can be one reason for beats phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) tokamak {{requires}} an electrical power up {{to a few}} hundred MVA for a time period of 10 – 20 s. The power and energy is provided by three separate networks based on flywheel generators. In 1999, during a routine check performed on generator EZ 3, {{it was discovered that}} <b>coupling</b> <b>bolts</b> of the flywheel generator shaft were deformed. Given that the active load of the generator (~ 100 MW) in service is well below the design value of the shaft (~ 800 MW), the damages may only be explained by a torsional resonance of the shaft line, itself excited by active power transients from the converter loads. A value of 23. 6 Hz was calculated for the first eigen-frequency of the shaft line. Frequencies between 10 and 30 Hz have been identified in the spectrum of the load curves. Since torsional shaft oscillations are characterised by very low damping, torsional resonance can become dangerous even for over-dimensioned generator shafts. Therefore, a novel `torque' measurement system was installed. The paper presents results from calculations and measurements showing that devices capable to measure the stress in the shaft line are essential for generator protection in feedback controlled fusion experiments...|$|R

In order to reduce the calculation cost of the finite element analysis and the fatigue life prediction, a so-called <b>coupled</b> <b>bolt</b> model was applied and stress severity factor approach was applied to assess the fatigue life of the connection. After the optimization, the weight of the optimized result was only 85. 9 % of the initial design and the fatigue life of the structure satisfied the constraint condition.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 121 - 138 In {{rotating}} equipment, torque {{is usually}} transmitted from shafts to coupling hubs through keys, splines, friction, {{or a combination}} of these. Not covered in this tutorial are applications where the rotating equipment has integral flanges that <b>bolt</b> to the <b>coupling.</b> The type of interface, the fit, and materials used are dependent on the criticality of the equipment. Equipment can be classified into general purpose and special purpose. General purpose equipment includes machines such as pumps that are spared. If they fail or require maintenance the operation does not shut down or slow down. In contrast special purpose equipment (compressor, generator) is critical to the process and if it is unavailable the entire plant might slow down, shut down, or might incur a safety incident or environmental incidence. Generally special purpose equipment and more sophistication is justified {{in the design of the}} interface. The type of interface has also a lot to do with several other issues, including: ?	Ease of assembly/disassembly ?	Reliability of connection ?	How much torque can be transmitted ?	Field conditions Most commonly for general purpose equipment keys with setscrews are used on a small horsepower applications. For larger horsepower applications keys with interference bores are common. For critical equipment the most common interface is keys with interference. As the application gets more critical and power dense, keyless shrink drives and integral flanges become common. Tight fitted splines are common in aircraft derivative gas turbines. The various types are covered in some detail for general purpose and special purpose applications. Covered also is how to assemble some of the most common types. Other issues such as who should bore the couplings, how does one fit bores and keys, and what needs to be considered when specifying interfaces is discussed. They types of couplings that are used on general purpose applications versus special purpose applications are discussed first...|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} of current aircraft turbofan engines consists of multi-stage assemblies {{resulting from the}} coupling of bladed disks by means of bolted flange joints. The efficiency of such systems in real working condition is strictly related to the dynamic properties of blades and disks constituting them. According to the current design practices, blades and disks are designed so that their weights are reduced and their slenderness increased. Therefore, latest generation turbofan engine thus result much more sensible to mechanical vibrations that may cause failure by high cycle fatigue phenomena. For these reasons robust computational techniques and innovative measurement systems have become necessary tools for the design and validation of multi-stage bladed disks assemblies, {{in order to preserve}} their structural integrity while operating in real working conditions. The topics developed in this Ph. D. thesis concern aspects of linear and non-linear dynamics in the turbomachinery field and give a series of important guidelines for the study of multi-stage bladed disks systems from both a numerical and experimental point of view. The research activity has been mainly focused on the following two topics: 1. Development of reduced order model techniques for the prediction of forced response of multi-stage bladed disk assemblies. The main challenge associated with modeling multi-stage assemblies is strictly related to the possible different cyclic symmetry characterizing the coupled stages. In such case a sector representative of the whole multi-stage system does not exist in general and typical dynamic calculations based on cyclic constraints can not be performed {{as in the case of}} single bladed disks. Therefore, two novel reduced order model techniques for multi-stage systems have been developed in order to overcome the mentioned drawback while guaranteeing high fidelity in modeling the system dynamics. Furthermore, for the first time the <b>bolted</b> flange joint <b>coupling</b> two bladed disks is considered as a possible source of damping due to friction phenomena. Understanding the effects of such non-linearities in damping blade vibrations could be crucial in design of bolted flange joint. The proposed reduction techniques then also allow the prediction of the forced response of a multi-stage system when friction contacts are present at the flange joint interface while maintaining low computational costs. 2. Validation of the Blade Tip-Timing measurement technique, for the identification of the modal properties of two laboratory dummy disks. In this frame an experimental procedure to validate the Blade Tip-Timing system against the strain gauges measurement has been proposed. Furthermore, a novel methodology for the identification of the operative deflection shape of a vibrating bladed disks in presence of small mistuning has been developed...|$|R
