30|$|Phase-change {{materials}} {{have already been}} employed in optical data storages (CDs, DVDs, <b>Blu-Ray</b> <b>disks)</b> due to the profound change in the optical properties between the amorphous and the crystalline state. In [3], it was demonstrated that by combining the optical and electronic properties of phase-change materials, display and data visualization applications that go beyond data storage applications can be created. This motivates researchers to investigate and to understand the optical properties of the phase-change materials in a wide spectral range.|$|R
40|$|Phase change {{materials}} can exist {{in two different}} phases, the amorphous and the crystalline phase, which exhibit distinctly different physical properties. It is possible to repeatedly switch the state of these materials, from the amorphous phase to the crystalline phase by heating the material above its crystallization temperature, and from the crystalline to the amorphous phase by melt-quenching. Phase change materials have been utilized very successfully in all modern optical re-writable storage media such as CDs, DVDs and <b>Blu-ray</b> <b>disks.</b> Recently, they have also been applied to solid-state memory devices where their large difference in electrical resistivity is used to store information. This paper reviews the unique properties of phase change materials in particular as they are important for their application to these devices...|$|R

Leone recollected, [...] "Clint arrived, dressed with exactly the same bad taste as American students. I didn't care. It was his face and his way of walking that I was interested in". Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man With No Name character's distinctive visual style, that would appear throughout the Dollars trilogy. He had brought with him black jeans, purchased from a shop on Hollywood Boulevard, which he had bleached out and roughened up, a hat from a Santa Monica wardrobe firm, a leather bracelet and two Indian leather cases with two serpents, and the trademark black cigars came from a Beverly Hills shop, though Eastwood himself is a non-smoker and hated the smell of cigar smoke.

Furthermore, we assess the parallelizability of our embedding approach and the impact of different hard drive configurations on the overall embedding speed, showing that low access times are as relevant as high transfer rates when maximum speedup through parallelization is desired. Lastly, this paper provides a discussion on a variety of design choices and practical issues which arise when designing an industry-level watermarking framework...|$|R
40|$|As a {{breakthrough}} in the cost and durability of molds for nanoimprint lithography (NIL), replica molds are fabricated by injection compression molding (ICM). ICM is commonly used for optical disks such as DVDs or <b>Blu-ray</b> <b>disks</b> and is also a practical fabrication method for nanostructures. In this paper, I successfully demonstrated the fabrication of cycloolefin polymer replica molds with structures smaller than 60 nm by ICM. Furthermore, ultraviolet (UV) -NIL using these replica molds was demonstrated. UV-cured resist was replicated over an area of 60 mm diameter. The degree of replication by UV-NIL in the first usage of each replica mold had good repeatability. Because ICM is a high-throughput, low-cost process, the replica mold can be disposed of after a certain time for UV-NIL. This method leads to a high-integrity UV-NIL process of patterned media because multiple large-area replica molds can be fabricated simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} decreasing the pit size in optical lithography by using combination of a four-zone annular binary phase filter and the phase transition material. The binary phase filter was designed by vector diffraction theory when linearly polarized light is focused under high numerical aperture objective lens (NA= 0. 95), the figures of merit produced by this filter are as follows: compared with the diffraction limited spot, Strehl ratio S is 0. 254, the spot size in the short axis direction is reduced down to 77. 3 %, the depth of focus is elongated to 317 % for the super-resolved spot,. Then a phase transition material {{is placed in the}} focal plane of the objective lens, according to the threshold effect of the material, the groove linewidth and pit size can decrease down to about 0. 2 lambda, which is about 90 nm at the wavelength of 405 nm. Therefore, nanoscale phase transition optical lithography is realized, and the capacity and density of the optical memory devices can be increased up to 2 - 3 times the <b>blu-ray</b> <b>disks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The gallium-nitride (GaN) {{semiconductor}} material {{has been the}} core of the revolutionary breakthroughs during the last two decades in the lighting industry, by enabling manufacturing of efficient blue light emitting diodes (LEDs), for which the 2014 Nobel prize in physics was awarded. The GaN technology has further led to violet edge-emitting lasers (EELs), enabling the <b>Blu-ray</b> <b>disk</b> technology, and also to the commercialization of directly green emitting EELs. A natural next step is the realization of GaN-based vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), which {{has proved to be a}} challenging task. The first electrically injected GaN-based VCSEL was announced in 2008, more than a decade after the first reports on its EEL counterpart. Still today only four groups in the world have demonstrated lasing under continuous-wave operation in a blue VCSEL. Some of the major challenges to realize GaN-based VCSELs are the lack of two lattice matched materials for forming high reflectivity distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), the poor current spreading capabilities in p-doped GaN, and the difficulty to achieve current and optical confinement. In this work we have addressed those issues. We have developed the novel concept of TiO 2 /air high contrast gratings (HCGs) to achieve high reflectivity over a broad wavelength range. The HCGs show a high reflectivity (> 95 %) over a 25 nm wavelength span, and a very good agreement between simulated and measured reflectivity spectra has been achieved. By using our in-house developed VCSEL simulation tools we have studied existing GaN-based VCSEL designs and shown that the approach taken by most groups to confine the current to the center of the device (transverse direction), yields an optical resonator that is weakly antiguiding with very high optical losses and thereby high threshold currents. These anti-guided devices have total losses that are typically 100 - 200 % higher than in our newly proposed structures, in which current confinement and optically guiding can be achieved simultaneously. These structures have already been implemented by two of the world's leading groups in the area...|$|E
5000|$|One {{reason for}} the decline in ticket sales in the 2000s is that [...] "home-entertainment options are {{improving}} all the time— whether streamed movies and television, video games, or mobile apps—and studios releasing fewer movies", which means that [...] "people {{are less likely to}} head to their local multiplex".

In 2014, it was reported that the practice of releasing a film in theaters and via on-demand steaming on the same day (for selected films) and the rise in popularity of the Netflix streaming service has led to concerns in the movie theater industry.
