40|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> is to {{encourage}} an employer to interview you. As with all written material that you send to an employer, a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should be persuasive and present you in a positive light. A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> also functions as a writing sample, so {{it is important that}} it is engaging, convincing, professional in appearance, grammatically correct, and free of typos. Narrowly tailor your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> to each job for which you apply. Mass mailings using generic language are ineffective. Tailoring each <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> will require researching both the job and the employer. Your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> can illustrate that you understand the position’s required qualifications, duties and responsibilities. Once you have a clear understanding of the position, use your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> to explain how your experience and education will benefit the employer. Your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should highlight the strengths and abilities listed on your resume. Most employers who are reading resumes have their regular jobs to perform. Your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should highlight the one or two items you hope they will see on your resume in the short time they have to glance at it. If your resume is particularly thin, you may use a specific example to illustrate a skill, but always be selective and concise. Anything mentioned should relate to the desired position. Always include a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> when you send a resume to an employer about a posted position. Below are guidelines to assist you in drafting a targeted, convincing <b>cover</b> <b>letter.</b> Use the mail unless email is requested. Avoid communicating via texting.

40|$|A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> {{serves as}} a tool for you to present {{yourself}} to an interviewer and make a favorable impression about your skills and personality outside of your resume. A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> can be more personable than a resume, and may serve to present your personality better than a resume. Often, an impressive <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> will increase a potential employer's desire to more seriously read your resume. Conversely, a poorly written <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> can discourage an employer from taking your resume seriously. The following information and format is essential to a good <b>cover</b> <b>letter.</b> Stationery Print your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> and resume in black ink, on neutral colored bond paper.

40|$|With all the {{emphasis}} on résumé writing, the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> is often overlooked. However, employers {{expect to see a}} <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> with each résumé. While some employers admit to reading the résumé first, they will read a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> second if the résumé piqued interest. A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> reflects your ability to communicate, provides an opportunity to establish a unique connection with an employer, and convinces an employer to take the next step, an interview.

Your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should emphasize {{why you want to}} work for that particular organization and why you would be a good fit. An effective <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> engages the reader and encourages him or her to invite you for an interview.

40|$|A well-written <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> {{encourages}} the prospective employer {{to look at}} your resume and bring you in for an interview. You should personalize and target your letter to a particular employer and convey your enthusiasm for the employer and position. A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should state your employment objective. It can also convey information that did not fit on your resume or was not necessarily appropriate for a resume. The goal of the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> is to tell the employer why they should hire you. Getting Started As with your resume, a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should be professional in tone, short, concise, and error-free. Remember, you are selling yourself to the employer in your letter and not merely expressing your interest in working for them. There is no “best ” way to write a <b>cover</b> <b>letter,</b> though set forth below are overviews of the paragraphs in a fourparagraph <b>cover</b> <b>letter.</b> If you find it difficult to start writing, one suggestion is to ignore all conventions of business writing and format—simply write out what you wish you could say. Getting your thoughts on paper is the first step; once your thoughts have been written, you can rephrase them so that they are organized and appropriate for a <b>cover</b> <b>letter.</b> <b>Cover</b> <b>Letter</b> Presentation A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> is a professional business letter. The paper should be the same quality as your resume. Similar to your resume, you should use a simple font such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Century Schoolbook (use the same font as on your resume). Font size should range from 11 – 12 point, and the overall letter should not exceed one page...|$|R

40|$|A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> is a {{document}} sent with your resumé {{to provide additional}} information on your skills and experience. A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> typically provides detailed information on why you are qualified for the job you are applying for. Effective <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and highlight your most relevant skills or experiences. Your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> may {{make the difference between}} obtaining a job interview and having your resumé ignored, so, it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing an effective <b>cover</b> <b>letter.</b> A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should complement, not duplicate your resumé. Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resumé and add a personal touch. A <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression. There are three general types of cover letters: • The application letter which responds to a known job opening. • The prospecting, unsolicited letter of enquiry which asks about possible positions. • The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search. Your <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek. Do not design a standardized letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!). 2 KEY AREAS FOR <b>COVER</b> <b>LETTER</b> WRITING • What position are you applying for? • How did you learn of the position or company? What {{do you know about the}} company? • Why are you perfect for the position? What sets you apart from the crowd? • Who will contact who? • Request a meeting or personal interview. • Mention that you will contact them to schedule a personal meeting. • Explain how they can reach you. • Thank them for taking the time to consider your application.

40|$|While many {{applicants}} {{feel that}} <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> are {{a waste of}} time – something to be dashed off to accompany the all-important resume- in reality the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> provides the employer a chance to evaluate your interest in their field and specific position, your relevant skills that match up with their job requirements, and your basic writing ability and attention to detail. Thank you letters following an informational or employment interview also make the candidate stand out from the competition and can be an effective way to emphasize your interest in the position and to summarize your candidacy. Often they can help “close ” the offer with you as the top candidate. While this material is prepared for all of SAIS students, we recognize that cultural and language differences exist across countries and encourage students to adapt content and format to business norms in the country of the intended recipient. Why <b>Cover</b> <b>Letters?</b> Given the challenge of crafting effective, original <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> and the proliferation of electronic communication and resume submission, is the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> still important? Employers tell us that they view the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> as an additional screening element for their candidates. Poorly prepared <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> result in unread resumes. Well-targeted and clearly written <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> can make your resume float {{to the top of the}} “To Interview ” stack.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} the field test of a survey designed {{to collect data on}} the individual decision to telecommute. The field test was conducted primarily to assess whether a <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> from the employer would induce a response bias. The survey was administered with two <b>cover</b> <b>letters</b> to the Sacramento-based Franchise Tax Board (FTB) and the San Francisco-based Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> type had a small (insignificant) impact on the response rate, but in the opposite direction than expected. The <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> had little effect on reasons for wanting to telecommute: "to get more work done" was still the most important advantage for both <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> groups. Differences in commute characteristics between the two agencies resulted in differences in perceived advantages of telecommuting. For PUC employees, reducing commute stress was the most important advantage of telecommuting, although getting more work done was a close second. For FTB employees, reducing commute stress was in ninth place. The combined sample showed a marked preference for home-based rather than center-based telecommuting...|$|R

The results to this experiment indicate that the photograph of a physically attractive researcher can dramatically increase a mail survey's response rate without creating a biased sample.

A partial explanation of why it failed in these latter areas comes from a re-examination of the <b>cover</b> <b>letter.</b> Although the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> stresses the importance of a reply, it does not state that a quick or complete response would be appreciated.
