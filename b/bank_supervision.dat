This is not, however, the case. Firstly, Swiss banking secrecy was not introduced in 1934, but rather reinforced; secondly, Swiss ruling circles performed the 1934 reinforcement without humanitarian motives in mind.|$|E

We investigate these issues using a survey among Dutch households. First, {{we find that the}} public's knowledge about <b>banking</b> <b>supervision</b> is far from perfect.
