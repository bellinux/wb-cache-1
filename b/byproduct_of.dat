5|$|Hafnium {{reserves}} {{have been}} infamously estimated to last under 10 years by one source {{if the world}} population increases and demand grows. In reality, since hafnium occurs with zirconium, hafnium can always be a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> zirconium extraction {{to the extent that}} the low demand requires.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|The {{elliptical}} brown-colored flecks, {{which can}} be observed in both the red and pink zones of the thallus, are made of confluentic acid and calcium oxalate monohydrate. The monohydrate is thought to be a more chemically stable metabolic <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> calcium oxalate dihydrate; the function of confluentic acid in the brown flecks is unclear.|$|E

5|$|The {{price for}} pure bismuth metal has been {{relatively}} stable {{through most of the}} 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E
5|$|Whereas bismuth is most {{available}} {{today as a}} byproduct, its sustainability is more dependent on recycling. Bismuth is mostly a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, primarily because of scattering.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Geological Survey, {{the world}} mining {{production}} of bismuth in 2014 was 13,600 tonnes, {{with the major}} contributions from China (7,600 tonnes), Vietnam (4,950 tonnes) and Mexico (948 tonnes). The refinery production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes. The difference reflects bismuth's status as a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> extraction of other metals such as lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium occurs {{naturally}} in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels. The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, {{is used as a}} catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E

After tidal wave floods following the explosions receded, Elohim scattered the Israelites and had them speak the language of other tribes.|$|E

30|$|There are two {{emission}} sources of non-metallic mineral wastes: waste derived from demolishing existing stock, such as structures, and that generated as <b>byproducts</b> <b>of</b> industrial production. Specifically, concrete waste and asphalt generated from demolishing structures and repairing roads, respectively, are non-metallic mineral wastes {{derived from the}} demolition of existing stock. On the other hand, iron and steel slag and coal ash, derived from the steel industry and coal-fired power generation, respectively, are non-metallic mineral wastes generated as <b>byproducts</b> <b>of</b> production.|$|R
5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, {{and also in the}} Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> the ornamental fish trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E
5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> natural gas.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
