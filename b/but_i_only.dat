500|$|In an {{interview}} 300 writer Frank Miller said, [...] "The inaccuracies, {{almost all of}} them, are intentional. I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason. I wanted these guys to move and I wanted 'em to look good. I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best result I {{can hope for is}} that if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating." ...|$|E
500|$|U2's {{lyrics are}} known for their social and {{political}} commentary, and are often embellished with Christian and spiritual imagery. Songs such as [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", [...] "Silver and Gold", and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] were motivated by current events of the time. The first was written about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, while the last concerns the struggle of a group of women whose children were killed or forcibly disappeared {{at the hands of the}} El Salvadoran government during the country's civil war. The song [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] from The Joshua Tree was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin—the lyric [...] "I see seven towers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> see one way out" [...] references the Ballymun Towers of Northern Dublin and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction.|$|E
500|$|Political {{and social}} {{concerns}} were {{the basis for}} several tracks. Bono wrote the lyrics for [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] after visiting El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War and witnessing how the conflict between rebels and the US-backed government affected local civilians. During the mid-song spoken passage, he talks {{of a man with}} a [...] "face red like a rose on a thorn bush", a reference to Reagan. Bono's trip also inspired [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared", after he met members of COMADRES—the Mothers of the Disappeared—a group of women whose children were killed or [...] "disappeared" [...] during the civil war {{at the hands of the}} local government. The 1984 UK mining strike inspired the lyrics for [...] "Red Hill Mining Town", which Bono wrote from the perspective of a couple affected by the strike. The story of a heroin-addicted couple was the basis for [...] "Running to Stand Still", which Bono set in the Ballymun Flats residential towers in Dublin near which he was raised. The buildings are referenced in the lyric [...] "I see seven towers / <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> see one way out". For [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", he wrote the lyrics in response to the idea that, in Belfast, a person's religion and income can be deduced based on the street they live on. [...] "Exit" [...] portrays the thoughts of a psychotic killer, although Clayton suggested that the line [...] "He saw the hands that build could also pull down" [...] is also a jab at the US government's conflicting roles in international relations.|$|E

2500|$|In 262, {{when the}} eunuch Huang Hao {{was in power}} in Shu, a big tree in the {{imperial}} palace suddenly collapsed. Qiao Zhou became worried {{but he could not}} find someone to talk to, so he wrote a 12-character mantra on a pillar which foreshadowed the conquest of Shu by Wei a year later. After the fall of Shu, when people praised Qiao Zhou for making an accurate prediction, he said, [...] "I may have thought about this myself, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> came up with it after expanding and deriving from the sayings of Du Qiong. I didn't use any special power or ability to predict the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cranston drew further {{attention}} in late 1905 when he published a further {{article in the}} Boston Journal opining that athletics were being overdone at universities. Under the headline, [...] "Wishes He Had Not Been a Famous Athlete When In College," [...] Cranston wrote:"I have had several serious sicknesses since I left college which I attribute to the great strain of my athletic training. On the whole I can't say that athletics have benefitted me any in my business career. I sincerely believe I {{would have been better}} off in my life since college if I had left athletics alone. ... I've never received any benefit in business life from athletics. I am not a broken down man by any means, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> speak the truth when I say I should have been better off had I left athletics alone." ...|$|E
