25|$|The {{failure of}} the {{propaganda}} war {{was evident in the}} increasing reliance on terror tactics by the regime in the antireligious campaign in the 1930s. However, {{by the end of the}} decade it may have <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the leadership of the antireligious campaign that the previous two decades of experience had shown that religion was a much deeper rooted phenomena than originally thought.|$|E
25|$|During {{his second}} term as Lieutenant Governor, the state passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act. Although it was at first {{extremely}} popular, it had soon <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> state leaders that it was leading the state to financial ruin. The problem was not fully evident when Wallace ran for governor in 1837, but was {{a small part of}} his election campaign. He was elected largely because of his prior support to the improvement act, which the public still supported, and his support from the popular governor Noah Noble.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} an {{intestinal}} illness which would plague Berlioz {{for the rest}} of his life had now <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> him. During a visit to Baden-Baden, Edouard Bénazet commissioned a new opera from Berlioz, but due to the illness that opera was never written. Two years later, however, Berlioz instead began work on Béatrice et Bénédict, which Bénazet accepted; it was completed on 25 February 1862. As for Les Troyens, in 1860 the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris had agreed to stage it, only to reject it the following year. It was soon picked up again by the Paris Opéra.|$|E

25|$|During the 2009–10 season, it had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the club's {{new owner}} Balram Chainrai that Portsmouth were {{approximately}} £135million in debt so {{to protect the}} club from liquidation, Chainrai placed the club into administration on 26 February 2010, and the club appointed Andrew Andronikou, Peter Kubik and Michael Kiely of accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young as administrators. This automatically incurred a nine-point penalty from the Premier League which came into effect on 17 March and consigned the team to almost certain relegation, which was mathematically confirmed on 10 April 2010. On 9 April 2010, it was announced David Lampitt would be joining Portsmouth as their new CEO after he had worked a period of notice at the FA, his current employer.|$|E
500|$|On December 20, 2007 Tancredo {{dropped out}} of the presidential race and thus ended his campaign. He cited that it had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> him that he could not win the race but was glad at what he {{perceived}} as the new positions of his opponents on illegal immigration, believing that [...] "we've (The Tom Tancredo campaign) forced them into that ..." [...] Tancredo also cited Huckabee's surge as a reason for his withdraw, stating his disagreements with the Governor made it important to help Romney secure the nomination. [...] While announcing his withdrawal, Tancredo also announced that he was endorsing Mitt Romney for President in 2008, citing Romney as [...] "the best hope for our cause [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The actual {{gameplay}} {{was seen}} as Brütal Legend largest weakness. Many reviewers were critical of the incorporation of real-time strategy (RTS) elements into the game, a fact that was not well advertised prior to the game's release and does not <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the player in the first hours of the game. Though Schafer had {{set out to make}} the console-based game like an RTS from the start, they were warned by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts that [...] "RTS" [...] was [...] "a naughty word in the console space", and instead marketed it as an action game. Despite this, reviewers found that the game was still difficult to play on a console due to the selected controls that made it difficult to target objectives or troops, the lack of a mini-map to track friends and foes, and the frantic pace of battle.|$|E

500|$|Historically, {{tropical}} cyclone tracking charts {{were used to}} include the past track and prepare future forecasts at Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers. [...] The need for a more modernized method for forecasting {{tropical cyclone}}s had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> operational weather forecasters by the mid-1980s. At that time the United States Department of Defense was using paper maps, acetate, grease pencils, and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones. [...] The Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF) software {{was developed by the}} Naval Research Laboratory for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) beginning in 1986, and used since 1988. During 1990 the system was adapted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for use at the NHC, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. This provided the NHC with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25% or 1 hour. ATCF was originally developed for use within DOS, before later being adapted to Unix and Linux.|$|E
500|$|The same Stuka {{bombardment}} {{that had}} put Brigade B to rout also broke {{the morale of}} the reserves at Rhenen. In the morning these troops had already shown severe discipline problems, with units disintegrating and leaving the battlefield because of German interdiction fire. In the late afternoon most of 4th Infantry Division was fleeing westwards. The Germans had expected that the Dutch would attempt to plug any gaps in the line and indeed it had been planned to shift to the north two regiments of the Dutch 3rd Army Corps for this purpose. But Dutch command now suffered such a loss of control that any thoughts to re-establish a continuous front had to be abandoned. A [...] wide gap had appeared in the defences. Fearing that otherwise they would be encircled, at 20:30 Van Voorst tot Voorst ordered the three Army Corps to immediately abandon both the Grebbe Line and the Waal-Linge Position and to retreat during the night to the East Front of Fortress Holland at the New Holland Water Line. The Germans, however, did not at once exploit their success; only around 21:00 had it <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> them that the gap even existed, when the renewed advance had met no enemy resistance.|$|E
2500|$|The concept {{reflected}} several {{changes that}} have <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> Extension administrators and educators within the last few years– first and foremost, that Extension’s Web presence would continue to outpace traditional sources of outreach, particularly face-to-face contact. [...] In Smith’s view, this was not surprising, considering that clients increasingly looked to Extension’s Web presence “as the most accessible {{source of information about}} Extension-related programs and services.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{stroboscopic}} lighting <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> {{the general public}} when it first became popular in discotheques during the 1960s. Many authorities responded by regulating the permissible frequency ranges of flashing lights in public places.|$|R
50|$|As Turkish Cypriots {{began to}} look to Turkey for protection, it soon <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> Greek Cypriots that enosis was {{extremely}} unlikely. Greek Cypriot leader Archbishop Makarios III now set independence for the island as his objective.|$|R

2500|$|The {{player and}} his companions {{accompany}} Eomer to Edoras, where the sings of Grima Wormtongue's growing influence <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> all after The King's Minstel Gléowine is {{thrown out of the}} court for crossing him. The audience with King Theoden quickly turns into an interrogation by Wormtongue, who oders Eomer stripped of his rank and imprisoned for breaking the [...] "King's" [...] direct order not to pursue the Uruk-hai band. Only an intervention by Lady Eowyn saves the player, Corudan and Horn from similar fate - instead they are thrown out of Edoras and are ordered to remain in the Eastemnet, not to cross the Entwash river under the penalty of death. Their next move uncertain, the trio decides to spend time helping those people who choose to fight for their homes in this land, despite being abandoned by Edoras.|$|E

For there is a very marked groove in every such skull, as in the human skull--which indicates the line of attachment of what is termed the 'tentorium'--a sort of parchment-like shelf, or partition, which, in the recent state, is interposed between the cerebrum and cerebellum, and prevents the former from pressing upon the latter. (See Fig. 16.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It serves you right. I say it now, and I {{will say}} it. Why was she so driven?" [...] Madame Staubach said never a word. Could she have had Linda {{back at the}} instant, just now, at this very moment, she would have yielded. It was {{beginning}} to <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> her that God did not intend that her prayers should be successful. Doubtless the fault was with herself. She had lacked faith. Then as she sat there she began to reflect {{that it might be}} that she herself was not of the elect. What if, after all, she had been wrong throughout! [...] "Is anything to be done?" [...] said Tetchen, who was still standing by her side.|$|E
50|$|As {{the need}} grew, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> Cox Cable {{that a more}} {{structured}} and formal approach would be needed. Studio space was carved out of {{a corner of the}} warehouse and garage and a full-time channel coordinator was hired.|$|R

50|$|It <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> Simonds {{that any}} further {{gains in the}} Scheldt would come at heavy cost, as the Breskens pocket, {{extending}} from Zeebrugge to the Braakman Inlet and inland to the Leopold Canal, was strongly held by the enemy.|$|R
60|$|Over my breakfast I {{studied the}} {{handwriting}} of her note. It might indeed have served for an index {{to so much}} of her character as had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> me. The crisp, clear formation of the letters, the bold curves and angular terminations, seemed to denote a personality free from all feminine weaknesses. I was reminded at once of the unfaltering gaze of her deep blue eyes, of the chill precision of her words and manner. I asked myself, then, why a character so free, apparently, from all the lovable traits of her sex, should have proved so attractive to me. I had known other beautiful women, I was not untravelled, and I had met women in Paris and Vienna who also possessed the more subtle charms of perfect toilet and manners, and were free from the somewhat hopeless obviousness {{of most of the}} women of our country. There was something beneath all that. At the moment, I could not tell what it was. I simply realized that, for the first time, a woman stood easily first in my life, that my whole outlook upon the world was undermined.|$|E
60|$|He had, therefore, to {{pull himself}} together, to adjust himself to the {{unexpected}} greatness of soul with which he was being received before he began to sketch the misgivings he had felt {{from the early days}} of his rectorship of St. John's; the helplessness and failure which by degrees had come over him. He related how it had <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> him that by far the greater part of his rich and fashionable congregation were Christians only in name, who kept their religion in a small and impervious compartment where it did not interfere with their lives. He pictured the yearning and perplexity of those who had come to him for help, who could not accept the old explanations, and had gone away empty; and he {{had not been able to}} make Christians of the poor who attended the parish house. Finally, trusting in the bishop's discretion, he spoke of the revelations he had unearthed in Dalton Street, and how these had completely destroyed his confidence in the Christianity he had preached, and how he had put his old faith to the test of unprejudiced modern criticism, philosophy, and science...|$|E
60|$|His cunningly devised {{speculation}} in diamonds had failed, {{but this}} failure had {{been due to}} an accident which could neither have been foreseen nor remedied. To carry out this scheme he had, as we have seen, been obliged to borrow money, which had now to be repaid. This {{he had managed to}} do, more or less completely, by the sale of the stones which Ezra had brought home, supplemented by the recent profits of the firm. There was still the original deficit to be faced, and John Girdlestone knew that though a settlement might be postponed from month to month, still the day must come, and come soon, when his debts must be met, or his inability to meet them <b>become</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the whole world. Should Ezra be successful in his wooing and his ward's forty thousand pounds be thrown into the scale, the firm would shake itself clear from the load which oppressed it. Supposing, however, that Kate were to refuse his son. What was to occur then? The will was so worded that there appeared to be no other way of obtaining the money. A very vulpine look would come over the old man's face as he brooded over that problem.|$|E
