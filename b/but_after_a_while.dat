5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in}} the older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the theme}} played out in Judges: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he {{therefore}} delivers them {{into the hands of}} their enemies; the people then repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends {{in the form of a}} judge; the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> they fall into unfaithfulness again and the cycle is repeated.|$|E

25|$|Poodles {{are known}} as a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. They require both {{physical}} and intellectual activities. Of note is this breed's keen sense for instinctive behavior. In particular, marking and hunting drives are more readily observable in poodles than in most other breeds. A typical poodle should be reserved with strangers upon first introduction, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> should slowly reveal a warm and personable disposition. Snappy, vicious behavior is considered a serious fault in the breed.|$|E
25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} at the {{beginning}} of August in 1914, the common belief was, that the war would only last {{for a couple of months}} at most. The shipyard management did not expect to have many orders, and therefore reduced the headcount. <b>But</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> the order intake increased; the Imperial Russian Army ordered more vessels, ship repair projects and gave various other assignments. The earlier declared ban the Emipre had laid down towards orders from Finnish companies was practically omitted.|$|E

25|$|The seismic {{activity}} started on 17 November 1917 and ruined several settlements around Amatitlán. On December 25 and 29 {{of the same}} year, and on January 3 and 24 of the next, there were stronger earthquakes felt {{on the rest of}} the country, which destroyed a number of buildings and homes in both Guatemala City and Antigua Guatemala. Diario de Centro América, a semi-official newspaper owned in part by President Estrada Cabrera, spent more than two months issuing two numbers a day reporting on the damage, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> started criticizing the central government after the slow and inefficient recovery efforts.|$|E
25|$|The pit organ will {{adapt to}} a {{repeated}} stimulus; if an adapted stimulus is removed, {{there will be a}} fluctuation in the opposite direction. For example, if a warm object is placed in front of the snake, the organ will increase in firing rate at first, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> will adapt to the warm object and the firing rate of the nerves in the pit organ will return to normal. If that warm object is then removed, the pit organ will now register the space that it used to occupy as being colder, and as such the firing rate will be depressed until it adapts to the removal of the object. The latency period of adaptation is approximately 50-150ms.|$|E

500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E

500|$|While Butcher contributed about a {{third of}} the album's lyrics, most of the music on Loveless was written and {{performed}} by Shields. Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At the beginning I used to go down [...] most days <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> I began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less."

500|$|The film premiered in late 1972 at {{the third}} Annual Baltimore Film Festival, held {{on the campus of}} the University of Baltimore, where it sold out tickets for three {{successive}} screenings; the film aroused particular interest among underground cinema fans following the success of Multiple Maniacs, which had begun to be screened in New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Being picked up by the small independent company New Line Cinema, Pink Flamingos was distributed to Ben Barenholtz, the owner of the Elgin Theater in New York City. At the Elgin Theater, Barenholtz had been promoting the midnight movie scene, primarily by screening Alejandro Jodorowsky's acid western film El Topo (1970). Barenholtz felt that being of an avant-garde nature, Pink Flamingos would fit in well with this crowd, screening it at midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. The film soon gained a cult following at the Elgin Theatre. Barenholtz characterized its early fans as primarily being [...] "downtown gay people, more of the hipper set," [...] <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> he noted that this group broadened, with the film becoming popular with [...] "working-class kids from New Jersey who would become a little rowdy". Many of these cult cinema fans learned all of the film's lines, reciting them at the screenings, a phenomenon which became associated with another popular midnight movie of the era, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).|$|E
2500|$|Hashemi {{refers to}} the point that the Islamic Republican Party {{established}} in the early years of revolution in Iran. Ruhollah Khomeini, at first step, was disagree with establishment of Party because he known the establishment of party as something gradually.

There were many negotiations and consultations on the instructions of Party [...]somebodies like Yadollah Sahabi and Habibollah Peyman were to communicate <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> there were no communication with them. Although Mortaza Motahhari had not any disagreement to establishing party but at the same time he hadn’t any communication with party. In fact, the idea of establishment of republic party was necessary in order to give the Mullahs an organization and political collection. The party has established formally on 17 February 1979, namely two weeks after the victory of Islamic Revolution. The members of the party even determined their members in Kanoon Touhid in early days. The financial expenses of party originated from the voluntary aids of people. At first, religious scholars or clerics took part in the party. In early days there were no financial problem <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> the problem appeared. Khomeini tried to give financial aid to the party with giving money. The members primarily chose from revolutionary individuals and believed persons.|$|E

2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Liu {{awarded the}} game a B, praising the {{graphics}} {{and variety of}} gameplay, but finding the game became somewhat repetitive towards the end; [...] "Dark Cloud 2 is very serial in nature. It's a game {{you can pick up}} and play for a few hours, stomping though a few dungeon floors, trying to solve a problem or two, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> it meanders towards repetition. In truth, the game is filled with innumerable challenges, likable characters and a high production value. But beneath the surface, the lightweight story and characters combined with the almost rigidly episodic game flow still hold it back." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Adams {{continued}} {{to write and}} submit sketches, though few were accepted.

The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams's life; [...] "I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [...] I briefly did therapy, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather.
