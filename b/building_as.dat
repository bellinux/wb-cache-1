5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred <b>building</b> <b>as</b> could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, {{the church}} had a stone-built nave and chancel; the latter survives in the present <b>building,</b> <b>as</b> does a 12th-century font which was {{probably}} taken from the building in place at that time.
