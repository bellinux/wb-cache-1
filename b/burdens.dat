40|$|Response <b>burden</b> in {{business}} surveys {{has long been}} a concern for National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) for three types of reasons: political reasons, because response <b>burden</b> is part of the total administrative <b>burden</b> governments impose on businesses; methodological reasons, because an excessive response <b>burden</b> may reduce data quality and increase data-collection costs; and strategic reasons, because it affects relations between the NSIs and the business community.

40|$|Purpose of the study: Caregiver <b>burden</b> is {{a multidimensional}} construct, {{addressing}} tension and anxiety (stress <b>burden),</b> changes in dyadic relationships (relationship <b>burden),</b> and time infringements (objective <b>burden)</b> resulting from caregiving. The study aims were to assess (a) whether {{the dimensions of}} <b>burden</b> were the same for caregiving spouses and adult children, (b) the role of assisting with problem behaviors (PBs) and {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) on each dimension of <b>burden,</b> and (c) the role of each dimension of <b>burden</b> on self-rated health and intention to institutionalize the care receiver.  Design and Methods: This study included 280 spouse/partner and 243 adult child caregivers of persons with chronic illnesses.  Results: Analysis using 2 -group structural equation modeling showed that the factor structure of <b>burden</b> was equivalent for spouses and adult children. For both groups, assisting with ADLs was directly related with objective <b>burden,</b> whereas PBs were directly related to all dimensions of <b>burden.</b> For both groups, stress <b>burden</b> was the only predictor of self-rated health, whereas PBs were significantly linked with intention to institutionalize. However, stress <b>burden</b> among spouses and relationship <b>burden</b> among adult children were significantly linked with intention to institutionalize.  Implications: We discuss the research and practice implications of the differing needs of spouses and adult children...|$|R

5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm <b>burdens,</b> large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm <b>burdens.</b> After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage).

However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue <b>burdens</b> on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

The study used pretest data from an intervention study in which psychoeducational family support groups in the Netherlands were evaluated. A total of 164 participants from 19 psychoeducational groups organized by nine community mental health centers completed the Dutch translation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted, with elements of subjective <b>burden</b> as dependent variables and elements of objective <b>burden,</b> demographic characteristics, and characteristics of the patient's disorder as predictors. <b>Burden</b> in general and emotional exhaustion were the aspects of subjective <b>burden</b> best predicted by objective <b>burden.</b> In two regression models, objective <b>burden</b> together with the other predictors explained 57 percent and 54 {{percent of the variance}} in subjective <b>burden.</b> Two aspects of objective burden-strain on the relationship with the patient and ability to cope with the patient's behavior-were related to almost all the investigated aspects of subjective <b>burden.</b> Strong evidence was found for the relationship between objective and subjective <b>burden</b> and for the hypothesis that particular elements of objective <b>burden</b> contribute more to subjective <b>burden</b> than others.
