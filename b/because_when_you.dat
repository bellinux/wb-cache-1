500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. Then I saw Gilles's time and — I still don't really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!" ...|$|E

Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock.

[...] "The Voice" [...] is a talent show that is actually talent-centric—it’s not about looks, not about youth, not about drama, it’s about vocal chops. There’s a greater level of objectivity, which I like. And it’s not just about their ability to belt out singing contest staples like Whitney Houston’s hits either." [...] She also said that the reason why she said yes for the show is that, [...] "It’s very different from American Idol, The X Factor, and America's Got Talent. There was just something about not knowing the backstory of an artist until you heard them sing. You know nothing. You literally know zero about that human being about to open their mouth, and that’s the only thing that will convince us to take somebody on. Talent. It was just that. Because it was a talent-first show." [...] On asked what part of the show she enjoyed most, she said: [...] "I enjoyed the battles the most <b>because</b> that’s <b>when</b> <b>you</b> really get to actively coach the two {{people who are going to}} be contenders. And that’s <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will start to see the people behind the voices. Because during blinds, we’re not coaches yet. For live shows it’s really more one-on-one, it becomes more like a conventional singing contest. But I love how unconventionally it starts. The battles, I think I enjoy them the most <b>because</b> that’s <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tell the one who has to battle somebody strong, “You have to come up to that level or else it’s not gonna look like an even fight,” and it has to look like an even battle eh. And my brother (Gerard Salonga) who was my guest adviser was like, “Let’s not think about competition now because it’s already inherent. You have to perform well. I don’t want a ‘pick me, pick me’ situation.” I hate that. Sometimes in attempting that, you muscle your way through a number and the number suffers.
