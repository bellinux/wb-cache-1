5|$|Clandestine {{trade with}} other nations continued, {{initially}} at a reduced level; among other things, Portugal illicitly labelled unsold Rhodesian tobacco as Mozambican product, then sold it on Salisbury's behalf in Europe and Asia. Through this {{and a series of}} similar sanction-busting operations Rhodesia avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson, and, with the help of South Africa and Portugal, gradually became more self-sufficient. Aiming to directly cut off the main supply lines of oil to Rhodesia, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at <b>Beira</b> and Lourenço Marques, Wilson set up the <b>Beira</b> Patrol, a Royal Navy squadron based in the Mozambique Channel, in March 1966. This blockade was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. Too small to cover both <b>Beira</b> and Lourenço Marques, and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in Portuguese waters, the patrol met with little success, but it endured regardless for nearly a decade.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of <b>Beira</b> and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E

The royal antelope is not closely related to the other two species in its genus – suni (N. moschatus) and Bates's pygmy antelope (N. batesi). The latter two are closely related, while the royal antelope is likely to have had an ancestor in common with the klipspringer and duikers (subfamily Cephalophinae).|$|E
5|$|After a {{subtropical}} depression {{exited the}} Mozambique Channel, {{another area of}} convection formed in the region on January8, which fluctuated in intensity for several days. A passing cold front increased convection further on January12, which split off a cutoff low-pressure area. Two days later, a subtropical disturbance formed offshore <b>Beira,</b> Mozambique, classified due to the extratropical origins and lack of centralized convection. The system remained nearly stationary, with the convection extending well to the east. On January16, the MFR reclassified {{the system as a}} tropical depression after the thunderstorms increased near the center, the increasing organization due to moderate but decreasing wind shear. By that time, the depression had begun an eastward movement, but soon turned to the south in the weakness between two high-pressure areas. Late on January16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alda after the convection organized into a central dense overcast. Also that day, the JTWC began tracking the system as Tropical Cyclone 12S. This marked an unusually late start for the first named storm, at the time the third-latest on record.|$|E
5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In <b>Beira,</b> the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods were beginning to recede by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods were beginning to recede again, leaving behind a deep layer of mud, ponds of contaminated water, and piles of rotten corpses.|$|E

40|$|U-Pb {{detrital}} zircon ages {{from the}} <b>Beiras</b> Group greywackes (SW Central Iberian Zone - CIZ) indicate a maximum depositional age of late Ediacaran (c. 560 - 578 Ma). Two salient features distinguish the <b>Beiras</b> Group from the Série Negra greywackes (age equivalent from the Ossa-Morena Zone - OMZ) : i) The presence of Tonian and Mesoproterozoic (< 8 %) age clusters in the <b>Beiras</b> Group greywackes, {{that are almost}} absent in the OMZ, imply either a distinct or an additional source of detrital zircons from the West African Craton; and 2) The higher content of Cryogenian zircon ages of the <b>Beiras</b> Group greywackes (mainly at c. 840 - 750 Ma and c. 685 - 660 Ma), that contrast with the dominant Ediacaran zircon ages of the Série Negra greywackes (OMZ). The Cryogenian zircon forming events that are dominant in the SW CIZ basins are probably related to a different source with early Cadomian juvenile crust (c. 700 - 635 Ma) and with a possible contribution of the Pan-African suture (c. 850 - 700 Ma). The Nd isotopic signatures support {{the addition of a}} juvenile source to pre-existent older crust for the <b>Beiras</b> Group metasediments. Although the <b>Beiras</b> Group (SW CIZ) and Serie Negra (OMZ) late Ediacaran basins have evolved together in the active margin of Gondwana, they were sufficiently separated to account for the differences in their detrital zircon content and isotopic signatures...|$|R
5|$|Cyclone Leon–Eline in February 2000 was the third-longest tracked {{tropical}} cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean. On February1, a tropical low originated within the monsoon trough {{to the south}} of Indonesia, and would eventually become Tropical Cyclone Leon in the Australian basin. Moving westward, the storm fluctuated in strength due to changes in the atmosphere, mostly increasing and decreasing wind shear. After crossing 90°E, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) began tracking the system as Tropical Storm Eline on February8. The storm continued across the Indian Ocean and intensified greatly as it approached the east coast of Madagascar. Late on February17, Eline made landfall near Mahanoro, with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). The storm rapidly weakened over land, but restrengthened in the Mozambique Channel to reach peak 10‑minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). On February22, Eline made landfall about 80km (50mi) south of <b>Beira,</b> Mozambique near peak intensity and quickly weakened over land. The well-defined circulation moved across southern Africa, finally dissipating over eastern Namibia on February29.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} United States entered World War II, Kentuckian was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), but {{continued}} to be operated by American-Hawaiian. On 19 November 1941, Kentuckian sailed from New York for Durban, where she arrived on 21 December. Kentuckian {{spent the next two}} months sailing between ports in South Africa and Mozambique, calling at Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, and East London in the former, and Lourenco Marques, and <b>Beira</b> in the latter, before heading to Trinidad from Cape Town on 28 February 1942. Arriving at Trinidad three weeks later, she made her way up to Boston by early April, before putting in at New York for about six weeks. Sailing from New York in late May, Kentuckian joined a southbound Hampton Roads, Virginia – Key West, Florida convoy. She left the convoy before Key West and headed back across the Atlantic to Cape Town, where she arrived on 7 July. Kentuckian spent the next month sailing between Cape Town, East London, and Durban. Kentuckian concluded her second trip to Africa when she sailed for South America on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} February, the ITCZ {{spawned a}} system along the Mozambique coast. With a {{circulation}} and warm water temperatures, the system developed into a tropical disturbance on February24 just offshore northeastern Mozambique. The system slowly organized while drifting southward between two ridges. After an increase in convection, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Lisette on February28 according to the MFR, although {{by that time the}} JTWC had upgraded the storm to the equivalent of tropical cyclone status. A building ridge turned the storm sharply westward. On March1, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph), making Lisette a severe tropical storm with an eye feature in the center. By comparison, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 130km/h (85mph). The storm failed to intensify further, making landfall at peak intensity just north of <b>Beira,</b> Mozambique early on March2. Lisette turned to the west-northwest, dissipating over Zimbabwe on March3.|$|E

5|$|ITAK {{had four}} main aims: {{creation}} of a federal union in Ceylon with two states - a Tamil state in the Northern and Eastern provinces and a Sinhalese state in the remaining seven provinces; cessation of state-sponsored colonisation in the two Tamil provinces; unity amongst the Tamil speaking peoples of Ceylon - Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils and Muslims; and equal status for Sinhala and Tamil languages. Chelvanayakam lost his seat in the 1952 parliamentary election but regained it in the 1956 parliamentary election. As Ceylon's two main parties, the UNP and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), introduced policies which further discriminated against the country's minorities, such as the Sinhala Only Act which made Sinhala the sole official language of Ceylon, ITAK's Tamil nationalism became more popular than the ACTC's conservatism. In the 1956 parliamentary election the ITAK overtook the ACTC as the most popular party amongst Ceylon Tamils. On 5 June 1956 a group of Tamil activists and parliamentarians, led by Chelvanayakam, staged a satyagraha (a form of non-violent resistance) against the Sinhala Only Act on Galle Face Green opposite the Parliament. The satyagrahis were attacked by a Sinhalese mob as the police looked on, and ITAK MPs E. M. V. Naganathan and V. N. Navaratnam were thrown in <b>Beira</b> Lake.|$|E
