50|$|The {{different}} <b>behaviourisms</b> {{also differ}} {{with respect to}} basic principles. Skinner contributed greatly in separating Pavlov’s classical conditioning of emotion responses and operant conditioning of motor behaviors. Staats, however, notes that food was used by Pavlov to elicit a positive emotional response in his classical conditioning and Thorndike Edward Thorndike used food as the reward (reinforcer) that strengthened a motor response in {{what came to be}} called operant conditioning, thus emotion-eliciting stimuli are also reinforcing stimuli. Watson, although the father of behaviorism, did not develop and research a basic theory of the principles of conditioning. The behaviorists whose work centered on that development treated differently the relationship of the two types of conditioning. Skinner’s basic theory was advanced in recognizing two different types of conditioning, but he didn’t recognize their interrelatedness, or the importance of classical conditioning, both very central for explaining human behavior and human nature.|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{to mimic}} the {{physical}} characteristics of the extracellular matrix in vitro is an invaluable tool with regards {{to being able to}} target stem cell differentiation along selective cell lineages. One such physical characteristic is the innate elasticity of the cell substrate. Studies have shown that the rigidity of a substrate has considerable inﬂuence over cellular <b>behaviourisms</b> such as migration and differentiation. Here we make use of liquid chromatography coupled to high mass accuracy mass spectrometry (LC-MS) as an established method for monitoring small changes in cell stasis. As such, this can be exploited to envisage the cellular metabolome (the entire array of metabolites that exist within a cell at any point in time). The interpretation of external cues by stem cells causes the activation or deactivation of several proteins, consequently causing shifts in the metabolome. This effect renders the metabolic proﬁle of a cell to be highly indicative of its phenotype at that point in time. This is potentially of signiﬁcance in stem cell research as the cells are metabolically quiescent in their self-renewing state in their natural niches and the metabolome is thought to become up regulated during differentiation. Investigating MSC metabolites during directed differentiation has enabled scrutiny of the cell behaviour as phenotype is altered and has the potential to inﬂuence the manner in which biomaterials are designed for cell culture in vitr...|$|R
25|$|A Clockwork Orange {{was written}} in Hove, then a senescent seaside town. Burgess had arrived back in Britain after his stint abroad to see that much had changed. A youth culture had grown, {{including}} coffee bars, pop music and teenage gangs. England was gripped by fears over juvenile delinquency. Burgess claimed that the novel's inspiration was his first wife Lynne's beating by a gang of drunk American servicemen stationed in England during World War II. She subsequently miscarried. In its investigation of free will, the book's target is ostensibly the concept of <b>behaviourism,</b> pioneered by such figures as B. F. Skinner.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his specific critiques of neo-Darwinism, Koestler was opposed to {{what he saw as}} dangerous scientific reductionism more generally, including the <b>behaviourism</b> school of psychology, promoted in particular by B. F. Skinner during the 1930s. Koestler assembled a group of high-profile antireductionist scientists, including C. H. Waddington, W. H. Thorpe and Ludwig von Bertalanffy, for a meeting at his retreat in Alpbach in 1968. This was one of many attempts which Koestler made to gain acceptance within the mainstream of science, a strategy which brought him into conflict with individuals such as Peter Medawar who saw themselves as defending the integrity of science from outsiders. Although he never gained significant credibility as a scientist, Koestler published a number of works at the border between science and philosophy, such as Insight and Outlook, The Act of Creation and The Ghost in the Machine.|$|E
25|$|Ethology is the {{scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually {{with a focus on}} behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait. <b>Behaviourism</b> is a term that also describes {{the scientific}} and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a laboratory context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity. Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, joint awardees of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as neuroanatomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour, such as aggression, in a number of unrelated animals.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{critical analysis of}} the development of the Danish economy {{in the aftermath of the}} ’Global Financial Crisis’ of 2008. We conduct the analysis of our empirical data through triangulation to examine both the phenomena and the cause of change in the phenomena. The theories employed in the project summaries to: ‘The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money’, ‘The Permanent Income Hypothesis’, ‘The Financial Instability Hypothesis’, and ‘The Phillip’s Curve’. The theories employed for the analysis are selected on their ability to elaborately depict the observed phenomena with critical reflections towards considerations of reliability and validity. The vast majority of our analysis, have been conducted on the basis of statistics gathered from ‘Danmarks Statistik’, ‘Trading Economics’, and ‘OECD’. Our data has seeking to illuminate of the agents operation and <b>behaviourisms</b> within the market and how that has affected the economic development in Denmark. The paper finds that business could be likely to obtain large amount of leverage in order to expand in a future economic upturn, hence creating Ponzi schemes, which multiplied by the low interest rate. Furthermore, the paper examines the debt level of the Danes, but I does not find a conclusive answer to rather it is an offsetting factor, but I does suggest that I could become one and hence macro prudential supervision should be a priority. Finally, the paper find that the ‘flexicurity’ have had a large impact on government budget, while it has been supporting both the demand and supply side of the economy...|$|R
2500|$|From {{the time}} of writing Structure of Behavior and Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty wanted to show, in {{opposition}} to the idea that drove the tradition beginning with John Locke, that perception was not the causal product of atomic sensations. This atomist-causal conception was being perpetuated in certain psychological currents of the time, particularly in <b>behaviourism.</b> According to Merleau-Ponty, perception has an active dimension, in that it is a primordial openness to the lifeworld (the [...] "Lebenswelt").|$|E
2500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, Noam Chomsky, Jerry Fodor and others mounted what they conceptualised as a 'revolution' against <b>behaviourism.</b> Retrospectively, this became {{labelled}} 'the cognitive revolution'. Whereas <b>behaviourism</b> had denied the scientific {{validity of the}} concept of [...] "mind", Chomsky replied that, in fact, the concept of [...] "body" [...] is more problematic. Behaviourists tended to view the child's brain as a tabula rasa, initially lacking structure or cognitive content. According to B. F. Skinner, for example, richness of behavioural detail (whether verbal or non-verbal) emanated from the environment. Chomsky turned this idea on its head. The linguistic environment encountered by a young child, according to Chomsky's version of psychological nativism, is in fact hopelessly inadequate. No child could possibly acquire the complexities of grammar from such an impoverished source. Far from viewing language as wholly external, Chomsky re-conceptualised it as wholly internal. To explain how a child so rapidly and effortlessly acquires its natal language, he insisted, we must conclude that it comes into the world with the essentials of grammar already pre-installed. No other species, according to Chomsky, is genetically equipped with a language faculty— or indeed with anything remotely like one. The emergence of such a faculty in Homo sapiens, from this standpoint, presents biological science with a major theoretical challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong holds to a physicalist, functionalist {{theory of}} the mind. He {{initially}} was attracted to Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind and the rejection of Cartesian dualism. Armstrong did not accept <b>behaviourism</b> and instead defended a theory he {{referred to as the}} [...] "central-state theory" [...] which identifies mental states with the state of the central nervous system. In A Materialist Theory of Mind, he accepted that mental states such as consciousness exist, but stated that they can be explained as physical phenomena. Armstrong attributes his adoption of the central-state theory to the work of J. J. C. Smart—specifically the paper 'Sensations and Brain Processes'—and traces the lineage from there to Ullin Place's 1956 paper 'Is Consciousness a Brain Process?' ...|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{prior to}} and {{immediately}} following World War II, the dominant psychological paradigm was <b>behaviourism.</b> Within this conceptual framework, language {{was seen as a}} certain kind of behaviour— namely, verbal behaviour, to be studied much like any other kind of behaviour in the animal world. Rather as a laboratory rat learns how to find its way through an artificial maze, so a human child learns the verbal behaviour of the society into which it is born. The phonological, grammatical and other complexities of speech are in this sense [...] "external" [...] phenomena, inscribed into an initially unstructured brain. Language's emergence in Homo sapiens, from this perspective, presents no special theoretical challenge. Human behaviour, whether verbal or otherwise, illustrates the malleable nature of the mammalian— and especially the human— brain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} epiphenomenalism {{goes back to}} the post-Cartesian attempt to solve the riddle of Cartesian dualism, i.e., of how mind and body could interact. La Mettrie, Leibniz and Spinoza all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were {{conscious}} nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by Cabanis (1802), and was further explicated by Hodgson (1870) and Huxley (1874). Huxley (1874) likened mental phenomena to the whistle on a steam locomotive. However, epiphenomenalism flourished primarily as it found a niche among methodological or scientific behaviorism. In the early 1900s scientific behaviorists such as Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of eliminativism or mental fictionalism, positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. However, by the 1960s, scientific <b>behaviourism</b> met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the cognitive revolution. Participants in that revolution, such as Jerry Fodor, reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of [...] "epiphobia"—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.|$|E

60|$|The {{primitive}} non-cognitive {{element in}} desire {{seems to be}} a push, not a pull, an impulsion away from the actual, rather than an attraction towards the ideal. Certain sensations and other mental occurrences have a property which we call discomfort; these cause such bodily movements as are likely to lead to their cessation. When the discomfort ceases, or even when it appreciably diminishes, we have sensations possessing a property which we call PLEASURE. Pleasurable sensations either stimulate no action at all, or at most stimulate such action as is likely to prolong them. I shall return shortly to the consideration of what discomfort and pleasure are in themselves; for the present, it is their connection with action and desire that concerns us. Abandoning momentarily the standpoint of <b>behaviourism,</b> we may presume that hungry animals experience sensations involving discomfort, and stimulating such movements as seem likely to bring them to the food which is outside the cages. When they have reached the food and eaten it, their discomfort ceases and their sensations become pleasurable. It SEEMS, mistakenly, as if the animals had had this situation in mind throughout, when in fact they have been continually pushed by discomfort. And when an animal is reflective, like some men, it comes to think that it had the final situation in mind throughout; sometimes it comes to know what situation will bring satisfaction, so that in fact the discomfort does bring the thought of what will allay it. Nevertheless the sensation involving discomfort remains the prime mover.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Behaviourism</b> has not, however, {{sprung from}} observing {{the folly of}} men. It is the wisdom of animals that has {{suggested}} the view. It {{has always been a}} common topic of popular discussion whether animals [...] "think." [...] On this topic people are prepared to take sides without having the vaguest idea what they mean by [...] "thinking." [...] Those who desired to investigate such questions were led to observe the behaviour of animals, in the hope that their behaviour would throw some light on their mental faculties. At first sight, it might seem that this is so. People say that a dog [...] "knows" [...] its name because it comes when it is called, and that it [...] "remembers" [...] its master, because it looks sad in his absence, but wags its tail and barks when he returns. That the dog behaves in this way is matter of observation, but that it [...] "knows" [...] or [...] "remembers" [...] anything is an inference, and in fact a very doubtful one. The more such inferences are examined, the more precarious they are seen to be. Hence the study of animal behaviour has been gradually led to abandon all attempt at mental interpretation. And it can hardly be doubted that, in many cases of complicated behaviour very well adapted to its ends, there can be no prevision of those ends. The first time a bird builds a nest, we can hardly suppose it knows that there will be eggs to be laid in it, or that it will sit on the eggs, or that they will hatch into young birds. It does what it does at each stage because instinct gives it an impulse to do just that, not because it foresees and desires the result of its actions.* ...|$|E

5000|$|Armstrong {{looks at}} Gilbert Ryles {{refinement}} of <b>Behaviourism,</b> Dispositional <b>Behaviourism.</b> Armstrong illustrates Ryles idea with {{a description of}} glass - brittleness is the disposition of materials such as glass to shatter under certain circumstances. Whether or not the glass shatters in a particular instance, it has the disposition to do so. In the same way, a mind can have a disposition towards anger, but it may only express this anger under certain circumstances. Armstrong quotes Ryles The Concept of Mind: [...] "To possess a dispositional property is not to be in a particular state, or to undergo a particular change, it is to be bound or liable to be in a particular state, or to undergo a particular change, when a particular change is realized." [...] Gilbert Ryle While this dispositionalism quite successfully deals with the objection that one can feel or think one thing and do another, it is not enough - [...] "it seems obvious as anything is obvious that there is something actually going on in me that constitutes my thought". Ryles Dispositional <b>Behaviourism</b> denies this, and so Armstrong declares it to be [...] "unsatisfactory as a theory of mind". Though he rejects <b>Behaviourism,</b> Armstrong suggests that it is useful to say that the mind and mental states are [...] "logically tied to behaviour". He says that [...] "thought is not speech under suitable circumstances, rather it is something within the person that, in suitable circumstances, brings about speech." [...] He thinks this view is compatible with a Materialist view of the mind, though it is also compatible with non-Materialist views, such as Descartes.|$|E
