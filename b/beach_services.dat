50|$|The beach craft were refuelled by {{a shuttle}} service of coastal tankers that bunkered in {{southern}} UK ports whilst five 12,000 ton tankers carried the water, two {{always at the}} beachhead with the remaining three in transit. From the two tankers at the beachhead other smaller tankers then shipped the water to depot ships and warships they also replenished the LBW's. This method of replenishment was in operation until D-Day plus forty when it became possible to use the captured channel ports. Their respective peacetime crews manned the Store and Replenishment crews of all the ships and barges albeit dressed in naval uniform; the ten CHANTS (Channel Tankers) were allocated to the <b>Beach</b> <b>services</b> of the Royal Navy. The bulk of these ships came under the Ministry of War Transport and carried oil to the storage tanks at Port-en-Bessin, others under control of the Royal Navy carried diesel, petrol and water, all destined for the advancing armies. This particular class of ship was not renowned for its stability and when loaded had to carry lots of ballast, as well as cargo in their tanks they also carried up to ten tons of lubricating oil on deck and were well armed considering their vulnerability. On D-Day plus three Chant 60 turned turtle when manoeuvring under full helm, fortunately her entire crew were rescued later, carrying a full load of petrol she was towed away from the beach and sunk by a British destroyer. Chant 69, this time carrying water performed a similar evolution a short while later. It was then decided to bring all the class into {{the confines of the}} gooseberry shelters until a Royal Navy Constructor could carry out stability tests. Others carried out sterling service, Chant 23 lying off Sword Beach had been hit by an enemy shell in her engine room and disabled but still continued to fuel anything that came alongside. Chant 7 was driven ashore after capsizing during the gales of 18/20 June when loaded with petrol and Chant 26 drove ashore on the crest of a wave, straight up the beach, through a hedge and landed in a field the right way up. After discharging her precious cargo to army bowsers she was dragged back to her natural element and towed home, the author Captain E. E. Sigart made the observation that Chant 26 was the only British merchantman to fly proudly the Red Ensign and discharge her cargo, literally in a foreign field! Chant 24 beached at Le Hamel carrying 200 tons of oil fuel for the RAF needed for the building of runways previously LBO's had carried out this duty with the muscle power supplied by the infantry on their hand pumps. Finally some of the Chants were used as accommodation ships as there uses diminished and after the landings had been completed most returned to the UK and after the war were sold on to commercial operators.|$|E

40|$|The {{beach is}} {{generally}} recognised {{as the most}} important recreation amenity in the region for Gold Coast residents, as well as tourists. However, there is very little data to support the role that this amenity plays in the life of over 500, 000 (ABS 2011) Gold Coast residents. This paper reports the results of a survey that set out to collect data from Gold Coast residents regarding their beach use and the values they associate with the beach, and to develop estimates of the economic value of the beach to residents. A mail survey of 8, 000 households resulted in 1, 862 responses. Over 80 per cent of respondents indicated that the beach, parks and foreshore were important to them. On average, residents visited 10 beaches per month during summer and 6 per month during winter, taking a total of 35 million visits to local beaches and foreshores parks each year. We used the individual travel cost method and limited dependent variable regression techniques to estimate the value of, and explain, resident visits to beaches. Travel costs were found to be significant in explaining visits. Females, people on higher incomes, home owners and full time employees take fewer visits to beaches while larger households take more. We also found that visits to multiple sites were compliments rather than substitutes. The value of recreational benefits to Gold Coast residents was found to be between $ 365 million and $ 1. 7 billion depending on whether fuel costs alone or full travel costs, including time, are used in the model. These estimates are invaluable to decision makers in resolving pressing policy issues such as adaptation options to climate change or budget allocations in maintaining <b>beach</b> <b>services.</b> Limitations and future areas for research are outlined in the paper...|$|E
