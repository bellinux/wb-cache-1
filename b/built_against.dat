5|$|The stadium {{was named}} Goodison Park because {{the length of}} the site was <b>built</b> <b>against</b> Goodison Road. The road was named after a civil {{engineer}} named George Goodison who provided a sewage report to the Walton Local Board in the mid-1800s and later became a local land owner.|$|E
5|$|The vicar from 1896 to 1908 was T.H. Birley, later Bishop of Zanzibar. In 1897 the {{building}} was again re-roofed and a vestry <b>built</b> <b>against</b> the north wall of the tower. St Thomas' was declared an ancient parish in 1948.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, <b>built</b> <b>against</b> the side of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E

5000|$|Around {{the church}} various low {{buildings}} have been <b>built</b> up <b>against</b> it, {{most notably the}} former fish market called De Vishal, which today is used for exhibiting modern art. On the south side a series of low buildings used as shops are <b>built</b> up <b>against</b> various church buildings such as the former [...] "librye" [...] or library, and sacristy. In 1630 the architect Salomon de Bray designed and built the [...] which still exists today.|$|R

5|$|To {{the south}} of the tower is a range of {{buildings}} <b>built</b> <b>against</b> the thick, buttressed, 14th-century curtain wall. The great hall occupied the central part of this range, with the lord's private apartments of great chamber and solar in the block to the north, and kitchens to the south. The foundations of a rectangular building stand on a rocky mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, {{the company}} {{received}} {{an order for}} three prototypes to be <b>built</b> <b>against</b> Specification O.5/43 and the first prototype, serial number RA356, was constructed at Fairey's Hayes factory and first flew on 5 July 1945 from Heston Aerodrome; the other two did not fly until 1947. In November 1943 the company was ordered to build a dual-control dive-bombing trainer variant against Specification T.21/43 and this was built at the Heaton Chapel factory and assembled and flown at Ringway on 20 June 1946. Three further development aircraft were ordered in May 1944 to be built at Heaton Chapel, with the last two to be fitted with a Rolls-Royce Pennine engine; only the first Centarus-engined aircraft was built but never flew.|$|E
5|$|The axis of {{the pyramid}} complex may be {{associated}} with a series of monuments strung out along a kilometer of desert. Along this axis are several key structures: 1) a large pyramid dedicated to his grandmother Tetisheri which contained a stele depicting Ahmose providing offerings to her; 2) a rockcut underground complex which may either have served as a token representation of an Osirian underworld or as an actual royal tomb; and 3) a terraced temple <b>built</b> <b>against</b> the high cliffs, featuring massive stone and brick terraces. These elements reflect in general a similar plan undertaken for the cenotaph of Senwosret III and in general its construction contains elements which reflect the style of both Old and Middle Kingdom pyramid complexes.|$|E

5|$|The {{open cup}} nest is <b>built</b> <b>against</b> a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against {{potential}} predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically {{of three to}} five eggs, is incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, {{although there has been}} a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|While {{much of the}} {{construction}} in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what {{seems to have been}} a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas <b>built</b> <b>against</b> each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.|$|E
5|$|Original to the house, and occupying its {{northwest}} terrace {{against its}} service wing, was an Italian garden with vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it {{characteristics of a}} hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was <b>built</b> <b>against</b> the hillside, occupying {{a portion of the}} slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of the house were screened with a row of large cedars planted on the highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas thickly overgrown with vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house.|$|E

50|$|Across the bailey, {{along the}} eastern wall between the {{south-east}} tower and the water gate {{would have been the}} kitchens. The lightly built foundations suggest that the buildings were timber, <b>built</b> up <b>against</b> the curtain wall, with stone fireplaces, hearths, and ovens.|$|R
5|$|School House, 70The Close, was {{formerly}} {{part of the}} Carnary college but now contains classrooms and school offices. While much of the building dates to around 1830, extensive 14th and 15th century features remain such as the stone entrance archway. The building, which is Grade I listed, adjoins the Erpingham Gate and is three storeys high and has eight bays. School End House, 69The Close, is a 17th-century timber-framed house <b>built</b> <b>against</b> {{the east end of}} the school chapel. Formerly a home, the Grade I listed building is now the senior common room for staff and a school office. The entrance is pilastered and is surrounded by lion-mask roundels. The Music School, 71The Close, was built in 1626–28 as a home for the prebendaries of the cathedral, funded by the chapter. Typical of the period, the Grade II* listed building was constructed from flint-rubble, brick, and reused materials from monastic buildings in the Close. It replaced an earlier house and incorporates the remains of a medieval free-standing bell tower originating in the 12th or 13th century, rebuilt around 1300 and largely demolished by 1580.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} structure after the Holy Mother of God {{church is a}} rectangular chapel <b>built</b> <b>against</b> its western wall. The remaining section of the façade of the main church is situated immediately next to it with a ridge roof. Ivane Zakarian and his son Avak were buried inside in 1227. A small structure with a lean-to roof {{is attached to the}} north wall of the main church. It was used to store ceremonial items. On the north-western side of the monastery, a single nave and ridge-roofed church is located detached from the main church. Another building that hasn't survived used to be located next to it. Numerous dilapidated dwellings and auxiliary structures are scattered in the territory of the fortress such as a two-story building believed to be a residence for guards. There are traditional networks of tunnels, crypts, water reservoirs and wine cellars, found among most monasteries of medieval Armenia. Not far from the monastery one can find other medieval monuments such as the Holy Trinity monastery, Saint George church, a 13th-century spring monument, a 19th-century Russian chapel, a Greek church as well as various khachkars and chapels.|$|E
5|$|The {{perimeter}} wall of {{the citadel}} is not a continuous fortification wall, but consists of the façades of approximately 100 houses that have been <b>built</b> <b>against</b> each other. Because they have been built {{on or near the}} steep slope of the citadel mound, many of these façades were strengthened by buttresses to prevent their collapse or subsidence. There were circa 30 city-palaces; most of them located along the perimeter of the citadel. The oldest surviving house that can be securely dated through an inscription was built in 1893. The oldest houses {{can be found on the}} southeastern side of the mound, whereas houses on the northern perimeter date to the 1930s–1940s. Before the introduction of modern building techniques, most houses on the citadel were built around a courtyard. A raised arcade overlooking the courtyard, a flat roof and a bent-access entrance to prevent views of the courtyard and the interior of the house were characteristic elements of the houses on the citadel.|$|E

25|$|Later {{additions}} to the church include toilets, <b>built</b> <b>against</b> {{the back wall of}} the church, and a brick columbarium wall near the entrance, both added in 1995. A rectory, which stood behind the church, was sold and removed in early 2004, and a recent steel building has been constructed in its place. The original timber church has also been demolished. St Paul's continues to function as the main church for the Parish of Proserpine.|$|E
