25|$|Endianness is {{a problem}} when a <b>binary</b> <b>file</b> created on a {{computer}} is read on another computer with different endianness. Some CPU instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as bswap (x86 - 486 and later), and rev (ARMv6 and later).|$|E
25|$|Administrative {{installations}} {{are also}} useful when creating a Windows Installer patch, as this requires uncompressed {{images of the}} earlier and current versions of a product in order to compute <b>binary</b> <b>file</b> differences. An administrative installation is performed by running the msiexec executable with the /a switch.|$|E
25|$|The Full Text Search {{engine is}} divided into two {{processes}}: the Filter Daemon process (msftefd.exe) and the Search process (msftesql.exe). These processes interact with the SQL Server. The Search process includes the indexer (that creates the full text indexes) and the full text query processor. The indexer scans through text columns in the database. It can also index through binary columns, and use iFilters to extract meaningful text from the binary blob (for example, when a Microsoft Word document is stored as an unstructured <b>binary</b> <b>file</b> in a database). The iFilters are hosted by the Filter Daemon process. Once the text is extracted, the Filter Daemon process breaks it up into a sequence of words and hands it over to the indexer. The indexer filters out noise words, i.e., words like A, And etc., which occur frequently and are not useful for search. With the remaining words, an inverted index is created, associating each word with the columns they were found in. SQL Server itself includes a Gatherer component that monitors changes to tables and invokes the indexer in case of updates.|$|E
50|$|AkelPad {{can also}} detect non-text (i.e. <b>binary)</b> <b>files</b> and will issue a message. <b>Binary</b> <b>files</b> can, however, be loaded and edited (e.g. {{internal}} text) if desired.|$|R
50|$|Static {{analysis}} tools often use an intermediate representation. For instance, radare2 is a toolbox for <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> analysis and reverse-engineering. It uses the intermediate languages ESIL et REIL to analyze <b>binary</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>files</b> {{are usually}} {{thought of as}} being a {{sequence}} of bytes, which means the binary digits (bits) are grouped in eights. <b>Binary</b> <b>files</b> typically contain bytes that are intended to be interpreted as something other than text characters. Compiled computer programs are typical examples; indeed, compiled applications are sometimes referred to, particularly by programmers, as <b>binaries.</b> But <b>binary</b> <b>files</b> can also mean that they contain images, sounds, compressed versions of other files, etc.—in short, any type of file content whatsoever.|$|R
2500|$|Compilers {{are used}} to {{translate}} source code from a programming language into either object code or machine code. [...] Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the central processing unit's native instructions, ready for execution. Compiled computer programs are {{commonly referred to as}} executables, binary images, or simply as binaries– a reference to the <b>binary</b> <b>file</b> format used to store the executable code.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the default Word {{document}} format (.DOC) became {{a de facto}} standard of document file formats for Microsoft Office users. There are different versions of [...] "Word Document Format" [...] used by default in Word 97–2007. Each binary word file is an OLE Compound File, a hierarchical file system within a file. According to Joel Spolsky, Word <b>Binary</b> <b>File</b> Format is extremely complex mainly because its developers had to accommodate an overwhelming number of features and prioritize performance over anything else.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} OLE Compound Files, Word Binary Format {{consists}} of [...] "storages", which are analogous to computer folders, and [...] "streams", which {{are similar to}} computer files. Each storage may contain streams or other storages. Each Word <b>Binary</b> <b>File</b> must contain a stream called [...] "WordDocument" [...] stream and this stream must start with a File Information Block (FIB). FIB serves as the first point of reference for locating everything else, such as where the text in a Word document starts, ends, what version of Word created the document and other attributes.|$|E

Superly active in 2017, it is delivered by email (that was allegedly an invoice requiring payment) with an attached Microsoft Word document that contains malicious macros. When the user opens the document, {{it appears to}} be full of garbage, and it includes the phrase [...] "Enable macro if data encoding is incorrect," [...] a social engineering technique. If the user does enable macros, the macros then save and run a <b>binary</b> <b>file</b> that downloads the actual encryption trojan, which will encrypt all files that match particular extensions.

[...] After encryption, a message (displayed on the user's desktop) instructs them to download the Tor browser and visit a specific criminal-operated Web site for further information. The Web site contain instructions that demand a payment of between 0.5 and 1 bitcoin (as of early November of 2017, one bitcoin varies in value between $7,000 and $8,000 via a bitcoin exchange). Since the criminals possess the private key and the remote servers are controlled by them, the victims are motivated to pay to decrypt their files.|$|E
