50|$|The {{transition}} {{state of}} a structure {{can best be}} described in regards to statistical mechanics where the energies of bonds <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> have an equal probability of moving from the transition state backwards to the reactants or forward to the products. In enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the overall activation energy of the reaction is lowered when an enzyme stabilizes a high energy transition state intermediate. Transition state analogs mimic this high energy intermediate but do not undergo a catalyzed chemical reaction and can therefore bind much stronger to an enzyme than simple substrate or product analogs.|$|E
50|$|Viewed from a {{microscopic}} perspective, the dilution process involves {{three steps of}} molecular interaction: the breaking of attraction between solute molecules, the breaking of attraction between solvent molecules, and the forming of attraction between a solute and a solvent molecule. If the solution is ideal, which means the solute and the solvent are identical in an interaction, then all the kinds of attraction mentioned above have the same value. As a result, the enthalpy change caused by <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> attraction is canceled, and the dilution of an ideal solution causes no enthalpy change.|$|E
50|$|ReaxFF (for “reactive {{force field}}”) is a bond order based force field {{developed}} by Adri van Duin, William A.

Whereas traditional force fields {{are unable to}} model chemical reactions becauseof the requirement of <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> bonds (a force field's functional form depends on having all bonds definedexplicitly), ReaxFF eschews explicit bonds in favor of bond orders, which allows for continuous bond formation/breaking. ReaxFF aims to be as general as possible and has been parameterized and testedfor hydrocarbon reactions, alkoxysilane gelation, transition-metal-catalyzed nanotube formation, and high-energy materials.|$|E

The multiplicity of equilibria in the non-cooperative formulation of network formation games brings out further difficulties in analyzing stability of network structures. This contrasts with the cooperative game approach where payoffs for agents are predetermined and thereby the multiplicity of equilibrium issues are sidestepped. We took issue with the multiplicity of equilibrium effort levels exerted on a given network structure, and we suggested different stability definitions for such network structures under multiplicity of equilibria. We demonstrated how these stability notions work for the network structures with four agents where <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> links is costless, {{and the cost of}} exerting effort level is linear. ...|$|E

This occurs because the number of water molecules adjacent to a hydrogen-bonded pair and available to accept or donate a hydrogen bond is smaller in the interface than in the bulk.

Relativistic rotation is inseparable from spin, which for elementary particles is extremely high and exceeds mass on 20 - 22 orders (in natural Planck units). Such a huge spin generates frame-dragging that distorts space much stronger than mass, and effective scale of gravitational interaction is shifted from Planck to Compton distances. We show that compatibility between gravity and quantum theory can be achieved without modifications of Einstein-Maxwell equations, by coupling to a supersymmetric Higgs model of symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> a non-perturbative super-bag solution, which generates a gravity-free Compton zone necessary for consistent work of quantum theory.

Isotope exchange reactions allow isolating {{some parts of}} this reaction without introducing major structural or chemical changes.

We show that the difference in hydrogen-bond kinetics in the different environments can be understood in terms of the energetics and the concerted forming and breaking of hydrogen bonds.

A direct connection between a kind of molecular friction and gradual wear is established. The models are compared with some recent experimental results. The present computer simulations of the adsorption and mechanical desorption of oxygen help to explain how microscopic processes, such as the <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> of interatomic bonds, may affect macroscopic phenomena such as friction.

In particular it is discussed how the use of IXS has improved our understanding of viscoelastic properties of water at THz frequencies. This specifically involves some solid-like features such as the onset of shear wave propagation, a sound velocity surprisingly similar to the one of ice, and an anomalously low sound absorption coefficient. All these properties can be explained by assuming the coupling of THz density fluctuations with a structural relaxation process connected to the <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>forming</b> of hydrogen bonds (HBs). This review also includes more recent IXS results demonstrating that, upon approaching supercritical conditions, relaxation phenomena in water gradually lose their structural character becoming essentially collisional in character.

Emphasis is {{laid on the}} detailed analysis of density matrices rather than on energetics.

Bond orders, free valence and spin densities on the atoms are calculated. The present analysis shows that the bond-cleavage process is always more advanced than the bond-formation process in the transition state. Further analysis shows a development of the negative spin density on the migrating atom 'B' in the transition state. The depletion of the alpha-spin density on the radical site "A" in the reactant during the reaction lags behind the growth of the alpha-spin density on the terminal atom "C" of the reactant bond, 'B-C' in the transition state.
