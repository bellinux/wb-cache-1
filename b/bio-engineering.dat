5|$|The use of {{ultrasonography}} {{in medicine}} soon followed in different {{locations around the}} world. In the mid-1950s more research was undertaken by Professor Ian Donald et al., in Glasgow, which advanced the practical technology and applications of ultrasound. In 1963, in France, Léandre Pourcelot started on his thesis, which was presented in 1964, and used pulsed Doppler for blood flow calculation as its subject. This was followed up by Peronneau in 1969. Dr. Gene Strandness and the <b>bio-engineering</b> group at the University of Washington who conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease, published their first work in 1967. The first report published about the venous system appeared around 1967–1968.|$|E

25|$|In his 2005 book, The Singularity is Near, Kurzweil {{suggests}} that medical advances would {{allow people to}} protect their bodies {{from the effects of}} aging, making the life expectancy limitless. Kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine would allow us to continuously repair and replace defective components in our bodies, prolonging life to an undetermined age. Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current <b>bio-engineering</b> advances. Kurzweil suggests somatic gene therapy; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.|$|E
500|$|The final chapter, [...] "The Rebellion of the Tools", {{seeks to}} answer the final Gauguin question, 'where are we going?', by {{applying}} these past examples to modern society. Technological advancements in <b>bio-engineering,</b> nanotechnology, cybernetics, amongst others, {{have the potential to}} be progress traps, and the global scale of modern society means that a societal collapse could impact all of mankind. Wright sees needed reforms being blocked by vested interests who reject multi-lateral organisations, and support laissez-faire economics and transfers of power to corporations as leading to the social and environmental degradations that led to the collapse of previous civilisations. Necessary reforms are, in Wright's view, being blocked by vested interests who are hostile to change, including American market extremists. Wright concludes that [...] "our present behaviour is typical of failed societies at the zenith of their greed and arrogance" [...] and calls for a shift towards long-term thinking: ...|$|E

2500|$|... on the Fredericton {{campus is}} one of the leading {{research}} institutes in biomedical engineering in Canada. It was founded in 1965 as the <b>Bio-Engineering</b> Institute, making it one of the oldest research institutes to be solely dedicated to the field of biomedical engineering. The institute is also the region's prosthetic fitting centre where amputees are fitted with state-of-the-art intelligent artificial limbs. The institute also carries out research in the field of myoelectric signal processing, biomedical instrumentation and human motion analysis. The IBME also developed the UNB Test of Prosthetic Function which is used by researchers all over the world. Although the institute does not offer degrees in biomedical engineering, students at UNB usually enroll in one of the other faculties of engineering such as electrical or mechanical and pursue their research in biomedical engineering at the IBME.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to improve {{conditions}} for migrating fish, a £485,000 scheme to create a [...] bypass around the weirs at Arborfield was implemented in 2010. It was a joint project between the Environment Agency, Thames Water, the University of Reading, the Farley Estate and Arborfield Angling Society, created to meet {{the provisions of the}} Water Framework Directive. The channel provides a range of habitats, including a [...] stretch which is suitable for spawning fish to lay their eggs, and is expected to be of benefit to salmon, sea trout, eels and barbel. The first phase of the project, which involved repairs to four of the five weir structures at Arborfield, was designed to create lower water levels on the [...] section above the mill site, {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding. Cain <b>Bio-Engineering</b> carried out the construction work, and the project is expected to become a benchmark for such schemes.|$|E
