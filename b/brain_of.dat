5|$|The <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> Deinocheirus was reconstructed through CT scans and {{presented}} at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the cerebrum was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The brain was proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large brains, and the small <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> Deinocheirus may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance {{would not have been}} as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone microstructure study {{presented at the}} 13th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists in 2015 showed that Deinocheirus probably had a high metabolic rate, and grew rapidly before reaching sexual maturity.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} clindamycin in a murine model of toxoplasmic encephalitis using direct intracerebral inoculation. Clindamycin reduced mortality from 40 % in normal mice and 100 % in cortisone-treated mice to 0 % in both groups. Although {{we were unable to}} document appreciable levels of clindamycin in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> infected mice, the histological features of cerebral infection were markedly altered. The formation of large numbers of cysts and the intense inflammatory response seen in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> normal mice and the unchecked infection and tissue necrosis in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> cortisone-treated mice were absent in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> clindamycin-treated mice. Enumeration of cysts in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> mice 10 weeks after infection revealed a significantly lower number in the clindamycin-treated mice. Spread of infection to other organs was also decreased during clindamycin administration. These observations suggest that clindamycin may have a role in the therapy of toxoplasmic encephalitis...|$|R

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size.

Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

40|$|The <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> mammals such as {{carnivores}} and primates contain developed structures {{not found}} in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> mice. Uncovering the physiological importance, developmental mechanisms and evolution of these structures using carnivores and primates would greatly contribute to our understanding <b>of</b> the human <b>brain</b> and its diseases. Although the anatomical and physiological properties <b>of</b> the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> carnivores and primates have been intensively examined, molecular investigations are still limited. Recently, genetic techniques that can be applied to carnivores and primates have been explored, and molecules whose expression patterns correspond to these structures were reported. Furthermore, to investigate the functional importance of these molecules, rapid and efficient genetic manipulation methods were established by applying electroporation to gyrencephalic carnivore ferrets.

5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E

5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence <b>of</b> ageing, the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> people with AD have {{a greater number of}} them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe.

5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} Mycoplasma, which some think {{may be the}} cause of the TSEs. The lack of a cell wall means it is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, which target cell wall synthesis. Frank O. Bastian of Louisiana State University first discovered Spiroplasma-like inclusions in the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> a CJD patient during an autopsy in 1979 and has hypothesized that this bacterium could possibly {{be the cause of}} the TSEs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, {{was more}} consistent with crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E
40|$|The role of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in the {{pathogenesis}} of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) was examined by using IL- 6 -targeted mutant (IL- 6 (-/-)) mice. At 4 and 8 weeks after infection with the ME 49 strain of Toxoplasma gondii, significantly greater numbers of T. gondii cysts and areas of inflammation associated with tachyzoites were observed in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> IL- 6 (-/-) mice than in those of control mice. Large areas of necrosis were observed only in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> IL- 6 (-/-) mice. Tachyzoites were frequently detected {{in the areas of}} necrosis, suggesting that necrosis was caused by proliferation of the parasite. These results indicate that IL- 6 is protective against development of TE by preventing formation of T. gondii cysts and proliferation <b>of</b> tachyzoites in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> infected mice. Whereas in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> control mice, large numbers of inflammatory cells were always observed in areas where tachyzoites were detected, in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> IL- 6 (-/-) mice, only small numbers of inflammatory cells were observed in many areas with tachyzoites. Lymphocyte preparations isolated from <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> infected control mice had significantly higher ratios of gamma/delta T cells and CD 4 + alpha/beta T cells but lower ratios of CD 8 + alpha/beta T cells compared to those of infected IL- 6 (-/-) mice. There were no differences in the ratios of these T-cell subsets in spleens between these mice. The amounts of mRNA for gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) detected by reverse transcriptase PCR were significantly smaller in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> IL- 6 (-/-) mice than in those of control mice, whereas amounts of IL- 10 mRNA were greater in the former than in the latter. IL- 6 mRNA was detected only in infected control mice. The protective activity of IL- 6 against development of TE appears to be through its ability to stimulate IFN-gamma production and induce infiltration and accumulation of different T-cell subsets in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> infected mice...|$|R

Pharmac. exp. Ther. 153 : 428 â€” 433, 1966. Experiments {{were performed to}} determine the relative sensi tivities <b>of</b> the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> infant and adult rats to the catecholamine (CA) -depleting actions of two drugs, reserpine and tetrabenazine. CA concentrations in <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> infant and adult animals were determined at various times after reserpine (0. 1 mg/kg), 1 hr after tetra benazine (1 and 2 mg/kg), 18 to 24 hr after reserpine (0. 025 â€” 1. 5 mg/kg) and during and after 20 daily injections of reserpine (0. 1 mg/kg). A single dose of 0. 1 mg/kg of reserpine reduced CA concentrations more rapidly, {{to a greater extent}} and for a longer time in infant than in adult rats. One hour after administration of tetrabenazine there was a greater depletion of CA in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> infant than in the <b>brains</b> <b>of</b> adult animals.

5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> a human embryo looked first {{like that of a}} fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Another {{argument}} for sociality {{is based on}} the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water. The <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that Smilodons brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).|$|E

5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> much of the painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr {{makes the point that}} back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ untranslated region based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the <b>brain</b> <b>of</b> embryonic, but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following ligation of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E
