40|$|Gear {{failure is}} one of the most common causes of {{breakdown}} in rotating machineries. It is well known that vibration signals from machineries can be effectively used to detect certain gear faults. Yet it is still not an easy task to find a symptom that reflects a particular fault from vibration signals. This paper presents an advanced time-frequency signal processing technique for extracting important gear fault information from the vibration signal that is heavily corrupted by measurement noise. Experiments were performed on a <b>bevel</b> <b>gearbox</b> test rig using vibration measurements. The Time Synchronous Average (TSA) was initially utilized to eliminate all asynchronous component of vibration signal obtained from the gear. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) method was then used to capture the non-stationary behaviour of the impulse signal generated from the broken bevel gear tooth. It was shown that the diagnosis method using the Continuous Wavelet Transform combined with Time Synchronous Averaging outperformed the conventional spectral analysis, capable of identifying the angular location of broken teeth in the gear...|$|E
40|$|Signal {{processing}} is {{an important}} tool for diagnostics of mechanical systems. Many different techniques are available to process experimental signals, among others: FFT, wavelet transform, cepstrum, demodulation analysis, second order ciclostationarity analysis, etc. However, often hypothesis about data and computational efforts restrict the application of some techniques. In order to overcome these limitations, the empirical mode decomposition has been proposed. The outputs of this adaptive approach are the intrinsic mode functions that are treated with the Hilbert transform {{in order to obtain}} the Hilbert–Huang spectrum. Anyhow, the selection of the intrinsic mode functions used for the calculation of Hilbert–Huang spectrum is normally done on the basis of user’s experience. On the contrary, in the paper a merit index is introduced that allows the automatic selection of the intrinsic mode functions that should be used. The effectiveness of the improvement is proven by the result of the experimental tests presented and performed on a test-rig equipped with a spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gearbox,</b> whose high contact ratio made difficult to diagnose also serious damages of the gears. This kind of gearbox is normally never employed for benchmarking diagnostics techniques. By using the merit index, the defective gearbox is always univocally identified, also considering transient operating conditions...|$|E

50|$|Hub {{gearboxes}} {{are found}} on many large quarrying dump trucks {{and they were}} also an iconic feature of the Alvis FV600 chassis vehicles, such as the Stalwart and Saracen. The FV600 used {{a version of the}} DAF H-drive, with a single differential between sides and all wheels on each side linked by an internal driveshaft and <b>bevel</b> <b>gearboxes</b> to the halfshafts. This has no differential axle between wheel stations on each side and so 'wind-up' was a regular problem for these vehicles when driven on roads. If individual wheels were out of phase with their neighbours, possibly caused by cornering or slightly varying tyre diameter, this could place a considerable force on the gearbox, leading to breakages. For this reason, it was regular practice when driving on tarmac to bump the vehicle over a kerb or other object at times, to allow this wind-up to be released. On slippery surfaces like sand or mud there is enough slippage between the tyres & ground to dissipate the tension.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{vibration}} measurementanalysis {{has been}} proven to be effective for gearbox fault diagnosis. However, the complexity of vibration signals observed from a gearbox {{makes it difficult to}} accurately detectfaults in the gearbox. This work is based on a comparative studyof several time-frequency signal processing methods {{that can be used to}} extract information from transient vibration signals containing useful diagnostic information. Experiments were performed on a <b>bevel</b> <b>gearbox</b> test rig using vibration measurements obtained from accelerometers. Initially, thediscrete wavelet transform was implementedfor vibration signal analysis to extract the frequency content of signal from the relevant frequency region. Several time-frequency signal processing methods werethen incorporated to extract the fault features of vibration signals and their diagnostic performances were compared. It was shown thatthe Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) could not offer a good time resolution to detect the periodicity of the faulty gear tooth due the difficulty in choosing an appropriate window length to capture the impulse signal. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), on the other hand, was suitable to detection of vibration transients generated by localized fault from a gearbox due to its multi-scale property. However, both methods still require a thorough visual inspection. In contrast, it was shown from the experiments that the diagnostic method using the Cepstrumanalysis could provide a direct indication of the faulty tooth without the need of a thorough visual inspection as required by CWT and STFT...|$|E
25|$|The Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII was a bomber {{aircraft}} {{designed and}} built in Germany from 1916. Having built the Steffen R series, Siemens-Schuckert planned to produce a six engined Riesenflugzeug (giant aeroplane) for the Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches (Imperial German Flying Corps). In common {{with many of the}} other contemporary R projects, the R.VIII had all six engines inside the fuselage, where they were tended by mechanics, driving two tractor and two pusher propellers mounted between the mainplanes, via leather cone clutches combining <b>gearboxes,</b> shafts and <b>bevel</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> Two aircraft were built but only the first, R23/16, was completed. Ground trials began in 1919, after the armistice but were interrupted by a gearbox failure which resulted in a propeller breaking up and causing extensive damage. The second airframe, R24/16, was never completed and the first was not repaired after the ground running accident due to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. At the time of its completion the Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII was the largest aeroplane in the world; (the Mannesman-Poll triplane was to have been much larger but was not completed before the Versailles Treaty came into force).|$|R
50|$|Claudius Dornier {{gained the}} {{attention}} of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin while working on a proposed trans-atlantic airship during 1913. Later he appointed him as chief designer of the Zeppelin-Werke at Lindau, responsible for building large patrol flying boats. Dornier's first design to be built was the Rs.I. This was a large aircraft (Riesenflugzeug in the German classification) constructed largely of high-strength steel for highly stressed parts, and Duralumin (aluminium alloy) for low stress parts.The wings were {{on top of the}} hull and were braced with four sets per side of Warren strut style interplane structures comprising 'V' struts, which obviated the need for drag inducing wire bracing. The wing structure was formed with built-up steel spars, four in the top wing and three in the lower wing, and duralumin ribs riveted to the spars and braced internally. The fuselage was also made up from formed steel members built up into a framework which was then covered with fabric or dural sheeting.The powerplant arrangements were unorthodox, with the two outboard engines housed inside the fuselage, each driving a pusher propeller via shafts and <b>bevel</b> <b>gearboxes,</b> and a central pusher engine in a nacelle between the wings.|$|R

40|$|Designing and {{manufacturing}} of aeronautic <b>bevel</b> <b>gearboxes</b> {{is a complicated}} and time-consuming process because of complex kinematics of the machining process as well as numbers of manufacturing methods. Machine manufacturers usually provide algorithms used in manufacture process. This requires substantial financial resources and, in consequence, it increases the costs of production. Using other commonly available calculation algorithm {{requires a lot of}} studies to verify whether the proposed gearbox works correctly. In order to reduce the manufacturing costs of prototypes, it is possible to use Rapid Prototyping methods. Using both Rapid Prototyping techniques and coordinate optical measurements enables to verify the correctness of assumptions made in the initial stage of product designing. This approach reduces significantly both prototyping time {{and manufacturing}} costs. In order to ensure the effectiveness of prototyping process, it is essential to provide the accuracy of manufactured prototypes. That is the reason why it is necessary to determine manufacturing methods that will ensure the highest geometric accuracy. The study presents the modelling and manufacturing process of aeronautic bevel gear of demonstrator taking into consideration the accuracy of selected Rapid Prototyping methods. The gear modelling is based on machining simulation method conducted in Autodesk Inventor. The measurement results are shown in displacement maps obtained with an optical scanner Atos II Triple Scan and universal GOM Inspect Professional software, which determines the prototype accuracy in relation to 3 D-CAD models...|$|R
50|$|The AJS S3 V-twin was a British {{motorcycle}} {{designed and}} built by the Wolverhampton, England company A. J. Stevens & Co. Ltd.

The 50 degree V configuration was effective for air cooling and with a tank top 'dashboard' was conceived as a luxury cruiser. It had been expensive to develop and at £65 was {{more expensive than the}} 1000cc AJS of the same year, so the S3 did not sell in large numbers {{and by the end of}} 1931 AJS had gone into liquidation and been taken over by Matchless motorcycles who discontinued production.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{operating}} {{instructions for the}} Stalwart recommend that after travelling some miles on firm ground, the vehicle should be bounced over a kerb or railway sleeper to lift wheels clear of the ground, one-by-one, so allowing them to spring back and release the windup.
