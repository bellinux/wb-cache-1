25|$|In North America, {{hospitals}} resisted {{adoption of}} meter glucose measurements for inpatient diabetes care {{for over a}} decade. Managers of laboratories argued that the superior accuracy of a laboratory glucose measurement outweighed the advantage of immediate availability and made meter glucose measurements unacceptable for inpatient diabetes management. Patients with diabetes and their endocrinologists eventually persuaded acceptance. Some health care policymakers still resist {{the idea that the}} society would <b>be</b> <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> pay the consumables (reagents, lancets, etc.) needed.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{differences}} between Muslim majority Turkey and predominantly Christian majority Europe {{play an important}} part in the entire debate on Turkish accession to the European Union. In an analysis, based on the World Values Survey, the social scientists Arno Tausch and Almas Heshmati {{came to the conclusion that}} a robust measurement scale of global economic, political and social values and Turkey's place on them wields only a very qualified picture of Turkey's place on the maps of global values. The study, which is based on 92,289 representative individuals with complete data in 68 countries, representing 56.89% of the global population, looks at hard-core economic values in the countries concerned. From nine dimensions for the determination of the geography of human values, based on a promax factor analysis of the available data, six factor analytical scores to calculate a new Global Value Development Index were used, which combines: avoiding economic permissiveness; avoiding racism; avoiding distrust of the army and the press; avoiding the authoritarian character; tolerance and respect; and avoiding the rejection of the market economy and democracy. Turkey is ranked 25, ahead of several EU member countries. But there are still considerable deficits concerning the liberal values components, which are very important for an effective democracy. The deficits, the study argues, suggest that the Turkish state, Turkish civil society and European decision makers would <b>be</b> <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> continue to support civil society and secular democracy in Turkey.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{employee}} of the United States Department of State, Mills was Counselor to the Secretary of State; it is unclear under the Federal Rules of Evidence whether attorney–client privilege applies to these communications. Law Professor Patricia Salkin writes in The Urban Lawyer that [...] "government lawyers would <b>be</b> <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> caution their government clients, particularly if the client is believed to be an individual public official, about the uncertainty of the privilege for what may be about to be disclosed".|$|E

"President Rajapaksa would <b>be</b> <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> {{distance}} himself swiftly from his brother's stream-of-consciousness on sensitive {{issues that are}} not his business. This includes an outrageous comment that because a Tamil woman, an “LTTE cadre” who was a British national, interviewed in the Channel 4 documentary was “so attractive” but had been neither raped nor killed by Sri Lankan soldiers, the allegation of sexual assault by soldiers could not be true. For this statement alone, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa {{must be taken to}} task." ...|$|E

In its decision, handed down on June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court rejected the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test of process patent eligibility based on an interpretation of the language of § 101.

30|$|Recommendations Career {{researchers}} {{interested in}} the dynamics of career success <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> operationalize objective career success with multiple measures (salary, position/status, promotions). They should also collect data on the employment context {{as well as on}} the career stage their respondents are in because only then can objective career success measures be adequately interpreted. Regarding subjective success career researchers <b>are</b> also <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> take multiple measures of both self-referent success (job satisfaction, career satisfaction) and of other-referent success because the two capture slightly different areas of subjective success; and because they are both important as motivators for further – objective and subjective – success development.|$|R

2500|$|Additional vitamin-mineral supplementation {{may have}} an effect also in the {{developed}} world. A study giving such supplementation to [...] "working class," [...] primarily Hispanic, 6–12-year-old children in the United States for 3 months found an average increase of 2 to 3 IQ points. Most {{of this can be}} explained by the very large increase of a subgroup of the children, presumably because these were not adequately nourished unlike the majority. The study suggests that parents of schoolchildren whose academic performance is substandard would <b>be</b> <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> seek a nutritionally oriented physician for assessment of their children's nutritional status as a possible etiology.|$|E

50|$|Sodium {{silicate}} {{was also}} used as an egg preservation agent through the early 20th century with large success.

The happiest Frenchman cannot possibly be as happy as the most wretched Britisher, for the reason that Britain owns many more thousands of square miles than France possesses. The Swiss peasant, compared with the Russian serf, must, when he looks at the map of Europe and Asia, feel himself to be a miserable creature. The reason that everybody in America is happy and good is to be {{explained by the fact that}} America has an area equal to that of the entire moon.
