I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|Pall Mall was {{constructed}} in 1661, replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket (approximately where Warwick House Street is now) to the royal residence, St James's Palace. Historical research suggests a road had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> location since Saxon times, although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century {{in connection with a}} leper colony at St James's Hospital. When St. James's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century, the park's boundary wall was built along {{the south side of the}} road. In 1620, the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{growth in}} the state since the Mexican Revolution has led to steady {{population}} growth. However, this population growth has been concentrated on the arid coastline due to the dominant agriculture and fishing industries. Eighty five percent of Sonora’s population growth since 1970 has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area. Another area where there have been gains are municipalities with industry, such as in Hermosillo and along the United States border. However, those municipalities with none of these economic advantages do not see population growth and some see population decreases. Despite population growth, Sonora {{is still one of}} the least densely populated states in the country. About 90% of the state’s population is Catholic, with about 5% belonging to Evangelical or Protestant groups and over 7% professing some other faith.|$|E

In May 2012 she participated in the Scottish Parliament debate paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth as the UK celebrated her Diamond Jubilee. Lamont commented, [...] "60 years in the one job is good going– I've <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> one for just six months and some days, I have to say, it feels like 60 years– so we recognise the scale of the achievement of the particular, very strong woman."

[...] Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing {{with a record of}} 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.|$|E

[...] Series producer Emma Turner said at the time that [...] "(Abra) made a huge impact in the few episodes that he was involved in" [...] and expressed her delight that Edmondson had agreed to reprise the role. [...] TV critic Jim Shelley satirised the unrealistic storyline given to the character upon his return, deeming Abra's line [...] "Essentially, it's an experiment and illegal." [...] when explaining to the sister of a patient that he intended to transplant a pig's kidney into her brother's body, his televisual 'Bad news of the week'. However, Digital Spy's Dek Hogan was more positive about the plot strand, and especially the role of Abra therein, stating: [...] "It’s been a cracking take this, another example of the excellent form that medical drama has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> year, thanks in no small part to Adrian Edmondson marvellous turn as maverick surgeon Abra." ...|$|E
