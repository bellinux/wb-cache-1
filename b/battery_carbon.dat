The study uses descriptive statistics to analyse the data. Majority of the respondents are male and mostly subsistence farmers. It was a hobby to majority of the farmers to keep small ruminants. About 60 % kept them on semi-intensive system with flock size of 75 - 105 sheep/goat per farmer. All of the respondents agree that mange is the commonest skin disease in the area.

50|$|Among many {{advanced}} electrochemical {{energy storage}} devices, rechargeable lithium-air batteries are of particular interest due to their considerable energy storing capacities and high power densities. As the battery is being used, lithium ions combine with oxygen from the air to form particles of lithium oxides, which attach to carbon fibers on the electrode. During recharging, the lithium oxides separate again into lithium and oxygen which is released back into the atmosphere. This conversion sequence is highly inefficient because there is significant voltage difference of more than 1.2 volts between the output voltage and the charging voltage of the battery meaning that approximately 30% of the electrical energy is lost as heat when the battery is charging. Also the large volume changes resulting from continuous conversion of oxygen between its gaseous and solid state puts stress on the electrode and limits its lifetime. The performance of these batteries depends {{on the characteristics of}} the material that makes up the cathode.

An effort has been made to the understand structural and electrochemical properties of lithium iron silicate (Li 2 FeSiO 4) and its manganese-doped analogue. Starting from the X-ray measurements, the crystal structure of Li 2 FeSiO 4 was refined, and several metastable phases of partially delithiated Li 2 FeSiO 4 were identified. There are signs that manganese doping leads to structural instability and that lithium extraction beyond 50 % capacity only occurs at impractically high potentials in the new material. The chemical interaction energies of single-walled carbon nanotubes and nanoclusters were calculated. It is found that the interaction needs to be strong enough to compete with the energy gained by detaching the nanotubes and forming closed ends with carbon caps. This represents a new criterion for determining catalyst metal suitability. The stability of isolated carbon nanotube fragments were also studied, and it is argued that chirality selection during growth is best achieved by exploiting the much wider energy span of open-ended carbon nanotube fragments. Magnesium hydride nanoclusters were doped with transition metals Ti, V, Fe, and Ni. The resulting changes in hydrogen desorption energies from the surface were calculated, and the associated changes in the cluster structures reveal that the transition metals not only lower the desorption energy of hydrogen, but also seem to work as proposed in the gateway hypothesis of transition metal catalysis...|$|R
