It describes the design, construction, measurement and experimental testing of such a jump. It improves on previous efforts with more complete instrumentation, a larger range of jump distances, and a new method for combining jumper- and <b>board-mounted</b> accelerometer data to estimate equivalent fall height, a measure of impact severity.

30|$|The {{popularity}} of the contemporary smartphone makes it an attractive platform for new applications. We are exploring the potential of such personal devices to control networked displays. In particular, we have developed a system that can sense mobile phone orientation to support two kinds of juggling-like play styles: padiddle and poi. Padiddling is spinning a flattish object (such as a tablet or <b>board-mounted</b> smartphone) {{on the tip of}} one’s finger. Poi involves whirling a weight (in this case the smartphone itself) {{at the end of a}} tether. Orientation of a twirled device can be metered, and with a communications infrastructure, this streamed azimuthal data can be used to modulate various distributed, synchronous, multimodal displays, including panoramic and photospherical imagery, diffusion of pantophonic and periphonic auditory soundscapes, and mixed virtuality scenes featuring avatars and props animated by real-world twirling. The unique nature of the twirling styles allows interestingly fluid perspective shifts, including orbiting “inspection gesture” virtual cameras with self-conscious ambidextrous avatars and “reality distortion” fields with perturbed affordance projection.|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{power has}} been a viable design {{approach}} for decades, albeit almost exclusively in the telecommunications domain. <b>Board-mounted</b> DC-DC converters, for example, were constructed with discrete components and used to convert power from a centralized supply to more usable power, typically at a backplane. Subsequently, the advent of high-density DC-DC converter modules paved the way to more widespread use of the idea in EDP, industrial, military and medical applications. Since that time, the chorus of articles in the trade press extolling the virtues of Distributed Power Architecture has been increasingly loud and clear: centralized architecture is going or gone and DPA is king. Wait a minute. A recent article 1 underscored the idea that power architectures don't exactly take the industry by storm. Centralized architectures 3 / 4 although they have lost three percentage points of share since 1997, 3 / 4 still account for 44 percent of power systems. Earlier, in the spring, an article 2 declared that designers (unquantified) of military electronic systems prefer centralized power.

40|$|Vibrations are one the {{important}} parameter which influence {{the reliability of}} structures, also of microstructures. The paper describes an evaluation framework of circuit board reliability based on measured eigenfrequencies and amplitudes. The valuation includes the following main steps: 1. Experimental vibration investigations of the board {{by means of a}} laser scanning vibrometer By a special structure borne noise ecxitation in a definite frequency range the vibration behaviour of a mobile measuring system´s circuit board is investigated. Electronic components on this board with high amplitudes have to be detected. 2. Microscopic analysis of solder joints A metallographic analysis of solder joints of components with a high amplitude is performed to get exact geometry data for stress calculation. 3. Stress calculation of solder joints A local 3 -dimensional FE-model based on the experimental results is created. Stress has to be calculated under test conditions and compared with critical stress values. 4. Estimation of solder joint damage A so called "Cumulativ Damage Index" which is a measure for a failure-probability has to be calculated. Is the index lower than 1 no solder joint damage has to be expected. The vibration investigation of a first example showed a high load at a <b>board-mounted</b> plug. Amplitudes of 140 µm (10 Hz) and 1, 2 µm (64, 4 Hz) are used as input values for the numerical simulation. The calculated "Cumulativ Damage Index" are 10 - 22 (10 Hz) and 10 - 2 (64, 4 Hz). This means that no solder joint damage due to vibrational fatigue has to be expected. A same valuation was done with a second circuit board. Here a PQFP (Plastic Quad Flat Package) was identified as a critical component...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} {{experimental}} study, small Particle Impact Dampers (PID) were bonded {{directly to the}} surface of printed circuit board (PCB) or printed wiring assemblies (PWA), reducing the random vibration response and increasing the fatigue life. This study provides data verifying practicality of this approach. The measured peak strain and acceleration response of the fundamental out of plane bending mode was significantly attenuated by adding a PID device. Attenuation of this mode is most relevant to the fatigue life of a PWA because the local relative displacements between the board and the supported components, which ultimately cause fatigue failures of the electrical leads of the <b>board-mounted</b> components are dominated by this mode. Applying PID damping at the board-level of assembly provides mitigation with a very small mass impact, especially as compared to isolation at an avionics box or shelf level of assembly. When compared with other mitigation techniques at the PWA level (board thickness, stiffeners, constrained layer damping), a compact PID device has the additional advantage of not needing to {{be an integral part of}} the design. A PID can simply be bonded to heritage or commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware to facilitate its use in environments beyond which it was originally qualified. Finite element analysis and test results show that the beneficial effect is not localized and that the attenuation is not due to the simple addition of mass. No significant, detrimental reduction in frequency was observed. Side-by-side life testing of damped and un-damped boards at two different thicknesses (0. 070 " and 0. 090 ") has shown that the addition of a PID was much more significant to the fatigue life than increasing the thickness. High speed video, accelerometer, and strain measurements have been collected to correlate with analytical results...|$|E
40|$|Ever-rising Integrated Circuit (IC) power dissipation, {{combined}} with reducing product development cycles times, have placed increasing {{reliance on the}} use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software for the thermal analysis of electronic equipment. In this study, predictive accuracy is assessed for <b>board-mounted</b> electronic component heat transfer using both a CFD code dedicated to the thermal analysis of electronics, Flotherm, and a general-purpose CFD code, Fluent. Using Flotherm, turbulent flow modelling approaches typically employed for the analysis of electronics cooling, namely algebraic mixing length and two-equation high-Reynolds number k-e models, are assessed. As shown, such models are not specific for the analysis of forced airflows over populated electronic boards, which are typically classified as low-Reynolds number flows. The potential for improved predictive accuracy is evaluated using candidate turbulent flow models more suited to such flows, namely a one-equation SpalartAllmaras model, two-layer zonal model and two equation SST k-co model, all implemented in Fluent. Numerical predictions are compared with experimental benchmark data for a range of componentboard topologies generating different airflow phenomena and varying degrees of component thermal interaction. Test case complexity is incremented in controlled steps, from single <b>board-mounted</b> components in free convection, to forced air-cooled, multi-component board configurations. Apart from the prediction of component operational temperature, the application of CFD analysis to the design of electronic component reliability screens and convective solder reflow temperature profiles is also investigated. Benchmark criteria are based on component junction temperature and component-board surface temperature profiles, measured using thermal test chips and infrared thermography respectively. This data is supplemented by experimental visualisations of the forced airflows over the boards, which are used to help assess predictive accuracy. Component numerical modelling is based on nominal package dimensions and material thermal properties. To eliminate potential numerical modelling uncertainties, both the test component geometry and structural integrity are assessed using destructive and non-destructive testing. While detailed component modelling provides the à priori junction temperature predictions, the capability of compact thermal models to predict multi-mode component heat transfer is also assessed. In free convection, component junction temperature predictions for an in-line array of fifteen boardmounted components are within ± 5 °C or 7 % of measurement. Predictive accuracy decays up to ± 20 °C or 35 % in forced airflows using the k-e flow model. Furthermore, neither the laminar or k-e turbulent flow model accurately resolve the complete flow fields over the boards, suggesting the need for a turbulence model capable of modelling transition. Using a k-co model, significant improvements in junction temperature prediction accuracy are obtained, which are associated with improved prediction of both board leading edge heat transfer and component thermal interaction. Whereas with the k-e flow model, prediction accuracy would only be sufficient for the early to intermediate phase of a thermal design process, the use of the k-co model would enable parametric analysis of product thermal performance to be undertaken with greater confidence. Such models would also permit the generation of more accurate temperature boundary conditions for use in Physics-of-Failure (PoF) based component reliability prediction methods. The case is therefore made for vendors of CFD codes dedicated to the thermal analysis of electronics to consider the adoption of eddy viscosity turbulence models more suited to the analysis of component heat transfer. While this study ultimately highlights that electronic component operational temperature needs to be experimentally measured to quality product thermal performance and reliability, the use of such flow models would help reduce the current dependency on experimental prototyping. This would not only enhance the potential of CFD as a design tool, but also its capability to provide detailed insight into complex multi-mode heat transfer, that would otherwise be difficult to characterise experimentally...|$|E
40|$|As the {{performance}} of digital electronic components improves, maintaining the integrity of high-frequency signals through circuit boards becomes increasingly challenging. The dimensions and material parameters of in-plane circuit board features, such as striplines, microstrips and co-planar waveguides are tuned to control signal impedance. Conventional multi-layer vertical interconnects, which connect between board layers, are not impedance matched to the in-plane signal traces. Multi-connection vias, developed in this thesis, provide a method for matching the impedance of vertical and in-plane features by forming co-cylindrical waveguides. Solutions from a high-frequency full-wave solver provide insight into field interactions within multi-connection vias; and results from these simulations and signal integrity experiments indicate impedance "tuneability" by adjusting the multi-connection via dimensions. The results also suggest that features can be impedance-matched independent of via diameter. Multi-connection vias are formed by creating distinct conductor paths within cylindrical plated through-holes. The thesis explores several alternative manufacturing methods for fabricating these features. A specialized broaching machine and carbide-insert broaches were used to manufacture multi-connection vias for signal integrity experiments. Models of the broach tool and cutting force simulations resulted in several iterations of the broach design. (cont.) Broaching multi-connection vias is challenging due to the small diameters and high aspect ratios of plated through-holes, {{as well as the}} unique copper-epoxy/resin material. Since the broaching process prefers larger plated through-holes to permit larger broach tools, a new method was developed to analyze the cumulative connection density of multi-connection via arrays. Multi-connection vias provide fertile ground for the development of corollary electronic products. Simulations for connector launches indicate that via impedance control can extend to <b>board-mounted</b> devices and connectors. Products that may benefit from multi-connection vias include by-pass capatrs, IC packages, test probes and pogo pins. The thesis presents a road map for commercializing multi-connection vias.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of material resources on a planetary surface requires exploration strategies not dissimilar to those employed by early field geologists who searched for ore deposits primarily from surface clues. In {{order to determine}} the location of mineral ores or other materials, {{it will be necessary to}} characterize host terranes at regional or subregional scales. This requires geographically broad surveys in which statistically significant numbers of samples are rapidly scanned from a roving platform. To enable broad-scale, yet power-conservative planetary-surface exploration, we are developing an instrument that combines x-ray diffractometry (XRD), x-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), and optical capabilities; the instrument can be deployed at the end of a rover's robotic arm, without the need for sample capture or preparation. The instrument provides XRD data for identification of mineral species and lithological types; diffractometry of minerals is conducted by ascertaining the characteristic lattice parameters or "d-spacings" of mineral compounds. D-spacings of 1. 4 to 25 angstroms can be determined to include the large molecular structures of hydrated minerals such as clays. The XRF data will identify elements ranging from carbon (Atomic Number = 6) to elements as heavy as barium (Atomic Number = 56). While a sample is being x-rayed, the instrument simultaneously acquires an optical image of the sample surface at magnifications from lx to at least 50 x (200 x being feasible, depending on the sample surface). We believe that imaging the sample is extremely important as corroborative sample-identification data (the need for this capability having been illustrated by the experience of the Pathfinder rover). Very few geologists would rely on instrument data for sample identification without having seen the sample. Visual inspection provides critical recognition data such as texture, crystallinity, granularity, porosity, vesicularity, color, lustre, opacity, and so forth. These data can immediately distinguish sedimentary from igneous rocks, for example, and can thus eliminate geochemical or mineral ambiguities arising, say between arkose and granite. It would be important to know if the clay being analyzed was part of a uniform varve deposit laid down in a quiescent lake, or the matrix of a megabreccia diamictite deposited as a catastrophic impact ejecta blanket. The unique design of the instrument, which combines Debye-Scherrer geometry with elements of standard goniometry, negates the need for sample preparation of any kind, and thus negates the need for power-hungry and mechanically-complex sampling systems that would have to chip, crush, sieve, and mount the sample for x-ray analysis. Instead, the instrument is simply rested on the sample surface of interest (like a hand lens); the device can interrogate rough rock surfaces, coarse granular material, or fine rock flour. A breadboard version of the instrument has been deployed from the robotic arm of the Marsokhod rover in field trials at NASA Ames, where large vesicular boulders were x-rayed to demonstrate the functionality of the instrument design, and the ability of such a device to comply with constraints imposed by a roving platform. Currently under development is a flight prototype concept of this instrument that will weigh 0. 3 kg, using about 4500 J of energy per sample analysis. It requires about 5 min. for XRD analysis, and about 30 min. for XRF interrogation. Its small mass and rugged design make it ideal for deployment on small rovers of the type currently envisaged for the exploration of Mars (e. g., Sojourner-scale platforms). The design utilizes a monolithic P-N junction photodiode pixel array for XRD, a Si PIN photodiode/avalanche photodiode system for XRF, and an endoscopic imaging camera system unobtrusively embedded between the detectors and the x-ray source (the endoscope with its <b>board-mounted</b> camera can be adapted for IR light in addition to visible wavelenths. A rugged, miniature (7 cu cm) x-ray source for the instrument has already been breadboarded...|$|E
