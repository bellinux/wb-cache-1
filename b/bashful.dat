Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an {{intruder}} has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, {{and all of the}} dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after they learn she can cook and clean beautifully. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.|$|E

25|$|Beecher Ray Kirby (December 26, 1911October 17, 2002), {{better known}} as <b>Bashful</b> Brother Oswald, was an American country {{musician}} who popularized {{the use of the}} resonator guitar and Dobro. He played with Roy Acuff's Smoky Mountain Boys and {{was a member of the}} Grand Ole Opry.|$|E
25|$|It {{was with}} the Acuff band that Kirby became {{introduced}} as <b>Bashful</b> Brother Oswald, with Kirby posing as {{the brother of the}} band's banjoist, Rachel Veach ("Queen of the Hills"), so that it would appear to audiences that the unmarried Veach was being chaperoned by a family member. To fit his new persona, Kirby created the clownish Oswald character, wearing a floppy, wide-brimmed hat, tattered bib overalls, oversized work shoes and adopting a braying laugh.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} Opry, Acuff {{spent several years}} touring the Western United States, {{although}} demand for his appearances dwindled {{with the lack of}} national exposure and the rise of musicians such as Ernest Tubb and Eddy Arnold, who were more popular with younger audiences. He eventually returned to the Opry, although by the 1960s, his record sales had dropped off considerably. After nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of Sparta, Tennessee, in 1965, Acuff pondered retiring, making only token appearances on the Opry stage and similar shows, and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate <b>Bashful</b> Brother Oswald.|$|E

Ovid's episode tells the story of Hyrieus and two gods, Jupiter and Neptune, although Ovid is <b>bashful</b> about the climax; Ovid makes Hyrieus a poor man, which means the sacrifice of an entire ox is more generous. There is also a single mention of Orion in his Art of Love, as a sufferer from unrequited love: [...] "Pale Orion wandered in the forest for Side." ...|$|E
500|$|An entire {{issue of}} the {{academic}} journal Safundi was devoted to Django Unchained: [...] "Django Unchained and the Global Western," [...] featuring scholars who contextualize Tarantino's film as a classic [...] "western". Dana Phillips writes: [...] "Tarantino's film is immensely entertaining, not despite {{but because it is}} so very audacious—even, at times, downright lurid, thanks to its treatment of slavery, race relations, and that staple of the Western, violence. No doubt these are matters that another director would have handled more delicately, and with less stylistic excess, than Tarantino, who has never been <b>bashful.</b> Another director also would have been less willing to proclaim his film the first in a new genre, the 'Southern'." ...|$|E

[...] FHM included it on its 2011 list of six games [...] "that shamelessly used sex to sell" [...] but adding that it was actually [...] "funny, well-crafted, and well-written" [...] and [...] "has become kind of like a cult classic among gaming fans." [...] In 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time, commenting: [...] "A humor-filled adventure game that wasn't <b>bashful</b> about showing some skin? The world hadn't seen anything like it." ...|$|E
500|$|Disney's {{public persona}} was very {{different}} from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described him as [...] "almost painfully shy... diffident" [...] and self-deprecating. According to his biographer Richard Schickel, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney [...] "played the role of a <b>bashful</b> tycoon who was embarrassed in public" [...] and knew that he was doing so. Disney acknowledged the façade, and told a friend that [...] "I'm not Walt Disney. I {{do a lot of things}} Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink." [...] Critic Otis Ferguson, in The New Republic, called the private Disney: [...] "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney." [...] Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said [...] "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of several cast members {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior {{to the rest of}} the cast; [...] "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano." [...] Similarly, The New Yorker Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice Karina Longworth concluded: [...] "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably <b>bashful</b> nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself." [...] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a [...] "scruffy warmth and humor" [...] vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Mantle played Maynard in Ben Bolt's TV movie, Second Nature, which starred Alec Baldwin in {{the leading}} role, and {{appeared}} in the first episode of the series Fortysomething. He portrayed Percy, described as a [...] "big, <b>bashful</b> Northern mill-worker who lives with his mum", in Patrick Sanford's stage production of Rattle of a Simple Man at the Clwyd Theatr Cymru in Mold, Flintshire. Gail Cooper of the Western Mail praised his performance and said: Mantle, better known as dishy and confident consultant Mike Barrett in Casualty, is cast completely against type as Percy, the 42-year-old virgin who admits to being only 35. His body language is superb: awkward, self-effacing, obsessively tidy – Coronation Street fans should think Roy Cropper {{if they want to}} imagine the sort of man Percy is. In 2003, Mantle began filming The Bingo Club, one of five specially commissioned one-hour plays which were screened in January 2004 on BBC1. Co-starring Paula Wilcox and John McArdle, The Bingo Tales relates the story of three women facing romantic hardship and growing old. During production, Mantle fell on his face while shooting a fencing scene and was rushed to Selly Oak Hospital with a ruptured ligament in his leg.|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1934, twenty-one {{pages of}} notes—entitled [...] "Snowwhite suggestions"—were {{compiled}} by staff writer Richard Creedon, suggesting the principal characters, {{as well as}} situations and 'gags' for the story. As Disney had stated {{at the very beginning}} of the project, the main attraction of the story for him was the Seven Dwarfs, and their possibilities for [...] "screwiness" [...] and [...] "gags"; the three story meetings held in October and attended by Disney, Creedon, Larry Morey, Albert Hurter, Ted Sears and Pinto Colvig were dominated by such subjects. At this point, Disney felt that the story should begin with Snow White's discovery of the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. Walt Disney had suggested from the beginning that each of the dwarfs, whose names and personalities are not stated in the original fairy tale, could have individual personalities. The dwarfs names were chosen from a pool of about fifty potentials, including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty, and Burpy. The seven finalists were chosen through a process of elimination. The leader of the dwarfs, required to be pompous, self-important and bumbling, was named Doc; others were named for their distinguishing character traits. At the end of the October story meetings, however, only Doc, Grumpy, <b>Bashful,</b> Sleepy and Happy of the final seven were named; at this point, Sneezy and Dopey were replaced by 'Jumpy' and an unnamed seventh dwarf.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the film. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised the subtle and refreshing humour, noting that [...] "Gowariker shows a flair for light scenes and creating atmospheric nuances" [...] but criticising the loopy screenplay. Verma called it [...] "ultimately a performance-oriented film", stating: [...] "A terrific ensemble cast {{from the world of}} television and theatre collaborate to its feel-good believability which lasts as long as their screen time." [...] She particularly praised Chopra's performance and wrote: [...] "Priyanka Chopra transforms into 12 new skins with astonishing distinction, voice and spirit. The actress reinvents herself into this unique individual every single time ranging from batty, <b>bashful</b> and boisterous. This is simply her show." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave a mixed review, noting that the film could have been hugely entertaining but was affected by [...] "a repetitive layout and agonising length". She believed that the film was watchable because of Priyanka Chopra's [...] "consistently stellar act"; she carried the film ably on her shoulders and gave [...] "a fun and uninhibited performance." [...] Namrata Joshi of Outlook gave the film 2 stars out of 4. She thought that Chopra played her characters [...] "competently, confidently but a bit unevenly" [...] and wrote: [...] "The one trump card for the film is the new queen bee Priyanka Chopra. The film is out-and-out a Priyanka show as she hogs screen time and audience attention with her 12 roles." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, {{but they made}} their final {{decision}} with newly created character Judge Doom. Doom {{was supposed to have}} an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons. Doom's five-man [...] "Weasel Gang" [...] (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, <b>Bashful,</b> Sneezy and Dopey) who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). There were originally seven weasels to mimic the dwarf's complement, but eventually two of them, Slimey and Slezey, were written out of the script. Further references included The [...] "Ink and Paint Club" [...] resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of [...] "The Dip" [...] to eliminate all the Toons as Hitler's Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who [...] killed Bambi's Mother, but Disney objected to the idea. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a Taxicab. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme's funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Heckle and Jeckle, Chip n' Dale, Mighty Mouse, Superman, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Clarabelle Cow, and The Seven Dwarfs in cameo appearances. However, the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film's title, working titles included Murder in Toontown, Toons, Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills, The Toontown Trial, Trouble in Toontown, and Eddie Goes to Toontown.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 20, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with the love affair of two young people, both of whose parents are anxious that they should wed. Young Marlow sent by his father to court {{the daughter of an}} old friend, Mr. Hardcastle. Marlow has spent very little time in the company of the fairer sex, and as a consequence thereof is always shy and nervous in their presence. He, therefore, accepts his father's orders unwillingly and, accompanied by his friend, young Hastings, rides out to meet his future bride. On the road the travelers encounter Hardcastle's stepson, Tony Lumpkin, who in revenge for punishment his stepfather has inflicted, directs Marlow and his friend to the Hardcastle mansion, claiming that it is an inn where they will be well treated. In the meantime, great preparations are being made at the Hardcastle home for the reception of Hardcastle's old friend, and when Tony ushers in young Marlow, thinking Hardcastle merely the proprietor of an inn, he treats him with scant courtesy and orders him about, much to the older man's chagrin. Hardcastle is subjected to his daughter's extravagant costumes, and she appears on this memorable evening dressed in a simple dress and wearing the cap and apron that housewives in the neighborhood assume. This costume greatly pleases her father, but leads young Marlow further astray. He immediately jumps to the conclusion that she is a most attractive barmaid and loses his heart to her in short order. Upon the arrival of his father, Marlow learns his mistake as regards the inn question, but flatly refuses to marry Hardcastle's daughter, claiming that she is too grand for him, and citing his preference for the maid servant. While in the act of making love to the supposed barmaid he is discovered by his father, and, when told that this is the young lady his father had intended him to marry, he is overjoyed, as he feels sure that his <b>bashful</b> disposition would never have allowed him to woo and win her had he known her to be a lady of fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Schilling of The Japan Times {{rated the}} film 5 out of 5 stars and {{observed}} that Summer Wars [...] "may contain familiar elements, beginning with its <b>bashful,</b> moonstruck young hero, but it combines them in ways fresh, contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative". He {{also said that}} the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an [...] "analog world" [...] and a [...] "realm of digital devices". Schilling titled his article [...] "The future king of Japanese animation may be with us; Hosoda steps out of Miyazaki's shadow with dazzling new film". He praised Sadamoto, Aoyama and Nishida for producing [...] "scenes of animated spectacle that, in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention, makes the usual SF/fantasy anime look childish and dull". Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [...] "cries went out immediately hailing him [...] as the heir apparent". He claimed that with Summer Wars, [...] "Hosoda is the new king, the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan and– quite possibly– the world." [...] Rosset praised the film itself as [...] "richly detailed and beautifully written...gorgeous to look at." [...] and [...] "blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller." [...] He also noted that [...] "The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film's greatest strengths" [...] while also highlighting that, of the virtual world of OZ, [...] "Here the creative minds of Madhouse can let their imagination run wild." [...] With regards to the technical aspects, Rosset called the film [...] "a top class audiovisual show." [...] He concluded by writing [...] "Mamoru Hosada deserves a place {{as one of the top}} contemporary Japanese animators. And it's good to know that once the time comes for Miyazaki to retire (not too soon I hope!) there's people capable of following his steps." [...] The Korean newspaper Herald Business saw the film's fantasy theme and gorgeous animation as a differentiator from works produced by Hollywood studios.|$|E

2500|$|In Tokyo Babylon Subaru {{appears as}} a cheerful yet <b>bashful</b> {{teenager}} from Tokyo, utterly devoted to helping others—both {{in his capacity as}} Japan's most powerful onmyōji.

Subaru lives alongside his sister Hokuto, whose personality had become the polar opposite to his own—eccentric and outgoing. Subaru and Hokuto are good friends with a kindly and magically-aware veterinarian named Seishirō Sakurazuka, whom they met at a railway station after Subaru's shikigami led him on a bizarre chase. Seishirō acts as guardian to both and claims to love Subaru romantically.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Geisel {{authorized}} Revell, {{the well-known}} plastic model-making company, {{to make a}} series of [...] "animals" [...] that snapped together rather than being glued together, and could be assembled, disassembled, and re-assembled [...] "in thousands" [...] of ways. The series was called the [...] "Dr. Seuss Zoo" [...] and included Gowdy the Dowdy Grackle, Norval the <b>Bashful</b> Blinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle, and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion. The basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, {{and so it was}} possible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially unlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this by selling Gowdy, Norval, and Tingo together in a [...] "Gift Set" [...] as well as individually).

2500|$|The first {{academic}} {{cultural studies}} of southwestern Alaska Eskimos were developed {{only in the}} late 1940s. This was {{due in part to}} a dearth of English-language documentation, as well as competition in the field of other subject areas. American anthropologist Margaret Lantis (1906 [...] 2006) published The Social Culture of the Nunivak Eskimo in 1946; it was the first complete description of any Alaskan indigenous group. She began Alaskan Eskimo Ceremonialism (1947) as a broad study of Alaskan Eskimo. James W. VanStone (1925 [...] 2001), an American cultural anthropologist, and Wendell H. Oswalt were among the earliest scholars to undertake significant archaeological research in the Yup'ik region. VanStone demonstrates the ethnographic approach to cultural history in Eskimos of the Nushagak River: An Ethnographic History (1967). Wendell Oswalt published a comprehensive ethnographic history of the Yukon- Kuskokwim delta region, the longest and most detailed work on Yup'ik history to date in <b>Bashful</b> No Longer: An Alaskan Eskimo ethnohistory, 1778-1988 (1988). Ann Fienup-Riordan (born 1948) began writing extensively about the Yukon-Kuskokwim Eskimo in the 1980s; she melded Yup'ik voices with traditional anthropology and history in an unprecedented fashion.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, the Crazy Tennesseans {{moved to}} Nashville to {{audition}} for the Grand Ole Opry. Although their first audition went poorly, the band's second audition impressed Opry founder George D. Hay and producer Harry Stone, and they offered the group a contract later that year. On Hay and Stone's suggestion, Acuff changed the group's name to the Smoky Mountain Boys, referring to the mountains near {{where he and his}} bandmates grew up. Shortly after the band joined the Opry, Clell Summey left the group and was replaced by the dobro player Beecher (Pete) Kirby—best known by his stage name <b>Bashful</b> Brother Oswald—whom Acuff had met in a Knoxville bakery earlier that year. Acuff's powerful lead vocals and Kirby's dobro playing and high-pitched backing vocals gave the band its distinctive sound. By 1939, Jess Easterday had switched to bass to replace Red Jones, and Acuff had added the guitarist Lonnie [...] "Pap" [...] Wilson and the banjoist Rachel Veach to fill out the band's lineup. Within a year, Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys rivaled the long-time Opry banjoist Uncle Dave Macon as the troupe's most popular act.|$|E

[...] Eventually he received a gift of 1000 livres from Mary of Modena, mother of the Pretender and this, plus some support from home and an allowance from James enabled him to spend the rest of the year at the university. In 1717, he received a commission as colonel of cavalry and was ordered to prepare to go to Scotland again, but the plan, contingent upon support from the Charles XII of Sweden, was discovered and thwarted, and he continued at the university.

[...] He said, [...] "My whole damn family was nice." [...] They were a close family and highly supportive, {{especially}} in health matters, as they avoided doctors due to their religion. Despite having a religious background, he later became an agnostic. Fonda was a <b>bashful,</b> short boy who tended to avoid girls, except his sisters, and was a good skater, swimmer, and runner. He worked part-time in his father's print plant and imagined a possible career as a journalist. Later, he worked after school for the phone company. He also enjoyed drawing. Fonda {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts of America; Teichmann reports that he reached the rank of Eagle Scout. However, this is denied elsewhere. When he was about 14, his father took him to observe the lynching of a young black man accused of rape. This enraged the young Fonda and he kept a keen awareness of prejudice {{for the rest of his}} life. By his senior year in high school, Fonda had grown to more than six feet tall, but remained shy. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he majored in journalism, but he did not graduate. He took a job with the Retail Credit Company.|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, Einstein {{released}} the album Mazal Gdi (Capricorn), {{which was not}} very successful. He therefore looked for a new sound {{and went on to}} produce the album Puzi with the Churchills, considered the first Israeli rock album. He stopped performing live in the early 1980s. He said: [...] "I performed from the age of 18 until I was 42...I wasn't exactly a stage animal. I was held back by the embarrassment, the bashfulness, and it became more evident as the years went by... By the way, when I say bashfulness, I'm not proud of it... I wish I could grab a microphone and sing like a Sinatra, but I don't have what it takes, and a person should adapt to his capabilities. On the other hand, in the studio, I blossom. That's my natural habitat, where I'm not <b>bashful.</b> The problem is that this profession has its field mines: success is accompanied by fame and a form of adoration, and I really don't get along with that. That's where I draw the line. It's pleasant to be loved, but not more." [...] For those who knew Einstein this came as no surprise. Einstein was regarded as a very humble and modest musician who focused solely on the artistic and creative aspect of the musical world and actively shied away from the lime-light, fame, and the entertainment business. This was also evident much later in his career when he preferred to collaborate with lesser known and younger musicians as the lifestyle and obsession with fame of more prominent artists did not suit his style.|$|E
