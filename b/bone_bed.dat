5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} Paleocene of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early Eocene) in age. That age has been revised, {{and now it is}} known that O. daouiensis comes from the same <b>bone</b> <b>bed</b> that is dated to the Selandian age of the Paleocene (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian <b>bone</b> <b>bed</b> of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest it is in the same evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the Eocene consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E

At the end of June 1989, Horner, his son Jason and his head preparator Carrie Ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen MOR 591 near the Blacktail Creek.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a <b>bone</b> <b>bed</b> in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time. From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E

5|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to {{the large number of}} known <b>bone</b> <b>beds</b> {{containing}} multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds that had been killed by drought or disease.

50|$|Many {{lines of}} fossil evidence, from both <b>bone</b> <b>beds</b> and trackways, {{indicate}} that sauropods were gregarious animals that formed herds. However, {{the makeup of}} the herds varied between species. Some <b>bone</b> <b>beds,</b> for example a site from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina, appear to show herds made up of individuals of various age groups, mixing juveniles and adults. However, a number of other fossil sites and trackways indicate that many sauropod species travelled in herds segregated by age, with juveniles forming herds separate from adults. Such segregated herding strategies have been found in species such as Alamosaurus, Bellusaurus and some diplodocids.|$|R
50|$|Dinosaur remains {{are among}} the fossils that have been {{recovered}} from the Cretaceous portion of the formation.

25|$|The type {{material}} was collected from mudstone deposits in June 1973 and initially {{identified as a}} juvenile Coelophysis bauri.

The <b>bone</b> <b>bed</b> excavated by Sankar Chatterjee and his students of Texas Tech University, in which Protoavis was discovered, likely reflects an incident of mass mortality following a flash flood. Chatterjee, who first described Protoavis, has assigned the binomial Protoavis texensis ("first bird from Texas") to the small cache of bones, allegedly conspecific. He interpreted the type specimen {{to have come from}} a single animal, specifically a 35cm tall bird that lived in what is now Texas, USA, between 225 and 210 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|A {{program on}} British {{television}} described that the drilling revealed, from top down: thick Cenozoic limestone; a graded sediment deposit from one tsunami, over 100 meters thick; the impact melted basement granite from the Earth's midcrust and shocked quartz.

As additional clues of the resulting megatsunami represented in a New Jersey quarry, a dense marine <b>bone</b> <b>bed</b> was found on the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary containing a mixture of dead sea animals with little or no damage from scavengers or predators.

40|$|AbstractThe mass {{burial of}} dinosaur bone fossils in the Late Cretaceous Wangshi Group in Zhucheng, Shandong Province {{has been a}} {{research}} focus in recent years. However, the provenance of the dinosaur bone fossils and the accurate depositional age of the <b>bone</b> <b>beds</b> remain ambiguous. Through U–Pb dating of detrital zircons collected from six conglomerate samples from the dinosaur <b>bone</b> <b>beds,</b> {{we found that the}} youngest single grain age (YSG) of sample 090414 - 24 -D was 77. 3  Ma, representing the maximum depositional age of the dinosaur fossil beds and sediments. This also indicates that the Hongtuya Formation was deposited during the Campanian. Dating results revealed an age peak of 120 – 110  Ma, which corresponds with the peak age of volcanic rocks of the Lower Cretaceous Qingshan Group. The volcanic rocks of the Qingshan Group are mainly exposed in Laiyang, to the north of Zhucheng, although a few also appear to the south and northwest. Through analysis of conglomerate composition and palaeocurrents in the sediments containing the <b>bone</b> <b>beds,</b> we found that the three different data sets of gravel compositions of the conglomerates were mainly composed of volcanic or pyroclastic rocks. Three different data sets of palaeocurrents suggested that the main sediment source of the Wangshi Group dinosaur <b>bone</b> <b>beds</b> was from the north−northwest of the Basin. Only one data set had a provenance south of the basin. This study revealed that the areas of Laiyang and the Yishu Fault Zone were the main provenance areas of both the dinosaur bone fossils and the sediments of the Wangshi Group in Zhucheng. The southern margin of the Zhucheng Basin may be a secondary source area. This research provides an important basis for judging the deposition time and the sediment source of fossil layers in the Wangshi Group, as well as reconstructing the palaeogeography of the Wangshi Group in the Jiaolai Basin...|$|R
500|$|Another {{specimen}} of E. annectens, pertaining to a [...] long individual from South Dakota, shows evidence of tooth marks from small theropods on its lower jaws. Some of the marks are partially healed. Michael Triebold, informally {{reporting on the}} specimen, suggested a scenario where small theropods attacked the throat of the edmontosaur; the animal survived the initial attack but succumbed to its injuries shortly thereafter. Some edmontosaur bone beds were sites of scavenging. Albertosaurus and Saurornitholestes tooth marks are common at one Alberta <b>bone</b> <b>bed,</b> and Daspletosaurus fed on Edmontosaurus and fellow hadrosaurid Saurolophus at another Alberta site.|$|E
500|$|All known Achelousaurus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Two Medicine Formation in Glacier County, Montana during excavations conducted by the Museum of the Rockies, which still houses the specimens. The discoveries came about by an accidental chain of events. In the spring of 1985, paleontologist John [...] "Jack" [...] R. Horner was informed that {{he would no longer}} be allowed to exploit the Willow Creek site, where he had studied the Maiasaura Egg Mountain nesting colony for six years. Having already made extensive arrangements for a new field season, he was suddenly forced to seek an alternative site. Horner had always been intrigued by the field diaries of Charles Whitney Gilmore who had reported the discovery of dinosaur eggs at Landslide Butte in 1928, but never published on them. In this locality, Gilmore had employed George Fryer Sternberg to excavate skeletons of the horned dinosaurs Brachyceratops and Styracosaurus ovatus. That summer, Horner obtained the permission of the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council to prospect for fossils on Landslide Butte, {{which is part of the}} Blackfeet Indian Reservation; it was the first paleontological investigation at that location since the 1920s. In August 1985, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered a rich fossil site on the land of the farmer Ricky Reagan, which was called the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and contained fossils of horned dinosaurs. On 20 June 1986, Horner and Makela returned to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and resumed work on the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry, which proved to contain, apart from eggs, more than a dozen skeletons of a horned dinosaur later named Einiosaurus. In August 1986, at a nearby site – the Canyon <b>Bone</b> <b>Bed</b> on the land of Gloria Sundquist, east of the Milk River – Horner's team discovered another Einiosaurus <b>bone</b> <b>bed.</b> Part of the discoveries made on this occasion was an additional horned dinosaur skull, specimen MOR 492, that later would be referred to (i.e., formally assigned to) Rubeosaurus, the genus name in 2010 given to Styracosaurus ovatus.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Horner {{had come}} to a more complex view of the situation. He still thought that the fossil {{material}} had been part of a single population but concluded that this had developed over time as a chronospecies evolving into a series of subsequent taxa. In 1992, Horner, David Varricchio and Mark Goodwin published an article in Nature based on the six-year field study of sediments and dinosaurs from Montana. They proposed that the expeditions had uncovered three [...] "transitional taxa" [...] spanning the gap between the already known Styracosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. For the moment, they declined to name these taxa. The oldest form was indicated as [...] "Transitional Taxon A", mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came [...] "Taxon B" [...] – the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon <b>Bone</b> <b>Bed.</b> The youngest was [...] "Taxon C", represented by skull MOR 485 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek.|$|E
50|$|The Erfurt Formation {{is known}} for its {{vertebrate}} fossils. Different kinds of fish, amphibians and archosauriforms have been found.

Since 2010, the area has brought forth considerable amounts of additional fossil material, including subadult and juvenile individuals. In 2014, based on fossils from this material, the genera Kulindapteryx and Daurosaurus were named. According to Godefroit, this publication was based on stolen specimens, and should be ignored. The material consists of six skulls, and hundreds of disarticulated skeletons found in two <b>bone</b> <b>beds.</b> Each skeletal element shows a single morphotype and Godefroit et al concluded, contrary to the earlier publication, that the <b>bone</b> <b>beds</b> are monospecific, containing but a single species.|$|R

500|$|The holotype {{specimen}} MOR 485 {{was collected}} by Hostetter and Ray Rogers from the Landslide Butte Field Area about [...] northwest of Cut Bank. In 1995 Sampson {{described it as}} the partial skull of an adult animal including the nasal and supraorbital (region above the eye socket) bosses (roundish protuberances instead of horns), and the parietal bones. Additionally, MOR 485 preserves some bones of the skull rear and sides, which in 2009 were listed by Tracy L. Ford as a right squamosal bone, the left squamosal, both maxillae, both lacrimal bones, both quadrate bones, both palatine bones, the braincase and the basioccipital bone. In 2015, Leonardo Maiorino reported {{that as part of}} the same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as MOR 485-7-12-87-4. A right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from the same Canyon <b>Bone</b> <b>Bed</b> site as MOR 485 (and catalogued under the same number), but only reported in 2010. Two other specimens were collected on the Black Tail Creek, [...] to the south of Cut Bank and referred to Achelousaurus by Sampson in 1995. Specimen MOR 591 is a partial skull and an about 60% complete skeleton of a sub-adult specimen that includes the vertebral column, pelvis, sacrum and a femur. It also includes lower jaws, catalogued as MOR 591-7-15-89-1. Both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete, only lacking the braincase and occipital region. MOR 591 is smaller than the holotype with a skull base length of about [...] Specimen MOR 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult. The skull only consists of the parietals, and the lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones, the surangulars and articulars. A fifth specimen is MOR 456.1, a subadult. None of the specimens were of an advanced individual age. According to Andrew McDonald and colleagues, the Achelousaurus finds represented single individuals, not bone beds.|$|E
2500|$|The Poison Strip Sandstone was {{the source}} of Tony's <b>Bone</b> <b>Bed,</b> a {{significant}} concentration of dinosaur bones.

The quality of the preserved remains in Tony's <b>Bone</b> <b>Bed</b> are [...] "highly variable". The condition of many of its fossils suggest the deposit accumulated gradually. Many of the bones seem to have been trampled before burial, and some of the ends of bones are missing and were likely removed by scavengers. None of the bones were preserved articulated with each other. All of this suggests a significant period of time between the deaths of the animals and their final entombment. Tony's Bonebed probably accumulated over time when the water in the river channel was low during the dry season.|$|E
