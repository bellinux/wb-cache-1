Due to poor planning, inadequate resources and strong Japanese defence, the landing failed at considerable cost to Australians, and as their efforts turned towards effecting a withdrawal from the beachhead and rescuing the stranded men, the attempt by the main force to <b>break</b> <b>through</b> from Ratsua also failed as tired troops came up against strong Japanese defensive positions.|$|E
