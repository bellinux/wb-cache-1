50|$|The {{laterite}} soils of {{the south}} cover most of western Al Istiwai and Bahr al Ghazal states. They underlie the extensive moist woodlands found in these provinces. Crop production is scattered, and the soils, where cultivated, lose fertility relatively quickly; even the richer soils are usually returned to <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> within five years.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} Ganda economy {{relied on}} crop cultivation. In contrast {{with many other}} East African economic systems, cattle played only a minor role. Many Baganda hired laborers from outside Buganda to herd the Baganda's cattle, for those who owned livestock. Bananas {{were the most important}} staple food, providing the economic base for the region's dense population growth. This crop does not require shifting cultivation or <b>bush</b> <b>fallowing</b> to maintain soil fertility, and as a result, Ganda villages were quite permanent. Women did most of the agricultural work, while men often engaged in commerce and politics (and in precolonial times, warfare). Before the introduction of woven cloth, traditional clothing was manufactured from the bark of trees.|$|R
50|$|The major {{economic}} activity for {{majority of the}} population is subsistence farming and crops such as cassava, yam, cocoyam, vegetables, maize, etc. are grown. <b>Bush</b> <b>fallowing,</b> mixed cropping and shifting cultivation are some of their farming practices. Livestock rearing is also common among some of the people. Palm wine extraction and stone quarrying are other economic activities also undertaken in Awgu. The major market in Awgu LGA is the Oye market. Various farm products are traded in the market on wholesale and retail basis every four days. Many of the people take their farm produce to sell in the market in exchange for other commodities they cannot produce. People from Nkanu and Enugu urban also patronize the traders in this market especially for cassava and vegetables.|$|R
40|$|The {{lengths of}} fallows have {{decreased}} {{in many parts}} of the Sahel due to agricultural expansion, which can have negative impacts on crop production when few other ways to improve soil fertility exist. However, the dynamics of agricultural expansion may change because of the changing role of agriculture in society due to increased livelihood diversification outside of agriculture. The results of this study, which combine very high resolution satellite images and interview data, show that the role of agriculture has changed in parts of central Sudan since the crop production per capita declined substantially during the past three decades. It is argued that this decline is linked to the increase in incomes from off-farm activities during the same period. The reduced role of agriculture implies that the majority of households have more than half of the land lying in fallow; however the amount of fallow land per household varies considerably. This has specific value for the debate about Acacia senegal <b>bush</b> <b>fallows</b> in Sudan since with respect to the availability of land, a potential for these fallows was shown...|$|R

Much of this land was farmed under the <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> system, whereby land is left idle {{for a period of time}} to allow natural regeneration of soil fertility. 18 million hectares were classified as permanent pasture, but had the potential to support crops.

5000|$|Today, many African {{economies are}} {{affected}} by the legacy of colonialism. In agriculture, the plantation systems that they introduced were highly unsustainable and caused severe environmental degradation. For example, cotton severely lowers soil fertility wherever it is grown, and areas of West Africa that are dominated by cotton plantations are now unable to switch to more profitable crops or even to produce food because of the depleted soil. Recently, more countries have initiated programs to change to traditional, sustainable forms of agriculture such as shifting cultivation and <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> in order to grow enough food to support the population while maintaining soil fertility which allows agriculture to continue in future generations.

50|$|In North Africa {{we look at}} {{the farming}} {{practices}} of the Egg on, a Nigerian hill farming community. The Egg on live in the Mada hills between Lafia and Akwanga. The hills lay between two rivers that Mada and Arikya. The altitude helps retain moisture on the hills due to early morning mists and fogs. The altitude also makes for earlier and longer crop cultivation. They practice <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> agriculture as well as mixed farming land management styles. They focus on growing yams, cassava, maize, beans, and African rice; much of what is produced is exported as a cash crop and is their primary source of cash income. The Egg on use a terraced agricultural system to maximize space on the hills. The goats that they raise are kept mostly for fertilizer used in farming. They are only killed on special occasions such as weddings. The Eggon use the diversity in their environment to maximize their production.|$|E

The trends in evaporative fraction over the IOP are also presented for eight sites. The high rate of evaporation from bare soil {{in the days following}} rainfall produces a variability in evaporation which makes differences between sites difficult to interpret on a day-to-day basis, but over the whole IOP it is shown that the millet uses a smaller proportion of the available energy for evaporation than the tiger <b>bush</b> or <b>fallow</b> savannah. The combined effect of differences in the total energy used and its partitioning into evaporation and sensible heat flux is demonstrated from the trends in cumulative total energy use and evaporation at the three southern sites, where it is shown that there is systematically less evaporation from the millet than from the savannah or tiger bush site...|$|R

The plant is native to Latin America but has since been naturalized other parts of the tropics. In Uganda, this species grows naturally in abandoned <b>bush</b> <b>fallows.</b> While cape gooseberry has been recently identified as a priority plant for commercialization, little is known about its value chain and potential as a cash, food, and or medicinal plant in Uganda. The objectives of this study were therefore to document and characterize the plant’s value chain, assess its demand and supply, and evaluate the contribution of the plant’s trade to the income of traders in Uganda. Primary and secondary data were collected using a market survey, focus group discussions, field observations, and key informants. A total of 120 value chain actors were interviewed in all the major markets of the city of Kampala, Uganda. The study reveals that the value chain of the plant is short but developing with gatherers/farmers, retailers/petty traders, processors, wholesalers, and consumers being the major stakeholders. Most of the cape gooseberry fruit on the market were coming from the districts of Kabale, Mpigi, and Wakiso, with 85 % coming from cultivated gardens and 5 % collected from the wild. The cape gooseberry fruit were found to have a high demand on the market, with 67 % of the value chain actors rating the demand as high. The average weekly sales for the traders interviewed stood at 49 kg. The supply of the fruit to the market was found to be high as well with 86 % of the value chain actors rating supply as high. Supply sustainability rating was significantly positively correlated with economic importance rating of the plant at 99 % confidence level (Kendall K = 0. 545, P < 0. 01, n = 120). The mean value of demand rating was not significantly differently to that of supply at 95 % level of significance (P < 0. 001). Economic potential of cape gooseberry fruit was found to be high with profit margins of 95 % recorded for some cape gooseberry products along the value chain.

40|$|Risk {{efficiency}} of rice grain yield {{and returns to}} farm operators' household resources generated from an improved short-duration cover crop fallow system were compared with (traditional) natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow,</b> and continuous rice-cropping systems. The improved fallow system involved maintaining "Calopogonium mucunoides", seeded into a natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> for 2 years before planting to rice. With no chemical fertilizer application, which reflects farmers' practice in the area, average grain yield for continuous rice (1, 185 kg/ha) and the cropping sequence incorporating a natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> (1, 175 kg/ha) did not differ, but were higher for the improved fallow system (1, 304 kg/ha). This suggests that nutrient contribution from the leguminous cover crop made up for critical crop N requirements in the improved fallow. Stochastic dominance of grain yield distributions from the improved fallow system, relative {{to the other two}} cropping systems, was more dramatic with no N fertilizer application compared to treatments with 30 kg/ha N. Average returns were highest for the improved fallow system, followed by the natural bush fallow-cropping system, and then continuous rice, under the no N fertilizer treatment regime. With 30 kg/ha N fertilizer, income risk efficiency was less clear (compared to treatments with no N fertilizer), especially between continuous rice and the improved fallow treatment, because of faster N mineralization effects on continuous rice. In contrast, the improved cover crop fallow system completely dominated the natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> treatment under both fertilizer regimes. Rice production systems that incorporated the leguminous cover crop fallow were superior to the natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> system, based on both grain yield and average farm income risk-efficiency considerations.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate weed seedbank characteristics and weed population dynamics in arable fields in natural and planted-fallow systems. The study plots were at Mbaise, a densely populated area of southeastern Nigeria, where farmers regenerate their exhausted soils by maintaining planted fallows of Dactyladenia barteri (Hook.

The effect of three years of fallow on the weed flora of arable fields in the two fallow management systems differed remarkably. The first flush of weeds on fields that were cultivated after three years of planted D. barteri fallow (Mbaise) consisted of 80 % broadleaf weeds, 7 % grass weeds and 13 % sedges. On the other hand, the first flush of weeds on the natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> fields (Umuahia) of the same fallow duration as the D. barteri fallow system consisted of 17 % broadleaf weeds, 70 % grasses and 13 % sedges. Three years of planted fallow caused 36 % decrease in weed seedbank at Mbaise relative to the cropped field while the same duration of natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> caused a 31 % increase in weed seedbank at Umuahia.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sustainability}} of traditional farming systems {{in many parts}} of Africa is threatened by losses in the variety of species, reduction in land, forest, soil and water resources under demographic pressure. Together with foreign influences these farming system are no longer in equilibrium with local culture and ecology and are therefore disintegrating {{due to the lack of}} local capacity to adjust to these changes. This has led to environmental degradation. The paper employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to: analyse the farming systems, assess the effect of cropping intensification on the climatic climax vegetation, and to establish the post-cultivation vegetation successions in fallows. It reports four crop fallow rotations: crop 3 years with 1 year <b>bush</b> <b>fallow,</b> crop 5 years with 1 - 2 year <b>bush</b> <b>fallow,</b> crop 10 years with 1 - 3 year <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> and continuous cropping. The post-cultivation successions present a plagioclimax dominated by Hyparhenia species with scattered shrubs maintained by cycles of cultivation and burning. The paper concludes that these shifting cultivation cycles involving cropping intensification and post cultivation savannization have deprived the farming system of its ecological benefits, that is, nutrient recycling through a long and mature fallow. The inability of the vegetation to reconstitute itself requires the development of farming systems that combine trees and crops in the field because of proven micro-ecological and ecological benefits. The paper therefore identifies the scope for the development of ecologically sustainable agro-ecosystems as a development path for shifting cultivation systems...|$|E

50|$|Robert Netting began anthropological {{research}} with the Kofyar in the early 1960s. In the Kofyar homeland population densities were high, approaching 500/km² in many areas. Netting's primary focus was on the Kofyar ecological adaptations, including the highly intensive agriculture being practiced and also the social institutions that were instrumental to sustainability. Much of the land was in annual cultivation, with animal herds providing dung compost for fertilizer, and steep hillsides were intricately terraced. Netting's Hill Farmers of Nigeria, a classic book {{in the field of}} cultural ecology, showed how social institutions such as household form and land tenure had adjusted to the intensive cultivation system. Netting compared adaptations of Kofyar and their neighbors to demonstrate Ester Boserup's thesis that agricultural intensification relates to the growth of increasingly dense population and decreasing per capita land area. Kofyar families farmed most intensively close to their homesteads while using less intensive <b>bush</b> and forest <b>fallow</b> systems, which required less investment, on more distant fields. Netting also observed that the Kofyar demonstrated a reversion to less labor-intensive long-fallow systems when land became available on the plains south of their traditional region. He further developed these ideas and placed the Kofyar within a much broader comparative context in his Smallholders, Householders.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{infiltration}} {{characteristics of}} soils under four different land use practices were studied in Owerri, Southeastern Nigeria. The land use practices considered were: arable crop land, <b>bush</b> <b>fallow,</b> continuously cultivated land and pineapple orchard. The study aimed at examining {{the effect of}} various farming practices on infiltration and determine the degree of relationship between infiltration rates and selected soil properties under different land use practices. The experiment was arranged in a random complete block design which was replicated thrice. The infiltration rates of the soils were measured using the double-ring infiltrometer. Soil samples from these areas were analysed for selected soil physicochemical properties. Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance, coefficient of variation and correlation and regression analysis. Results showed that <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> land had the highest average infiltration of 264 mm/hr while arable crop land experienced the least average rate of 164 mm/hr. From the analysis of variance, there was a highly significant difference (p= 0. 01) in infiltration rates among treatment means. The coefficient of variation {{was found to be}} 3. 35 %. There were appreciable relationships between steady infiltration rates and soil organic matter, bulk density and total porosity in the order r= 0. 963,- 0. 898 and 0. 899, respectively.

40|$|In the West African Sahel, few direct {{measurements}} are currently {{available for the}} major land-use types {{on the extent of}} soil losses by wind erosion. A measurement campaign was therefore carried out in 1997 to monitor windblown sediment fluxes using Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) sand-traps in a conventionally managed cultivated field and <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> in western Niger. Sediment balances were derived from the measured windblown sediment mass fluxes. Results indicate that sediment fluxes in a cultivated field increased linearly over distances up to 76 m irrespective of wind speed and duration. Sediment deposition over distances up to 47 m in an adjacent <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> was well described by an exponential decay function with a near constant trapping efficiency coefficient of 0. 11 m− 1 for incoming sediment mass fluxes between 10 and 45 kg m− 1. Soil mass balances up to − 17. 5 and + 10. 5 Mg ha− 1 were measured in a single storm in the field and fallow, respectively. However, 89 % of the sediment deposition observed in the fallow occurred within the first 20 m. The nutrient content of windblown sediment generally declined with distance into the field and increased with distance into the <b>bush</b> <b>fallow.</b> Because of the low nutrient content of the native soil, total nutrient losses remained very low (< 163 mg m− 2 for any given nutrient). However, such losses were by no means negligible compared to the average nutrient uptake by a millet crop. The present measurements confirm that wind erosion can result in substantial soil losses in traditionally managed fields on the sandy soil of the Sahel. The bulk of sediment transport is, however, predominantly short range as the saltating material is efficiently trapped by the natural vegetation of fallow land...|$|E
40|$|To create {{multifunctional}} {{buffer strips}} along a watercourse in an economically sustainable way requires consideration {{of many different}} factors. In this plan we have selected pollutant reduction as {{the main purpose of}} the buffer strip. We have also strived to achieve minimal income loss due to reduced production, increased biological diversity, good game preservation that leads to higher income from hunting, aesthetical satisfaction and possibility to profit from available subsidies. This is done mainly to make landowners/farmers more interested in creating buffer strips along water courses. As sand is the dominant type of soil in the area, the water course is less affected by surface runoff compared to if the soil would be clay or some other finer texture. Game preservation and subsidies have therefore been the main factors when establishing the width of the strip, because these require wider buffer strips in some cases. Most of the buffer strips have been left as fallow fields and multilayered vegetation systems have been strived for. This means combined tree, bush and grass/herb zones. To be allowed to plant <b>bushes</b> on a <b>fallow</b> field and also receive subsidies we suggest that perennial energy plants should be planted {{in some parts of the}} buffer strips. Perennial energy plants have several benefits, such as income when harvested and game preservation. In addition we have suggested planting and self rejuvenation of the local trees and bushes...|$|R

The objectives among others were {{to assess the impact}} of nitrogen, natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow,</b> and legume−maize rotations on weed growth and species composition in the forest/savanna transition zone (Ibadan) and northern Guinea savanna (Zaria) in Nigeria. At both locations, the experiment was arranged as a split-plot design. The main plots were green manure legumes (Pueraria phaseoloides [Roxb. ] Benth in Ibadan and Aeschynomene histrix Poir. in Zaria), a forage legume (Stylosanthes guianensis [Aubl. ] Sw.), grain legumes (cowpea [Vigna unguiculata {L. } Walp ‘IT- 90 K- 284 - 2 ’ or soybean [Glycine max {L. } Merr ‘TGx 1864 and TGx 1485 - 1 D’), natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow,</b> and continuous cropping with maize [Zea mays L. ]/cassava [Manihot esculenta Crantz] ‘ 82 / 00058 ’ at Ibadan and maize at Zaria. Grain legumes were either double-cropped in one season by growing short-duration soybean with cowpea varieties sequentially, or by growing long-duration cultivars within one growing season. Nitrogen levels (0 and 30 kg N ha− 1) were the subplot treatments. Weed data were collected in 2000 and 2003 after 2 years of continuous cropping or rotation with natural fallow or legumes. Weed density was significantly higher at Zaria (177 plants m− 2) than at Ibadan (149 plants m− 2). Weed dry matter was higher at Ibadan than at Zaria. Weed density and dry matter were lower in the green manure and forage legume treatments in both years at Ibadan. At Zaria, the forage legume treatment had the lowest weed density and dry matter in 2003 only. In 2003 at Ibadan, per capita weed population growth rate (WPGR) decreased in the green manure and forage legume treatments. There was an increase in WPGR in continuous cropping, double-cropping with cowpea and soybean, and natural <b>bush</b> <b>fallow</b> treatments. At Zaria, WPGR was not affected by fallow type or nitrogen (P> 0. 05). Redundancy analysis showed significant differences in species composition among the various treatments.

40|$|The Sahel has {{experienced}} strong climate {{variability in the}} past decades. Understanding its implications for natural and cultivated ecosystems is pivotal {{in a context of}} high population growth and mainly agriculture-based livelihoods. However, efforts to model processes at the land–atmosphere interface are hindered, particularly when the multi-decadal timescale is targeted, as climatic data are scarce, largely incomplete and often unreliable. This study presents the generation of a long-term, high-temporal resolution, multivariate local climatic data set for Niamey, Central Sahel. The continuous series spans the period 1950 – 2009 at a 30 -min timescale and includes ground station-based meteorological variables (precipitation, air temperature, relative and specific humidity, air pressure, wind speed, downwelling long- and short-wave radiation) as well as process-modelled surface fluxes (upwelling long- and short-wave radiation, latent, sensible and soil heat fluxes and surface temperature). A combination of complementary techniques (linear/spline regressions, a multivariate analogue method, artificial neural networks and recursive gap filling) was used to reconstruct missing meteorological data. The complete surface energy budget was then obtained for two dominant land cover types, <b>fallow</b> <b>bush</b> and millet, by applying the meteorological forcing data set to a finely field-calibrated land surface model. Uncertainty in reconstructed data was expressed by means of a stochastic ensemble of plausible historical time series. Climatological statistics were computed at sub-daily to decadal timescales and compared with local, regional and global data sets such as CRU and ERA-Interim. The reconstructed precipitation statistics, ∼ 1 [*]°C increase in mean annual temperature from 1950 to 2009, and mean diurnal and annual cycles for all variables were in good agreement with previous studies. The new data set, denoted NAD (Niamey Airport-derived set) and publicly available, can be used to investigate the water and energy cycles in Central Sahel, while the methodology can be applied to reconstruct series at other stations.

40|$|Rotational <b>bush</b> <b>fallowing,</b> the {{dominant}} agricultural land-use practice in Ghana {{is no longer}} sustainable as fallow periods have declined from over 10 to five or less years mainly due to increased population pressure on land, along with inter alia drought and rampant wild fires. Managed fallows have in recent times been useful in improving short fallow productivity {{in many parts of}} the tropics including Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, adoption of agricultural innovation by smallholders has often been poor. This is attributed to the inappropriateness of sound scientific breakthroughs to the complex socio-cultural and economic conditions that characterize rural livelihoods in the SSA. This study forms part of a bigger project that tested and developed managed fallow technologies in a participatory manner in three villages, Gogoikrom, Subriso III and Yabraso in the Atwima, Tano and Wenchi Districts of Ghana respectively. It involves a socio-economic analysis of livelihoods of farmers and their involvement in the development of the technologies to complement bio-physical aspects to ensure that technologies developed suit the socio-cultural, tenurial and economic circumstances of farmers and are adoptable by the farmers. PRA tools, mainly key informant, group and semi-structured interviews as well as structured questionnaire interviews of 242 households, were employed in collecting data to characterize the livelihoods of the people in the study villages. This guided the identification of suitable fallow improvement interventions and possible domains for their uptake. The data were analyzed descriptively and complemented with a regression analysis and analysis of variance to describe the infra and inter-village similarities and differences. Input-output data on crop, livestock and off farm enterprises were collected and analyzed to estimate farmers' financial resource capacity. Primary and secondary economic data on the technologies were gathered and analyzed through ex-ante cost benefit analysis to assess the profitability of the technologies. A chi-squared analysis was carried out to identify the determinants of adoption of the technologies. Community perceptions of the performance of the technologies and adoption potential were assessed and verified with a survey of 99 non-participating farmers. Farmer indicators were developed for evaluating the performance and the design of the experiments by participating farmers. Technology expansion and diffusion of knowledge gained by the experimenters were also assessed. The study area is characterized by two main classes of farmers, natives (indigenous landowners) and settlers (mainly tenants) whose livelihoods rely largely on the management of natural fallow rotations for the cultivation of a range of crops, i. e. maize, plantain, rice and cocoa for Gogoikrom; maize, plantain, cassava, groundnuts, tomato and pepper for Subriso; and maize, yam, groundnuts and pepper for Yabraso. However, fallow periods have declined and numerous associated problems of which poor soils, high weed pressure, poor yields and low farm incomes are paramount. Four interventions, namely: maize-legume relay suitable for all three districts; plantain-legume for Atwima and Tano; and cocoa-shade tree for Atwima and planted tree fallow for Wenchi were identified for on-farm experimentation after a series of ranking and discussion of interventions proposed at a stakeholder workshop to address the short fallow constraints. The interventions were experimented with farmers over two seasons. Farmers' assessment of the technologies over the two seasons revealed that the weed suppression and moisture conservation or retention potential of the maize-legume relay had been realized, V while they anticipated improved maize yields and a reduction in labour for land preparation in subsequent years. The major limitation to the use of this technology identified during a monitoring process was labour for weeding before and after relaying the legume to facilitate growth and spread. The labour constraint for relaying the legume can be addressed by targeting this activity to coincide with the first or second weeding as appropriate to the fanner. The weeding after the legume relay is a necessity where weed pressure is high as this may retard legume biomass productivity. The potential effects of the plantain-legume, cocoa-shade tree and planted tree fallow are likely to be realized in the long-term. However, farmers were hopeful that these technologies would address their respective targeted problems based on their judgments of the performance of the technologies at the time. The ex-ante economic assessment of the farmer experiments yielded higher gross margins, returns to labour, B/C ratios, NPV, LEV and IRR than the alternative options in the absence of the technologies but were sensitive to reductions in prices and yields. However, tenure, age and gender differences may be important in technology adoption. Although all the main community groupings participated in technology development it was observed that male tenants and landowners are potential adopters of the most preferred cocoa-shade tree technology in Gogoikrom-Atwima while in Subriso-Tano, middle-old aged, landowner men are potential adopters of the maize-legume relay and plantain-legume technologies. Native landowners including women are the potential adopters of the maize-legume and planted tree fallow technologies in Yabraso-Wenchi. The participatory technology development process was documented. It was observed that while the process was interactive, enlightening both farmers and scientists, farmers need to be encouraged to take greater control to enhance innovativeness and reduce research cost. Improving fallow productivity should be a national concern, as it has a wider implication on the livelihoods of rural people and that of the economy of the country. The majority of the producers that are directly involved in crop production may be tenants who are unlikely to improve soil productivity due to tenure restrictions. Government policies that encourage landowners to adopt fallow improvement technologies are required. Policies encouraging education, training or extension of improved fallow techniques are useful. Likewise, participatory policy research for improving traditional tenure systems to encourage sustainable land improvement need consideration. Policies that ensure stability in prices of agricultural commodities will improve farm income gained from improved fallow productivity and encourage the adoption of fallow techniques...|$|R
