5|$|Living in Brighton, Valiente took up {{employment}} in {{a branch of}} the Boots pharmacist. In 1971 she appeared on the BBC documentary, Power of the Witch, which was devoted to Wicca and also featured the prominent Wiccan Alex Sanders. That same year, she was involved in the founding of the Pagan Front, a British pressure group that campaigned for the religious rights of Wiccans and other Pagans. In November 1970 she developed a full moon inauguration ritual for local branches of the Front to use and on May Day 1971 she chaired its first national meeting, held at Chiswick, West London. It was she who developed the three principles that came to <b>be</b> <b>central</b> to the Pagan Front's interpretation of their religion: adherence to the Wiccan Rede, a belief in reincarnation, and a sense of kinship with nature.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} central Armendariz rings which are a generalization of Armendariz rings and investigate their properties. We show that the class of central Armendariz rings lies strictly between classes of Armendariz rings and abelian rings. For a ring R, we prove that R <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz {{if and only if}} the polynomial ring R[x] <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz if and only if the Laurent polynomial ring R[x; xn] <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz. Moreover, it is proven that if R is reduced, then R[x]=(xn) <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz, the converse holds if R is semiprime, where (xn) is the ideal generated by xn and n 2. Among others we also show that R is a reduced ring if and only if the matrix ring Tn- 2 n (R) <b>is</b> <b>central</b> Armendariz, for a natural number n 3 and k = [n= 2]...|$|R

Crystal Dynamics stated on their Facebook page that development on Guardian of Light had not affected development on the next main installment and reboot of the franchise, titled Tomb Raider.

25|$|A primary {{demand of}} the {{movement}} has been for decent, public housing and much of its work {{takes the form of}} opposing evictions. The movement has often used the phrase 'The Right to the City' to insist that the location of housing is critically important and demands that shack settlements are upgraded where they are and that people are not relocated to out of town developments. The movement rejects technocratic approaches to the housing crisis and stresses the need for dignity to <b>be</b> <b>central</b> to the resolution of the housing crisis. It is opposed to shack dwellers being moved into 'transit camps'.|$|E

25|$|Kabbalah {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>central</b> to Haredi Orthodox Judaism, which generally rejected philosophy, although the Chabad strain of Chasidism showed {{a more positive}} attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in Kabbalah. In academic studies, Gershom Scholem began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations, Jewish Renewal and Neo-Hasidism, spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah {{is a collection of}} esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can <b>be</b> <b>central,</b> {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying cause, if any.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of this conclusion {{is that it allows}} Davidson to draw on the work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to <b>be</b> <b>central</b> to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively.|$|E
