Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and <b>bandpass</b> designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple <b>bandpass</b> filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a <b>bandpass</b> filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{detailed}} study of the RR Lyrae period-luminosity (PL) relation in the ugriz <b>bandpasses</b> of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) filter system. We argue that tight, simple PL relations are not present in the SDSS filters, except for the redder <b>bandpasses</b> i and (especially) z. However, for all <b>bandpasses,</b> we show that, by incorporating terms involving a (fairly reddening-independent) "pseudo-color" C_ 0 = (u-g) _ 0 - (g-r) _ 0, tight (non-linear) relations do obtain. We provide theoretically calibrated such relations in the present paper, which should be useful to derive precise absolute magnitudes (hence distances) and intrinsic colors (hence reddening values) to even individual field RR Lyrae stars. For applications to cases where photometry in all five passbands may not be available, we also provide simple (though less precise) average PL relations for the i and z <b>bandpasses,</b> which read as follows: M_z = 0. 839 - 1. 295 log P + 0. 211 log Z, M_i = 0. 908 - 1. 035 log P + 0. 220 log Z.

Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution.

25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF <b>bandpass</b> filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF.

Sometimes, the attacker does not know which frequencies encryption is performed at. In this case, the trace can be represented as a spectrogram, which can help determine which frequencies are most prevalent at different points of execution. Depending on the device being attacked and the level of noise, several filters may need to be applied.|$|E

25|$|Ultraviolet microscopes {{have two}} main purposes. The {{first is to}} utilize the shorter {{wavelength}} of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the image resolution beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard optical microscopes. This technique is used for non-destructive inspection of devices with very small features such as those found in modern semiconductors. The second application for UV microscopes is contrast enhancement where the response of individual samples is enhanced, relative to their surrounding, due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself. One example is {{in the growth of}} protein crystals. Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions. As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm <b>bandpass</b> filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|E

It concists of two models, our auditory segregation model (model A) {{and the power}} spectrum model of masking (model B), and a selection process that selects one of their results. Model A extracts a sinusoidal signal using the outputs of multiple auditory filters and model B extracts a sinusoidal signal using the output of a single auditory filter. For both models, simulations similar to Hall et al. 's demonstrations were carried out. Simulation stimuli consisted of two types of noise masker, <b>bandpassed</b> random noise and AM <b>bandpassed</b> random noise. It was found that in model A, the signal threshold decrease as the masker bandwidth increases for AM <b>bandpassed</b> noise. In contract, in model B, the signal threshold increases as the masker bandwidth increases up to 1 ERB and then it remains constant for both noises. The selection process selects the sinusoidal with the lowest signal threshold from the two extracted signals. As a result, the signal threshold of the pure tone extracted using the proposed model shows the similar properties to Hall et al. 's demonstrations. The maximum amount of CMR in the proposed model is about 8 dB. リサーチレポート（北陸先端科学技術大学院大学情報科学研究科...|$|R
