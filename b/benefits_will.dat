25|$|Alba-Ramirez (1997) uses micro {{data from}} the Active Population Survey of Spain and logit model for {{analyzing}} determinants of retirement decision and finds that having more members in the household, and as well as children, has {{a negative effect on}} the probability of retirement among older males.

25|$|About {{halfway through}} the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to {{consider}} two different {{ways of looking at}} the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective <b>benefits</b> <b>will</b> control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.|$|E
25|$|The {{contraindications}} for mastopexy are few: aspirin use, tobacco smoking, diabetes, {{and obesity}} are medical and health conditions {{associated with increased}} incidences of nipple necrosis. In resolving the perceived ptosis {{of a woman with}} encapsulated breast implants, the surgeon determines her suitability for a breast lift procedure after explantation, which facilitates assessment of the true degree of ptosis present in the explanted breasts; likewise the assessment of the effects of a combined breast-lift and revision-augmentation procedure, featuring the removal and the replacement of breast implants. For the woman who is at high risk for developing breast cancer (primary or recurrent), the mastopexy might alter the histologic architecture of the breasts, which tissue change might interfere with the accurate MRI detection and subsequent treatment of cancer; the risks and <b>benefits</b> <b>will</b> be discussed in that setting.|$|E

500|$|This {{long period}} of wall-building {{burdened}} the populace and provoked controversy. Sometime between 1190 and 1196, during Zhangzong's reign, the high official Zhang Wangong (張萬公) and the Censorate recommended that work on the wall be indefinitely suspended due to a recent drought, noting: [...] "What has been begun is already being flattened by sandstorms, and bullying the people into defence works will simply exhaust them." [...] However, Chancellor Wanyan Xiang (完顏襄) convinced the emperor of the walls' merits based on an optimistic cost estimate – [...] "Although the initial outlay for the walls will be one million strings of cash, when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it, which means that every year you will save three million strings of cash... The <b>benefits</b> <b>will</b> be everlasting" [...] – and so construction continued unabated. All this work created an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a [...] "outer wall" [...] from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a [...] network of [...] "inner walls" [...] north and northeast of Beijing. Together, they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications [...] in length and [...] in diameter. Some of these walls had inner moats (from [...] in width), beacon towers, battlements, parapets, and outward-facing semicircular platforms protruding from the wall—features that set the Jin walls apart from their predecessors.|$|E

2500|$|There is a Social Security {{government}} pension offset {{that will}} {{reduce or eliminate}} any spousal (or ex-spouse) or widow(er)'s benefits if the spouse or widow(er) is also receiving a government (federal, state or local) pension that did not require paying Social Security taxes. The basic [...] "rule" [...] is that Social Security <b>benefits</b> <b>will</b> be reduced by 2/3's of the spouse or widow(er)'s non-FICA taxed government pension. If the spouse's or widow(er)'s government (non-FICA paying) pension exceeds 150% of the [...] "normal" [...] spousal or widow(er)'s benefit the spousal benefit is eliminated. For example, a [...] "normal" [...] spousal or widow(er)'s benefit of $1,000/month would be reduced to $0.00 if the spouse or widow(er)'s if already drawing a non-FICA taxed government pension of $1,500/month or more per month.

2500|$|In the United States, {{while the}} normal {{retirement}} age for Social Security, or Old Age Survivors Insurance (OASI), historically has been age 65 to receive unreduced benefits, it is gradually increasing to age 67. For those turning 65 in 2008, full <b>benefits</b> <b>will</b> be payable beginning at age 66. Public servants {{are often not}} covered by Social Security but have their own pension programs. Police officers in the United States are typically allowed to retire at half pay after only 20 years of service or three-quarter pay after 30 years, allowing people to retire in their early forties or fifties. Military members of the US Armed Forces may elect to retire after 20 years of active duty. Their retirement pay (not a pension since they can be involuntarily called back to active duty at any time) is calculated on total number of years on active duty, their final pay grade and the retirement system in place when they entered service. Allowances such as housing and subsistence {{are not used to}} calculate a member's retired pay. Members awarded the Medal of Honor qualify for a separate stipend, regardless of the years of service. Military members in the reserve and US National Guard have their retirement based on a point system.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{changing}} needs or personal preferences, {{a person may}} {{go back to work}} after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or survivors benefits and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker's spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn [...] "too much", the <b>benefits</b> <b>will</b> be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, Social Security deducts $1 from the worker's benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if you were receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) you would lose all ($14,760) of your benefits. If you made $1,000 more than $15,200/year you would [...] "only lose" [...] $500 in benefits. You would get no benefits for the months you work until the $1 deduction for $2 income [...] "squeeze" [...] is satisfied. Your first social security check will be delayed for several months—the first check may only be a fraction of the [...] "full" [...] amount. The benefit deductions change in the year you reach full retirement age and are still working—Social Security only deducts $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{each year}} since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, {{interest}} payments and other income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, for example {{by more than}} $150 billion in 2004. As the [...] "baby boomers" [...] {{move out of the}} work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds to pay their bills. The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total [...] "Social Security" [...] expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars, which was 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit). All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue. As the trust funds are exhausted either <b>benefits</b> <b>will</b> have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, upward redistribution of income is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.|$|E
