40|$|Many {{approaches}} to conserving and managing natural resources depend upon rules, but {{the existence of}} rules alone does not guarantee compliance. Information on rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> is needed for designing interventions to improve compliance. However, directly investigating rule breaking is difficult as perpetrators may not wish to identify themselves. Other disciplines have developed methods for answering sensitive questions but so far these have not been widely applied in conservation. Using rule breaking among fly fishers as a case study, we tested two methods specifically designed for collecting sensitive data (the randomised response technique (RRT) and the nominative technique), against a conventional self-complete questionnaire. RRT resulted in much higher estimates of the prevalence of rule breaking than the self-complete questionnaire, particularly for more sensitive questions. The nominative technique yielded extremely low estimates, possibly because respondents did not know enough about their friends’ rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> or {{did not want to}} discuss it in a face-to-face interview. Despite requiring large sample sizes we suggest that RRT is a useful method for obtaining information about rule breaking and could be more widely used, for example in studies of poaching and illegal resource extraction...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of controlling the}} voltage distribution across the gaps of a closing switch based on a cascade of corona stabilised electrodes has been examined. When operating in a corona stabilised mode the corona current flowing in each gap must be equal. By altering the corona characteristics of the gaps, through changing electrode separation and the area of corona emission, it should therefore be possible to control the voltage distribution across {{the elements of the}} cascade. A simple theoretical model of the behaviour of corona emission for an electrode with a protruding cylindrical corona generation element has been developed. Experimental tests have confirmed the broad validity of the model. The experimental data for individual electrode geometries has been used to predict the expected self <b>break</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a two gap cascade and the predictions are compared with experimental data. The voltage distribution across the cascade has also been measured and compared with the values predicted from the mode...|$|R
40|$|Background Older adults spend a {{large part}} of the day being sedentary, but several {{national}} and international health guidelines explicitly recommend that older adults should reduce their sedentary time and break prolonged periods of sitting to promote healthy ageing and well-being. In order to refine the guidelines and develop effective interventions, it is crucial to identify when, why and how older adults are most likely to be able to change their sitting habits. Aim The aim of this study was to utilise life-logging equipment (objective activity monitor and camera) to understand reasons for older people to remain sedentary and to break periods of prolonged sitting. Methods In this mixed-methods study, 30 older adults (mean (±SD) age 74. 0 ± 5. 3 years) were asked to recollect their believed reasons for (<b>breaking)</b> sedentary <b>behaviour.</b> In addition, they were presented with a personal storyboard with objective records (1 day activity monitor [activPAL] and time-lapse camera images [ViconRevue]) of their daily behaviour and asked, during a semi-structured interview, to give their individual interpretation of their objectively measured sedentary behaviour and explain their actual reasons for (<b>breaking)</b> sedentary <b>behaviour.</b> The interview transcriptions were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results The most frequent reasons that people believed kept them sedentary were television/radio (48. 3 %), fatigue (34. 5 %) and health status (31. 0 %). The factors most often mentioned as actual reasons were eating/drinking (96. 6 %), television/radio (89. 7 %) and reading/crosswords (75. 9 %). Domestic chores (55. 2 %), walking (37. 9 %) and socialising (20. 7 %) were most often mentioned as reasons that people believed made them <b>break</b> their sedentary <b>behaviour.</b> The factors that were most often mentioned as actual reasons were domestic chores (86. 2 %), food/tea preparation (82. 8 %), and performing simple tasks (75. 9 %). Conclusions It can be concluded that a mixed methods approach, by combining objective data of an activity monitor with contextual information from time-lapse photos and subjective information from people regarding their own behaviour, is an useful method to provide indepth information about (<b>breaking)</b> sedentary <b>behaviour</b> in older adults. The results of this study showed that there is a difference in what older adults believe that are reasons for them to remain sedentary or break their sedentary time and what their actual reasons are. A personal story board based on objective measurements of sedentary behaviour can be a useful method to raise awareness and find individual and tailored ways to reduce sedentary behaviour and to increase the number of <b>breaks</b> in sedentary <b>behaviour</b> without much interference in daily routine...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} likely {{behaviours}} of train passengers {{in an emergency}} evacuation and examines four crucial theoretical issues on the passengers&# 039; evacuation, including reactive vs. proactive behaviours, cooperative vs. competitive behaviours, symmetry breaking, and route/exit choice. A survey of 1134 train passengers shows that respondents are not homogeneous in their likely behaviours. Overall, {{they are more likely}} to be reactive (e. g., wait for instruction from station staff) than proactive (e. g., move to exit) in an emergency situation. We also find that people are more likely to be cooperative (e. g., helping other people) than competitive (e. g., push other passengers). Although passengers are likely to show herding or symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> (e. g., following other passengers) than symmetric behaviour (e. g., choose least crowded exit), the degree of symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> is not as high as assumed in previous mathematical models. They are also unlikely to use escalators, lifts and train tunnels in their exit/route choice during an emergency escape. In terms of demographic differences in behaviours, results from the ordered logit models demonstrate that there are significant differences in the evacuation behaviours between males and females but not among the different age groups. Besides providing valuable information for developing mathematical models intended to simulate passengers&# 039; evacuation in a train station, our findings can assist managers of emergency response in developing appropriate strategies and training, and in designing solutions and education campaigns for effective evacuation...|$|E
40|$|The Degasperis-Procesi {{equation}} (DP) is one {{of several}} equations known to model important nonlinear effects such as wave breaking and shock creation. It is, however, a special property of the DP equation that these two effects can be studied in an explicit way {{with the help of the}} multipeakon ansatz. In essence this ansatz allows one to model wave breaking as a collision of hypothetical particles (peakons and antipeakons), called henceforth collectively multipeakons. It is shown that DP multipeakons have Painlevé property which implies a universal wave <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> that multipeakons can collide only in pairs, and that there are no multiple collisions other than, possibly simultaneous, collisions of peakon-antipeakon pairs at different locations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that each peakon-antipeakon collision results in creation of a shock thus making possible a multi shock phenomenon...|$|E

We examine this in SU(2) in 2 + 1 dimensions. Crossover between string-like and broken states is clearly seen by the mixing-matrix technique, using different operators to probe the two states; the <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> is rather abrupt. Furthermore, we are able to show that both types of operator have a finite overlap with both states; {{in the case of the}} Wilson loops the overlap with the broken string is, as predicted, very small. As a by-product we have also looked at scaling behaviour both with Wilson and improved actions: for gluelumps asymptotic scaling is actually worse with the improved action, in contrast to the string tension...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{potato protein}} {{concentrate}} (PPC) was investigated {{as a source}} of thermoformed bio-based plastic film. Pressing temperatures of 100 to 190 degrees C with 15 to 25 % glycerol were used to form PPC films. The shape of the tensile stress-strain curve in thermoformed PPC was controlled by glycerol level and was independent of processing temperature. Tensile testing revealed that elongation at break increased with processing temperature while Young's modulus was unaffected by processing temperature, both in contrast to previous results in protein based systems. Also in contrast to previous studies, Young's modulus was found to be only sensitive to glycerol level. Maximum tensile stress increased with increasing processing temperature for PPC films. Maximum stress and strain at break correlated with the extractable high molecular weight protein content of the processed films measured with size exclusion chromatography. Infrared absorption indicated that the content of beta-sheet structure increased from the commercial protein concentrate to that pressed at 100 degrees C, but did not further develop with increasing press temperature. Changes in structural arrangements were observed by small angle X-ray scattering indicating the development of different correlation distances with processing temperature but with no clear long range order at the supramolecular level. The novel Young's modulus behaviour appears to be due to constant secondary structure or the effect of aggregated protein structure formed during protein production. Unique strain at <b>break</b> <b>behaviour</b> with processing temperature was demonstrated, likely due to new connections formed between those aggregates...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the mechanical}} properties of polyester powder coatings is of paramount importance, as they have to undergo {{a wide variety of}} forces and deformations during their service life. Determine the response of polymeric coatings to the actual loading conditions can be, however, very troublesome as their properties are function of the material physical state, rate-dependence and yield and <b>break</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Further, the characterization of soft, contaminated organic surfaces such as polymers can often cause severe problems with reliability and imaging accuracy due to instrumental artefacts. This is therefore the context in which this paper investigates the capability of multiple parameters scratch tests joined with non-contact CLA profilometry and FE-SEM to detect the scratch response of polyester powder coatings for protective and decorative outdoor applications. Scratch tests with blunt contact geometry were used to evaluate the response of polyester coatings baked at different time temperature programs and, so, at different stages of their curing process. In particular, being such coatings highly non-linear in their response to mechanical stress or strain, the influence from scratch load and speed was carefully taken into account. Analytical evaluations of the experimental results led to good correlations between the extent of the deformed zone after scratch, scratch parameters and curing operational settings. This allows mapping the scratch response of the polyester topcoats to broad ranges of both scratch parameters and curing conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Barley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cereals worldwide. About two-thirds of the barley production is used for feed, one-third for malting and 2 % for human consumption. Low consumption as food and poor product development is related with its lower leaving capacity or colour development when comparing it wheat and rice respectively. However barley can be used as food ingredient in several products like unleavened products, cereals, pastries, etc. Barley is a low fat cereal containing several nutrients in which the most abundant are starch, protein and fibers like ?-glucan. A key strategy to increase the added value of barley is to produce enriched fractions of its components e. g. starch, protein. With this purpose, a better understanding of the <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the grain is needed. The <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the grain is determined by the mechanical properties of its components, which are influenced by the state they are in. In this research the glass transition temperature (Tg) of barley starch isolate (BSI) and barley protein isolate (BPI) were studied. The Tg is the temperature at which components change from a rubbery to a glassy state. In both states molecules form amorphous structures with different mechanical and thermal behaviour. A glass has a solid-like brittle behaviour and a rubber has a liquid-like behaviour with restricted capacity to deform or flow. Water is an important component of food products and has an enormous influence in the Tg of the components. In this research, the Tg of BSI and BPI were determined at several moisture contents and a state diagram was constructed using the Gordon-Taylor equation. Tg was measured with thermal mechanical compression test (TMCT). TMCT is a novel technique that measures the Tg by applying a constant force to a sample while increasing the temperature. When the samples changes from glassy to rubbery, there is a change in volume that is measured and Tg can be determined. The outcome of this research was compared with measurements of the Tg for the isolates obtained with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a previous study. DSC is a widely used technique that measures the Tg by detecting changes in heat capacity. The drawback of DSC is that changes in heat capacity are very small and the interpretation of the data might be ambiguous. To have a clearer interpretation and to avoid side effects, during DSC samples are heated, cooled and heated again. The Tg is measured during the second heating but denaturation and/or degradation of the components during the first heating might be an important complicating factor [...] ...|$|E
40|$|First-principles fully relaxed tensile {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a Σ 3 (111) /[1 Ῑ 0] tilt Fe grain boundary (GB) segregated with Al. The effects of Al segregation on bond breaking in the GB were {{compared with those of}} Cu and P, which are typical GB embrittlers because of charge transfer and covalent-like characteristics, respectively. It was suggested by first-principles tensile tests that the intergranular embrittling potency of Al is as strong as that of Cu. However, this result disagreed with an estimation based on the Rice–Wang thermodynamic model. The first bond breaking site in the Al-segregated GB was the Fe-Fe bond neighbouring the Al atom, as in the Cu-segregated GB. This is typical of bond breaking due to charge transfer. However, no charge transfer was observed from the Fe atom to the Al atom, while the Fe atom neighbouring the Al atom showed covalent-like characteristics. It was suggested from investigations of the charge density at the bond critical point that the effect of covalent-like characteristics of Al on the Fe-Fe bond was small in the initial stage of straining, but it increased as the charge density of the Fe-Fe bond decreased with increasing strain. The investigation of the dynamic change in electronic structure also shed light on the difference of bond <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> in metallic and covalent-like bonding in metallic materials...|$|E

40|$|While {{research}} suggests that peer influence can lead to increases in undesirable behaviours of adolescents, {{there has been little}} focus on the specific mechanisms of influence. A relatively small literature examining social interactions between peers has found that the discussion of rule breaking topics by pairs of boys relates to how much problem behaviour the boys engage in. This research is limited by its reliance on a set of similar samples from a North American population base. This thesis explored the relationship between social interaction and behaviour with sample from New Zealand Aotearoa. Nine pairs of Year 10 boys were recruited primarily from two high schools. A half-hour conversation was video taped for each pair. These conversations were coded {{on the basis of the}} nature of the talk between pairs of participants following the coding system proposed by Poe, Dishion, Griesler and Andrews (1990). The coded behaviours were analysed and compared to measures of previous rule breaking behaviours. The duration of rule breaking talk was found to correlate with the level of previous rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> It was not clear whether the amount of rule breaking talk was related to the amount of laughter following it. Possible explanations are discussed. While generalisations from these results are limited by an unexpectedly small sample size, they show similarity to the previous research findings.

Study 1 a is a review of incident reports using Tripod methodology to understand {{the relative importance of}} human factors causes.   This revealed that unsafe acts, in particular procedural violations, were the most frequent immediate cause of accidents. Study 2 took a proactive approach to determine the frequency and type of rule breaking prevalent in the UK oil and gas industry. Study 3 developed and tested a model of the organisational antecedents of individual rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour.</b>   This revealed that the two independent variables, Organisational Features (Work pressure, Job Satisfaction, Safety Discussion and Satisfaction with Safety Management System Activities) and Social Safety Norms, (Others Approval of Shortcuts and Relationship with Supervisor), were associated with self-reported rule breaking. Study 4 was based on, appraisals of safety leadership and leadership style by subordinates and self-reports from the most senior managers in the company.   This revealed that a charismatic leadership style is associated with a stronger perceived commitment to safety; whilst managers with a more passive style were perceived more negatively. Overall, the evidence presented in this thesis highlights the organisational influences on committing violations and the importance of managing rule breaking to accident prevention.   However, to achieve this requires a focus at the workgroup and leadership level, as well as the traditional management system and individual worker-focused approaches.

40|$|Background: Much {{research}} has been conducted on the subject of problem behavior and the relationship with executive functions in adolescents and adults. Substantially less is known about the development of executive functions in young children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and/or Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD). Aim: The first aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the development in inhibition performance of children aged 3. 5 to 7 years with and without ADHD and/or DBD over a period of 18 months. The second aim was to examine the differences in inhibition performance between the three clinical groups (ADHD, ADHD + DBD, DBD) and the control group. The final aim of the present study was to investigate the degree in which rule breaking behavior occurs within an inhibition task between the three clinical groups and the control group. Method: A battery of seven executive function tasks, specially developed for young children, were used to assess the performance of inhibition of the four groups during three points in time over a period of 18 months. 	 	Results: The results show a significant increase in inhibition performance for the clinical groups after 18 months, indicating an inhibition development. Secondly, compared to the control group all three clinical groups showed significant differences in inhibition performance, where the three clinical groups showed significant lower inhibition results than the control group. Finally, when frequency of rule breaking behavior is compared, all groups show a decrease in this behaviour after 18 months. Furthermore, the clinical groups exhibit more rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> than the control group.

40|$|Objective: Criminal {{liability}} for the sexual-transmission of HIV raises complex questions for both clinicians and service-users regarding their responsibilities and legal obligations {{to disclose information}} to others. This is the first research study to address {{the impact of these}} issues upon everyday clinical and professional management in the UK. The prevalence and incidence of clinical and HIV-legal issues reported by the 107 psychologists sampled are reported. Design: A cross-sectional approach comprising two components was utilised: Firstly, questionnaire survey (Response rate 22 %) scoping the experiences of practice issues among psychologists from sexual-health and generic settings. Attitudes towards HIV-prosecutions and various measures of professional self-efficacy were also collected. Secondly, three focus groups (N= 15) exploring the impact of practice issues upon clinicians’ likely confidentiality <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Methods: Clinical and legal issues are presented. Further statistical analyses explored the interaction of various demographic, clinical and attitudinal variables upon clinician’s perceived self-efficacy. Focus Group transcripts analysed using Thematic Analysis (Data-driven approach) with eight emergent themes. Results: Although no direct involvements in police investigations reported, two instances of psychology notes being subpoenaed plus multiple ‘near miss’ clinical experiences described. High proportions of sexual-health psychologists experienced HIV-clients disclosing problematic behaviours, including intentional transmission (9 %; N= 5) and/or ‘reckless’ behaviour (72 %). Focus groups expressed high levels of anxiety regarding these scenarios associated to multiple influences (interpersonal, clinician, professional and service factors). Quantitative and qualitative results were triangulated to provide a detailed analysis of how psychologists manage the clinical impact of the issues. Conclusions: Psychologists broadly supported HIV-prosecutions for intentional transmission (81 %) but only limited support around ‘reckless’ cases (44 %), particularly among those sexual-health experienced. Those ‘critical’ attempted to mitigate the impact of legal issues by proactively raising awareness among HIV-clients and resisting overly-defensive service changes; whereas those ‘less-critical’ were more accepting.

40|$|To those {{interested}} in managing change in a large, rule-based organization, rule breaking {{is something of a}} double-edged sword. On the one hand, a change agent might need to circumvent old rules, written to pursue stability and predictability, without having to wait for the rules to be abolished or updated. On the other hand, a change agent in such an organization might need to rely on directives and rules to impose the change, in turn facing rule breaking as a mean of change resistance. We have investigated how rule breaking is transferred between organizational members, and in particular how employees motivate their rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> We do this by means of a multiple case study within six Swedish IT companies. We have focused on the diffusion of rule breaking norms onto organizational newcomers, in order to assure that our respondents would be able to more accurately report on the behavior. Our results show that subjects are typically not directed to break rules, but pick it up when given advice or through observation of other rule breakers. The motives for the rule breaking often regards the performance of their project and thus {{is in the interest of}} the organization at large, and our subjects are in general quite relaxed when discussing their ‘crimes’. Thus, our findings support the advocates of the constructive type of rule breaking called ‘pro social rule breaking’. We discuss the existence of an interpretation system guiding organizational members on how to interpret rules and directives, the lack of feedback to the rule makers on why rules are broken, and the consequences for change agents...|$|E

However, there is currently scant research that has examined the origins of pedestrians’ rule breaking at level crossings. As a result, this study examined the origins of pedestrians’ rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> at crossings, with particular emphasis directed towards examining the factors associated with making errors versus deliberation violations. A total of 636 individuals volunteered {{to participate in the study}} and completed either an online or paper version of the questionnaire. Quantitative analysis of the data revealed that knowledge regarding crossing rules was high, although up to 18 % of level crossing users were either unsure or did not know (in some circumstances) when it was legal to cross at a level crossing. Furthermore, 156 participants (24. 52 %) reported having intentionally violated the rules at level crossings and 3. 46 % (n = 22) of the sample had previously made a mistake at a crossing. In regards to rule violators, males (particularly minors) were more likely to report breaking rules, and the most frequent occurrence was after the train had passed rather than before it arrives. Regression analysis revealed that males who frequently use pedestrian crossings and report higher sensation seeking traits are most likely to break the rules. This research provides evidence that pedestrians are more likely to deliberately violate rules (rather than make errors) at crossings and it illuminates high risk groups. This paper will further outline the study findings in regards to the development of countermeasures as well as provide direction for future research efforts in this area...|$|E

The simulation results {{have been used to}} produce a regime diagram giving a description of the wave <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> in Richardson number–dimensionless mountain height parameter space.

When mountain waves break, the associated convective instability leads to turbulence generation (which is one of the known forms of Clear Air Turbulence, also known as CAT). Thus, regions within the simulation domain where wave breaking and the development of CAT are expected have been identified. The extent of these regions increases with terrain elevation and background wind shear intensity. Analysis of the model output, supported by theoretical arguments, suggest the existence of a link between wave breaking and the relative orientations of the incoming wind vector and the horizontal velocity perturbation vector. More specifically, in a wave breaking event, due to the effect of critical levels, the background wind vector and the wave-number vector of the dominant mountain waves are perpendicular. It is shown that, at least for the wind profile employed in the present study, this corresponds to a situation where the background wind vector and the velocity perturbation vector are also approximately perpendicular...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} cultural, economic, and social practices that the unemployed {{residents of the}} Finglas Partnership Area in Dublin took into consideration when deciding to accept or reject job offers in 1993 - 1994. Two distinct albeit complementary techniques of research were adopted. Firstly, Personal Construct Theory was used {{to address the problem}} of observer bias and difficulties of discounting professionals' paradigms when investigating attitudes. The combined repertory grid responses from a group of long term unemployed subjects, was compiled to form the core of a questionnaire. Secondly the questionnaire was administered to 334 residents from the defined area with a population of 4500. The study consists of a Literature Review of work; empirical views of the Long Term Unemployed and a Social Survey. The evidence of the survey is that two of three persons would not accept wages equal to their social welfare benefits. Also, because being unemployed carries no stigma, and secure in the intuitive knowledge of the culturally prevailing practices, job offers can be accepted or rejected without loss of community respect. Self-interest is bolstered and socially approved by the community practice of the individuals putting their own circumstances first. The crucial factor that the unemployed consider when evaluating a job or training opportunity is whether the offer is to their advantage strictly in cash terms. The study draws conclusions and reflects on how the LTU as agents relate to structures in society and how the coping practices that have evolved are a reflection of the perceived rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of other socially successful groups. A further finding of the research is that young persons displayed a keen awareness of the relationship between paid work and self-esteem as well as a marked reluctance to do unpaid voluntary work. The survey also identified that there has been a trend of changing social attitudes across three generations about the role of work in relation to the quality of life that is now expected as a right...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the stress placed on a child when a sibling in the family has a chronic illness or disability, and analysis of what factors may buffer this stress and be associated with well child resilience in the face of family illness. Several major studies from other countries (Cadman, Boyle, & Offord, 1988; Houtzager, Grootenhuis, Caron & Last, 2005; Laufersweiler-Plass, Rudnik-Schoneborn, Zerres, Backes, Lehmkuhl & von Gontart, 2003; Sharpe & Rossiter, 2002; Williams, Williams, Graff, Hanson et al., 2002) suggest that there may be deleterious outcomes for well children in such families, for example higher rates of anxiety, depression, aggressive behaviour and rule <b>breaking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> However {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the processes which lead to these negative outcomes. The current study had two major research aims. The first was to describe social, family and personal characteristics of a group of well children with siblings who have a chronic illness or disability. The second aim was to examine relationships between adjustment problems in these well children and factors relating to the family (income, number of children in family, respite availability and utilisation), parents (stress, parenting style, maternal education, access to support) and children (ill child behaviour, amount of care required, well child age, well and ill child participation in social activities). Adjustment in well-children (n= 102) was assessed using child self report, child projective and parent rating measures. Parents rated well children with ill siblings as significantly higher in externalising and internalising behaviour than age and gender matched population norms. Children did not rate their behaviour problems higher than norms but did indicate quite high rates of emotional problems on a projective (drawing) test. Parent-rated behaviours of well children were associated with parental, family and ill child variables, including (high) parental stress (daily hassles), (low) family income and (high) ill child internalising and externalising behaviours. Relationships between the well child's perception of having a sibling with a chronic illness or disability and various parent, child and family variables were also explored. Well children who listed more negative (than positive) attributes about having a sibling with a chronic illness were more aggressive and rule breaking in their behaviour. Well children with emotional problems, as assessed by the child family drawings, did not differ significantly from children without emotional problems in any of the parent, child or family variables however both the emotional problems index and the use of scribble drawings were associated with several measures of well child maladjustment. The results were discussed in terms of family systems and resilience theory. Implications for well children and their families including practical applications for existing interventions which target well children, ill siblings and parents were discussed and ideas for future directions for interventions to improve outcomes for well siblings were presented...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to {{incorporate}} selected findings from behavioural finance into a Heterogeneous Agent Model using the Brock and Hommes (1998) framework. Behavioural patterns are injected into an asset pricing framework through the so-called `Break Point Date', which allows us to examine their direct impact. In particular, we analyse {{the dynamics of the}} model around the behavioural <b>break.</b> Price <b>behaviour</b> of 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents covering five particularly turbulent U. S. stock market periods reveals interesting pattern in this aspect. To replicate it, we apply numerical analysis using the Heterogeneous Agent Model extended with the selected findings from behavioural finance: herding, overconfidence, and market sentiment. We show that these behavioural breaks can be well modelled via the Heterogeneous Agent Model framework and they extend the original model considerably. Various modifications lead to significantly different results and model with behavioural breaks is also able to partially replicate price behaviour found in the data during turbulent stock market periods...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Landfill covers are designed as impermeable caps on top of waste containment facilities {{after the completion of}} landfill operations. Geocomposite drain (GD) materials consist of a geonet or geospacer (as a drainage core) sandwiched between non-woven geotextiles that act as separators and filters. GD provides a drainage function as part of the cover system. The stability performance of landfill cover system is largely controlled by the interface shear strength mobilised between the elements of the cover. If a GD is used, the interface shear strength properties between the upper surface of the GD and the overlying soil may govern stability of the system. It is not uncommon for fine grained materials to be used as cover soils. In these cases, understanding soil softening issues at the soil interface with the non-woven geotextile is important. Such softening can be caused by capillary <b>break</b> <b>behaviour</b> and build-up of water pressures from the toe of the drain upwards into the cover soil. The interaction processes to allow water flow into a GD core through the soil-geotextile interface is very complex, and have been defined herein as Capillary Related Interface Breakthrough (CRIB). The infiltration test using small column on CRIB conditions for GD in contact with fine grained soils confirmed the development of capillary break at the interface. The effect of water build-up on the interface leads to soil softening in fine grained soils layer and reduce the interface shear strength hence potential instability of the system. Two series of fine grained soil/GD interface shear strength tests conducted to determine the interface shear strength behaviour for a range of soil water contents. The soil softening at the interface due to soaked behaviour show a reduction in interface shear strength and this aspect should be emphasized in design specifications and construction control. Comparison on the main behaviour using field measurements on the trial landfill cover at Bletchley were conducted to increase confidence in the understanding of the implications for design of cover systems...|$|R
