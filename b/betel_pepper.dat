500|$|Almost 71% of the {{population}} of Madras Presidency was engaged in agriculture with the agricultural year usually commencing on 1 July. Crops cultivated in the Madras Presidency included cereals such as rice, corn, kambhu (Indian millet) and ragi as well as vegetables including brinjal, sweet potato, ladies' fingers, beans, onions, garlic and spices such as chilli, pepper and ginger along with vegetable oils made from castor beans and peanuts. Fruits cultivated included lime, banana jackfruit, cashew nuts, mangos, custard apples and papayas. In addition, cabbages, cauliflowers, pomelos, peaches, <b>betel</b> <b>pepper,</b> niger seed and millet were introduced from Asia, Africa or Europe, while grapes were introduced from Australia. The total cultivated area used for food crops was 80% and for cash crops, 15%. Of the gross area, rice occupied 26.4 percent; kambhu, 10 percent; ragi, 5.4 percent and Cholam, 13.8 percent. Cotton occupied , oilseeds, 2.08 million, spices,0.4 million and indigo, 0.2 million. In 1898, Madras produced 7.47 million tons of food grains from [...] of crops grown on [...] of ryotwari and inam lands, which supported a population of 28 million. The rice yield was 7 to 10 cwt. per acre, the cholam yields were 3.5 to 6.25 cwt. per acre, khambu, 3.25 to 5 cwt. per acre and ragi, 4.25 to 5 cwt. per acre. The average gross turnout for food crops was 6.93 cwt. per acre.|$|E

Preparation techniques vary from using hands to feet to help in grinding and extracting the exotic flavours. The nut is either slivered or grated, often flavored with spices according to local tradition and usually wrapped in a betel leaf (betel leaf comes from the <b>betel</b> <b>pepper</b> plant, Piper betle, which is not botanically related to the betel palm, Areca catechu), along with some lime (calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide) to better extract the alkaloids. Some people also chew tobacco, marijuana or cocaine along with betel nut. After about 20 minutes of chewing, the fibrous residue which remains of the nut is spat out onto the street, where it remains visible due to its characteristic bright red color.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Betel</b> <b>pepper</b> (Piper betle L.) {{cultivation}} is {{an important}} agricultural industry in Taitung, Taiwan, and culling leaves is very labor-intensive. This case study compares the proportion of cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) between cullers and those with other occupations. Methods: Patients with musculoskeletal disorders in the rehabilitation clinic of a local hospital in Taitung were enrolled. This all female cohort was divided into a culler group (<b>betel</b> <b>pepper</b> cullers, n = 20), and a non-culler group (other occupations, n = 47). Three cullers were interviewed, and were also recorded to elucidate the related ergonomics. Patients were diagnosed using plain radi-ography and ultrasonography. Results: The act of culling involves an overhead internal rotation of both shoulders with extended elbows while standing, followed by wrist flexion and forearm pronation. Flexing of the fingers is also required by the tools, ‘iron nails ’ fit-ted onto both thumbs. The proportions of patients with shoulder impinge-ment syndrome (SIS) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were significantly higher among cullers than non-cullers (0. 45 vs. 0. 15, p = 0. 011 and 0. 40 vs. 0. 06, p = 0. 002, respectively). Furthermore, the total frequency of CTDs dis-played a positive linear correlation with employment duration (r = 0. 618, p = 0. 004). Conclusions: Proportions of occupational SIS and CTS were higher among <b>betel</b> <b>pepper</b> cullers than those with other occupations. These CTDs may have resulted from a prolonged static posture and repetitive motions during culling.

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{study was conducted}} to survey the data, which were related to local vegetables and herbs from government and inhabitants, such as cultivation data, processing data, data from interviewer and data of utilization. Then, local vegetables and herbs were sampling, collected and analyzed for nutritive values. The finding showed that local vegetables and herbs were processed and traded in low amount. There were imported from neighboring provinces, such as Rajaburi and Bangkok. The attitude between government officers and local manufacturers were conflicted by government officers were intended to improve quality of products, therefore, local manufacturers were interested to promote health benefits and product styles. The collected samples were angled gourd (Luffa acutangula Linn.), holly basil (Ocimum sanctum), Seablite (Suaeda maritima), karanda (Carissa carandas Linn.), Tahitian noni leaves and fruits (Morinda citrifolia), Indian camphorweed (Pluchea indica Less.), sea holly (Acanthus ebracteatus Vahl.), blue thunbergia (Thunbergia laurifolia Linn.) and <b>betel</b> <b>pepper</b> (Piper betle Linn.), which were analyzed to determine nutritive values, such as, water content, protein, fat, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, calcium, beta-carotenes and vitamin C. From the results, we were suggest that some of local vegetables, seablite was possess highly nutritive values for health benefits, which, were ability to processing as functional foods.

A reason to call on the British for assistance by the Kandyan King in 1762 was that after the treaty of Paris, the Dutch poured troops into Sri Lanka. They were bent on capturing Kandy from six directions (1764). Anticipating such a scenario the King sent an envoy to the English Governor of Madras to assist him in expelling the Dutch. This envoy, a junior Kandyan Official in the military made a clandestine trip to Madras Fort, and the English responded by sending their councillor Mr Pybus.|$|R
50|$|Erythrina edulis is a {{suitable}} crop for agroforestry. Thanks to nitrogen fixation, other crops included in an intercropping system with E. edulis benefit from higher nitrogen {{content in the}} soil, and the tree has potential to make wasteland more productive.E. edulis can produce food during scarcity, because the seeds are normally ripe when the previous year’s stocks are exhausted but when it is still too early for the new harvest. The trees can be grown in association with other cash crops as sugar cane, coffee and cacao. A basul tree can grow very high (8-14 m). As it provides shade, the tree can serve to protect sun-sensitive crops from strong radiation. This association is beneficial {{not only for the}} sun-sensitive crop but also for basul, since it is less harmed by pests when grown in association with other plants, compared to a monoculture. Combinations with coffee, cacao, <b>pepper,</b> <b>betel</b> and grape have been observed.|$|R

30|$|The temple {{economy at}} Vijayanagar {{and in many}} temple cities in the empire, was tied to the {{charities}} of the king. Its dynamic workings on temple economics and political power can be understood {{with the help of}} royal images within the built environment of temple cities in the capital city of Vijayangar. Dividing the city on the basis of natural and man-made features, Michell and others distinguish two major zones, the sacred center which is {{in the northern part of}} the city, and a royal center, within the innermost fortification, within an urban core. 18 The sacred center is dominated by four large temple complexes: the Virupaksa, Krisna, Tiruvengalanatha (or Acyuta Raya) and Vitthala temples. These large temple complexes, or cities (puras) were known by the name of the temple; thus there is the Virupaksapura, Krisnapura, Vitthalapura and Tiruvengalanathapura (or Acyutarayapura) The main feature of a pura is the large temple complex with its high enclosure walls and towered gateways, approached by a long chariot street flanked on both sides by shops (angadi), which functioned as a bazaar. 19 The architectural assemblage of the temple cities of Krisnapura, Vitthalapura, Virupaksapura and Tiruvengalanathapura, were agro-urban creations. These complexes were built from large grants made by kings and nobles. Distinguished by a large enclosure within which were tanks, wells, schools, they were entered through a towered gate and approached by a long colonnade street which functioned as a market or bazaar for the exchange of goods. In these markets along the chariot streets, were sold gold, rubies, pearls, diamonds openly in the bazaars. 20 In fact, each temple complex was surrounded by an agricultural hinterland, residences, craft industries, markets and water facilities which were strongly tied to local economy. The temples particularly in the sacred center, utilized a variety of food articles, including coconut, rice, turmeric, incense, leaves, flowers, lights, butter, salt, <b>pepper,</b> <b>betel</b> leaves and nut, oil, mustard, sugar, plantain leaves, flowers, lamps, butter, salt, pepper, mustard, pulses, sugar, bananas, firewood, cotton clothing, as well as articles from foreign markets, musk, camphor, saffron for the multiple functions of worship, ritual celebration, teaching and feeding. Indirectly, the demand promoted industries such as cotton, jewelry and stone workers. The important industries that grew around Vijayanagar temple towns were those of artisans, weavers, oil pressers, ceramic vessels, textiles, jewelry, armor, weapons, stone carvers, leather workers, barbers, potters and washers. The temples even constructed the road system for effective transportation of food and distribution of goods around the capital, thereby playing a significant role in the urban landscape in the temple cities or puras in the capital city of Vijayanagar.|$|R
