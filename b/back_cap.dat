60|$|I used {{to think}} at nite what you said, & for it i nocked off {{swearing}} months before my time was up, for i saw it want no good, nohow--the day my time was up you told {{me if i would}} shake the cross (QUIT STEALING) & live on the square for months, it would be the best job i ever done in my life. The state agent give me a ticket to here, & on the car i thought more of what you said to me, but didn't make up my mind. When we got to Chicago on the cars from there to here, I pulled off an old woman's leather; (ROBBED HER OF HER POCKETBOOK) i hadn't no more than got it off when i wished i hadn't done it, for awhile before that {{i made up my mind}} to be a square bloke, for months on your word, but forgot it when i saw the leather was a grip (EASY TO GET)--but i kept clos to her & when she got out of the cars at a way place i said, marm have you lost anything. & she tumbled (DISCOVERED) her leather was off (GONE)--is this it says i, giving it to her--well if you aint honest, says she, but i hadn't got cheak enough to stand that sort of talk, so i left her in a hurry. When i got here i had $1 and 25 cents left & i didn't get no work for 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust about on a steam bote (FOR A DECK HAND)--The afternoon of the 3rd day I spent my last 10 cts for moons (LARGE, ROUND SEA-BISCUIT) & cheese & i felt pretty rough & was thinking i would have to go on the dipe (PICKING POCKETS) again, when i thought of what you once said about a fellows calling on the Lord when he was in hard luck, & i thought i would try it once anyhow, but when i tryed it i got stuck on the start, & all i could get off wos, Lord give a poor fellow a chance to square it for 3 months for Christ's sake, amen; & i kept a thinking, of it over and over as i went along--about an hour after that i was in 4th St. & this is what happened & is the cause of my being where i am now & about which i will tell you before i get done writing. As i was walking along herd a big noise & saw a horse running away with a carriage with 2 children in it, & I grabed up a peace of box cover from the side walk & run in the middle of the street, & when the horse came up i smashed him over the head as hard as i could drive--the bord split to peces & the horse checked up a little & I grabbed the reigns & pulled his head down until he stopped--the gentleman what owned him came running up & soon as he saw the children were all rite, he shook hands with me and gave me a $50 green back, & my asking the Lord to help me come into my head, & i was so thunderstruck i couldn't drop the reigns nor say nothing--he saw something was up, & coming back to me said, my boy are you hurt? & the thought come into my head just then to ask him for work; & i asked him to take back the bill and give me a job--says he, jump in here & lets talk about it, but keep the money--he asked me if i could take care of horses & i said yes, for i used to hang round livery stables & often would help clean & drive horses, he told me he wanted a man for that work, & would give me $16 a month & bord me. You bet i took that chance at once. that nite in my little room over the stable i sat a long time thinking over my past life & of what had just happened & i just got down on my nees & thanked the Lord for the job & to help me to square it, & to bless you for putting me up to it, & the next morning i done it again & got me some new togs (CLOTHES) & a bible for i made up my mind after what the Lord had done for me i would read the bible every nite and morning, & ask him to keep an eye on me. When I had been there about a week Mr. Brown (that's his name) came in my room one nite and saw me reading the bible--he asked me if i was a Christian & i told him no--he asked me how it was i read the bible instead of papers & books--Well Charlie i thought i had better give him a square deal in the start, so i told him all about my being in prison & about you, & how i had almost done give up looking for work & how the Lord got me the job when I asked him; & the only way i had to pay him back was to read the bible & square it, & i asked him to give me a chance for 3 months--he talked to me like a father for a long time, & told me i could stay & then i felt better than ever i had done in my life, for i had given Mr. Brown a fair start with me & now i didn't fear no one giving me a <b>back</b> <b>cap</b> (EXPOSING HIS PAST LIFE) & running me off the job--the next morning he called me into the library & gave me another square talk, & advised me to study some every day, & he would help me one or 2 hours every nite, & he gave me a Arithmetic, a spelling book, a Geography & a writing book, & he hers me every nite--he lets me come into the house to prayers every morning, & got me put in a bible class in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it helps me to understand my bible better.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{electropneumatic}} {{spool valve}} markers on the market, which use a solenoid valve to actuate {{the movement of}} the bolt, the SLG operates using a spool valve actuated by a mechanical solenoid and sear. This unique single-tube, sear-tripping, blow-forward operation is comparable to, though not identical to, the operation of the Automag. In the SLG, the recocking mechanism is air pressure acting on a smaller, forward-facing area to push the bolt back open when the pressure in the dump chamber—which acts on a larger, rearward-facing area—reaches a low pressure from firing and venting the dump chamber. In the Automag, this is accomplished by the return spring. If the sear is tripped but the dump chamber is not vented due to the bolt failing to close, the bleed button on the <b>back</b> <b>cap</b> can be depressed, which vents the dump to the outside through the <b>back</b> <b>cap,</b> thus allowing the bolt to recock.|$|E

With {{the disappearance of the}} heavy tank from US forces came the full acceptance of the main battle tank in 1960 for the US Army, and 1973 for the US Marine Corps. Although the later M1 Abrams main battle tank utilizes the same caliber of main gun, 120 mm, the M103's cannon was a rifled gun firing a separate-loading round, in which the projectile was loaded into the breech, followed by a cartridge case consisting of a brass case, primer, and propellant in a fixed unit. This separate-loading system necessitated the use of two loaders. The only part of the cartridge case consumed during firing was the propellant and a plastic cap {{on the end of the}} brass cartridge case. The spent brass cartridge case was ejected after firing. The M1 tank's 120 mm main gun is a smooth bore firing a semi-caseless round, ejecting only a <b>back</b> <b>cap</b> of the original loaded round; the bulk of the M1's 120 mm shell casing is consumed during firing.|$|E

Captain America investigates, and finds out that Ultron is controlling his armour. Iron Man then attacks and flees, but as he leaves, Black Widow attaches a tracking device on his <b>back.</b> <b>Cap</b> and Thor follow, while Vision remains in the Quinjet. Cap, Thor, and Iron Man battle, and as he escapes, Vision discovers that Yellowjacket is controlling the armour. The Avengers call Ant-Man and track Iron Man to a H.Y.D.R.A. castle, and Hulk brings Iron Man back to his senses, but he is still not in control of his armour. Hawkeye puts Ant-Man on one of his arrows and launches him towards Iron Man. As Iron Man heads to the Shield Hellicarrier to do one more thing for Ultron, Ant-Man defeats Yellowjacket. Iron Man downloads top secret files and battles the Avengers. Ant-Man concludes to override the circuit he needs a power surge, which Thor provides. Spider-Man and Iron Spider arrive and reveal that Ultron had stolen the access codes for Avengers Tower, and Iron Man realizes that Ultron wants to control the Iron Legion. Iron Man activates the Hulkbuster and the Avengers head to the tower. Ultron gains control of the legion and forms them into a huge likeness of himself. Iron Man shoots Ant-Man at Ultron, who goes inside his head and rips out several wires, causing Ultron to malfunction and explode. The Avengers resume their party, and Iron Man makes his announcement which he first mentioned at the beginning: the Avengers have a new member: Falcon, much to Ant-Man's dismay as he thought {{that it was going to}} be himself.

40|$|Microfluidic {{technologies}} {{have started to}} show their potential in assisting with the probes into the complicated mechanical-chemical interactions of multiphase fluids at microscale geometries (e. g., regular channels, porous media micromodels). The benefits of appropriately implementing microfluidics in such research efforts may include, {{but are not limited}} to: (1) small-dimensions facilitated analogous mechanical behaviors, (2) precise and reliable controls over relevant operating parameters of the fluids, (3) approximated reproduction of the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic circumstances, and (4) implementations of advanced visualization technologies such as microscopic imaging in order to reveal the dynamic processes involved in those multi-fluid interactions. Following the early studies on two-phase flow such as oil and water in microscale devices driven by the understanding of oil recovery process and mechanisms, carbon dioxide (CO 2) has drawn increasing attention because of their environmental impact such as greenhouse gas effects. Most studies target either enhancing the chemical reactions by using pressurized CO 2 as a solvent or revealing physical properties as well as mass transfer performance of gaseous CO 2 in common hydrodynamic scenarios. However, dense CO 2 including liquid and supercritical states are rarely touched, which is mainly due to the technical difficulties in working with extreme pressures (tens to hundreds times of atmospheric pressure) and elevated temperatures (> 31 °C). Driven by the literature voids, this thesis presents some preliminary studies of the hydrodynamic issues and mass transfer of dense CO 2 in a form of flowing segments in microchannels. Prior to the commencement of any experimental work concerning dense CO 2, a system capable of working at extreme pressures reliably and safely needs to be build first. Chapter 3 details the building of an experimental system which is dedicated to two phase microfluidic studies, especially for those related to extreme pressure/temperature conditions. Based on two principles of being extreme conditions durable and leakage free., a few goals, namely, reliability, flexibility and coordinability of this system are achieved. The first part of this thesis (Chapter 4) presents an experimental study of a fluid pair, namely, liquid CO 2 and deionized (DI) water, in a micro T-junction, where liquid CO 2 and DI water are injected from the side and the main channel of the T-junction, respectively. Drop flow and co-flow are identified as two main flow regimes subjected to the various flow rate ratios applied. By focusing on the drop flow, a full period of liquid CO 2 drop generation is divided into three stages, and each stage is meticulously described in terms of the interfacial developments (e. g., interface profile, pressures across the interface, size variations). The mass transfer mechanisms including CO 2 hydration, diffusion on a perpendicular dimension of the interface and the advection parallel to the interface are considered and discussed in terms of their effects in CO 2 molecules transport. An overall theoretical analysis of such mechanisms verifies that the transported CO 2 portion is a small quantity compared with the bulk CO 2 stream. Based on this verification, the generated liquid CO 2 drop size, speed, and the spacing development within one drop generation period are probed. A formulation of drop size with the flow rate ratio shows a magnified effect of the later factor, which is interpreted by the extended time scale of an ‘elongating-squeezing’ stage of the period. Drop speed results show that they can be approximated by dividing the total flow rates over the channel cross-sectional area. And the speed differences between the generated drop and the emerging one in the T-junction lead to a model which details the spacing development within one drop generation period. The model is well validated by experimental results. The second (Chapter 5) and the third part (Chapter 6) of the thesis are devoted to the investigations of hydrodynamics and mass transfer of liquid CO 2 and scCO 2 drops traveling simultaneously with water in a long straight microchannel (~ 15 mm long), respectively. The production of such CO 2 drops is realized by using the aforementioned micro T-junction. Distinctly, these studies focus on the drop size and drop speed at three specified positions of the channel and the mass transfer caused shrinkage of the CO 2 drop quantified by the decreasing drop length. In order to calculate the mass transfer coefficient of CO 2 drops, the detailed geometries of a Taylor drop in the square microchannel with a presence of wall films that separate the drop from the channel wall are considered, and consequently, the surface area and the volume of the drop are formulated based on the drop dimensions, channel geometries, contact angle and estimated film thicknesses. Furthermore, a specific mathematical model is developed to calculate the mass transfer coefficients based on the drop length reductions and drop flowing time in the channel. Discussions on these results indicate that surface-volume ratio and drop flow time are the two main factors in controlling the hydrodynamic shrinkage of the liquid CO 2 and scCO 2 drops. In addition, pressure declines of segmented flows in microchannels are considered and their effects are evaluated based on a pressure decline model and the Peng-Robinson equation of state (Eos) as well as the estimated initial pressures at the T-junction. Calculations of the resulted volume changes from the pressure declines show that the influences are small, and the observed CO 2 drop shrinkage is confidently attributed to the mass transfer across the interface between the CO 2 phase and water phase. The last part (Chapter 7) presents a numerical study of the hydrodynamics of one single liquid CO 2 drop and one single scCO 2 drop traveling in a straight microchannel simultaneously with water as the carrier fluid. A two-dimensional (2 D) computational domain of the straight microchannel is configured based on the experimental observations. Three liquid CO 2 cases and three scCO 2 cases are studied. It is found that the computed drop is disk-like shape encapsulated by thin films that separate the drop from the channel walls. The predicated film thicknesses agree very well with the literature. Besides, the flow domain within CO 2 drops could be mainly composed of a few vortex regions, and small vortex regions at the front and the <b>back</b> <b>cap</b> of the drop start to vanish with increased velocities. Analysis of the mechanisms causing the vortexes is provided. The interfacial CO 2 distributions of the drop show that both diffusion and local relative convection at the meniscus regions contribute to the concentration profile. Although no significant drop shrinkage is observed for typical Taylor drops, the one for the case with the highest capillary number (Ca ~ 10 - 2) defined from its pure diffusional gradient profile showed a similar development tendency over time as its experimental counterpart in Chapter 6...|$|E
