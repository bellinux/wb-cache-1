At 20 years old he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} tied and bases loaded {{with two outs}} in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning, Mr. Burns elects to field a {{right-handed}} hitter against a left-handed pitcher and pinch hits Homer for Strawberry. Distracted by Mr. Burns, the first pitch hits Homer in the head, rendering him unconscious, but forcing in the winning run. The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from baseball, Grove {{continued to work}} with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning. Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five votes in the 1958 balloting (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the 1960 balloting (2.6% of the required votes needed).|$|E

50|$|Sometimes in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning (or later), when a {{team has}} a runner on third base in a tie game with less than two outs, the {{defending}} team will pull the outfielders in very close, almost creating three extra infielders. This is sometimes known as do or die depth. The reason for positioning this way in this situation {{is that there is}} no point in having the outfielders playing deep, waiting to catch a fly ball for an out; if they do, the runner at third base will be able to tag up when the ball is caught and then run to home plate to score the winning run. So the outfielders can contribute constructively only by filling the gaps between the infielders.|$|R
5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties {{himself for the}} 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no experience as a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming into the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest {{player in the league}} for the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} game of a July 25 doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park, {{starting}} pitcher Roberts batted in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> in a 0–0 shutout. With Bob Rush on the mound for Chicago, Roberts managed a walk and was replaced on base by Caballero, who promptly took second base on a hit and run groundout by first baseman Eddie Waitkus. A single to center field by Richie Ashburn allowed the speedy Caballero to score from second and completed the doubleheader sweep for Philadelphia—Bubba Church having pitched a three-hit shutout {{in the first game}} earlier in the day.|$|E
5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth.</b> Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E

5000|$|The 1987 World Series was notable {{in several}} regards: It {{featured}} the first World Series games played in an indoor stadium (the Hubert H.

In 1987, the Twins set the record for the worst (full 162 game) regular season win-loss record of any World Series championship team (85-77, [...]525). This record stood until it was broken when the Cardinals won the 2006 Series after going 83-78 (.516).

5|$|Cards' player-manager Rogers Hornsby chose Alexander {{to start}} Game6, and used him in relief to close out Game7. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won {{the final two}} games of the series, {{and with it the}} world championship. In Game7, the Yankees, {{trailing}} 3–2 in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning and down to their last out, Ruth walked, bringing up Bob Meusel. Ruth, successful in half of his stolen base attempts in his career, took off for second base on the first pitch. Meusel swung and missed, and catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to second baseman Hornsby who tagged Ruth out, ending Game 7 and thereby crowning his Cardinals World Series champions for the first time. The 1926 World Series is the only Series to date which ended with a baserunner being caught stealing.|$|E
5|$|Chad Durbin {{relieved}} Happ {{in the top}} of the seventh. He walked Johnny Damon, {{who then}} stole second base. Rodriguez was then hit by a pitch, and Damon scored on a single by Jorge Posada. Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte in the bottom of the seventh and retired the side in order. Brett Myers retired the first two batters {{in the top of}} the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a solo home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final two outs. This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds.

Some Yankees present at the game included owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players Reggie Jackson, Bucky Dent, Lou Piniella, Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Yankees returned for another game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. Former Sound Don Mattingly, as well as Yankees manager Billy Martin and pitcher Goose Gossage were in attendance.

50|$|On a miserably cold (51 degrees) and rainy evening, Morgan Ensberg's first-pitch {{home run}} off starter Mark Buehrle put the Astros on top {{in the second}} inning. The White Sox {{answered}} in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second with two runs of their own off Andy Pettitte. Lance Berkman drove in three runs in <b>the</b> game, two <b>of</b> them on a go-ahead double in <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth. In the seventh inning, Dan Wheeler loaded the bases with a double to Juan Uribe, a walk to Tadahito Iguchi, and home plate umpire Jeff Nelson's ruling that Jermaine Dye {{was hit by a}} pitched ball. The ruling was considered questionable, as television replays showed that the ball hit Dye's bat (which would have made the pitch a foul ball rather than a HBP). The Astros brought in Chad Qualls, who promptly served up a grand slam to Paul Konerko on the very first pitch he threw, the eighteenth grand slam in <b>the</b> annals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fall Classic. In <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth,</b> White Sox closer Bobby Jenks blew the save when he gave up a two-run game-tying pinch hit single to José Vizcaíno. In <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth,</b> Astros closer Brad Lidge gave up a one-out, walk-off home run — the fourteenth in Series history — to Scott Podsednik, giving Lidge his second loss in as many post-season appearances (his previous appearance was in Game 5 of 2005 National League Championship Series). Podsednik had not hit a single homer in the regular season, and this was his second <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postseason. The Series moved to Houston with the White Sox leading 2-0.|$|R

Freese joined Jim Edmonds, the man he was traded for, as the only players in Cardinals history to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run in the postseason. He joined Aaron Boone (2003), David Ortiz (2004) and Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk (1975) and Kirby Puckett (1991) as the only players to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run when their team was facing postseason elimination.|$|E

It was reported on July22 that a deal had been agreed upon to trade Stivetts to the St. Louis Browns of the NL for Kid Carsey and cash. The deal was contingent upon the acceptance of Stivetts. In early August, the Boston manager Selee sent Stivetts home, commenting that the team did not have use of his services any longer. Tim Hurst, now managing St. Louis, planned on using Stivetts in center field. Stivetts {{refused to accept the}} move to St. Louis, and a sale was officially conducted on August14 that sent him to St. Louis for $2000 and an unnamed player. True to his word, Stivetts did not report, or play a single game for St. Louis that season.

Al Bridwell singled to center field, but Hank O'Day called Merkle out because Merkle had not touched second base. O'Day ruled the game a 1–1 tie due to darkness. With both teams finishing the season at a 98–55 record, a replay game had to be played to determine who would win the National League pennant. The game was held on October 8, with the Cubs winning, 4–2.|$|E
