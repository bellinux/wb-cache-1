40|$|The {{influence}} of ballistic channels superimposed on tunneling conduction channels in magnetic tunnel junctions {{has been studied}} in a manganese oxide based tunneling device. Inversion of magnetoresistance has been observed in magnetic tunnel junctions with pinhole nanocontacts over a broad temperature range. The tunnel magnetoresistance undergoes a change of sign at higher bias and temperature. This phenomenon is attributed to the parallel conduction channels consisting of spin conserved ballistic transport through the pinhole contact where the transmission probability is close to unity and spin polarized tunneling across the insulating spacer with weak transmittivity. The results seem to resolve a controversy regarding <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> in ferromagnetic nanocontacts and establishes that <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> do exist even if the previous results are attributed to magnetostriction and magnetostatic force related artifacts.

40|$|Electronic {{transport}} in ferromagnetic ballistic conductors {{is predicted}} to exhibit <b>ballistic</b> anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> (BAMR) - {{a change in the}} ballistic conductance with the direction of magnetization. This phenomenon originates from the effect of the spin-orbit interaction on the electronic band structure which leads to a change in the number of bands crossing the Fermi energy when the magnetization direction changes.

40|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} nanostructures, the <b>ballistic</b> anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> (BAMR) is {{a change}} in the ballistic conductance with the direction of magnetization due to spin-orbit interaction. Very recently, a directional dependent ballistic conductance has been predicted to occur in a number of newly synthesized nonmagnetic semiconducting nanostructures subject to externally applied magnetic fields, without necessitating spin-orbit coupling. In this article, we review past works on the prediction of this BAMR effect in core-shell nanowires and rolled-up nanotubes. This is complemented by new results we establish for the transport properties of tubular nanosystems subject to external magnetic fields. Comment: 17 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|When the {{dimensions}} of a metallic conductor are reduced so that they become comparable to the de Broglie wavelengths of the conduction electrons, the absence of scattering results in ballistic electron transport and the conductance becomes quantized. In ferromagnetic metals, the spin angular momentum of the electrons results in spin-dependent conductance quantization and various unusual magnetoresistive phenomena. Theorists have predicted a related phenomenon known as <b>ballistic</b> anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> (BAMR). Here we report the first experimental evidence for BAMR by observing a stepwise variation in the ballistic conductance of cobalt nanocontacts as the direction of an applied magnetic field is varied. Our results show that BAMR can be positive and negative, and exhibits symmetric and asymmetric angular dependences, consistent with theoretical predictions. Includes supplemental figures 1 - 4...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the circumstances underlying recent reports of very large values of <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> (BMR) in nanocontacts between magnetic wires. We find that the geometries used are subject to artifacts due to motion of the wires that distort the nanocontact thereby changing its electrical resistance. Since these nanocontacts are often of atomic scale, reliable experiments would require stability on the atomic scale. No method for achieving such stability in macroscopic wires is apparent.

Because of the increasing influence of the spin-orbit interaction on the magnetic properties, as going from V to Ta, a significant increase of the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) in the molecules is observed. In particular, an infinite Nb-benzene wire is predicted to change its ballistic conductance upon changing of magnetization direction (<b>ballistic</b> anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance).</b> The origin of the peculiar magnetic properties of the molecules is analyzed, and new possible technological applications are proposed.

40|$|Anisotropic magnetoresistance, that is, the {{sensitivity}} of the electrical resistance of magnetic materials on the magnetization direction, is expected to be strongly enhanced in ballistic transport through nanoscale junctions. However, unambiguous experimental evidence of this effect is difficult to achieve. We utilize single-atom junctions to measure this <b>ballistic</b> anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> (AMR). Single Co and Ir atoms are deposited on domains and domain walls of ferromagnetic Fe layers on W(110) to control their magnetization directions. They are contacted with nonmagnetic tips in a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope to measure the junction conductances. Large changes of the magnetoresistance occur from the tunneling to the ballistic regime due to the competition of localized and delocalized d-orbitals, which are differently affected by spin–orbit coupling.

Upon stretching monatomic chains of W, Ir, and Pt suspended between two leads, {{we find the}} development of strong magnetism and large values of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of up to 30 meV per chain atom. We predict that switches of the easy magnetization axis of the nanocontacts upon elongation should be observable by <b>ballistic</b> anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> measurements. Due to the different local symmetry, the contributions to the MAE of the central chain atoms and chain atoms {{in the vicinity of}} the leads can have opposite signs which reduces the total MAE. We demonstrate that this effect occurs independent of the chain length or geometry of the electrodes. Comment: accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{electronic}} structure in determining the transport properties of ballistic point contacts is studied.

In magnetic metallic multilayers {{the electronic}} structure {{gives rise to a}} large difference in conductance between the parallel and antiparallel configurations. For Co/Cu and Fe/Cr multilayers the dependence of the conductances on the layer thicknesses and the crystal orientations is investigated for the geometries with the current perpendicular, parallel, and at an angle to the interface planes.

The wires are conducting and the conductance channels increase with increasing width. The wires have a non-linear behavior in the <b>ballistic</b> anistropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> ratios {{with respect to the}} magnetization directions. All 2 D nanowires as well as Ni (111) and Ni (100) monolayer investigated are ferromagnetic under the Stoner criterion and exhibit enhanced magnetic moments as compared to bulk Ni and the respective Ni monolayers. The Stoner parameter is seen to depend on the structure and the dimension of the Nws. The easy axis for all nickel nanowires under investigation is observed to be along the wire axis.

As junction size is decreased to the single channel limit, conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) increases in magnitude, approaching the size expected for tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) upon tunnel junction formation. Significant mesoscopic variations are seen in the magnitude and sign of the magnetoresistance, and no evidence is found of large <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> effects.

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of 2 D magnetoresistance in an applied in-plane magnetic field is theoretically considered for electrons in Si MOSFETs within the screening theory for long-range charged impurity scattering limited carrier transport. In agreement with recent experimental observations we find an essentially temperature independent magnetoresistivity for carrier densities {{well into the}} 2 D metallic regime due to the field-induced lifting of spin and, perhaps, valley degeneracies. In particular the metallic {{temperature dependence}} of the <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> is strongly suppressed around the zero-temperature critical magnetic field (B_s) for full spin-polarization, with the metallic temperature dependence strongest at B= 0, weakest around B ∼ B_s, and intermediate at B ≫ B_s.

Analysis of the magnetoconductance versus conductance data for all materials known to exhibit so-called <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> strongly suggests that the magnetoconductance of nanocontacts follows universal scaling. If the maximum magnetoconductance is normalized to unity and the conductance is scaled to the resistivity of the material, then all data points fall into a universal curve that is independent of the contact material and the transport mechanism.

40|$|Based on first-principles density {{functional}} theory calculations {{we explore}} electronic and magnetic properties of experimentally producible sandwiches and infinite wires made of repeating benzene molecules and transition-metal atoms of V, Nb, and Ta. We describe the bonding mechanism in the molecules {{and in particular}} concentrate {{on the origin of}} magnetism in these structures. We find that all the considered systems have sizable magnetic moments and ferromagnetic spin-ordering, with the single exception of the V 3 -Bz 4 molecule. By including the spin-orbit coupling into our calculations we determine the easy and hard axes of the magnetic moment, the strength of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), relevant for the thermal stability of magnetic orientation, and the change of the electronic structure with respect to the direction of the magnetic moment, important for spin-transport properties. While for the V-based compounds the values of the MAE are only of the order of 0. 05 - 0. 5 meV per metal atom, increasing the spin-orbit strength by substituting V with heavier Nb and Ta allows to achieve an increase in anisotropy values by one to two orders of magnitude. The rigid stability of magnetism in these compounds together with the strong ferromagnetic ordering makes them attractive candidates for spin-polarized transport applications.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{implementation}} of the ballistic Landauer-Büttiker transport scheme in one-dimensional systems based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method. In order to calculate the conductance within the Green's function method we map the electronic structure from the extended states of the FLAPW calculation to Wannier functions which constitute a minimal localized basis set. Our approach benefits from the high accuracy of the underlying FLAPW calculations allowing us to address the complex interplay of structure, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling and is ideally suited to study spin-dependent electronic transport in one-dimensional magnetic nanostructures. To illustrate our approach we study ballistic electron transport in non-magnetic Pt monowires with a single stretched bond including spin-orbit coupling, and in ferromagnetic Co monowires with different collinear magnetic alignment of the electrodes {{with the purpose of}} analysing the magnetoresistance when going from tunneling to the contact regime. We further investigate spin-orbit scattering due to an impurity atom. We consider two configurations: a Co atom in a Pt monowire and vice versa. In both cases, the spin-orbit induced band mixing leads to a change of the conductance upon switching the magnetization direction from along the chain axis to perpendicular to it. The main contribution stems from ballistic spin-scattering for the magnetic Co impurity in the non-magnetic Pt monowire and for the Pt scatterer in the magnetic Co monowire from the band formed from states with d_xy and d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 orbital symmetry.

40|$|As {{dimensions}} of a metallic conductor are reduced so that conduction electrons pass without scattering, electric transport becomes ballistic. This ultimately leads to conductance quantization, revealing a quantum-mechanical nature of electrons and a conductor width comparable to an electron 2 ̆ 7 s wavelength, i. e. {{a fraction of}} a nanometer. In ferromagnetic metals, properties of electrons such as their wavelength depend on their spin angular momentum, which results in spin-dependent conductance quantization and leads to unusual magnetoresistive (MR) phenomena. One of them is <b>ballistic</b> anisotropic <b>magnetoresistance</b> (BAMR), a quantized change in the ballistic conductance according to the direction of magnetization. We observed BAMR in Co electrodeposited nanocontacts by in-situ investigation of their spin-dependent transport properties. By measuring the conductance {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic field direction at saturation, we found the step-wise variation of the ballistic conductance, signature of the BAMR effect. The experimental results showed that BAMR could be positive and negative, and exhibited symmetric and asymmetric angular dependences, which was consistent with the theoretical predictions. This BAMR phenomenon may be appealing for the future generation of electronic devices, such as quantum switches and logic circuits, adding the possibility to control the quantized conductance by applied magnetic fields. ^ Based on the same junction, other structures such as alternating multilayers of ferromagnetic metal (FM) and nonmagnetic metal (NM) and FM-NM-FM trilayer point contacts were investigated by the same methods. Bismuth point contacts on gold substrates showed bulk bismuth properties with large ordinary magnetoresistance (OMR). The Ni-Bi-Ni point contacts showed small OMR due to the bad interface between Ni and Bi. Point contacts of Co/Cu multilayer and Co-Cu-Co trilayer were also studied and showed not negligible MR, which reveals the possibility of making GMR electronic devices in nanocontact geometries. ...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{transport}} in nickel magnetic point contacts is investigated with {{a combination}} of density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green functions method. In particular we address the possibility of huge <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> in impurity-free point contacts and the effects of oxygen impurities. On-site corrections over the local spin density approximation (LSDA) for the exchange and correlation potential, namely the LDA+U method, are applied in order to account for low-coordination and strong correlations. We show that impurity-free point contacts present magnetoresistance never in excess of 50 %. This value can raise up to about 450 % in the case of oxygen contamination. These results suggest that magnetoresistance in excess of 1, 000 % can not have solely electronic origin. Comment: 9 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{establish}} theoretically that in nonmagnetic semiconducting bilayer or multilayer {{thin film}} systems rolled up into compact quasi-one-dimensional nanoarchitectures, the <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> is very anisotropic: conductances depend strongly {{on the direction}} of an externally applied magnetic field. This phenomenon originates from the curved open geometry of rolled-up nanotubes, {{which leads to a}} tunability of the number of quasi-one-dimensional magnetic subbands crossing the Fermi energy. The experimental significance of this phenomenon is illustrated by a sizable anisotropy that scales with the inverse of the winding number, and persists up to a critical temperature that can be strongly enhanced by increasing the strength of the external magnetic field or the characteristic radius of curvature, and can reach room temperature.

For thinner barriers, new nucleation centers are created during electrodeposition. The resistance of the defects, characterized by conducting atomic force microscopy, ranges from less than 10 (4) to greater than 10 (12) Omega. Various I(V) characteristics were also obtained, depending on the resistance of the defect.

40|$|Using a fully {{relativistic}} {{implementation of}} the Landauer-Buttiker formalism, the <b>ballistic</b> conductance and <b>magnetoresistance</b> in the Fe/GaAs/Fe tunnel junction has been calculated. The underlying electronic structure of the system was obtained using a spin-polarized relativistic version of the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green-function method. To analyze the influence of spin-orbit coupling induced spin-flip processes on the spin-dependent transport, a scheme introduced recently by us which allows one to split the relativistic conductance in terms of individual spin-diagonal and spin off-diagonal (spin-flip) components has been applied. Our previous investigations showed that a strong spin-flip channel {{is present in the}} conductance, having the most important influence for an antiparallel alignment of the magnetization in the two Fe leads. Motivated by these findings and based on model calculations in which the strength of the spin-orbit interaction has been manipulated we present a detailed analysis of the various features induced by the spin-orbit coupling inside the barrier, and how these modify the tunneling.

40|$|The magnetocrystalline {{anisotropy}} of thin {{magnetic wires}} {{of iron and}} cobalt {{is quite different from}} the bulk phases. The spin moment of monatomic Fe wire may be as high as 3. 4 μB, while the orbital moment as high as 0. 5 μB. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) was calculated for wires up to 0. 6 nm in diameter starting from monatomic wire and adding consecutive shells for thicker wires. I observe that Fe wires exhibit the change sign with the stress applied along the wire. It means that easy axis may change from the direction along the wire to perpendicular to the wire. We find that ballistic conductance of the wire depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field, i. e. shows anisotropic <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance.</b> This effect occurs due to the symmetry dependence of the splitting of degenerate bands in the applied field which changes the number of bands crossing the Fermi level. We find that the ballistic conductance changes with applied stress. Even for thicker wires the ballistic conductance changes by factor 2 on moderate tensile stain in our 5 × 4 model wire.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study {{electron}} transport through magnetic nanocontacts and nanowires with ab initio quantum transport calculations. The {{aim is to}} gain {{a thorough understanding of}} the interplay between electrical conduction and magnetism in atomic-size conductors and how it is affected by different aspects as e. g. the atomic structure and the chemical composition of the conductor. To this end our ab initio quantum transport program ALACANT which combines the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations has been extended to describe spin-polarized systems. We present calculations on nanocontacts made of Ni as a prototypical magnetic material. We find that atomic disorder in the contact region strongly reduces the a priori high spin-polarization of the conductance leading to rather moderate values of the so-called <b>ballistic</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> (BMR). On the other hand, we show that the adsorption of oxygen in the contact region could strongly enhance the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and thus BMR by eliminating the spin-unpolarized s-channel. Finally, we show that short atomic Pt chains suspended between the tips of a nanocontact are magnetic in contrast to bulk Pt. However, this emergent nanoscale magnetism barely affects the overall conductance of the nanocontact making it thus difficult to demonstrate by simple conductance measurements. In conclusion, we find that spin-transport through atomic-scale conductors is quite sensitive to the actual atomic structure {{as well as to the}} chemical composition of the conductor. This presents both, opportunities and challenges for the realization of future nanoscale spintronics devices. Comment: PhD thesis (2007), Universidad de Alicante, Spain; 134 pages, 47 figure...|$|E
