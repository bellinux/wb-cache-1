For example, if the CDS spread of Risky Corp is 50 basis points, or 0.5% (1 <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> = 0.01%), then an investor buying $10million worth of protection from AAA-Bank must pay the bank $50,000.

2500|$|One part per ten {{thousand}} is denoted by the permyriad (‱) symbol. In contrast, in finance, the <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> is a quantity with dimensions of (time−1) and is typically used to denote changes in or differences between percentage interest rates. For instance, {{a change in}} an interest rate from 5.15% per annum to 5.35% per annum could be denoted as a change of 20 basis points. Although rarely used in science (ppm is typically used instead), one permyriad has an unambiguous value of one part per [...] parts, one part in 104, and a value of 1×10−4. This is equivalent to one drop of dye diluted into half a liter of water or about nine seconds out of one day.|$|E

50|$|<b>Basis</b> <b>points</b> {{are used}} as a {{convenient}} unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1% are discussed. The most common example is interest rates, where differences in interest rates of less than 1% per year are usually meaningful to talk about. For example, a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> (e.g., a 4.67% rate increases by 10 <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> to 4.77%). In other words, an increase of 100 <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> means a rise by 1%.|$|R
2500|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that PCS has a {{physiological}} <b>basis</b> <b>point</b> to findings that children demonstrate deficits on standardized tests of cognitive function following a mild TBI. A few {{studies have shown that}} people with PCS score lower than controls on neuropsychological tests that measure attention, verbal learning, reasoning, and information processing, but issues related to effort and secondary gain {{can not be ruled out}} as contributing to these differences. [...] Recovery as measured by scores on cognitive tests frequently do not correlate with resolution of symptoms; individuals diagnosed with PCS may still report subjective symptoms after their performance on tests of cognitive functioning have returned to normal. Another study found that although children with PCS had poorer scores on tests of cognitive functioning after the injury, they also had poorer behavioral adjustment before the injury than children with no persistent symptoms; these findings support the idea that PCS may result from a combination of factors such as brain dysfunction resulting from head injury and preexisting psychological or social problems. Different symptoms may be predicted by different factors; for example, one study found that cognitive and physical symptoms were not predicted by the manner in which parents and family members coped with the injury and adjusted to its effects, but psychological and behavioral symptoms were.|$|E

5000|$|Between 2004 and {{the first}} half of 2007, the {{creation}} of credit derivatives indexes, credit default swap indexes, which essentially involve investors selling credit protection on a group of companies, was one of the factors that helped to drive spreads tighter.

40|$|International audienceThe {{results of}} {{mathematical}} processing of modern geodetic observations of landslide processes in Dnipropetrovsk on points of observation stations {{in case of}} lost <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> are presented. Previous observations were conducted in 1993 using classic geodetic instruments. To provide the required accuracy of observations the local geodetic coordinate system was developed. There were two basis points; using laser range equipment {{the distance between them}} was measured with accuracy higher than 0. 001 m. New observations were conducted in 2015 using GNSS-technologies and satellite observations in static mode because the traditional methods were impossible to use as the mutual visibility between <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> was lost. The biggest problem in current monitoring was the loss of <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> of monitoring stations. Some suggestions as for choosing the most stable points of network were made. Such points were defined according to previous observations; and the new method of determining the "temporary" <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> by comparing the lengths of lines between points of observation is offered. There were chosen three most stable points with minimal length disparity. Using such method we have transformed satellite observations from WGS- 84 to local coordinate system established at the territory of landslide. Such method could be used in case of lost <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> and with considerable number of rather stable observation points. At the same time, we suggest setting the <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> as far from the landslide observation stations as possible. For further observations, we suggest using GNSS-technologies in static mode and setting the new <b>basis</b> <b>points.</b> To improve the accuracy, the observations on <b>basis</b> <b>points</b> will be combined with GNSS and other ground observations. ...|$|R
