25|$|In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts {{are invited}} to Rosings Park, the {{imposing}} home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, patroness of Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy's extremely wealthy aunt. She expects Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park. Colonel Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy managed to save a friend from a <b>bad</b> <b>match</b> by convincing the friend of the lady's indifference. Elizabeth realizes the story must refer to Jane and is horrified that Darcy has interfered and caused her sister so much pain. Mr. Darcy, meanwhile, has {{fallen in love with}} Elizabeth and proposes to her. She rejects him angrily, stating that she could not love a man who has caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Mr. Wickham unjustly. The latter accusation seems to anger Mr. Darcy, and he accuses her family of wanting propriety and suggests he has been kinder to Bingley than himself. They part, barely speaking.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the event}} have been mainly positive. Writing for Online Onslaught, {{columnist}} Adam Gutschmidt stated that the event is the best King of the Ring show to watch. He called all three of Bret Hart's matches [...] "outstanding" [...] but was not as impressed {{with any of the}} other matches on the card. He thought that the eight-man match served no real purpose, the match between Luger and Tatanka was poorly planned and executed, and that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the worst on the card. Also writing for Online Onslaught, Rick Scaia also enjoyed Bret Hart's matches. He thought that the match between Tatanka and Luger was a [...] "good booking decision" [...] and that the wrestlers performed well in the match. He also enjoyed the endings to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match and the Intercontinental Championship match. The review from The Other Arena also praised Bret Hart's matches, as well as the Intercontinental Championship match. The other matches were not rated as highly, although only the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was said to be a <b>bad</b> <b>match.</b>|$|E
500|$|Two months later, amid {{reports that}} paleoconservative {{political}} commentator and adviser Pat Buchanan {{was about to}} join the Reform Party to seek the nomination, Trump {{announced that he would}} consider running as a sign of respect for Ventura. He labeled the views of Buchanan as [...] "prehistoric", and commented that even though he liked Pat, [...] "I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila the Hun." [...] He expected that a primary battle between the two would be [...] "nasty." [...] According to columnist Robert Novak, Bush operatives concerned about a third party run by Buchanan contacted Ventura indirectly about preventing Buchanan's nomination. [...] Novak argued that Trump [...] "seems a <b>bad</b> <b>match</b> with Perot's party, but he may be the GOP's last hope to stop Buchanan." [...] When Weicker decided not to seek the party's nomination due to internal bickering, Ventura reportedly went all in for Trump. [...] The media capitalized on a potential Trump versus Buchanan challenge, and Saturday Night Live satirized it with a skit in which Darrell Hammond portraying Trump and Chris Parnell as Buchanan pitched their candidacies to Ross Perot, played by Cheri Oteri. The segment also featured an appearance by Will Ferrell as Ventura.|$|E

500|$|With {{much of the}} {{criticism}} placed on the club during his first year, the scrutiny turned to Watts {{during the next few}} seasons as it was deemed that he was not living up to his potential or the public's expectations. This was partly due to Watts displaying a lack of urgency and work-rate on the field according to former players Wayne Carey, Garry Lyon and coach Mick Malthouse. He played the early parts of his career in different positions, which Garry Lyon wrote led to an instability in his game and was a reason for why he, at times, lacked confidence and self-belief in his abilities. He was often very quickly scrutinised when he played poorly, and was the first to player to be blamed when the team played a <b>bad</b> <b>match,</b> which led to Paul Roos questioning why the public had such a fixation with Watts' form. He was also plagued with being known as the [...] "great white hope" [...] {{as soon as he was}} drafted and due to the club trailing near the bottom of the ladder from 2009 to 2015 and experiencing failed rebuilds, Watts was symbolically seen as a poster boy for Melbourne's failures during this period.|$|E

40|$|Non-technical summary Earnings pro 8 ̆ 5 les of {{individuals}} depend {{not only on}} the characteristics of workers and their employers, which may be both observable and unobservable, but also {{on the quality of the}} match between the two. The quality of the match is determined when the worker enters the rm and while successful matches are likely to continue, unsuccessful ones are likely to result in separations of workers from the 8 ̆ 5 rm. Both good and <b>bad</b> <b>matches</b> are at risk of job mobility. Good matches may lead to internal mobility (promotions) while <b>bad</b> <b>matches</b> lead to permanent separations from 8 ̆ 5 rms. Typically, analyses of the impact of job mobility on wages focus either on moves within a rm, or between 8 ̆ 5 rms, making it di ¢ cult to compare changes in wages associated with each type. Furthermore, although much of the di¤erences in wages are not explained by what we can observe, the nature of most data sets does not allow us to identify the e¤ect of unmeasured factors relating to the worker, the 8 ̆ 5 rm and the match between the two. We make three main contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, using the same data set we compare the impact on wages of promotions within 8 ̆ 5 rms and of moving between 8 ̆ 5 rms, and therefore provide...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{matching}} model with differentiated skills, we study {{the effect of}} a minimum wage on mismatch. Introducing a minimum wage appears to improve the assignment of jobs to workers by making ?<b>bad?</b> <b>matches</b> impossible. Three main results are established. First, a minimum wage increase may improve the efficiency of the labour market. Next, as soon as the minimum wage is binding (some workers do earn this minimum), unemployment benefits loose their effect on productivity, becoming invariably inefficient then. In the end, numerical simulations show that introducing a minimum wage might be more efficient than increasing unemployment benefits.

Efficient algorithms are necessary for both frame-rate vision tasks and offline tasks with difficult data. We present a deterministic scheme for selecting samples to generate hypotheses, applied to data from feature matching. This method combines matching scores, ambiguity and past performance of hypotheses generated by the matches to estimate the probability that a match is correct. At every stage the best matches are chosen to generate a hypothesis. This method will therefore only spend time on <b>bad</b> <b>matches</b> when the best ones have proven themselves to be unsuitable. The result is a system that is able to operate very efficiently on ambiguous data and is suitable for implementation on devices with limited computing resources. ...|$|R

We prove the concept by applying supervised learning algorithms to automatically classify shirt and tie combinations as good <b>matches</b> or <b>bad</b> <b>matches</b> based on their color and pattern features. Since {{it is more important}} for the system to have a low false positive rate than a low classification error the algorithms are tuned for high precision at the expense of classification error. This resulted in a precision of 91. 37 % with 27. 25 % classification error. Before precision tuning our best classification error is 23 %. Our best results were achieved using features of top 2 essential colors and a custom pattern complexity metric and SVM with a quadratic kernel implemented as an ensemble. Investigations into other features and supervised learning algorithms are summarized. ...|$|R
