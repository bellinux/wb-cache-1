2500|$|Between 1988 and 2003, SEPTA {{undertook}} a $493,300,000 complete {{reconstruction of the}} Frankford side of the Market–Frankford Line between Frankford Transportation Center and the 2nd Street portal. The new Frankford Elevated was built with new stringers and deck installed on the original columns, thus giving not only a reduction in cost, but also reducing the street-level impact on adjoining neighborhoods. [...] The old ballasted trackage was replaced with a direct fixation system. In addition to the new Elevated structure, all of the stations were replaced with new stations with higher boarding platforms and elevators, allowing customers with disabilities to easily board and depart from Market-Frankford trains. [...] The reconstruction of the Frankford Elevated structure was mostly complete by 2000, {{with the exception of}} the elevated section from Dyre Street (just to the south of the Bridge-Pratt terminal) to the Frankford Yard entrance. The basic design of the bearings of the reconstructed Frankford elevated, however, was not appropriate for the repetitive loading from the train traffic. The <b>bearing</b> <b>design</b> did not take into consideration the interaction of the concrete haunches with the steel stringers when loaded by the passing train; and the concrete has started to fracture and drop onto the street below. The problem was first discovered in 1997, but at that time was simply attributed to faulty construction, without evaluation of the root cause. As built, the concrete haunches on the underside of the deck cannot move properly over the supporting steel stringers, causing chipping and breaks, with pieces falling into the street. As a temporary fix, SEPTA has installed 10,000 metal mesh belts on the underside of the structure. Estimates for a permanent fix placed the cost at about $20 million, and SEPTA has filed suit against the engineering companies that contributed to the design flaw to recover part of the repair cost. [...] Work on the permanent fix is currently underway.|$|E

50|$|With the {{development}} of external <b>bearing</b> <b>designs,</b> the standard shell diameter has become a considerable constraint, limiting both {{the diameter of the}} bottom bracket spindle {{and the size of the}} actual bearing balls in the races. Consequently, these external <b>bearing</b> <b>designs</b> can be less durable than older internal <b>bearing</b> <b>designs.</b> To address this problem several designers have recently promoted proposed standards for a larger diameter bottom bracket shell, the best known of which is the BB30 standard promoted by Cannondale. The name BB30 refers to the 30mm diameter of the spindle, not of the shell.|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the more}} sporty {{high-performance}} engines use the four <b>bearing</b> <b>design</b> because of better torsional stiffness (e.g., BMW small straight 6, Ford's Zephyr 6). The accumulated length of main bearing journals gives a relatively torsionally flexible crankshaft. The four main <b>bearing</b> <b>design</b> has only six crank throws and four main journals, so is much stiffer in the torsional domain. At high engine speeds, the lack of torsional stiffness can make the seven main <b>bearing</b> <b>design</b> susceptible to torsional flex and potential breakage. Another factor affecting large straight-six engines is the end-mounted timing chain which connects any camshafts to the crankshaft. The camshafts are also quite long and subject to torsional flex as they in turn operate valves alternately {{near the front of}} the engine and near the rear. At high engine speeds, camshafts can flex torsionally in addition to the crankshaft, contributing to valve timing for the cylinders furthest from the cam drive becoming inaccurate and erratic, losing power, and in extreme cases resulting in mechanical interference between valve and piston — with catastrophic results. Some designers have experimented with installing the timing chain/gears {{in the middle of the}} engine (between cylinders 3 and 4) or adding a second timing chain at the rear of the engine. Either method can solve the problem at the cost of additional complexity.|$|E
50|$|A flexure bearing {{relies on}} the bearing element being made of a {{material}} which can be repeatedly flexed without disintegrating. However, most materials fall apart if flexed a lot.

50|$|Although {{bearings}} tend to {{wear out}} with use, designers can make tradeoffs of bearing size and cost versus lifetime. A bearing can last indefinitely—longer {{than the rest of}} the machine—if it is kept cool, clean, lubricated, is run within the rated load, and if the bearing materials are sufficiently free of microscopic defects. Note that cooling, lubrication, and sealing are thus important parts of the <b>bearing</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
