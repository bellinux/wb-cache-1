40|$|The {{structural}} {{diversity of}} arsenic sulfide molecules in compositions between As 4 S 6 and As 4 was investigated using ab initio quantum chemical calculations. The As 4 S 6 molecule {{consists of four}} trigonal pyramid coordinations of As atoms <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three S atoms. In the As 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atom, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms. The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one As atom and two S atoms. The As 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal As atom configurations of one type <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two As atoms and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of three types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> two S atoms and one As atoms, <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms. The As 4 S molecule has trigonal pyramidal As atom coordinations of two types: <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> one S atom and two As atoms, and <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> three As atoms. The As 4 S composition permits only one molecular configuration, {{which suggests that the}} mineral duranusite comprises the As 4 S molecular geometry. In all, ten molecular configurations are predicted in the molecular hierarchy of the arsenic sulfide binary system. The simulated Raman spectral profiles are helpful in searching for undiscovered arsenic sulfide minerals...|$|R

Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor.

5|$|Carbon is {{the sixth}} element, with a {{ground-state}} electron configuration of 1s22s22p2, {{of which the}} four outer electrons are valence electrons. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7kJ/mol, are much {{higher than those of}} the heavier group 14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group 14 elements (1.8–1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals {{as well as some of}} the second- and third-row transition metals. Carbon's covalent radii are normally taken as 77.2pm (C–C), 66.7pm (C=C) and 60.3pm (C≡C), although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is <b>bonded</b> <b>to.</b> In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{covered the}} deaths of the men with a photo essay, including photographs by Cornell Capa and some taken by the five men before their deaths. The ensuing worldwide publicity gave several missionary organizations significant more visibility, especially in the United States and Latin America. Most notable among these was the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), the organization for which both Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint worked. Because of the martyrdom of her brother, Saint considered herself spiritually <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> the Huaorani, believing that what she saw as his sacrifice for the Huaorani was symbolic of Christ's death for the salvation of humanity. In 1957, Saint and her Huaorani companion Dayuma toured across the United States and appeared on the television show This Is Your Life. The two also appeared in a Billy Graham crusade in New York City, contributing to Saint's increasing popularity among evangelical Christians and generating significant monetary donations for SIL.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified. The ions +, +, and + have been observed from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Solid neon clathrate hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense crystalline form of water.|$|E

5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E

The new compound {{was determined to be}} toxic in the brine shrimp lethality test, but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines.
