25|$|A major problem, afflicting early {{production}} Typhoons in particular, was {{a series}} of structural failures leading to loss of the entire tail sections of some aircraft, mainly during high-speed dives. Eventually a combination of factors was identified, including harmonic vibration, which could quickly lead to metal fatigue, and a weak transport joint just forward of the horizontal tail unit. The loss of the tailplane of R7692 (having only 11 hours of flight recorded) on 11 August 1942, {{in the hands of an}} experienced test pilot (Seth-Smith), caused a major reassessment which concluded that the failure of the bracket holding the elevator mass balance <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> linkage had allowed unrestrained flutter which led to structural failure of the fuselage at the transport joint.|$|E
25|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had a Type 90 57mm cannon as {{its main}} armament, with one machine {{gun in the}} front hull glacis and another located in a small rear turret. The armour was riveted steel plates with a minimum {{thickness}} of 6mm and a maximum of 17mm. The engine compartment was located {{in the middle of}} the hull and the tank was powered by a V8 gasoline engine. The tank chassis had a complex parallelogram suspension system with two pairs of road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara later designed a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors suspension which paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on the majority of the subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{requirement}} {{is for a}} linkage between the [...] "machines" [...] (engine and gun) to be synchronized. Many early gears used an intricate and inherently fragile <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> and push rod linkage that could easily jam or otherwise malfunction, especially when required to work at higher speeds {{than it had been}} designed for. There were several alternative methods, including an oscillating rod, a flexible drive, a column of hydraulic fluid, a cable, or an electrical connection.|$|E
25|$|On Novelty, the {{cylinders}} were mounted vertically towards {{the rear of}} the engine (to the right {{of the men in the}} illustration). Directly below were <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> which changed the drive to horizontal. Connecting rods linked the <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> to the crank axle (the axle on the left in the illustration).|$|R
50|$|Experiment was a steam {{locomotive}} {{designed and built}} by Richard Roberts in 1833 for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR). The locomotive had vertical cylinders driving via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hibernia {{was built}} in 1834 for the D&KR. It {{was one of a}} class of three similar locomotives. Like Experiment, power {{transmission}} from the vertical cylinders was via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{conductor}} cable was laid {{in a trench}} between the rails. At [...] intervals a box was fitted between the rails that contained a stud (which protruded about [...] above the road) and a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> A magnet on a passing tram attracted this crank which then moved to make contact between the {{conductor cable}} and stud; once the tram moved away the crank dropped away and the stud was no longer connected to the cable. A long skate was suspended beneath each tramcar which was magnetised by electro-magnets and so both operated the cranks and collected the current that both moved the tram car and powered the electro-magnets. A small battery was carried to charge the electro-magnets should the power be interrupted. The negative return current passed through the rails.|$|E
50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is <b>Bell</b> <b>Crank</b> Mechanism. The <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever rotates around the Fulcrum point. One {{end of the}} <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever {{is connected to the}} pipe ‘P’, the other end is connected to the spring by the tie rod. Thus when the pipe moves down from cold to hot condition, the point P moves down, and as it moves down the <b>Bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever will rotate in the anti clock wise direction & tie rod connected to the spring will be pulled in, by which the spring gets further compressed. When the pipe moves up the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & the tie rod connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|E
50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} a screw sleeve, which extended {{to work a}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> turned a transverse shaft fitted with an eccentric cam, which would push or pull the pivot clamp, thus moving the rocket forward or aftward along its centreline.|$|E
50|$|Hibernia was a steam {{locomotive}} designed by Richard Roberts and built by Sharp, Roberts and Company in 1834 for the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR). The locomotive had vertical cylinders driving via <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Primary {{flight control}} is {{achieved}} by use of dual control wheels and rudder pedals. The control wheels operate the elevator and ailerons mechanically through a system of cables, pulleys, push-pull tubes and <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b> Trim functions, microphone keying, autopilot override and steering system switches {{are located in the}} control wheels. The rudder pedals mechanically operate the rudder for directional yaw control. Nose wheel steering is electrically controlled via the rudder pedals.|$|R
50|$|In the June 2010 {{issue of}} Car and Driver magazine, safety {{specifications}} were revealed {{pertaining to the}} safety of the SLS AMG's gullwing doors. Ten to fifteen milliseconds after a detected rollover, explosive bolts situated {{at the top of the}} door frame fire and <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> separate the doors from the car for easy exit during a serious accident. An anti-lock braking system and a 3-stage Electronic stability program (ESP) are standard.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{side had}} 5 road wheels, {{using the same}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> {{suspension}} found on other Japanese tanks.|$|E
50|$|L&MR No.32 Experiment {{was built}} in 1833 with {{vertical}} cylinders mounted just behind the chimney, driving the wheels via a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The locomotive also had piston valves. These valves were probably {{the reason that the}} design was not a success, rather than the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> transmission, which was used successfully in other locomotives. Another reason that the locomotive was not successful was steam leakage from the cylinders. Experiment was withdrawn after a few months.|$|E
5000|$|USS {{is usually}} {{indirect}} — the bars {{link to the}} headset through a system of rods or cables and possibly a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> Most tadpole trikes are USS.|$|E
50|$|The year 2000 car {{marked the}} return to inboard suspension. However, the {{mounting}} posts for the <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> caused cracks in the main frame tubes. This car utilized the same engine, differential, and rear chassis subframe configurations as the 1998 and 1999 cars. However, a new rear upright and half shaft designs were implemented to eliminate cv joint failure and to reduce overall weight. The remainder of the chassis was fully redesigned from the engine forward.|$|R
50|$|The Type 95 So-Ki was {{an armored}} {{railroad}} {{car of the}} Imperial Japanese Army used for patrolling and guarding railway lines in both Manchuria and Burma. The chassis {{was based on the}} Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tank. The Type 95 So-Ki had light armor and no weapons armament. It had a simple suspension system with bogie wheels suspended on <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> {{on each side of the}} chassis. The tracks were driven through the front sprockets. There were three small return wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Type 98, in {{comparison}} to the Type 95, featured thicker, welded armor of improved shape, including the use of a Mitsubishi Type 100 6-Cylinder air-cooled diesel engine, rated at 130 horsepower, and located sideways to make maintenance easier. Slightly lighter and shorter than the original Type 95, it could travel at 50 km/h even with its thicker armor. Three pairs of bogies with six road-wheels connected to the chassis using <b>bell</b> <b>cranks,</b> which transferred any movement in the bogies into sideways motion that was absorbed by springs.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Light Tank Mk III {{introduced}} a slightly modified version {{with only one}} <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> per bogie, causing the spring to lie somewhat angled as a result. This system was used on the Universal Carrier.|$|E
50|$|Speeds {{increased}} due to {{more powerful}} engines, {{and the quality}} of ride had to be improved. In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle's armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a <b>bell</b> <b>crank.</b> The T-34's suspension was directly descended from Christie designs. Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s. The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspension of the M3 Lee/Grant and the M4 Sherman was similar to the Hortsmann type, with the suspension contained within the track oval.|$|E
50|$|By 1932, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was {{producing}} an air-cooled diesel engine that was suitable for tanks. It was placed experimentally into a Type 89. This later {{became known as}} the Type 89-B medium tank. Subsequently, Major Tomio Hara designed the basis of many of the suspensions of future Japanese tanks, the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors which had paired bogie wheels connected by a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} three bogies per side—each formed of two <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> arranged as [...] "scissors" [...] with springs at the top. Each bogie carried two rubber-rimmed wheels. The first ten production vehicles, which {{can be considered as}} forming a separate preseries, had curved bogie sides; in later vehicles the bogies had straight sides. The bogies superficially resembled the R35 type, but used horizontal helical springs instead of rubber cylinders. The sprocket was at the front, the idler—which itself was sprung to automatically control tension—at the rear. There were two top rollers.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, {{following}} {{the sale of}} Simmonds Aircraft, Simmonds went to Paris to attend the annual Air Show at Le Bourget, which included a large fixed display of aircraft equipment suppliers. One of these was the Coursey Company which made push pull controls for use in operating aircraft control surfaces. The design of these were ingenious for their day in that you could push significant loads, as well as pull them. As Simmonds described it later, he did an instant market survey and realized this product could end the use of <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> and levers to control aircraft flight surfaces. He negotiated an exclusive license to produce and sell these devices {{in all the world}} except France.|$|R
50|$|Helicopter rotors {{operate in}} a much more {{challenging}} environment than a normal aircraft propeller. To start with, helicopters normally use the main rotor both for lift and manoeuvrability, whereas fixed-wing aircraft normally use separate surfaces for these tasks. Pitch and yaw are operated by changing the lift on different sides of the rotor, using a system of <b>bell</b> <b>cranks</b> to adjust the blades to different angles of attack as they rotate. To roll to the left, the blades are adjusted so there is slightly more angle of attack on the front and slightly less on the back, resulting in a net upward lift on the right side that rolls the aircraft. The reason the blades are adjusted in the front and back instead of right and left is due to phase lag caused by precession.|$|R
50|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had {{a complex}} {{parallelogram}} suspension system with {{two pairs of}} road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara designed a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> scissors suspension that paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on {{the majority of the}} subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|E

5000|$|The Type 2 Ke-To {{was based}} on the Type 98, using the same engine and <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> suspension. However, the gun turret was {{enlarged}} and the main armament was changed to the more powerful Type 1 37 mm gun, with a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s. The new 37 mm gun used gave the tank [...] "slightly better performance". The designation “Type 2” represented the year 1942, “Ke” represented “light”, and “To” represented the number seven.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving wheels}} were 44.6 inch in diameter, flanged upon their lower edge like the balance {{wheels of the}} trucks, and were mounted upon steel axles 6 inch in diameter, which extend through a sliding box {{containing}} the journals. The boxes slid in cast iron ways placed at right angle {{to the line of}} the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two <b>bell</b> <b>cranks.</b> The throttle valve, link rod, brake, and coupling rods, and the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although hand levers were also provided.|$|R
40|$|Design {{requirements}} for the cabin, cabin system, flight controls, engine installation, and wing-fuselage interface that provide adequate interior volume for occupant seating, cabin ingress and egress, and safety are presented. The fuselage structure must be sufficient to meet the loadings specified in the appropriate sections of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23. The critical structure must provide a safe life of 10 (exp 6) load cycles and 10, 000 operational mission cycles. The cabin seating and controls must provide adjustment to account for various pilot physiques and to aid in maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Seats and doors shall not bind or lockup under normal operation. Cabin systems such as heating and ventilation, electrical, lighting, intercom, and avionics must {{be included in the}} design. The control system will consist of ailerons, elevator, and rudders. The system must provide required deflections with a combination of push rods, <b>bell</b> <b>cranks,</b> pulleys, and linkages. The system will be free from slack and provide smooth operation without binding. Environmental considerations include variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure, protection against sand, dust, rain, humidity, ice, snow, salt/fog atmosphere, wind and gusts, and shock and vibration. The following design goals were set to meet the requirements of the statement of work: safety, performance, manufacturing and cost. To prevent the engine from penetrating the passenger area {{in the event of a}} crash was the primary safety concern. Weight and the fuselage aerodynamics were the primary performance concerns. Commonality and ease of manufacturing were major considerations to reduce cost...|$|R
40|$|Conventionally, force {{balances}} {{have been}} calibrated manually, using a complex system of free hanging precision weights, <b>bell</b> <b>cranks,</b> and/or other mechanical components. Conventional methods may provide sufficient accuracy in some instances, but are often quite complex and labor-intensive, requiring {{three to four}} man-weeks to complete each full calibration. To ensure accuracy, gravity-based loading is typically utilized. However, this often causes difficulty when applying loads in three simultaneous, orthogonal axes. A complex system of levers, cranks, and cables must be used, introducing increased sources of systematic error, and significantly increasing the time and labor intensity required to complete the calibration. One aspect of the VACS is a method wherein the mass utilized for calibration is held constant, and the acceleration is changed to thereby generate relatively large forces with relatively small test masses. Multiple forces {{can be applied to}} a force balance without changing the test mass, and dynamic forces can be applied by rotation or oscillating acceleration. If rotational motion is utilized, a mass is rigidly attached to a force balance, and the mass is exposed to a rotational field. A large force can be applied by utilizing a large rotational velocity. A centrifuge or rotating table can be used to create the rotational field, and fixtures can be utilized to position the force balance. The acceleration may also be linear. For example, a table that moves linearly and accelerates in a sinusoidal manner may also be utilized. The test mass does not have to move in a path that is parallel to the ground, and no re-leveling is therefore required. Balance deflection corrections may be applied passively by monitoring the orientation of the force balance with a three-axis accelerometer package. Deflections are measured during each test run, and adjustments with respect to the true applied load can be made during the post-processing stage. This paper will present the development and testing of the VASC concept...|$|R
50|$|The export plan never materialised and the Milemaster, {{with its}} modest specificationhand gear change and bicycle seatand lacking rear suspension, was marketed instead in the United Kingdom until 1952. In 1949, Tandon {{introduced}} the 122 cc Superglid featuring conventional foot gear-change {{and a new}} frame with swinging-arm rear suspension. However, the suspension itself was highly unusual with damper units being replaced by a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> linked to rubber bands for suspension and a hard rubber block for compression action, all located under the gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the motion}} in the Derschmidt rotor follows the natural change in drag through the rotation, the force applied to the blades to move them into {{position}} is quite small. Of the several designs he presented in his early patents, most used a very small linkage from a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> {{on the inner side}} of the blade attached to a small pushrod for operation. These rods were attached to a disk set eccentrically to the centre of rotation, which drove the blades into their proper locations.|$|E
50|$|Mechanically, {{the design}} shares {{much in common}} with the Christie suspension, which also uses a <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> to press on a spring. The main {{difference}} is that in the Christie each wheel is mounted separately and the spring is usually mounted on or inside the tank hull. The longer spring allows for more controlled flexion and potentially longer throw. Christie suspensions are generally more difficult to maintain because the wheels and suspension are mounted separately, and a broken spring can be difficult to reach without removing the wheels.|$|E
5000|$|For Worn Thin {{the band}} strove {{for a high}} {{production}} value to the tracks, an approach Hammer described as [...] "almost like a reactionary antidote to what we're sick of in music. That dry, low-tech production of {{the past ten years}} is tiring. It's in its footy pajamas, and it needs to take a nap. We wanted something lush and dramatic for the songs on Worn Thin. They usually relegate that kinda over-the-top production to Lady Gaga. But believe me, it works really well with a messy little band like Weep." [...] To this end the band incorporated additional elements into the songs, including multi-part vocal harmonies and string and horn sections:It was fun pushing these songs to a place that most bands would feel goofy pushing them to. The vocals have three- and even four-part harmonies, which for a guy with my brass pipes, is no small feat. And we have string and horn sections that push the material right over the cliff. But at the same time, when we approached the guitar-heavy songs, we backed off all the <b>bells</b> and <b>cranked</b> up the amps. I guess we just took each song on its own and did everything in our power to present it the way we heard it in our heads.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} is initially calibrated to the standard, and the zero {{is set to}} this value. Then, the test specimen are placed on the measuring table and are slid below the plunger of the instrument. Any difference in the measured dimension of the specimen will result in either the lowering or rising of the plunger. The lowering or rising of plunger will make the <b>bell</b> <b>crank</b> lever to move in forward or backward direction, and in turn, will twist or untwist the metallic strip.the centre line of strip is perforated {{in order to prevent}} excessive stress.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{design feature}} is that {{two or more}} wheels are mounted to a common framework. Each wheel is mounted on an L-shaped swing arm that forms a <b>bell</b> <b>crank,</b> so the upward movement of the wheel is turned into sideways motion {{of the top of}} the crank. The two arms may be mounted on a common shaft between them, or more commonly, two closely spaced shafts. The two wheels share a coil spring running horizontally between the tops of the crank arms. Thus if one wheel moves up over an obstacle, the spring is compressed against the swing arm of the other wheel.|$|E
