5|$|After he {{was passed}} over by Johnny Behan for the {{position}} of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff's office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was foiled when the three suspects—Leonard, Head and Crane—were killed in unrelated incidents.|$|E

That summer, Sigismund went to Kraków in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland.

5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E

The Beltway received full funding; funding for the ambitious Inner Loop Freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the Metro system.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> proved too expensive for VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT. Valmet is also rumoured to {{have been interested in}} VAT but {{there is no evidence of}} concrete negotiations.|$|E

Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought {{that that was the}} place to create a prime-time animation show. Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.|$|E

5|$|Three of {{the four}} ships were {{launched}} in 1915 and the fourth in 1916.

The Russian Revolution of 1917 put a stop to their construction, which was never resumed. Although some consideration was given to finishing the hulls that were nearest to completion, they were all eventually sold for scrap by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Navy proposed in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was cancelled after political maneuvering by the Red Army led to funding not being available.|$|E
