5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E
5|$|The Sagarin {{computer}} ratings calculated Alabama's {{strength of}} schedule to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> {{out of the}} 245 Division I teams. The Congrove Computer Rankings also calculated it as the most difficult out of the 120 Division I FBS teams in its rankings. Alabama's 2009 schedule was officially released on December 19, 2008. In accordance with conference rules, Alabama faced all five Western Division opponents: Arkansas, Auburn, LSU, Mississippi State, and Ole Miss. They also faced three Eastern Division opponents: official SEC rival Tennessee, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Alabama did not play SEC opponents Georgia and Vanderbilt. Although not on the regular season schedule, Bama met Florida in the SEC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult,</b> owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E

5|$|The cross-channel {{invasion}} of France finally came on June 6, 1944, D-Day, {{otherwise known as}} Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied {{invasion of}} Normandy. The 29th Infantry Division sent the 116th Infantry to support the western flank of the veteran 1st Infantry Division's 16th Infantry at Omaha Beach. Omaha was known to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> of the five landing beaches, due to its rough terrain and bluffs overlooking the beach, which had been well fortified by its German defenders of the 352nd Infantry Division. The 116th Infantry was assigned four sectors of the beach; Easy Green, Dog Red, Dog White, and Dog Green. Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division boarded {{a large number of}} attack transports for the D-Day invasion, among them Landing craft, Landing Ship, Tank and Landing Ship, Infantry ships and other vessels such as the , , and USS Buncombe County.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear as unique as possible.|$|E
5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises {{for the sake of}} technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E

Lord Hawke, who played first-class cricket for a great many years, considered him to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> bowler he had ever played against.

The game retains many of the series' traditional role-playing elements, however, such as turn-based combat and a level system based on gaining experience points.

25|$|The {{assault on}} Urgench proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> {{battle of the}} Mongol invasion. The city was built along the river Amu Darya in a marshy delta area. The soft ground did not lend itself to siege warfare, {{and there was a}} lack of large stones for the catapults. The Mongols {{attacked}} regardless, and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.|$|E
25|$|The reggae organ-shuffle {{is unique}} to reggae. In the {{original}} version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove {{that was used in}} the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument. Typically, a Hammond organ-style sound is used to play chords with a choppy feel. This is known as the bubble. This may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> reggae keyboard rhythm. The organ bubble can be broken down into 2 basic patterns. In the first, the 8th beats are played with a space-left-right-left-space-left-right-left pattern, where the spaces represent downbeats not playedâ€”that and the left-right-left falls on the ee-and-a, or and-2-and if counted at double time. In the second basic pattern, the left hand plays a double chop as described in the guitar section while the right hand plays longer notes on beat 2 (or beat 3 if counted at double time) or a syncopated pattern between the double chops. Both these patterns can be expanded on and improvised embellishments are sometimes used.|$|E

500|$|Empires was {{designed}} primarily for multiplayer gameplay: the multiplayer development team created and fine-tuned each civilization, which the single-player team then used in campaign levels. Because the civilizations do not overlap, Bishop considered game balance to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> {{aspect of the}} project. Previously, Stainless Steel had balanced its games in a microcosmic fashion: the [...] "individual components" [...] of each civilizationâ€”for example, the economic power of Germany versus that of Englandâ€”were balanced against one another. Balance on this scale led to overarching balance. However, this technique hinged on a broad similarity between civilizations that is not present in Empires. Consequently, the company had to abandon its earlier practice and [...] "develop an entirely new methodology", Goodman explained. The result was a macrocosmic system of balance, in which civilizations are inherently unbalanced but equally powerful overall.|$|E
500|$|Thompson's {{first draft}} {{was more than}} three hundred {{handwritten}} pages, which required her to reduce it to a more manageable length. She found the romances to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> to [...] "juggle", and her draft received some criticism for the way it presented Willoughby and Edward. Doran later recalled the work was criticized for not getting underway until Willoughby's arrival, with Edward sidelined as backstory. Thompson and Doran quickly realised that [...] "if we didn't meet Edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those people... then it wasn't going to work." [...] At the same time, Thompson wished to avoid depicting [...] "a couple of women waiting around for men"; gradually her screenplay focused as much on the Dashwood sisters' relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{promising}} sales of Zoot Suit Riot, this period proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> of the Daddies' career. Consistently performing to little media recognition, full-time touring was becoming both {{a personal and}} financial strain, leading to frequent quitting among band members. The Daddies experienced at least fifteen line-up changes from 1996 to 1997, including the departure of original keyboardist Chris Azorr and co-founder Schmid, leaving Perry and trumpeter Dana Heitman as the sole remnants of the original line-up. With no label backing them, the band had trouble securing distribution and press outside of the Northwest, often being unable to get their CDs sold in cities they were touring through. Feeling they had finally hit a [...] as an independent band, Perry said the Daddies were ultimately left with one of two options at this time: either sign to a label or break up.|$|E
500|$|The spacewalk was {{completed}} in six hours and thirty-six minutes, and the ACS passed the initial aliveness tests. It was the twenty-first Hubble servicing spacewalk, and Grunsfeld's seventh EVA, moving him up to fourth in the record book of spacewalking time. During the previous day's mission status briefing, Dave Leckrone, Hubble Space Telescope Senior Project Scientist, made a prediction, joking that since the first two spacewalks, which {{were considered to be}} straightforward, had run into issues, the most difficult EVA â€“ to repair the ACS, would be the smoothest one of the mission. [...] "I have a prediction, We've always said EVA 3 was going to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> and the most challenging, and I predict it's going to go more smoothly than any other EVA on this mission.
