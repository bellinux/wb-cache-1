The largest one, in Stradów, Kazimierza Wielka County, had an area of 25 hectares and walls or embankments 18 meters high, but parts of this giant structure were probably built later. The gords were often located along the northern slope of the western Carpathian Mountains, on hills or hillsides. The buildings inside the walls were sparsely located or altogether absent, so for the most part, {{the role of the}} gords seems to have been something other than that of settlements or administrative centers.|$|E

5000|$|After {{making peace}} on several planets and helping out in {{different}} ways the various inhabitants of them, <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> is sucked into [...] "The Bottom of Gravity", a literal gravity pit. There they find SDF and Galaxy Railways Trains that have disappeared from their universe over the years. They also find various other craft that have been missing. For some reason, the Platoon {{is not able to}} get <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> to move. During this time, Frell starts spending periods of time in the engine room (inside the boiler, where all the glowing dials and switches are). One time, as she is turning to leave, she feels a presence and asks who is there. Suddenly, all the glowing dials and switches light up and a voice says that it is the Independent Train Control System, type G8001. This is basically the voice of <b>Big</b> <b>One.</b> Frell has a conversation with <b>Big</b> <b>One,</b> and she learns that <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> will not move because the other trains have started to persuade him to stay in the pit and sleep peacefully, or die. <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> also says that he is not moving because he does not have a destination. After Frell convinces the rest of the Platoon that <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> really does talk, they come into the engine room and give <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> some support, such as saying that after they take Frell to her planet, they will all go back to Destiny together. <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> realizes that Sirius Platoon never gives up, even in impossible situations. He also realizes that he too is a member of Sirius Platoon. He asks other engines that have been repaired and coupled up to lend him their power, and they do. <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> with all the other engines make it out of the pit.

25|$|The chloroplasts {{of plant}} and algal cells can orient {{themselves}} to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts {{so that they can}} take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few <b>big</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E

500|$|Landy was {{initially}} hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife Marilyn in 1975. Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, {{saying that the}} only reason that he went along with it was so {{that he would not be}} committed to a psychiatric facility. Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group. During the recording of 15 <b>Big</b> <b>Ones</b> (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours. Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income. At the command of Landy, Wilson appeared on Saturday Night Live, choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] which received mixed feedback. Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read [...] "smile". He said that critics misapprehended his motives, elaborating that Wilson's performance [...] "was a terrible thing" [...] as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances, then he would have gradually overcome his stage fright.|$|E

500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 <b>Big</b> <b>Ones</b> as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|Smiley Smile {{became the}} first in a three-part series of lo-fi Beach Boys albums (preceding Wild Honey and Friends) and {{the first in a}} seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums (ending with the 1974 {{compilation}} Endless Summer). The Smile era is generally viewed as the beginning of the artistic decline of the Beach Boys and the point in which Brian began relinquishing his hold as the group's creative leader. Carl took Brian's place as the most musically dominant member, and Brian would not be credited as producer for another Beach Boys album until 1976's 15 <b>Big</b> <b>Ones.</b> Much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 continued the pattern of sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality. Harrison opined that this experimental songwriting and production phase lasted until Sunflower (1970), after which their albums [...] "contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead." [...] "Cool, Cool Water", an outtake from Smiley Smile and Wild Honey sessions, was partially rerecorded and issued as the closing track for Sunflower.|$|E
500|$|During {{the making}} of Get a Grip, the {{management}} and record company brought {{in a variety of}} professional songwriting collaborators to help give nearly all the songs on the album more commercial appeal, a trend which would continue until the early 2000s. However, this led to accusations of selling out that would continue throughout the 1990s. In addition to Aerosmith's grueling 18-month world tour in support of Get a Grip, the band also did a number of things to help promote themselves and their album and appeal to youth culture, including the appearance of the band in the movie Wayne's World 2 where they performed two songs, the appearance of the band and their music in the video games Revolution X and Quest for Fame, performing at Woodstock '94, using their song [...] "Deuces Are Wild" [...] in The Beavis and Butt-head Experience, and opening their own club, The Mama Kin Music Hall, in Boston, MA in 1994. That same year saw the release of the band's compilation for Geffen Records, entitled <b>Big</b> <b>Ones</b> featuring their biggest hits from Permanent Vacation, Pump, and Get a Grip, [...] "Deuces Are Wild" [...] from the Beavis and Butt-head Experience, as well as two new songs, [...] "Blind Man" [...] and [...] "Walk on Water", both of which experienced great success on the rock charts.|$|E

500|$|Aerosmith {{had signed}} a $30million {{contract}} for four records with Columbia Records/Sony Music in 1991, but had only recorded three of their six contractual albums with Geffen Records at that point (Done with Mirrors, Permanent Vacation, and Pump). Between 1991 and 1996, they released two more albums with Geffen (Get a Grip and <b>Big</b> <b>Ones),</b> which meant they now had five albums with Geffen under their belt (along with a planned live compilation), which meant they could now begin recording for their new contract with Columbia. The band took time off with their families before working on their next album, Nine Lives, which was plagued with personnel problems, including the firing of manager Tim Collins, who, according to band members, had nearly caused the band to break up. The album's producer was also changed from Glen Ballard to Kevin Shirley. Nine Lives was released in March 1997. Reviews were mixed, and Nine Lives initially fell down the charts, although it had a long chart life and sold double platinum in the United States alone, fueled by its singles, [...] "Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)", the ballad [...] "Hole in My Soul", and the crossover-pop smash [...] "Pink" [...] (which won the band their fourth Grammy Award in 1999 in the Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal category).

500|$|Already by 1940, Mutual {{was on a}} {{par with}} the {{industry}} leaders in terms of affiliate roster size. Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in <b>big</b> <b>ones,</b> the network lagged way behind in advertising revenue—NBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year. In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company [...] "has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets." [...] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its parent company, RCA, alleging a conspiracy [...] "hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nationwide network programs." [...] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit. These developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to Mutual—the transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States. But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350. It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained [...] "less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage," [...] as the Supreme Court had put it. For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. Mutual needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.|$|E
