5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|E

Nudity, public defecation and urination are used, in connection with the precolonial practices, to emphasize the shame of anti-democratic practices and to prevent disruption by police or security forces.

25|$|Twenty-five of the 34 cases {{listed in}} the {{previous}} Compliance Report have been closed, with approximately one-third resulting in {{the return of the}} children to the United States. There have been ten Hague court hearings since Fall 1999, with all children except one returned to the U.S. In one case, children were returned to the United States only six months after the abduction. In addition, there have been voluntary returns in more than 30 cases, with the existence of a pending Hague case a factor in the voluntary return decision. Once a child has been located, the taking parent must be notified of the hearing date. Mexico’s new procedure of taking children into custody at that time has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> in ensuring that the taking parent does not go into hiding with the children.|$|E
25|$|When the Portuguese {{arrived in}} Kongo they were {{immediately}} added as a mercenary force, probably {{under their own}} commander, and used special-purpose weapons, like crossbows and muskets, to add force to the normal Kongo order of battle. Their initial impact was muted; Afonso complained in a letter of 1514 {{that they had not}} <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> in a war he waged against Munza, a Mbundu rebel, the year before. By the 1580s, however, a musketeer corps, which was locally raised from resident Portuguese and their Kongo-mestiço (mixed race) offspring, was a regular part of the main Kongo army in the capital. Provincial armies had some musketeers; for example they served against the Portuguese invading army in 1622. Three hundred and sixty musketeers served in the Kongo army against the Portuguese at the Battle of Mbwila.|$|E

25|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources has {{classified}} the markhor as {{an endangered}} species, meaning {{it is in}} danger of facing extinction in the near future if conservation efforts are not maintained. There have been different estimates as to how many markhors exist but a global estimate put the number at less than 2,500 mature individuals. There are reservations in Tajikistan to protect the markhors. In 1973, two reservations were established. The Dashtijum Strict Reserve (also called the Zapovednik in Russian) offers markhor protect across 20,000 ha. The Dashtijum Reserve (called the Zakasnik in Russian) covers 53,000 ha. Though these reserves exist to protect and conserve the markhor population, the regulations are poorly enforced making poaching common as well as habitat destruction. Although markhors still face ongoing threats, recent studies have shown considerable success with regards to the conservation approach. The approach began in the 1900s when a local hunter was convinced by a hunting tourist to stop poaching markhors. The local hunter established a conservancy that inspired two other local organizations called Morkhur and Muhofiz. The two organizations expect that their conversations will not only protect, but allow them to sustainability use the markhor species. This approach has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> compared to the protect lands that lack enforcement and security. In India, the markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978.|$|E
500|$|Remembering his {{experience}} with Shaoweng, the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da; he requested the mystic to display his power. Luan Da set down a chess board and, while chanting, caused the chess pieces to charge at one another. The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power. The trick was achieved by coating the pieces {{in a mixture of}} rooster's blood, iron shavings, and [...] "magnetic dust". In Science and Civilisation in China (1986), Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used: powdered magnetite would not have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E

Moreover, Bt cotton technology has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> overall in India." [...] Matin Qaim finds that Bt cotton is controversial in India, irrespective of the scholarly evidence. Anti-biotech activist groups in India repeat their claim that there is evidence of link between Bt cotton and farmers suicides, a claim that is perpetuated by mass media. This linking of farmers suicide and biotech industry has led to negative opinions in public policy making process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the two {{aircraft}} are similar in design and construction. [...] Both have spans of 18.0m (59ft1in) and are straight tapered with rounded wing tips, although the Air's taper ratio (wing root chord to tip chord) is higher, resulting a slightly greater aspect ratio. Some later Air 100s have squared-off tips terminated in streamlined [...] "salmons". Both wings use the Göttingen 549 airfoil inboard of the tips, though the Air's roots have a thickened version. [...] They are wooden single spar structures, plywood covered ahead of the spar and fabric covered behind. The Air 100 has slotted ailerons to improve roll rates and, inboard, has Schempp-Hirth parallel-rule airbrakes mounted immediately aft of the main spar; the Weihe's DFS style brakes had never <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective,</b> largely because their design placed them further aft on the wing where space did {{not allow them to}} open fully.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{civilian}} {{inhabitants of}} Khanasor, meanwhile, expressed frustration and {{anger at the}} clashes, saying that both groups should focus on expelling ISIL from southern Sinjar rather than fighting each other. Some locals even said both groups should simply retreat from the Sinjar Mountains, and leave the Yezidi civilians alone. Both Mir Tahsin Beg, leader of the Yezidi community, as well as Nadia Murad, female Yezidi activist and UN Goodwill ambassador, called on both sides to stop the fighting. Murad said that [...] "it is deeply saddening {{for me to see}} once again victims of Genocide become victims of an internal conflict, it is painful to see the Yezidi women again are suffering from fear after all that happened to them". An expert also warned that both the Sinjar Resistance Units as well as the Rojava Peshmerga had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> at [...] "keeping IS at bay" [...] and that the fighting among these anti-ISIL forces [...] "would slow the process to liberate the remaining territory from IS".|$|E

2500|$|The Cardinals {{continued}} to play well {{in the month of}} May, but injuries began to accumulate. Relief pitcher Ricardo Rincón, on the disabled list since April 28, had season-ending shoulder surgery on May 12. Ponson went on the disabled list with a strained muscle in his right arm, and ace Chris Carpenter went on the DL with bursitis {{at the end of the}} month. Rookie Anthony Reyes got two callups to make emergency starts for Carpenter and Ponson, earning one victory and one no-decision. Jim Edmonds missed time with an abdominal infection and many of the players fell victim to a flu bug in the clubhouse. But Albert Pujols continued his great year, hitting 11 home runs in May after 14 in April, Jason Isringhausen was 10-10 in save opportunities, and the team went 17-11 for the month and finish May with a record of 34-19, fifteen games over [...]500. On May 28, Mulder, who had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> for most of the first two months of the season, was tagged for eight runs in 4.1 innings as the Cardinals lost to San Diego 10-8.

2500|$|In {{the centre}} German Army Group A smashed through the Belgian {{infantry}} regiments and French Light Divisions of the Cavalry (Divisions Légères de cavalerie) advancing into the Ardennes, {{and arrived at}} the Meuse River near Sedan the night of May 12/13. On May 13, the Germans forced three crossing near Sedan. Instead of slowly massing artillery as the French expected, the Germans replaced the need for traditional artillery by using the full might of their bomber force to punch a hole in a narrow sector of the French lines by carpet bombing (punctuated by dive bombing). Sedan was held by the 55th French Infantry Division (55e DI), a grade [...] "B" [...] reserve division. The forward elements of the 55e DI held their positions {{through most of the}} 13th, initially repulsing three of the six German crossing attempts; however, the German air attacks had disrupted the French supporting artillery batteries and created an impression among the troops of the 55e DI that they were isolated and abandoned. The combination of the psychological impact of the bombing, the generally slowly expanding German lodgements, deep penetrations by some small German infantry units and the lack of air or artillery support eventually broke down the 55e DI's resistance and much of the unit went into rout by the evening of May 13/14. The German aerial attack of May 13, with 1215 bomber sorties, the heaviest air bombardment the world had yet witnessed, is considered to have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> and key to the successful German river crossing. It was the most effective use of tactical air power yet demonstrated in warfare. The disorder begun at Sedan was spread down the French line by groups of haggard and retreating soldiers. During the night, some units in the last prepared defence line at Bulson panicked by the false rumour German tanks were already behind their positions. On May 14, two French tank battalions and supporting infantry from the 71st North African Infantry Division (71e NADI) counter-attacked the German bridgehead without success. The attack was partially repulsed by the first German armour and anti-tank units which had been rushed across the river as quickly as possible at 7:20 A.M. on pontoon bridges. On May 14, every available Allied light bomber was employed in an attempt to destroy the German pontoon bridges; but, despite incurring the highest single day action losses in the entire history of the British and French air forces, failed to destroy these targets. Despite the failure of numerous quickly planned counterattacks to collapse the German bridgehead, the French Army was successful in re-establishing a continuous defensive position further south; on the west flank of the bridgehead, however, French resistance began to crumble.|$|E
