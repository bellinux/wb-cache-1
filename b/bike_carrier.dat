50|$|Automobile mounted <b>bike</b> <b>carriers</b> can be {{attached}} to the roof, rear trunk, or rear tow hitch, depending on the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Bus mounted <b>bike</b> <b>carriers</b> {{are usually}} {{attached}} {{to the front of}} the bus. They may flip up against the bus, out of the way, when not carrying any bikes.|$|R
50|$|Front trailer hitches {{are also}} widely used on pickup trucks and full size SUVs for {{multiple}} purpose. A front-mounted hitch can accommodate additional truck {{equipment such as}} front mount <b>bike</b> <b>carriers,</b> fishing / hunting gear, winches, step plates, snow plows and more. It also allows a driver to temporarily maneuver a trailer with better visibility into any convenient place. Front trailer hitches are mounted directly to the frame of a vehicle to ensure a reliable connection. Front hitches are typically equipped with standard size receiver tubes to accommodate a variety of hitch mount equipment.|$|R

5000|$|Expanded in 2005 {{to start}} using the Comet Six-Pack the bike park {{features}} more than 50 km of downhill bike trails and more than 30 km of XC trail. [...] The bike park features a 4 <b>bike</b> <b>carrier</b> lift system that uses a <b>bike</b> <b>carrier</b> on every second chair so you hardly ever wait in line. Biking terrain (XC and DH combined) consists of roughly 23% beginner green trails, 43% intermediate blue trails and 34% advanced and expert trails.|$|E

The K2 edition came with a ski/snowboard roof carrier, a K2 'Limited Edition' sticker, and either a pair of K2 El Camino skis, or a K2 Juju snowboard.Both editions also included special seats, and fog lights.|$|E
50|$|If a crash should occur, lashing eyes {{can reduce}} the {{severity}} of outcome of the accident by keeping the luggage in the loadspace compartment and thereby preventing projectiles from harming correctly restrained passengers in the passenger compartment.These lashing features {{may be in the}} form of fixed or foldable loops, {{or in the case of}} certain European vehicles combine sliding loops in a rail system to allow optimal positioning of the lashing eyes. At the same time this eases the integration of accessories for loadspace management; dividers, <b>bike</b> <b>carriers,</b> etc. into the interior of the vehicle, a principle that has been applied in cargo vans and air transport for many years.|$|R

25|$|In January 2007, the European {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} motion decreeing that all international trains must carry bicycles. In some cities, bicycles {{may also be}} carried on local trains, trams and buses {{so that they may}} be used {{at either end of the}} trip. The Rheinbahn transit company in Düsseldorf permits bicycle carriage on all its bus, tram and train services at any time of the day,. In Munich bicycles are allowed on the S-Bahn commuter trains outside of rush hours, and folding bikes are allowed on city busses. In Copenhagen, you can take your bicycle with you in the S-tog commuter trains, all times a day with no additional costs. In France, the prestigious TGV high-speed trains are even having some of their first class capacity converted to store bicycles. There have also been schemes, such as in Victoria, British Columbia, Acadia, and Canberra, Australia to provide bicycle carriage on buses using externally mounted <b>bike</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{structural}} durability {{through the}} analyses of stress, fatigue life and vibration damage at <b>bike</b> <b>carrier</b> basket. As model 2 has less stress and deformation than model 1 on static structural analysis, model 2 becomes more durable than model 1. Among {{the cases of}} nonuniform fatigue loads, ‘SAE bracket history ’ with the severest change of load becomes most unstable but ‘Sample history ’ becomes most stable. The amplitude deformations become highest at maximum response frequency of 2400 Hz in cases of models 1 and 2. As the values of maximum equivalent stresses become within the allowable material stresses at two holes at the upper parts on models 1 and 2, these models become safe. The structural result of this study can be effectively utilized with the design of <b>bike</b> <b>carrier</b> basket by investigating prevention and durability against fatigue or vibration damage...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{resulted}} in a concept- and prototype development of a new car roof mounted <b>bike</b> <b>carrier.</b> The design problem was assigned by Thule Group and was intended be performed alongside the company’s own project of updating their different roof mounted carriers. What Thule wanted to gain from this project was to obtain concepts produced with a different approach than their usual course of action. This could lead to concepts consisting of solutions not before thought of. The solution should answer to three major problems: 1. How the bike could be attached to the carrier. 2. How the mechanism could tighten. 3. How the user could be given feedback when enough force had been applied. This report explains the approach to the problem and how the used design process has been implemented. The solution to the problem are presented successively of how the front holder of a <b>bike</b> <b>carrier</b> is developed, from idea into prototype. The applied design process “Produktutveckling - Effektiva metoder för konstruktion och design” have an iterative structure. An iterative process does not occur in a straight line, but rather in a spiral that repeat its steps over and over again to achieve better results. The different phases and methods of the design process are explained to clarify the approach of the implementation. These methods includes Benchmarking, User study, Quality function deployment, 6 - 3 - 5 Brain writing method, PUGH and Validity and Reliability. To give this thesis a theoretical foundation, theories about the design process, semantics and intuition been applied. The generated ideas resulted in two concepts that were further developed and presented. One of the concepts was decided by Thule to undergo a patent research, which was not completed before this thesis was finished. This concept has therefore not been explained in detail. The other concept has been presented in its complete state, explaining its solutions to the design problem. The report explains all features the prototype of the product resulted in. The design process is presented in a chronological way and contribute with an easy traceability throughout this report...|$|E
40|$|A loading {{standard}} called CARLOS TC BC (CAR LOading Standard for Trailer Coupling devices with Bike Carriers) {{is derived}} with focus on trailer coupling devices during <b>bike</b> <b>carrier</b> service. Based {{on this new}} standard a comparison with available loading standards for trailer coupling devices is performed and an optimized design of a trailer coupling device is proposed. The derived loading standard is based on results of a public opinion poll in 2005 with 1200 trailer coupling device users. Furthermore service load measurements at trailer coupling devices on proving grounds and public roads are used to derive the loading standard. The scatter bands caused by the track mixture (T), the way of driving (F) and the loading conditions (B) {{are taken into account}} to carry out the standardization process. Comparisons between loading standards CARLOS TC BC, CARLOS TC and 94 / 20 /EC are performed. The regulation 94 / 20 /EC covers fictitious damage sums of CARLOS TC BC and CARLOS TC for large sections of the trailer coupling device. However the regulation 94 / 20 /EC does not lead to service load oriented stresses and strains, so that it is not used within the derivation of an optimized trailer coupling device...|$|E

5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer hitch. Trailer hitches come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable ball mounts, hitch <b>bike</b> racks, cargo <b>carriers,</b> or other hitch mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar hitches are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch accessories.|$|R
40|$|Products {{that are}} used by varying users, for varying {{purposes}} in varying contexts (dynamic and diverse use situations) are difficult to design because {{it is hard to}} predict the situations in which the product will be used and consequently what this requires from the design. In our research we develop guidelines and the Envisioning Use workshop to support designers in dealing with dynamic use. The basic idea of both support tools is that an overview of possible users, goals and contexts serves as an evolving frame of reference for use evaluations in the design process. In the course ‘Design for Dynamic Use’ of the master Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) of the University of Twente students applied the developed workshop and guidelines to the design of a <b>carrier</b> <b>bike</b> for a real client. This paper describes the application and evaluation of the workshop technique by students. From this can be concluded that the workshop results in a structured view on the broadness of use situations and use issues. Therefore it is a valuable tool in setting the basis for a frame of reference of product use. For research purposes, a company was involved in the project to provide a real case. While this led to useful research results, students benefited from the collaboration as well by being able to do an exercise in a realistic design context and learning how to deal with client demands. Moreover, the company benefited from the involvement in education by gaining new ideas and insight...|$|R
