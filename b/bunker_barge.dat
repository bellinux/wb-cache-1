50|$|Bunkering, {{the supply}} of fuel to vessels, is the main service that is carried out at the Port. Customarily, the fuel is {{delivered}} by <b>bunker</b> <b>barge</b> to a vessel anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar, however, bunkers can also be delivered to vessels alongside a berth where multiple shore fuelling stations are located.|$|E
50|$|Spapool was {{purchased}} commercially in July 1976 at Mombasa {{and used by}} Divecon Ltd. as a salvage vessel later that year for the recovery of M/V Southern Pioneer, a tanker that sank at Tanga, Tanzania. She {{was used as a}} <b>bunker</b> <b>barge</b> in Mombasa after the boiler was condemned. The ship sank on Christmas Day 1983, and was salvaged by Divecon Ltd., Mombasa in 1984, and scrapped.|$|E
40|$|Volatile organic {{compound}} (VOC) abatement regulations in Southern California have driven {{the development of}} a vapor processing plant that is suitable for the <b>bunkering</b> <b>barges</b> it serves. A system was required that could be mounted on board existing <b>bunker</b> <b>barges,</b> could be operated by existing tankerman crews and had no need for additional pumps and blowers, which would require additional power generation capacity. Foss Maritime Long Beach teamed with The Glosten Associates, Inc., to develop and deploy a system that allows the existing fleet to practice VOC abatement at any of the active tank terminals in the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. This paper discusses: VOC environmental impact, {{the costs and benefits of}} practicing VOC abatement for bunkering products in terms of dollars per ton of abated VOCs, benefits to tankermenâ€™s health and welfare, an overview of available VOC abatement technologies, and specifics of the Foss-Glosten system, including system installation and operating costs...|$|R
5000|$|The NDPFV {{attempted}} control such resources {{primarily through}} oil [...] "bunkering", {{a process in}} which a petroleum pipeline is tapped and the petroleum extracted onto a <b>barge.</b> <b>Bunkering</b> is illegal in the eyes of both the Nigerian state and the petroleum corporations, but is justified by the militias on the basis that they are being exploited and have not received adequate profits from the monstrously profitable but ecologically destructive petroleum industry. Bunkered petroleum is usually sold for profit, usually to destinations in West Africa, but also further afield. Bunkering is a fairly common practice in the Delta but in this case the militia groups are the primary 'perpetrators'.|$|R
