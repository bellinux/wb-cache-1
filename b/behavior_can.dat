5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding <b>behavior</b> <b>can</b> be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake. This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Ranging <b>behavior</b> <b>can</b> also exhibit {{seasonal}} variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or}} in groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} frill use in sexual display was first {{proposed}} in 1961 by Davitashvili. This theory has gained increasing acceptance. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship {{or in other}} social <b>behavior,</b> <b>can</b> {{be seen in the}} fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about <b>behavior</b> <b>can</b> also {{be drawn}} from {{examination}} of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can either}} choose {{to play a}} ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, {{where they will be}} matched with other players using a system called TrueSkill Matchmaking, or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games. Like the {{original}} Perfect Dark, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and <b>behavior</b> <b>can</b> be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them {{as long as they are}} on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.|$|E

30|$|Behavior-based {{artificial}} intelligence {{is the concept}} that intelligence can emerge through the interactions of simple, individual behaviors lacking centralized control. Combining several well-defined but separate <b>behaviors</b> <b>can</b> result {{in the emergence of}} intelligent systemic behavior. When used in software and robotics, this approach can provide a high level of robustness, as failed <b>behaviors</b> <b>can</b> be ignored while default behaviors are activated (Brooks 1999). The division of logic between <b>behavior</b> modules <b>can</b> allow the system to scale to a high level of complexity without imposing an unmanageable cognitive load on software developers.|$|R

5|$|The Kingdom Hearts games contain {{elements}} of action role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. The games {{are driven by}} a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown {{in the form of}} a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their <b>behavior</b> <b>can</b> be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one's party members.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} {{their use in}} sexual display was first {{proposed}} by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social <b>behavior,</b> <b>can</b> {{be seen in the}} fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. A 2006 study of the smallest Triceratops skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed at a very early age, predating sexual development and thus probably important for visual communication and species recognition in general. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E
