40|$|Introduction to {{the style}} of the course I plan to prepare extra {{material}} in the form of these notes, as we go. I will add remarks, examples, references, intuition, and, I hope, insight. You should have the book, A First Course in Stochastic Processes, by Karlin and Taylor, 2 nd edition, which I think is quite clear. You'll get more out of the course by doing more of the problems in the book. From time to time I will make a reality check by giving a quiz. Questions are strongly encouraged at all times. If you are willing to work, you can make up for alot of what you may be lacking in prerequisites; I will tell you what to read, etc, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to ask questions; don't allow yourself to fall behind. For next time, please read Chapter 1 of and do as many of the problems as you can. I'll be available to ask questions - I'm in Hill 569 across the hall. Reach me by e-mail at: shepp@stat. rutgers. edu I will provide notes electronically so you don't need to take notes in class,...|$|E

Heart-felt thanks go to my soul mate and biggest fan, my husband, Joel Brown, who always believed that I would complete this educational journey. Your patience, love, support, and sacrifice allowed me to accomplish this goal. Morgan Joel, thank you for your patience in allowing Mommy to finish her homework. Your love and encouragement inspired me to forge ahead and complete the journey. And no, you don’t have to get three degrees. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to get at least one! Carla, my dear sweet sister. Without you, what would I do? Thank you for being Morgan’s surrogate mother when I was busy on this journey, lending me a helping hand when you knew I was stressed, and for listening to me when I needed to vent. Toi, you have grown up before my very eyes. Thank you for being a good big cousin to Morgan during these last couple of years. I look forward to helping you acquire your Ph. D. when the time comes...|$|E

40|$|The Liberal Party {{must not}} allow itself {{to become a}} haven for extremists, writes BRIAN COSTAR AS THE Liberal Party begins the painful but {{essential}} task of reconstruction after Saturday’s electoral catastrophe, it could do worse than heed {{the words of the}} late Victorian Liberal Party minister Walter Jona. In his book People, Parliament and Politics Jona lamented those on his side of politics who called themselves “conservatives”. He then asked: “Why can’t all Liberals simply say ‘we in the great Australian Liberal Party’ and be thoroughly proud of saying it that way?” Why indeed? While {{it is not unusual for}} a political party long in opposition to drift towards its ideological extreme - the Labor Party did it with disastrous consequences in the 1950 s and 1960 s - it is strange that over the past decade the Liberal Party has done so while in government. A party like the Liberals can, and must, accommodate people who hold both progressive and conservative views. Indeed, it has shown in the past that it can benefit from the input of those who are economically conservative and socially progressive. What it must not do is present as a haven for extremists. When a faction within the NSW division is referred to by its opponents, only half-jokingly, as “the Taliban” a serious situation exists. Also, while mainstream political parties should be respectful and welcoming of people of faith, as well as non-believers, they run grave risks if they allow religious fanatics to use the party to prosecute extremist agendas. The Australian Liberal Party is not the south-western Pacific branch of the United States’ Republican Party and any member who thinks it is should be courteously invited to take up permanent residence in Texas. As the self-appointed and honorary adviser to the Liberal Party (why not? everyone else is), may I suggest what not to do? Do not repeat the farce of the 1980 s revolving door of leaders. Accept that the party probably won’t win the 2010 election, or the double-dissolution election that may occur in 2008, and choose - and stick with - a leader for the long term. There is no quick fix and messiahs are hard to come by these days. Do not continue to fight “culture wars”. Leave the contest to the intellectual class, it keeps them busy and the rest of us amused. Do not go on about how the ALP is controlled by unions, because it isn’t. You know it and so does the electorate. That’s why the “ 70 % union-dominated Labor government” mantra did you no good last Saturday. Do not commission a retired federal or state party director to conduct a review of the 2007 election campaign and produce the usual anodyne report, which looks invariably like a photocopy of the last one. Or if it does make tough recommendations, these are rarely implemented or worse, are used as weapons by factional warriors to settle scores. Do not turn a blind eye to the condition of the state divisions because, unlike when in government, you’re going to need them. Accept that almost all of them are seriously dysfunctional and that political and personal relationships within them are toxic. Firm action will be required here by the federal organisation and, given the historical independence granted to the state branches, it will be painful and will involve political risk. But if the problem is ignored it will grow. Do not listen to those who urge a merger with the Nationals: it will prove a divisive diversion. Research in the early 1990 s showed that the effort is not worth the candle because rather than winning votes, a blended party would lose them. Remember, however, what Robert Menzies said about the importance of maintaining good relations with the Nationals. You don’t have to always love them <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to work with them. A serious discussion about the nature of the Coalition can only be productive, especially if it stops hostile three-cornered contests that cost you seats last Saturday. Don’t become too obsessed with policy development. It’s too early in the electoral cycle and there are more important things to do. And don’t be depressed by doomsayers who will tell you the party’s “rooned”. They said that in 1983 and 1993 and will be proved wrong again. Big parties with fifty-year histories don’t disappear overnight. • Brian Costar is professor of Victorian state parliamentary democracy at Swinburne University of Technology.
