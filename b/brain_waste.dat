30|$|There {{are certain}} {{phenomena}} {{related to the}} action of migration, which take place either in the outgoing or incoming country: brain drain and <b>brain</b> <b>waste.</b> Through measures taken within the Mobility Partnership both of them should be prevented. The first term means that mostly people with high potential and specific qualification emigrate to have better opportunities of working and earning abroad. Clearly, there are negative effects produced on their cities and countries of origin, if specifically those skilled workers and highly qualified workforces are missing, who are often quite important for developments in the home society (e.g., medicines, scientists, etc.). <b>Brain</b> <b>waste,</b> on the other hand, describes the phenomenon of “de-qualification” of people conducting jobs below their qualification in a low-skill sector abroad, not making use of their skills {{and in the course}} of time even losing them. Both the phenomena can be observed during the migration term, but as well on the return [6 : 37]. Brain drain and <b>brain</b> <b>waste</b> are hard to quantify since the data recording on education or skills has not been given much of a priority in the past. However, as the awareness on the importance of skills and qualification is rising, data collecting in the field is on the rise as well. According to the evaluation report, EU members and participants in the partnership do not see the emigration of knowledge, its effect on Moldova and the structure of its economy as their responsibility [6 : 35 – 36], so to say as “[…] beyond the sphere of migration policy.” [6 : 36] Therefore, corresponding to the evaluators only few activities were accomplished in preventing brain drain- with some exceptions such as study visits and returning programs [6 : 35 – 36]. Whereas in the prevention of <b>brain</b> <b>waste</b> an initiative on skills validation was started for returning migrants and concepts were formed on the level of recognition of qualification. The report definitely highlights the impulse given by the mobility partnership addressing the questions of validation and description of different types of learning and the recognition of qualifications [6 : 38].|$|E

The consequences of this migration can be significant for donor countries where physician densities are already low. In addition, a significant number of migrating physicians fall victim to “brain waste” upon arrival in higher-income countries, with their skills either underutilized or not utilized at all. In order to better understand the phenomena of brain drain and <b>brain</b> <b>waste,</b> we conducted an anonymous online survey of international medical graduates (IMGs) from low-income and middle-income countries who were actively pursuing a medical residency position in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Approximately 6, 000 physicians were contacted by email and asked to fill out an online survey consisting of closed-ended and open-ended questions. The data collected were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis approach. Results: A total of 483 IMGs responded to our survey and 462 were eligible for participation. Many were older physicians who had spent a considerable amount of time and money trying to obtain a medical residency position. The top five reasons for respondents choosing to emigrate from their home country were: socioeconomic or political situations in their home countries; better education for children; concerns about where to raise children; quality of facilities and equipment; and opportunities for professional advancement. These same reasons were the top five reasons given for choosing to immigrate to Canada. Themes that emerged from the qualitative responses pertaining to <b>brain</b> <b>waste</b> included feelings of anger, shame, desperation, and regret. Conclusion: Respondents overwhelmingly held the view that there are not enough residency positions available in Ontario and that this information is not clearly communicated to incoming IMGs. <b>Brain</b> <b>waste</b> appears common among IMGs who immigrate to Canada and should be made a priority for Canadian policy-makers.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{critique}} of the adoption of incentivised recycling policies in the UK, through an exploration of Hegel's dialectic and concept of plasticity, as developed by French philosopher Catherine Malabou. With reference to Malabou’s use of neuroscientific research, it argues that the brain {{can be viewed as a}} metaphor for the connections between people in the world, with neural pathways representing habits that can be formed and resist deformation. What plasticity captures is our propensity to procrastinate, both individually and socially. I argue that the plastic brain represents the connections between all entities, that is human beings and the environment. It is suggested that UK policies will only succeed in diverting waste from landfill by means of retraining our habitual behaviour away from throwing unwanted waster away and towards recycling. The article then considers how the work of Hegel and Malabou can be used to demonstrate that recycling is a matter of maintaining the connectivity of the whole plastic <b>brain,</b> whilst <b>waste</b> disposal disrupts this connectivity, like Alzheimers or some other degenerative condition, through being forgotten 6. Furthermore, because the environment is incorporated in the plastic brain through a post-humanist approach, it can be argued that discarding waste can also be taken as a metaphor for marginalising people in wasted lives, because they are no longer needed or don’t meet requirements anymore. The plasticity of the dialectic shows that resistance or procrastination is an essential or natural element of recycling, which is therefore naturally going to take time...|$|R

50|$|A {{congenital}} {{deficiency in}} 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity {{is believed to}} lead to hypotonia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperlactatemia. It {{is characterized by the}} buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body and a variety of neurological problems. Signs and symptoms of this condition usually first appear shortly after birth, and they can vary widely among affected individuals. The most common feature is a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, severe breathing problems, and an abnormal heartbeat. People with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency usually have neurological problems as well. Most have delayed development of mental abilities and motor skills such as sitting and walking. Other neurological problems can include intellectual disability, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), poor coordination, and difficulty walking. Some affected individuals have abnormal brain structures, such as underdevelopment of the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the <b>brain</b> (corpus callosum), <b>wasting</b> away (atrophy) of the exterior part of the brain known as the cerebral cortex, or patches of damaged tissue (lesions) on some parts of the brain.
