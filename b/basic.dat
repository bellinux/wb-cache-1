5|$|<b>Basic</b> Guides were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art <b>Basic</b> Guide focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics <b>Basic</b> Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The Language and Literature <b>Basic</b> Guide provides students with a <b>basic</b> grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math <b>Basic</b> Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music <b>Basic</b> Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the <b>Basic</b> Guides were incorporated into the year's Resource Guides.|$|E

5|$|The other game Ahl {{originally}} ported to <b>BASIC,</b> Lunar Lander, {{appeared in}} the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim Storer while {{a high school student}} in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written in <b>BASIC</b> by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in <b>BASIC.</b> Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to <b>BASIC,</b> changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. A year or so later, all three <b>BASIC</b> versions of the game appeared in 101 <b>BASIC</b> Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to the textual summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft <b>BASIC,</b> changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of <b>BASIC</b> Computer Games.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, DEC {{employee}} David H. Ahl converted two minicomputer games, Hamurabi and Lunar Lander, {{from the}} FOCAL language to <b>BASIC,</b> partially {{as a demonstration}} of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing <b>BASIC</b> games in the DEC newsletter he edited, both ones he wrote and reader submissions. In 1973, he released the book 101 <b>BASIC</b> Computer Games, containing descriptions and the source code for video games written in <b>BASIC.</b> The games included were written by both Ahl and others, and included both games original to the language and ported from other languages such as FOCAL. Many of these ports were originally mainframe computer games. 101 <b>BASIC</b> Computer Games was a landmark title in computer games programming, and was a best-selling title with more than 10,000 copies sold—more sales than computers in existence at the time. Its second edition in 1978, titled <b>BASIC</b> Computer Games, was the first million-selling computer book. As such, the <b>BASIC</b> ports of mainframe computer games included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe computer games.|$|E
