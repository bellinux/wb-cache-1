On 15 September, a senior Palestinian diplomat said that [...] "we will make the final decision soon" [...] when disputed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas [...] "announce the final decision."

5000|$|Bassam is an Arabic {{name and}} a given name roughly meaning [...] "one who smiles". More accurately, it is the Arabic name [...] "Basem" [...] (often {{incorrectly}} written in English as Bassem) that translates to [...] "one who smiles". <b>Basem</b> is the agent noun of the Arabic verb with the root ba-sa-ma, which means to smile. The name [...] "Bassam" [...] is the exaggerated form of the agent noun (Arabic: صيغه مبالغه), and would therefore roughly translates to [...] "one who smiles profusely".|$|E

50|$|On January 15, 2008, {{the son of}} Mahmoud al-Zahar, {{the leader}} of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, was killed (another son {{was killed in a}} 2003 {{assassination}} attempt on Zahar). Three days later, Israel Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered Israel Defense Forces to seal all border crossings with Gaza, cutting off the flow of supplies to the territory in an attempt to stop rocket barrages on Israeli border towns. Nevertheless, violence from both sides only increased. On February 4, 2008, two friends (Mohammed Herbawi, Shadi Zghayer), who were members of the Masjad al-Jihad soccer team, staged a suicide bombing at commercial center in Dimona, Israel. Herbawi had previously been arrested as a 17-year-old on 15 March 2003 shortly after a suicide bombing on Haifa bus (by Mamoud al-Qawasmeh on March 5, 2003) and coordinated suicide shooting attacks on Israeli settlements by others on the team (March 7, 2003, Muhsein, Hazem al-Qawasmeh, Fadi Fahuri, Sufian Hariz) and before another set of suicide bombings by team members in Hebron and Jerusalem on May 17-18, 2003 (Fuad al-Qawasmeh, <b>Basem</b> Takruri, Mujahed al-Ja'abri). Although Hamas claimed responsibility for the Dimona attack, the politburo leadership in Damascus and Beirut was clearly initially unaware of who initiated and carried out the attack. It appears that Ahmad al-Ja'abri, military commander of Hamas's Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in Gaza requested the suicide attack through Ayoub Qawasmeh, Hamas's military liaison in Hebron, who knew where to look for eager young men who had self-radicalized together and had already mentally prepared themselves for martyrdom.|$|E
5000|$|Although Melville's first biographers did {{not know}} of its existence, as early as 1922 the writer Meade Minnigerode found a cache of Melville family letters in the New York Public Library which {{included}} several references in 1853 to a major work which was not subsequently published. Harrison Hayford in 1946 suggested that the confirmation in a newly found letter that Melville had completed a major project after the failure of Moby-Dick exposed [...] "serious errors in the theory now generally held", that Melville [...] "in despair and defiance at the reception of Moby-Dick had written Pierre with [...] "no expectation that it would succeed with the public", and expected that it would be his last book. Merton M. Sealts, Jr., in state of the field note of 1980, endorsed the possibility that Melville wrote the story in the winter of 1853 with Hawthorne's style in mind and that the work was a transition toward the [...] "Hawthornesqe symbolism" [...] of Melville's later stories. Sealts quotes Melville’s letter to Harper's Magazine of November 24, 1853, referring to [...] "the work which I took to New York last Spring, but which I was prevented from printing at that time..." [...] Parker in 1990 suggested that the [...] "Agatha story" [...] was the [...] "Isle of the Cross" [...] and devoted extensive space to it in the second volume of his Melville biography. In 1991, <b>Basem</b> L. Ra'ad concluded that [...] "The Isle of the Cross" [...] refers to a story, not a full-length book, and that the story was incorporated into [...] "Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles", a series of sketches published in the Piazza Tales.|$|E
