40|$|The {{recently}} developed technique of field ion mi-croscopy (FIM) {{is a powerful}} tool for the investiga-tion of metal surfaces. In many instances, resolution of individual atoms in the metallic lattice has been possible (1). Recent progress in electrode kinetics has shown the need for models on a true atomic scale for the interpretation of phenomena occurring at the electrified interface. The use of FIM for electrochemistry provides an opportunity to observe surface effects on a scale in which the elementary electrochemical steps occur. Ex-periments have been performed based on the se-quence: 1. image ir idium tip (after shaping to almost per-fect hemispherical form and atomic smoothness by field induced evaporation); 2. bring to atmospheric pressure and remove tip from FIM; 3. immerse for specified time in electrolyte with ir idium ions; 4. rinse electrolyte from tip; 5. return to FIM and image again. Changes on the surface have been photographically recorded and compared with those occurring in a "blank " experiment during which the tip is treated in a similar electrolyte, but free of ir idium ions. The rate of exchange of charge at the equil ibrium potential between a metal and its ions is the exchange current density, a central concept of electrode kinetics (2). Thus, rearrangement of a previously smooth sur-face should be expected as atoms from the metal be-come involved in the exchange of charge. The extent of this perturbation is expected to be an increasing function of the time of contact of the metal with the electrolyte and of the magnitude of the exchange current. FIM prepared iridium tips have been im-mersed for various times in acid solution (2 N H 2 SO 4) containing 10 - 6 M iridium ion.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{focussed}} on {{the evaluation of}} ductile fracture methodologies, which are needed to predict product shapes in the blanking process. In an earlier publication [Goijaerts et al., J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., Trans. ASME 122 (2000) 476], two approaches were elaborated using local ductile fracture models. The first strategy incorporates the characterisation of a ductile fracture model in a <b>blanking</b> <b>experiment.</b> The second methodology is more favourable for industry. In this approach, instead of a complex and elaborate <b>blanking</b> <b>experiment,</b> a tensile test is used to characterise a newly proposed criterion, which was shown to predict accurately the ductile fracture for different loading conditions. In this paper, finite element simulations and experiments are performed on both tensile testing and blanking to evaluate the validity of both approaches with corresponding criteria for five different metals. In the blanking process, different clearances as well as different cutting radii of the tools are considered. In conclusion, it can be stated that the first approach gives very good results close to, or within the experimental error for all five materials. The second approach, the more favourable one for industry, yields good results that deviate slightly more over the range of metals. # 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

However, limited research is available on the effect of atmospheric pollutants on these materials, especially pollutants generated indoors.

Therefore, the colourimetric method was compared to dye extraction and liquid chromatographic analysis to justify its use as a rapid, non-destructive method for quantitative assessment of the rate of change in dye content of colour photographs during degradation. The effects of typical indoor (acetic acid, formaldehyde) and outdoor (nitrogen dioxide) generated pollutants on chromogenic colour prints were then investigated at 80 degrees C, 60 % RH.

In the current study possible mechanisms underpinning distortions in the perception of dynamic, ecologically-valid, {{facial expressions}} were explored. In four experiments we examined to what extent basic perceptual processes such as contrast/context effects, adaptation and representational momentum underpinned the perceptual distortions, and to what extent ‘emotional anticipation’, i. e. the involuntary anticipation of the other’s emotional state of mind on the basis of the immediate perceptual history, might have played a role. Neutral facial expressions displayed at the end of short video-clips, in which an initial facial expression of joy or anger gradually morphed into a neutral expression, were misjudged as being slightly angry or slightly happy, respectively (Experiment 1). This response bias disappeared when the actor’s identity changed in the final neutral expression (Experiment 2).
