50|$|One {{problem with}} adding a tweeter to a bass speaker cabinet {{is that the}} tweeter may be damaged by the overdriven {{amplifier}} tone that is popular in some musical genres, since overdriving the amplifier adds {{a great deal of}} high frequency information to the signal. Horns and speakers in the same cabinet are sometimes wired separately, {{so that they can be}} driven by separate amplifiers. <b>Biamplified</b> systems and separately-wired cabinets produced by manufacturers such as Gallien-Krueger and Carvin and other manufacturers allow bassists to send an overdriven low-pitched sound to the speaker, and a crisp, undistorted high-pitched sound to the horn, which prevents this problem. Since the 1960s, some bassists have obtained a similar result by plugging their bass into both an electric guitar guitar amp and a bass amp. This approach does not use a crossover, but since an electric guitar amp will only produce pitches down to about 80 Hz, the guitar amp reproduces the mid- to high frequencies and the bass amp reproduces the low frequencies. With this arrangement, distortion and other effects can be applied to the guitar amp without affecting the solidity of the bass amp tone.|$|E
