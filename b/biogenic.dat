5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with <b>biogenic</b> amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E
5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be <b>biogenic</b> precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, <b>biogenic</b> graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the <b>biogenic</b> flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogenic</b> amines {{have been}} implicated as a {{potential}} cause of red wine headaches. In wine, histamine, cadaverine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, and tyramine have all been detected. These amines are created by the degradation of amino acids found in grape must and {{left over from the}} breakdown of dead yeast cells after fermentation. Most LAB have the potential to create <b>biogenic</b> amines, even some strains of O. oeni, but high levels of <b>biogenic</b> amines are most often associated with species from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. In the European Union, the concentration of <b>biogenic</b> amines in wine is beginning to be monitored, while the United States currently does not have any regulations.|$|E

25|$|Reserpine {{was also}} highly {{influential}} {{in promoting the}} thought of a <b>biogenic</b> amine hypothesis of depression— see Everett & Tolman, 1959.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogenic</b> {{deposition}} from suspension {{may also}} supply sediment to these deepwater bottom-currents. The deposition {{of this material}} has strong implications for the biology, chemistry and flow conditions at the time. It must occur in areas of high <b>biogenic</b> productivity, during periods of relatively quiet flow and, if calcareous, must also occur at depths above the carbonate compensation depth. There is also {{a contribution to the}} concentration of suspended sediment by the burrowing activity of benthic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Natural gas {{is found}} in deep {{underground}} rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates. Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found {{in close proximity to}} and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: <b>biogenic</b> and thermogenic. <b>Biogenic</b> gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.|$|E
25|$|Fish is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} product. The fishy smell of dead fish {{is due to the}} breakdown of amino acids into <b>biogenic</b> amines and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|The Chimaera gas seep, near Çıralı, Antalya (southwest Turkey), {{has been}} {{continuously}} active for millennia {{and it is}} known to be the source of the first Olympic fire in the Hellenistic period. On the basis of chemical composition and isotopic analysis, the Chimaera gas is said to be about half <b>biogenic</b> and half abiogenic gas, the largest emission of <b>biogenic</b> methane discovered; deep and pressurized gas accumulations necessary to sustain the gas flow for millennia, posited to be from an inorganic source, may be present. Local geology of Chimaera flames, at exact position of flames, reveals contact between serpentinized ophiolite and carbonate rocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} life on Earth is <b>biogenic</b> graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. A 2015 study found potentially <b>biogenic</b> carbon from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in Western Australia, but such findings would indicate the existence of different conditions on Earth during that period from those generally assumed today, and point to an earlier origin of life. In 2017, there was published a description of putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3.77 billion, and possibly 4.28 billion years old, in ferruginous sedimentary rocks in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} for a <b>biogenic</b> occurrence of dolomite. One example {{is that of the}} formation of dolomite in the urinary bladder of a Dalmatian dog, possibly as the result of an illness or infection.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 Rolland and Hungarian scholar, {{philosopher and}} natural living {{experimenter}} Edmund Bordeaux Szekely founded the International <b>Biogenic</b> Society {{to promote and}} expand on their ideas of the integration of mind, body and spirit.|$|E
25|$|Food {{intolerance}} are {{all other}} adverse reactions to food. Subgroups include enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase deficiency), pharmacological (e.g. reactions against <b>biogenic</b> amines, histamine intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives).|$|E
25|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{is different from}} <b>biogenic</b> oil in {{that the role of}} deep-dwelling microbes is a biological source for oil which is not of a sedimentary origin and is not sourced from surface carbon. Deep microbial life is only a contaminant of primordial hydrocarbons. Parts of microbes yield molecules as biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Gold, in a 1999 book, {{cited the}} {{discovery}} of thermophile bacteria in the Earth's crust as new support for the postulate that these bacteria could explain the existence of certain biomarkers in extracted petroleum. A rebuttal of <b>biogenic</b> origins based on biomarkers has been offered by Kenney, et al. (2001).|$|E
25|$|The Spratly Islands {{consist of}} islands, reefs, banks and shoals that consist of <b>biogenic</b> {{carbonate}}. These accumulations of <b>biogenic</b> carbonate lie upon the higher crests of major submarine ridges that are uplifted fault blocks known by geologists as horsts. These horsts {{are part of}} a series of parallel and en echelon, half-grabens and rotated fault-blocks. The long axes of the horsts, rotated fault blocks and half-grabens form well-defined linear trends that lie parallel to magnetic anomalies exhibited by the oceanic crust of the adjacent South China Sea. The horsts, rotated fault blocks, and the rock forming the bottoms of associated grabens consist of stretched and subsided continental crust that is composed of Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous strata that include calc-alkalic extrusive igneous rocks, intermediate to acid intrusive igneous rocks, sandstones, siltstones, dark-green claystones, and metamorphic rocks that include biotitemuscovitefeldsparquartz migmatites and garnetmica schists.|$|E
25|$|Edible {{vegetable}} oils also typically contain small fractions of <b>biogenic</b> alkanes {{with a wide}} spectrum of carbon numbers, mainly 8 to 35, usually peaking in the low to upper 20s, with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram (parts per million by weight) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction.|$|E
25|$|Antihistamines are {{effective}} at treating mild cases of pollinosis, {{this type of}} non-prescribed drugs includes loratadine, cetirizine and chlorpheniramine. They do not prevent the discharge of histamine, {{but it has been}} proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this <b>biogenic</b> amine, which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.|$|E
25|$|GPCRs {{respond to}} {{extracellular}} signals mediated {{by a huge}} diversity of agonists, ranging from proteins to <b>biogenic</b> amines to protons, but all transduce this signal via a mechanism of G-protein coupling. This is {{made possible by a}} guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain primarily formed by a combination of IL-2 and IL-3 along with adjacent residues of the associated TM helices.|$|E
25|$|As an alternative, several {{researchers}} {{have investigated the}} precipitation of metals using <b>biogenic</b> sulfide. In this process, Sulfate-reducing bacteria oxidize organic matter using sulfate, instead of oxygen. Their metabolic products include bicarbonate, which can neutralize water acidity, and hydrogen sulfide, which forms highly insoluble precipitates with many toxic metals. Although promising, this process has been slow in being adopted {{for a variety of}} technical reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{appendix}} {{is attached}} to the inferior surface of the cecum, and contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. However, the appendix is known to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release <b>biogenic</b> amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development. The appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence to the patient.|$|E
25|$|Trace amines are {{endogenous}} amines which act as agonists at TAAR1 and {{are present}} in extracellular concentrations of 0.1–10 in the brain, constituting less than 1% of total <b>biogenic</b> amines in the mammalian nervous system. Some of the human trace amines include tryptamine, phenethylamine (PEA), , , , , , , and synephrine. These share structural similarities with the three common monoamines: serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Each ligand has a different potency, measured as increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration after the binding event.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} {{atmospheric}} aerosol {{have a significant}} effect on Earth's climate: volcanic, desert dust, sea-salt, that originating from <b>biogenic</b> sources and human-made. Volcanic aerosol forms in the stratosphere after an eruption as droplets of sulfuric acid that can prevail for up to two years, and reflect sunlight, lowering temperature. Desert dust, mineral particles blown to high altitudes, absorb heat and may be responsible for inhibiting storm cloud formation. Human-made sulfate aerosols, primarily from burning oil and coal, affect the behavior of clouds.|$|E
25|$|Methane is {{ubiquitous}} in crustal fluid and gas. Research continues {{to attempt to}} characterise crustal sources of methane as <b>biogenic</b> or abiogenic using carbon isotope fractionation of observed gases (Lollar & Sherwood 2006). There are few clear examples of abiogenic methane-ethane-butane, as the same processes favor enrichment of light isotopes in all chemical reactions, whether organic or inorganic. δ13C of methane overlaps that of inorganic carbonate and graphite in the crust, which are heavily depleted in 12C, and attain this by isotopic fractionation during metamorphic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Incineration {{plants can}} {{generate}} {{electricity and heat}} that can substitute power plants powered by other fuels at the regional electric and district heating grid, and steam supply for industrial customers. Incinerators and other waste-to-energy plants generate at least partially biomass-based renewable energy that offsets greenhouse gas pollution from coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants. The E.U. considers energy generated from <b>biogenic</b> waste (waste with biological origin) by incinerators as non-fossil renewable energy under its emissions caps. These greenhouse gas reductions are {{in addition to those}} generated by the avoidance of landfill methane.|$|E
25|$|One is shallow, biogenically derived gas {{in mixed}} sand and shale sequences. Shallow <b>biogenic</b> gas is {{considered}} to be an unconventional gas resource since it is not generated in the same temperature and pressure systems found in conventional hydrocarbon generation. The Milk River and Medicine Hat sands of southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan are classic examples of this type of unconventional gas. This is the area where gas was first produced in western Canada, and it is still a major producing region. This continuously gas-producing area is the largest in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.|$|E
25|$|Ammolite is an opal-like organic {{gemstone}} found primarily {{along the}} eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains of North America. It is made of the fossilized shells of ammonites, which in turn are composed primarily of aragonite, the same mineral contained in nacre, with a microstructure inherited from the shell. It is one of few <b>biogenic</b> gemstones; others include amber and pearl.1 In 1981, ammolite was given official gemstone status by the World Jewellery Confederation (CIBJO), the same year commercial mining of ammolite began. It was designated the official gemstone of the City of Lethbridge, Alberta in 2007.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{maintains}} {{a catalog of}} 34 Mars meteorites. These assets are highly valuable since {{they are the only}} physical samples available of Mars. Studies conducted by NASA's Johnson Space Center show that at least three of the meteorites contain potential evidence of past life on Mars, in the form of microscopic structures resembling fossilized bacteria (so-called biomorphs). Although the scientific evidence collected is reliable, its interpretation varies. To date, none of the original lines of scientific evidence for the hypothesis that the biomorphs are of exobiological origin (the so-called <b>biogenic</b> hypothesis) have been either discredited or positively ascribed to non-biological explanations.|$|E
25|$|Microbial corrosion, or {{commonly}} known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and non-metallic materials, in {{the presence or absence}} of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen sulfide, causing sulfide stress cracking. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing <b>biogenic</b> sulfide corrosion. Concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products, leading to localized corrosion.|$|E
25|$|More {{volatile}} short-chain alkanes {{are also}} produced by and found in plant tissues. The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally {{high levels of}} n-heptane in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, pentane, and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not {{generally considered to be}} a major component of <b>biogenic</b> air pollution.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{studies of}} mantle-derived rocks from many places {{have shown that}} {{hydrocarbons}} from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe. However, the content of such hydrocarbons in such rocks are extremely low and seem to lack accumulation in concentrations that would render them feasible for exploitation. Scientific consensus {{on the origin of}} oil and gas is that all natural oil and gas deposits on Earth are fossil fuels and are, therefore, <b>biogenic.</b> Globally significant amounts of abiotic oil in the crust can even be ruled out. Yet, abiogenesis of small quantities of oil and gas remains an area of ongoing research in limited, mostly just laboratory, scale.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} thing to consider when assessing the urban forest's effect on air quality is that trees emit some <b>biogenic</b> volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). These are the chemicals (primarily isoprene and monoterpenes) {{that make up the}} essential oils, resins, and other organic compounds that plants use to attract pollinators and repel predators. As mentioned above, VOCs react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to form ozone. BVOCs account for less than 10% of the total amount of BVOCs emitted in urban areas. This means that BVOC emissions from trees can contribute to the formation of ozone. Although their contribution may be small compared with other sources, BVOC emissions could exacerbate a smog problem.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{particles}} {{derive from}} the oxidation of primary gases such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides into sulfuric acid (liquid) and nitric acid (gaseous). The precursors for these aerosols—i.e. the gases from which they originate—may have an anthropogenic origin (from fossil fuel or coal combustion) and a natural <b>biogenic</b> origin. In the presence of ammonia, secondary aerosols often {{take the form of}} ammonium salts; i.e. ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate (both can be dry or in aqueous solution); in the absence of ammonia, secondary compounds take an acidic form as sulfuric acid (liquid aerosol droplets) and nitric acid (atmospheric gas), all of which may contribute to the health effects of particulates.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of cell walls varies between species and {{may depend on}} cell type and developmental stage. The primary cell wall of land plants is composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Often, other polymers such as lignin, suberin or cutin are anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls. Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls of archaea have various compositions, and may be formed of glycoprotein S-layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or polysaccharides. Fungi possess cell walls made of the glucosamine polymer chitin. Unusually, diatoms have a cell wall composed of <b>biogenic</b> silica.|$|E
