5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than <b>bright.</b> <b>In</b> 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
5|$|Her {{appearances}} {{became more}} regular from July 2014 onwards, with her stepping up her blackmail and revealing Ian's actions to Denise's protective father figure, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). In August 2014, Ian's friend Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, pulled over behind Ian and Rainie {{when he spotted}} them talking. Ian drove off and Rainie approaches Mick, believing {{him to be a}} customer of her prostitute services. The police then pulled up behind Mick, and arrested him for soliciting. When Ian explained Rainie's blackmail, Mick agreed to cover for him, {{to ensure the safety of}} his fake alibi. As a result of this, Rainie was reconciled with her mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), as Cora supported Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie <b>Bright)</b> <b>in</b> court before bumping into her daughter. Rainie wants nothing to do with Cora, and pretends the allegations against Mick are true.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they are <b>bright</b> <b>in</b> forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these domes are <b>bright</b> <b>in</b> color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented snow from piling on the roof.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm). Light {{at those}} wavelengths are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very <b>bright</b> <b>in</b> this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.|$|E

25|$|A special far {{ultraviolet}} camera, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph, {{was taken to}} the lunar surface on Apollo 16 and operated {{in the shadow of the}} Apollo Lunar Module (LM).

Two other faithless electors, David <b>Bright</b> <b>in</b> Maine and Muhammad Abdurrahman in Minnesota, attempted to cast their electoral votes for Sanders, but their votes were invalidated by their states' faithless elector laws; Bright subsequently switched his vote to Clinton as pledged, while Abdurrahman was replaced by another elector who voted for Clinton as pledged.|$|E
25|$|Eta Boötis appears {{close to}} the {{prominent}} star Arcturus (Alpha Bootis) in Earth's sky, and Arcturus is in fact its closest stellar neighbor, as both stars are nearly identical in distance from the Sun. The two stars are about 3.24 light years apart, and each would appear <b>bright</b> <b>in</b> the other's sky. Arcturus would appear as roughly magnitude -5.2 (about 120 times brighter than it appears from Earth, or close to twice the brightness of Venus) {{in the night sky}} of a hypothetical planet orbiting Eta Boötis, while Eta Boötis would appear at about magnitude 2.4 (absolute magnitude 2.41 at 0.99 parsec) in the sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Arcturus, or over twice the brightness of Sirius in the night sky.|$|E
25|$|Accounts are {{conflicting}} {{regarding the}} exact {{form of the}} Hungarian bagpipe. Cocks describes it as similar to the Bulgarian one which has a chanter and a bass drone but no tenor drone. Baines (pp. 77-79) gives Hungary {{as one of the}} countries possessing the duda, which has this construction, also a Hungarian bagpipe with a diple (i.e., twin-bore) chanter, one bore of which gives a variable drone, the bag pipe having a bass drone in addition. Robert <b>Bright</b> <b>in</b> Travels through Lower Hungary(1818), quoted by Flood (p. 79), describes the Hungarian bagpipe as having two drones and a chanter of square section (in other worlds the Dudelsack). Fraser (p. 243) has a picture of a Hungarian bagpipe with one chanter and one drone of medium length, probably a bass drone. It seems possible that all these forms of the instrument may be in use.|$|E
