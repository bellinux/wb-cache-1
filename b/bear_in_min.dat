We report the case of a 40 years old man who four days after an embolization with cyanoacrylate, begins with cough, bloody sputum, and right hemithorax pleuritic pain. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed with chest X ray, CT scan and scyntigraphy. The patient received anticoagulation, with adequate response. The most common complications of cerebral embolization are related to central nervous system and pulmonary embolism is exceptional.

40|$|I {{was invited}} to {{contribute}} to {{this special edition of}} the e - Journal of Portuguese History with a short piece on the late Professor Oliveira Marques and his contribution to Portuguese hi storiography, more specifically his contribution to our under standing of the First Republic (1910 - 1926). As someone who beg an his graduate studies i n 1992 having com pleted an undergraduate degree outside Portugal, and having set out to write a thesis about Portugal’s inter vention in World War One, I owe — like all other scholars of the period — an immense debt of gratit ude to Oliveira Marques, who over the course of some forty years of febrile activity contributed enormously {{to our understanding of the}} period. But this is a debt of gratitude qualified by the realization that there were certain limitations to Oliveira Marques’ writings on the subject of the First Republic, and that these ought to be <b>borne</b> <b>in</b> <b>min...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bone biopsy is {{not only}} the most {{important}} step in the diagnosis of bone tumours, but since the introduction of chemotherapy, it has also become essential in the evaluation of treatment of highly malignant bone tumours. A total of 206 bone biopsies were performed on 136 patients seen between January 1, 1978 and August 1, 1982 (99 open and 107 drill biopsies). Complications during or after biopsy were relatively rare, and none were of a serious nature. Pathological fractures at sites of biopsies developed exclusively in patients given chemotherapy. In gaining adequate histologic material, the overall result of open bone biopsies (98 %) was superior to that of drill biopsies (70 %). The choice between both techniques was dependent on individual patient factors. Of the total of 206 bone biopsies, 10 % proved not to be representative. It is concluded that, especially in patients given chemotherapy for a malignant tumour of a long bone, the possibility of a spontaneous fracture after a bone biopsy should be <b>borne</b> <b>in</b> <b>min...</b>|$|R
