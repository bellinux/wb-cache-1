500|$|The {{chemistry}} of astatine is [...] "clouded by the extremely low concentrations at which astatine experiments have been conducted, {{and the possibility}} of reactions with impurities, walls and filters, or radioactivity by-products, and other unwanted nano-scale interactions." [...] Many of its apparent chemical properties have been observed using tracer studies on extremely dilute astatine solutions, typically less than 10−10 mol·L−1. Some properties– such as anion formation– align with other halogens. Astatine has some metallic characteristics as well, such as plating onto a cathode, coprecipitating with metal sulfides in hydrochloric acid, and forming a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution. It forms complexes with EDTA, a metal chelating agent, and is capable of acting as a metal in antibody radiolabeling; in some respects astatine in the +1 state is akin to silver in the same state.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Anti-tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -α <b>biotherapies</b> have considerably {{changed the}} treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, serious infections are a major concern in patients with rheumatic diseases treated with anti-TNF-α. Little is known about viral, especially latent, infections in anti-TNF-α treatments. Infections by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a β-herpes virus, are frequent and induce a strong CD 4 pos T-cell immunity, which participates in the control of infection. We thus have chosen to analyze the CD 4 pos T-cell response to CMV antigens {{as a model of}} antiviral response in RA patients treated with anti-TNF-α. CD 28 expression was evaluated. METHODS: We have measured the CD 4 pos response to CMV antigens in RA patients, before and after initiation of treatment with an anti-TNF-α agent. The intracellular production of interferon (IFN) -γ in total and CD 28 neg CD 4 pos T cells in response to CMV antigens (Ags) was evaluated with flow cytometry. The proliferation of total CD 4 pos T cells in the presence of CMV antigens was measured with 3 H-thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: Anti-TNF-α treatments impaired neither the anti-CD 4 pos anti-CMV IFN-γ response nor the proliferative response in patients. The percentage of CD 28 neg CD 4 pos cells remained constant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the CD 4 pos T-cell response against CMV is not altered by anti-TNF-α treatments and that infection remains controlled in treated RA patients latently infected with CMV. Our observation brings new insight into the current knowledge of the risks of infection in patients treated with anti-TNF-α <b>biotherapies...</b>|$|R

Many prospective clinical trials were organized by the French Vasculitis Study Group and the European Vasculitis Study group, and have contributed to optimizing targeted treatment strategies. Recent therapeutic strategies include immunomodulating methods, like plasma exchanges, or products, like intravenous immunoglobulins, or, more recently, new agents called <b>biotherapies.</b> Some of them have achieved promising positive effects, for example, anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibodies, and are now being evaluated in prospective trials...|$|R
