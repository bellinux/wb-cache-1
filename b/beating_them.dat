5|$|Barcelona and Manchester United had {{previously}} {{faced each other}} nine times in European competitions: {{three times in the}} UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and six times in the UEFA Champions League. Of those nine matches, Manchester United had recorded three wins to Barcelona's two, with the remaining four matches finishing in draws. The only time that the two teams met in a final came in 1991, when they contested the 1991 Cup Winners' Cup final. The first meeting between the two sides came in the third round of the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup; Barcelona won the first leg at the Camp Nou 2–0, but Manchester United won the return leg 3–0 at Old Trafford to reach the semi-finals. That result marked Manchester United's biggest win over Barcelona; Barcelona's biggest win was a 4–0 home victory in the group stage of the 1994–95 Champions League.

5|$|Benfica started November by hosting Beira-Mar on the 2nd in the {{official}} opening of their new stadium. Beira-Mar won 2–1, inflicting Benfica's second league defeat, which opened an 11-point gap to Porto. Camacho blamed the defeat {{on the lack of}} goal opportunities. Four days later, Benfica received Molde for the UEFA Cup, <b>beating</b> <b>them</b> 3–1 and assuring a two-goal lead for the second leg. Camacho recognized the team was struggling to defend against corner-kicks, as both Beira-Mar and Molde had scored in corners. On 9 November, the team visited Alverca and won three-nil, with two goals from Tiago and one from Geovanni. Camacho was pleased with the performance, but said that Benfica should have scored more. On 12 November, Benfica played Marítimo, in a fixture transferred from October. Weakened by injuries in some of the regular players, Benfica could not do better than a one-all draw. Camacho attributed the result to the excessive number of games in short amount of time, something most of the players were not accustomed to. After a 10-day international break, Benfica opened the Portuguese Cup campaign against Estrela da Amadora on the 22nd. They won 3–1 with all of the goals arriving late in the game. Benfica closed the month with a 2–0 win to Molde, on the second leg of the UEFA Cup, with Tiago again scoring twice.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Maryland {{was again}} named the top-seed, despite having lost to second-seed Johns Hopkins {{during the regular}} season. In the championship game, Hopkins quickly took the lead, led by Hall of Fame attackman Jack Thomas and entered halftime with a 10–4 advantage. In the second half, Maryland outscored them 8–7, but the effort fell short. In 1975, Maryland defeated Hopkins, 19–11, before winning the national title, and won again the following year, 21–13, {{on their way to}} finish as national championship runners-up after an overtime loss to Cornell in the final. In 1977, the Blue Jays edged the Terrapins, 21–20, in the regular season and began a run in the series. Hopkins eliminated Maryland in the tournament semifinals in both 1977 and 1978, before <b>beating</b> <b>them</b> in the 1979 championship game at home in College Park, Maryland. During that game, the Blue Jays were able to limit the Terrapins' second all-time leading scorer and 1979 attackman of the year Bob Boneillo. During the 1970s, Maryland participated in six NCAA title games, including four in a row from 1973 to 1976. During that span, the Terps won two national titles and lost four.|$|E
5|$|Benfica {{played the}} second {{leg of the}} UEFA Cup third round on 3 March. At the Lerkendal Stadion, Rosenborg scored two goals inside the first 15 minutes, but Benfica regained their {{aggregate}} lead with a goal on the 19th minute. Despite playing with a man less in the second half, Moreira was not beaten again and Benfica went through to the next round on away goals. On the 7th, the team visited Gil Vicente's home stadium. Benfica scored first with Geovanni, but squandered two chances to make it 2–0. Instead Gil Vicente were able to equalize. Camacho substituted in Manuel Fernandes and the 17-year-old scored the winning-goal for Benfica. Camacho praised the players for maintaining their commitment after an exhausting European game. On the following Thursday, Benfica hosted Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup. The team had multiple chances against Toldo but could not beat him, with the match ending 0–0. On 14 March, Benfica played host to Marítimo, <b>beating</b> <b>them</b> 1–0 with a goal by Simão in the 81st minute. On the 17th, Benfica hosted Belenenses for the Portuguese Cup semi-final. With three goals scored in the first 36 minutes, Benfica managed the lead until the end. They qualified for their first final since 1997. On 21 March, Benfica visited the new Municipal de Aveiro to face the local team, Beira-Mar. With the team resting players for the game with Inter, Camacho brought in Nuno Gomes and the striker scored the winning goal with 15 minutes left to play. The win reduced the gap to Sporting to just 4 points. Four days later, Benfica and Inter Milan had an entertaining seven-goal thriller in the second leg of the UEFA Cup. At half-time, the teams were level, but in the 10 minutes between the 60th and 70th minute, Inter scored three to Benfica's one, opening a two-goal cushion. Benfica later reduced the lead to 4–3, but this was insufficient to prevent an elimination. Benfica closed March on the 28th. Two early goals allowed the team to cruise past Alverca, bringing their win tally to five wins in eight games.|$|E
