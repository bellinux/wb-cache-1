40|$|Decentralization {{is often}} hailed for moving govern-ment closer to its {{citizens}} and providing opportuni-ties {{for participation in}} decision making. Achieving this goal, however, depends {{on a variety of}} condi-tions, including establishing mechanisms to pro-mote <b>broad</b> <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> and more responsive and accountable local governments. These goals are especially relevant for East Asian countries pursu-ing large-scale decentralization programs. One mechanism intendedtomakedevelopmentplanning and management more responsive and account-able arises from what the World Bank has called community-driven development (CDD). A great deal of empirical evidence reveals that decentralization will not always achieve the goal of making local governments more responsive and accountable. They are often susceptible to elite cap-ture: that is, public decision making often reflects disproportionate influence by well-off and well-connected groups. In many countries, officials exploit the opportunities offered by decentraliza-tion to promote their own commercial activities. Standard mechanisms for accountability, such as elections, audits, and performance benchmarking...|$|E

The problem is: What does an effective system of accountability look like in a world of decentralized governance, shared power, collabora-tive decision processes, results-oriented management, and <b>broad</b> <b>civic</b> <b>participation?</b> This article examines how the theory of accountability has been reconfigured to fit the new para-digm for governance and places accountability in historical context to gain perspective for contemporary discussions of bureaucracy in a democracy. It finds that the conceptualization of democratic accountability varies dramatically over time. The Jacksonian, Progres-sives/New Deal, public-interest-egalitarian, neoconservative efficiency, and GREM models are all distinct conceptualizations of accountability. Each emphasizes different institutions and locates the authority for accountability in differing combinations and types of sectors (public, private, intermediary), processes, decision rules, knowledge, and values...|$|E
40|$|A long {{existing}} compulsive {{curriculum of}} ideological and political education is {{employed by the}} Chinese government to promote citizenship education among Chinese university students. This article builds {{on the findings of}} a mixed-methods research that examined the role of ideological and political education on university students’ civic perceptions and civic participation. The results showed little evidence of this curriculum having a clear effect on students’ political participation such as voting, as well as their idealized <b>broad</b> <b>civic</b> <b>participation,</b> but did reveal relatively positive effects on students’ civic intention and civic expression. In addition, it also identified its significant role in organizing students towards attending party-related activities. It shows that ideological and political education is insufficient to achieve specified aims of citizenship education among Chinese university students. We then argue that it results from a mechanistic understanding of citizenship and participation in educational policies and structural barriers to young people’s formal participation. Hence, this article argues that the forms and contents of citizenship education in China need to be reconsidered beyond the limits of the current ideological and political education and that the analyses contributed to an argument for a broader approach to citizenship education to be developed and adopted...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{studies in}} the U. S. context have {{suggested}} that political participation {{is a function of}} the size and concentration of a city’s population. Most of this research focuses on the idea that there is an optimal size and concentration of population that favors active political participation in terms of a higher propensity to vote in local elections, contact local officials, and attend community meetings.

40|$|Purpose – Rulemaking (the process {{agencies}} use to {{make new}} health, safety, social and economic regulations) {{is one of the}} US Government’s most important policymaking methods and has long been a target for e-government efforts. Although broad transparency and participation rights are part of its legal structure, significant barriers prevent effective engagement by many citizens. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – RegulationRoom. org is an online experimental e-participation platform, designed and operated by Cornell e-rulemaking Initiative (CeRI), the cross-disciplinary CeRI. Using the Regulation Roomas a case study, this paper addresseswhat capacities are required for effective civic engagement and how they can be nurtured and supported by an online participation system. Findings – The research suggests that effectively designing and deploying technology, although essential, is only one dimension of realizing broader, better online civic engagement. Effective e-participation systems must be prepared to address procedural, social, and psychological barriers that impede citizens’ meaningful participation in complex policymaking processes. The research also suggests the need for re-conceptualizing the value of <b>broad</b> <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> to the policymaking processes and for recognizing that novice commenters engage with policy issues differently than experienced insiders. Practical implications – The paper includes a series of strategic recommendations for policymaking seeking public input. While it indicates that a broader range of citizens can indeed be meaningfully engaged, it also cautions that getting better participation from more people requires the investment of resources. More fundamental, both government decision makers and participation designers must be open to recognizing non-traditional forms of knowledge and styles of communication – and willing to devise participation mechanisms and protocols accordingly. Originality/value – This paper describes lessons from a unique design-based research project with both practical and conceptual implications for more, better civic participation in complex government policymaking...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} how common contexts for extracurricular activities, friendships, and technology mediated interactions form social structures {{that are related to}} distinct civic experiences of high school youth from diverse social types. A key role of education is to prepare individuals to participate in civil society. Extracurricular and civic experiences during high school contribute to such preparation because they are associated to <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> in adulthood. Yet, participation opportunities for students are unequal. Research suggests that adolescents of diverse social types (i. e., categorical labels based on behavior stereotypes that students place on each other, like "Jocks" or "Gamers") are predisposed to different activities. Extracurricular participation is further constrained by concerns for social validation (e. g., underperforming to not be labeled "Nerd"). Today, such social processes are increasingly mediated by communication technologies and social media. Despite the importance of social types, extracurricular activities or school clubs, friendships, and technologies in adolescents' social development, little is known about their synergistic influences, the social structures they create, and how such structures affect civic experiences. In this dissertation, I compare such phenomena across two high schools. Based on 315 surveys, 26 interviews and observations collected over 10 months, I found that there are potentially optimal social structures for adolescents' development of civic experiences; that the existence of multiple domain-specific school clubs, particularly in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) and community service, was critical to the distinct social structures observed in each school; and that when the social structures were based on mediated interactions via different technologies (e. g., texting, instant messaging), specific affordances were revealed, about technologies and activity contexts, that helped make sense of how sub-communities select a communication technology to maintain needed group boundaries while use others to remain connected to their broader community. Using established methods in social network analysis, I examine the common contexts shared by social types. Adopting an information perspective, I describe how social information, such as values and norms, is channeled across social types via their common contexts of shared friendships or school clubs. I also assess the potential for such channels to bridge social divisions. Observed social structures corroborated students' perceptions of social divisions, and the desire (or lack thereof) by social types from each school to participate in civic activities. I conclude first, with implications for schools to plan for <b>broader</b> <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> according to the observed social structures. Then, I address the need for researchers to use social interaction data from more than one technology medium to make conclusions about social structure. Finally, I discuss design opportunities and challenges for supporting sub-communities' needs to reify their group boundaries through a preferred technology while maintaining some connection to other groups. These implications for schools, research methods, and technology design, speak to the major concerns in information science: on the development of STEM and civics as part of life-long learning, on assessing research methods to study the vast availability of online data, and on novel design directions...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> {{and its role in}} an emerging democracy context, and examines the forms, patterns, trends, obstacles to and opportunities for <b>civic</b> <b>participation,</b> as well as the impact of <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> on democratization and development processes in Armenia, a post-soviet country in the South Caucasus, that has embarked on simultaneous transition toward democracy and free market economy since its independence in 1991. The dissertation suggests that <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> is a key ingredient for successful transformations and effective reforms in both political and economic sectors in the post-soviet context of Armenia, and, therefore, more attention, as well as more vigorous efforts and resources should be directed to building civic capacity of the people and organizations in this setting. It is argued, that while, obviously, not a panacea for all development and democratization related challenges, civic engagement has a strong potential to foster those processes and contribute to the achievement of more effective, inclusive and sustainable solutions in the areas of democracy promotion and development in the transition countries. The original contribution of the thesis is an empirical study of <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> in Armenia and assessment of its determinants and the impact on democracy and development related outcomes in the country. The primary research includes a study of <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> in 10 rural and small urban communities across the country, and provides comprehensive information and insights into <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> forms, pattern, determinants, obstacles and opportunities at the community level. <b>Civic</b> <b>participation</b> is further studied by examining the major civic initiatives and campaigns {{that took place in the}} country over the recent five years (2010 - 2015) and assessment of their outcomes and impact. The study looks closely at the determinants of <b>civic</b> <b>participation,</b> both the individual level factors and the obstacles and opportunities provided by the institutional context, and, in particular, examines the relationship of <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> with social capital, civic education, and use of internet and communication technology (ICT). <b>Civic</b> <b>participation</b> habits and trends among the youth are explored by means of surveys conducted in 2013 and 2014. An innovative measure – a <b>Civic</b> <b>Participation</b> Score (CP Score) is introduced and computed, based on a pre-defined and operationalized set of indicators, and a <b>Civic</b> <b>Participation</b> Index (CP Index) is calculated for monitoring the changes, in separate indicator categories and overall, and analysing <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> trends over time. The research sheds light on <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> practice and trends in Armenia and builds a framework for analysis of civic engagement in an emerging democracy context, by identifying the participants, their motives, forms of civic engagement, its impact, as well as challenges and opportunities for participation. The study highlights the specific needs and opportunities for further civic capacity building and lays down a roadmap for further research and action in this direction. ...|$|R

This research examined general school administrative practices that could be construed as being supportive of the development of a school community and citizenship behaviours, and also teacher engagement with their students in terms of explicit Civics and Citizenship curriculum and activities. The research was predicated on the view that both of these strands of educational work have potential for inducting students into citizenship dispositions and civic behaviours, and also the norms and practices, rights and responsibilities of democratic citizenship. The research also examined the young people’s experience of Web 2. 0 and other social media platforms (Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and shared content sites (such as flickr, blogs, discussion forums) and sought their views and understandings of the potential of these processes for <b>broader</b> <b>civic</b> engagement...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{an insight into}} how {{emigration}} countries influence immigrants in their host society. Our main objective is to explore the following questions: first, whether and how emigration countries can influence the <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> of immigrants in immigration countries and second, whether transnational links, in particular political transnational activities, {{have an impact on}} <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> in receiving countries. <b>Civic</b> <b>participation</b> is approached as a form of political participation outside of traditional political institutions. As an active and collective dimension of engagement in society, one form of <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> consists in being active in organizations. This paper addresses three forms of involvement: in local politics (mainstream organizations focused on mainstream issues), immigrant and homeland politics (migrant organizations focused on ethnic or country of origin issues) and finally a combination of mainstream and other issues with bi-national associations. The paper also raises the issue of maintaining links with the country of origin and simultaneously integrating into the immigration country. It questions, in particularly, the impact of transnational civic engagement on <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> in destination countries. Several case studies are presented and, in the case of Mexico/U. S., some show that the Mexican migrant experience in hometown associations help maintain civic ties with Mexico and positively affect <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> with U. S. issues. Other cases indicate that <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> can, indeed, be influenced by transnational links, but also that it relies on the institutional context of the receiving country: for example questions such as access to citizenship). Possible conflicts of interests with countries of origin and countries of destination are also raised in relation to the <b>civic</b> <b>participation</b> of emigrants here and there.
