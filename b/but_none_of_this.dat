25|$|The {{movement}} to include girls as full {{members of the}} BSA was put into the public spotlight most notably by Sydney Ireland. Ireland, age 16 in 2017, had unofficially been participating in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts with her brother for twelve years, completing merit badges and the Arrow of Light, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was officially recognized {{because she is a}} girl. Ireland and her family started a Change.org petition to the BSA leadership calling for equal membership. Ireland's petition gained media attention and utilized an email campaign for supporters to contact BSA leadership. It was supported by Scouts for Equality and endorsed by the National Organization for Women. The BSA leadership was receptive and unanimously approved new programs allowing girls and young women into Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.|$|E
25|$|Nicolas Fatio {{presented}} the first formulation {{of his thoughts}} on gravitation {{in a letter to}} Christiaan Huygens in the spring of 1690. Two days later Fatio read the content of the letter before the Royal Society in London. In the following years Fatio composed several draft manuscripts of his major work De la Cause de la Pesanteur, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> material was published in his lifetime. In 1731 Fatio also sent his theory as a Latin poem, in the style of Lucretius, to the Paris Academy of Science, but it was dismissed. Some fragments of these manuscripts and copies of the poem were later acquired by Le Sage who failed to find a publisher for Fatio's papers. So it lasted until 1929, when the only complete copy of Fatio's manuscript was published by Karl Bopp, and in 1949 Gagnebin used the collected fragments in possession of Le Sage to reconstruct the paper. The Gagnebin edition includes revisions made by Fatio as late as 1743, forty years after he composed the draft on which the Bopp edition was based. However, {{the second half of the}} Bopp edition contains the mathematically most advanced parts of Fatio's theory, and were not included by Gagnebin in his edition. For a detailed analysis of Fatio's work, and a comparison between the Bopp and the Gagnebin editions, see Zehe The following description is mainly based on the Bopp edition.|$|E

2500|$|... c. [...] Diogenes Laertius {{mentions}} that Plato [...] "was born, {{according to some}} writers, in Aegina {{in the house of}} Phidiades the son of Thales". Diogenes mentions as one of his sources the Universal History of Favorinus. According to Favorinus, Ariston, Plato's family, and his family were sent by Athens to settle as cleruchs (colonists retaining their Athenian citizenship), on the island of Aegina, from which they were expelled by the Spartans after Plato's birth there. Nails points out, however, that there is no record of any Spartan expulsion of Athenians from Aegina between 431–411 BC. On the other hand, at the Peace of Nicias, Aegina was silently left under Athens' control, and {{it was not until the}} summer of 411 that the Spartans overran the island.• Thucydides, [...] Therefore, Nails concludes that [...] "perhaps Ariston was a cleruch, perhaps he went to Aegina in 431, and perhaps Plato was born on Aegina, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> enables a precise dating of Ariston's death (or Plato's birth).

30|$|Laparoscopy {{has become}} the gold {{standard}} for the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy. The problem with salpingostomy is persistent trophoblastic tissue, the incidence of which has been reported to be between 3 % and 20 % [3]. It is recommended that women should be followed up with serial hCG to prevent morbidity from this complication. There are no such reports following salpingectomy and thus no such recommendations. There are reports in literature of recurrent EP in the ipsilateral fallopian tube following salpingectomy or partial salpingectomy [4, 5] <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> PEP. <b>This</b> may be because such negative complications are not publicised, but herein we believe lies a valuable lesson. In our case, at the first presentation, a right “salpingectomy” was performed using endoloops. However, this resulted in a PEP in the tubal stump.|$|R
2500|$|In 1974 Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane {{reclaimed}} his {{ancestral home}} and moved {{with his new}} wife back into Brympton d'Evercy {{with the intention of}} restoring it and opening it to the public as a stately home. His problem was that, while the empty and neglected house may have been his home, it was far from stately. While the house was structurally in a fair condition, it had not been redecorated since the 18th century and had endured the obvious ravages caused by its use as a boys' school. The redecoration of the state rooms was executed on a very restricted budget. The principal problem facing the owners was furnishing the house. Few of its former contents remained, and while Brympton d'Evercy is not on a par with Blenheim Palace in size, it still required large items and quantities of high quality antique furniture. This was the stumbling block to the stately home scheme. The Clive-Ponsonby-Fanes made great efforts to draw in the crowds, an agricultural museum, a vineyard, a distillery of apple brandy, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was interesting enough to attract visitors from as far afield as London, let alone those from across the Atlantic. Ultimately, as a financial enterprise, opening to the public failed. In 1992 after almost 300 years of ownership the family sold Brympton d'Evercy. The situation was summed up at the time by the satirist Auberon Waugh: [...] "Last week we learnt that the most beautiful house in Somerset has been sold.....it is sad of course for the family who owned it who had made a valiant effort to keep it going [...].it did not succeed as a showpiece: they had run out of money, the internal decorations were dreadful, and they lacked the proper kit {{to make it look like}} anything more than a prep school on open day. So now the most beautiful house in England will be a private family home once again..".|$|E

A. monochrus is an amphibious species and remains almost {{exclusively}} above the water line, migrating vertically with the tide while feeding on a thin algal layer scraped from the moist substratum. Spawning activity peaks were observed at Pointe aux Caves, Mauritius, during the full moon periods of October and November and two corresponding oocyte size cohorts were identified in excised ovaries collected over the breeding season. Larvae hatched in approximately four days and otolith ring counts showed that settlement occurred 28 days later. Initial post-settlement growth was rapid but growth rate in length declined linearly beyond 50 mm. Length frequency time series showed that the 1991 cohort reproduced at age one, <b>but</b> that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cohort survived into the 1993 breeding season, consistent with annual semelparity.
