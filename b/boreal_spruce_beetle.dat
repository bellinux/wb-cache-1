40|$|The great European spruce {{bark beetle}} (Dendroctonus micans, Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and the <b>boreal</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (D. punctatus) are two phylogenetically and ecologically close bark beetles. They bore {{galleries}} into the bark of spruce in Europe and Asia (D. micans) and North America (D. punctatus). We analyze the mechanisms of coevolution between these species and their specific predators: D. micans-Rhizophagus grandis (Coleoptera: Monotomidae) and D. punctatus-Hapalaraea longula (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae). David Pimentel(2) suggested that a prey could evolve resistance against a longstanding associated predator. To test this hypothesis we compare the reproductive success of each predator on both prey and on the red turpentine beetle (D. valens) which is an ecologically close bark beetle outside the geographical range of the predators. R. grandis females fit their oviposition to prey availability probably relying on kairomones. It is likely (but not established) that H. longula developed a similar process. I proceed to chemical analyses (GC-MS using headspace extraction) to identify oviposition stimuli and inhibitors of each predator. Possible differences between prey {{may be linked to}} coevolution with the predator. Bioassays will be able to confirm the role of these molecules. Microorganisms could influence the survival and success of bark beetles, and perhaps also the chemical cues involved in oviposition of the predators. To emphasize their role I consider characterizing the microflora of each bark beetle and using antibiotics. D. micans adults have a reproductive diapause which has never been removed in laboratory. To get full life cycle rearing we use thermoperiods in conditioned rooms to simulate winter. (2) -Hokkanen H. & Pimentel D. (1984) New approach for selecting biological control agents.

In Colorado, <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak {{is one of the}} most important disturbances. Future warming is expected to promote outbreak through direct effects on beetle population dynamics. However, little is known about if or how climate change will affect the host, Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The central goal of this research was to determine the susceptibility of Engelmann <b>spruce</b> to <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> in the context of climate variability in northwestern Colorado. To gain insight into the effects of climate on <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak, I examined a 350 - year tree-ring record of outbreak. I found <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreaks were initiated by drought, which affects both beetle population dynamics and tree resistance to infestation. To understand if recent warming had affected the susceptibility of spruce, I compared historical (1940 s) and current (2001 - 2011) tree- and stand-scale constraints on outbreak. I found that stand-level constraints appear to be less restrictive of the current outbreak, likely due to drought-driven declines in host resistance. To determine how climate and forest structure interact to influence <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak, I examined landscape-level outbreak. Outbreak was constrained by forest structure, which reflects past disturbance. In particular, previous outbreak created a landscape template characterized by depleted susceptible hosts, which was less susceptible to subsequent outbreak. A better understanding of the landscape-scale patterns of outbreak requires better scientific monitoring of <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles.</b> This need motivated the development of remote sensing methods for <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak. This dissertation has revealed important insight into how climate variability alters the susceptibility of <b>spruce</b> to <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak. Notably, this dissertation highlights the importance of drought in decreasing host resistance to <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation. Future changes in climate will likely promote outbreak through direct effects on host resistance and <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> population dynamics, however how disturbances interact to affect the forest structure and composition will likely be equally or more important in determining future outbreak...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{a native}} species in Colorado’s spruce forest ecosystem. Endemic populations are always present, and {{epidemics}} are {{a natural part of}} the changing forest. There usually are long intervals between such events as insect and disease epidemics and wildfires, giving spruce forests time to regenerate. Prior to their occurrence, the potential impacts of these natural disturbances can be reduced through proactive forest management. The <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) is {{responsible for the death of}} more spruce trees in North America than any other natural agent. <b>Spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> populations range from Alaska and Newfoundland to as far south as Arizona and New Mexico. The subalpine Engelmann spruce is the primary host tree, but the beetles will infest any spruce tree species within their geographical range, including blue spruce. In Colorado, the beetles are most commonly observed in high-elevation spruce forests above 9, 000 feet. At endemic or low population levels, <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> generally infest only downed trees. However, as <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> population levels in downed trees increase, usually following an avalanche or windthrow event – a high-wind event that topples trees over a large area – the beetles also will infest live standing trees. <b>Spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> prefer large (16 inches in diameter or greater), mature and over-mature spruce trees in slow-growing, spruce-dominated stands. However, at epidemic levels, or when large-scale, rapid population increases occur, <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> may attack trees as small as 3 inches in diameter. Attacks also have been observed in krummholz – trees near timberline that exhibit stunted growth due to harsh conditions.

40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> {{outbreaks}} are {{the primary}} biotic disturbance affecting forests in the Intermountain spruce-fir zone. Major snow avalanches can produce large quantities of host material for <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> colonization; however, {{few studies have examined}} the influence of avalanche disturbance on outbreak initiation. The purpose of my research was to investigate potential relationships between these two disturbance agents. In the first study, I used dendro-ecological analyses to date major avalanche years on the Wasatch Plateau in south-central Utah, and then determined what climate factors were associated with avalanche occurrence. The results indicated that mean January snowfall was significantly related to the probability of major avalanche years, although model correlations were extremely low. Potential dating errors, the lack of complete historical climate data, and the absence of snow pack information may have prohibited obtaining high model correlations. In the second study, Investigated how the seasonal availability of host material influenced <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> brood production. I found that significantly fewer mean numbers of <b>spruce</b> <b>beetles</b> were produced in downed spruce felled during August 1997 than from trees felled in April of 1998. More brood adults also were present in, or emerged from the bottom surfaces of sample trees than either unexposed (North, East) or exposed (South, West) bole aspects. These results provided evidence that with greater potential for <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> populations to build in host material produced in the host material produced in the spring, snow avalanche disturbance could contribute to the risk of outbreaks.

Three silvicultural treatments, single tree selection, group selection, and shelterwood with reserves, were established in a spruce-fir forest in northern Utah with the goals of increasing both resistance and resilience to outbreaks.

A previously undescribed behaviour was observed, in which <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> adults exuded oral secretions, especially within fungus-pervaded galleries. 4.

Oral secretions cultured on microbiological media yielded substantial bacterial growth. 6. Filter-sterilised secretions failed to inhibit fungal growth, evidence that the bacteria are responsible for the antifungal activity. 7.

Here, we evaluated 1) how climate and forest habitat variables, including disturbance history, interact to drive 2000 s <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) infestation of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) across the Southern Rocky Mountains; and 2) how previous <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation affects subsequent infestation across the Flat Tops Wilderness in north- western Colorado, which experienced a severe landscape-scale <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation in the 1940 s.

Of the seven dVIs tested, the change in Normalized Difference Moisture Index (dNDMI) was most strongly correlated with field measurements of beetle-killed basal area (R 2 = 0. 66). dNDMI was included as an explanatory variable in sequential autoregressive (SAR) models of NDVI 2015.

50|$|The most {{important}} bark beetle {{species in the}} Kawuneeche Valley are mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis).

40|$|Infrequent {{large-scale}} {{natural disturbance}} regimes {{are an integral}} component of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) forests of the central Rocky Mountains. Wildfires, bark beetle outbreaks, winds, and avalanches cause relatively drastic changes in community structure, composition, and function. These disturbances may occur independently or interact where the incidence of one may change the potential for another. We assessed potential wildfire behaviour change {{in the wake of}} a catastrophic, landscape-wide <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak in southern Utah, USA. Using data collected in spruce forests affected by the outbreak, the Forest Vegetation Simulator and Fire and Fuels Extension were used to simulate long-term (100 y) stand dynamics and potential fire behaviour under 3 reconstructed scenarios: no <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak (low-severity), 50 % spruce beetle-caused mortality (mid-severity), and 95 % spruce beetle-caused mortality (high-severity). Simulations suggested a likely reduction in probability of active crown fire for 1 or 2 decades on near-pure Engelmann spruce sites after high-severity mortality. This counterintuitive result suggested extreme fire behaviour is not an inevitable consequence of <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreaks. No change in potential fire behaviour was predicted in stands with the least reduction in spruce basal area (low- or mid-severity). In one stand with a history of surface fire, stand structure and potential fire behaviour from low- and high-severity simulations were influenced by surface fire 100 y ago. These results are indicative of complex disturbance interactions that were influenced by the host-specific <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle,</b> resultant stand structures and fuel profiles, and in one case antecedent disturbance...|$|R
40|$|Extensive Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) {{mortality}} {{caused by}} the <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) has been occurring {{at the southern end}} of the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah. This <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak is the largest recorded in Utah history. An extensive ground survey was conducted in 1996 on the Manti-LaSal National Forest, Sanpete and Ferron Ranger Districts, to document mortality and impact of a major <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreak on post-outbreak forest composition. In 1998 the same sites were resurveyed. Survey results indicate Engelmann spruce basal area (BA) loss averaged 78 % in trees ≥ 5 inches diameter breast height (DBH) in 1996. Ninety percent of BA ≥ 5 inches DBH was lost within the same sites by 1998. Tree mortality of spruce ≥ 5 inches DBH expressed in trees per acre (TPA) averaged 53 % in 1996. In 1998 TPA ≥ 5 inches DBH mortality averaged 73 %. Before the outbreak live Engelmann spruce BA ≥ 5 inches DBH averaged 99 square feet, and TPA ≥ 5 inches DBH averaged 97. In the sites surveyed in 1996 and resurveyed in 1998, Engelmann spruce BA ≥ 5 inches DBH averaged 21 and 9 square feet, and TPA ≥ 5 inches DBH averaged 43 and 25, respectively. Overstory tree species composition changed from stands dominated by spruce to subalpine fir. Stand ratings for potential <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreaks were high to mostly medium hazard pre-outbreak and medium to primarily low hazard by 1998, as a result of reduction in average spruce diameter, total basal area, and overstory spruce...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{large and}} severe {{outbreaks}} of native bark beetles has raised concern {{among the general}} public and land managers about potential risks of amplified fire activity in western North America. However, there are no field studies {{of the effects of the}} severity of <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) infestation on subsequent fire severity in subalpine Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forests. We collected extensive field data in subalpine forests in the eastern San Juan Mountains, southwestern Colorado, to investigate whether fire severity changed across a range of severity of early, gray-stage <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> infestations. Using correlation and multivariate generalized linear regression analyses, we found that pre-fire <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> severity was not correlated with or a significant predictor of most field measurements of fire severity or a remotely sensed estimate of fire severity under moderate and extreme burning conditions. However, under moderate burning conditions only, the number of fire-killed stems and fire-killed basal area were weakly but positively correlated with the severity of beetle infestation. In comparison to severity of the pre-fire beetle outbreak, we found that topography, live and dead basal area at time of fire, and short-term weather conditions exerted a stronger effect on fire severity. This suggests the beetle outbreak and fire were either independent of one another or factors unrelated to beetle outbreak overrode any effects of the outbreak on fire activity. This finding of no effect agrees with retrospective studies using remotely sensed products to examine fire activity following other <b>spruce</b> <b>beetle</b> outbreaks, which similar to this study, concluded that the overriding influence of climate is essential for creating conditions conducive to large, high-severity fires in the subalpine zone of Colorado...|$|R
