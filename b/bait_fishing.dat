25|$|In fly fishing, {{fish are}} caught by using {{artificial}} flies that are cast with a fly rod and a fly line. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy {{enough to send}} the fly to the target. The main difference between fly fishing and spin or <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> is that in fly fishing {{the weight of the}} line carries the hook through the air, whereas in spin and <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> the weight of the lure or sinker {{at the end of the}} monofilament or braided line gives casting distance. Artificial flies are of several types; some imitating an insect (either flying or swimming), others a bait fish or crustacean, others attractors are known to attract fish although they look like nothing in nature. Flies can be made either to float or sink, and range in size from a few millimeters to 30cm long; most are between 1 and 5cm.|$|E
25|$|Tailor {{is one of}} {{the more}} common species sought by anglers on Fraser Island and along the Queensland coast. Other fish caught on the eastern coast include jewfish, golden {{trevally}} and surf bream, while whiting, flathead and surf bream prefer the calmer western waters. Pilchards, bloodworms, yabbies, pipi and sandworms can all be used for <b>bait.</b> <b>Fishing</b> is banned in the island's creeks and lakes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> are {{consumed}} by larger, aquatic predators. Swimming in ocean water with <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> can be dangerous, as these <b>fish</b> attract sharks. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> will sometimes use whale sharks {{as a shield}} from their other predators such as tuna, as tuna are usually wary of approaching the sharks. The shark cannot attack the <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> easily, as they constantly swim above them and are too fast for the shark to manoeuvre its mouth into position. However, the sharks eventually dive deep, where the <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> cannot follow, and as the other predators finally dare attack the stranded <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> the shark comes back to eat numerous <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> who are already preoccupied with the attacking tuna.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} rock <b>fishing</b> is using <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b> The <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> may be bought from a store, or the angler can catch them himself. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> {{can be used}} either whole or cut up into pieces. The size and type of <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> used will vary {{depending}} what species is being targeted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> can be {{contrasted with}} forage <b>fish.</b> <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> {{is a term}} used {{particularly}} by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch <b>fish</b> to <b>bait</b> longlines and traps. Forage fish is a fisheries term, and is used in that context. Forage fish are small fish that are preyed on in the wild by larger predators for food. The predators can be other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish,</b> by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as <b>bait</b> for other <b>fish.</b> The terms also overlap {{in the sense that}} most <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> are also forage fish, and most forage fish can also be used as <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 1880, the Salmon Creek {{was named}} by Richard Harris and Joe Juneau (during their {{first visit to}} the area for gold prospecting). The local people called it Tilhini meaning [...] "dog salmon" [...] a native name used by Tingit Alaskan Indian; this name is also shown in some early {{topographic}} maps. In 1917, fish propagation was established in Salmon Creek Reservoir by introducing 50,000 fry lings (small and young recently hatched fish) in the reservoir with assistance from Alaska Fish and Game Club, which maintained a hatchery at Juneau. This helped in propagating fish reserves of Salmon in the reservoir. It is reported that by the time the lake was opened for fishing, the fish measured [...] and could be caught with a fly of [...] Salmon Creek Reservoir is now open for <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> all the year round. Salmon fish varieties are many. Some fish species identified are: Dolly Varden, Brook Trout, Freshwater Trout, Salmon family, Chum Salmon and Coho Salmon.|$|E

50|$|A jerkbait {{resembles a}} small <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> (example: shad); usually hard-bodied, {{sometimes}} soft plastic, usually with two (or sometimes three) treble hooks. The fisherman imparts a stop-and-go, twitching-type motion to the lure to resemble an injured or dying <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> {{are small}} fish caught {{for use as}} bait to attract large predatory fish, {{particularly}} game fish. Species used are typically those that are common and breed rapidly, making them easy to catch and in regular supply. Examples of marine <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> are anchovies, gudgeon, halfbeaks such as ballyhoo, and scad. Some larger fish such as menhaden, flying fish, or ladyfish may be considered <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> in some circles, {{depending on the size}} of the gamefish being pursued.Freshwater <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> include any fish of the minnow or carp family (Cyprinidae), sucker family (Catostomidae), top minnows or killifish family (Cyprinodontidae), shad family (Clupeidae), sculpin of the order Osteichthyes and sunfish family (Centrarchidae), excluding black basses and crappies.|$|R

25|$|Forage {{fish are}} {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> or feeder <b>fish.</b> <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> is a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch <b>fish</b> to <b>bait</b> longlines and traps. Forage fish is a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish,</b> by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as <b>bait</b> for other <b>fish.</b> The terms overlap in the sense that most <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> are also forage fish, and vice versa. Feeder fish is a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small fish that are eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> {{are often}} {{short-lived}} and proliferate spawners. This means their populations can fluctuate rapidly, {{and they can}} often recover quickly when depleted. Regulations may exist to prevent overexploitation, as in Arkansas and Massachusetts.

50|$|One study {{looking at}} brook trout found that {{barbless}} hooks {{did not result}} in statistically significantly lower mortality rates than barbed hooks when fish were hooked in the mouth, but did elevate mortalities if fish were hooked deeper. The study also suggested <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> does not have a significantly higher mortality when utilized in an active style, rather than a passive manner that allows the fish to swallow the bait.|$|E
50|$|The boats cruise {{along the}} edge of the {{continental}} shelf where billfish can be found down to 200 metres (600 ft), sometimes near weed lines at the surface and submarine canyons and ridges deeper down. Commercial fishermen usually use drift nets or longlines to catch billfish, but recreational fishermen usually drift with <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> or troll a bait or lure. Billfish are caught deeper down the water column by drifting with live <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> such as ballyhoo, striped mullet or bonito. Alternatively, they can be caught by trolling at the surface with dead bait or trolling lures designed to imitate <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|R
25|$|The capture, {{transportation}} {{and culture of}} <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> can spread damaging organisms between ecosystems, endangering them. In 2007, several American states, enacted regulations designed to slow the spread of fish diseases, including viral hemorrhagic septicemia, by <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b> Because {{of the risk of}} transmitting Myxobolus cerebralis (whirling disease), trout and salmon should not be used as bait.|$|R
40|$|Tuna fishing by {{pole and}} line around Minicoy in the Indian Ocean is {{carried out by the}} islanders,with <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> {{collected}} from the lagoon (Jones 1958). The tuna caught is mostly the oceanic skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis and occasionally the yellow fin, Neothunnus macropterus (Jones and Kumaran 1959). During the fishing season the availability of adequate supplies of <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> is the most important deciding factor in the successful operation of the fishery. The non-availability of <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> as it sometimes happens restricts fishing activity to a minimum as the fishermen have to devote much time on bait collection even if tuna shoals occur in abundance in close proximity into the island...|$|R
50|$|Gameplay, {{like other}} {{games in the}} fishing {{simulator}} genre consists of casting a line from a fishing pole to reel in fish. In the game, the player casts the line and reels in fish with the touch screen. Whether or not a player can catch a fish usually depends on timing and {{the placement of the}} tackle. The game includes multiple fishing techniques, including <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> as well as fly fishing. The game also includes 15 stages, 40 fish, and over 100 pieces of tackle. Players can also keep caught fish in a fish tank for display.|$|E
5000|$|Recreation Areas, {{marked in}} water by buoys {{indicating}} RECREATION ZONE, provide areas for line fishing (from {{the beach to}} 100 ft from shore), and personal watercraft use; Marine Park permits may also be issued for <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> and catch and release guide fishing in this area. On the north shore, the shoreline fishing area extends from Green Cay to Cottongarden Point, and on the South Shore from Grapetree Point to Milord Point. In addition, the areas of Teague Bay to Cramer's Park on the north shore, and in Turner Hole on the south shore are Recreation Areas, which extend to 300 ft beyond the reef.|$|E
50|$|The McCloud is {{generally}} {{divided into two}} sections. The Upper McCloud {{is considered to be}} above McCloud Reservoir, and the Lower McCloud stretches from the reservoir to Lake Shasta. The waterfalls mentioned above are all found on the Upper McCloud. The Upper McCloud is a popular destination for kayakers. There is an improved campground called Fowlers on the Upper McCloud. The Upper McCloud above Upper Falls is rarely stocked, and locating the fish often proves to be a challenge to most avid anglers, while the section from Lower Falls to Upper Falls is stocked and is open to <b>bait</b> <b>fishing.</b> The Lower McCloud {{is generally}} a fly/artificial lure fishery and catch and release fishing is greatly encouraged.|$|E

5000|$|Crane Prairie Reservoir, {{the first}} major lake/reservoir the Deschutes flows into, offers {{some of the best}} rainbow trout fishing in Oregon, with a large number of rainbows in the 4-10 pound range and some {{reaching}} 20 pounds. These trout are renowned for their size and are given the nickname [...] "cranebows". Other fish found in Crane Prairie are brook trout, kokanee salmon, largemouth bass, black crappie, tui chub, three-spined stickleback, and whitefish. [...] Fly, lure, and <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> are popular methods, with the majority of trout fisherman casting or trolling in the channels. For the best chance of catching large fish, a boat or other flotation device is recommended as the channels can be wide and deep.|$|E
