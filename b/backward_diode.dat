It is possible to get a sharp, high conductance on/off transition by exploiting the sharp step in the density of states at band edges. The nature of the density of states, {{is strongly dependent on}} quantum dimensionality. To know the current/voltage curve requires us to specify both the n-side dimensionality and the p-side dimensionality of pn junctions. We find that a typical bulk 3 d- 3 d tunneling pn junction has only a quadratic turn-on function, while a pn junction consisting of two overlapping quantum wells (2 d- 2 d) would have the preferred step function response.

In this thesis, I discuss some of the most fundamental nanoscale electronic/optoelectronic elements, including p-n, Schottky and tunneling junctions based on carbon nanotubes and graphene. By characterizing these nanoscale junctions using electrical and optical spectroscopic techniques, unconventional device operation principles were unveiled. More importantly, these fundamental understandings combined with the novel design of the device structures provided us with the ability to tailor material properties and engineer novel carbon-based optoelectronics. First, we demonstrate a tunable diode based on a fully suspended single-walled carbon nanotube structure. The turn-on voltage of the diode under forward bias can be continuously and widely tuned by controlling gate voltages. Additionally, the same device design could be configured into a <b>backward</b> <b>diode</b> by tuning the band-to-band tunneling current in the reverse bias region. A nanotube <b>backward</b> <b>diode</b> is demonstrated {{for the first time with}} nonlinearity exceeding the ideal diode. These suggest that a tunable nanotube diode could be a unique building block for developing next generation programmable circuits. Second, we present spatio-temporal photocurrent measurements of graphene p-n and graphene-metal junctions. The results explicitly confirm that the hot carrier photoresponse of graphene is related to its doping level, mobility and optical excitation power. Furthermore, our photocurrent measurements reveal the formation of an ultrafast photo-Dember process in graphene.

Other technologies such as MOSFET bridge or active diode are designed to minimize the voltage drop to reduce the conduction loss. However, these designs require either additional power supplies to operate comparators or have a larger threshold turn-on voltage than Schottky.

Here ideality factor n increased and the barrier height <Db decreased with temperature. This was seen to be a consequence of TFE through the metal/GaAs barrier. This was borne out by the Richardson's plots [In (Is/T 2) versus 103 /nT] which exhibited straight lines. The slope indicated the barrier heights, which ranged between 1. 1 - 1. 4 e V.

It was found that I-V-T data could be interpreted {{on the basis of a}} back to back diode model. The c-GaAs:Mn made a Schottky contact with the metal and a p n junction with c-GaAs:Si. It was found that for the forward bias, where metal was biased negative with respect to the GaAs:Mn, the 1 - v -T data could also be analysed on the basis of a Schottky behaviour. Here ideality factor n increased and the barrier height Φb decreased with temperature. This was seen to be a consequence of TFE through the metal/GaAs barrier. This was borne out by the Richardson's plots [ln (ls/T 2) versus 103 /nT] which exhibited straight lines. The slope indicated the barrier heights, which ranged between 1. 1 - 1. 4 eV. The <b>backward</b> <b>diode</b> on the other hand gave a barrier height of 1. 4 eV, which was compatible with the proposed model. C-V-T measurements could also be accounted for, at least qualitatively, on the basis of the proposed back to back diode model. The device structure of c-GaMnN was planar. Both the Ohmic and Schottky contact were in the same plane on the top surface. I-V measurements were performed over the temperature range 100 - 480 K. I-V-T was explained in the terms of the Schottky model. The current was limited, however, by the Poole-Frenkel type centres in the bulk which behaved as an insulator (high resistivity semiconductor). The C-V–T was satisfactorily accounted for on the basis of MIS/MOS model. Low temperature grown films had poor material quality which made any correlation between samples difficult...|$|E
