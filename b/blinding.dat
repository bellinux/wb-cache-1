5|$|Born in 1131, Ladislaus was {{the second}} son of King Béla the Blind and his wife, Helena of Rascia. A few months after his birth, his mother took him and his elder brother, Géza, to an {{assembly}} held at Arad where the barons who were considered responsible for the <b>blinding</b> of the King were massacred upon the Queen's order.|$|E
5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, <b>blinding</b> the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
5|$|Baxter's brigade {{was worn}} {{down and out}} of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, <b>blinding</b> him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before {{the end of the}} day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Emeric, who {{received}} {{the name of his}} maternal uncle, Emperor Henry II, was born around 1007. His Legend from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his chastity even during his marriage. According to Györffy, Emeric's wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. His premature death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul's <b>blinding</b> and civil wars.|$|E
5|$|Susanna's (Priyanka Chopra) first husband—Edwin Rodriques (Neil Nitin Mukesh), an army major—is overbearing, jealous and possessive. Disabled, he cannot {{believe that}} a {{beautiful}} woman like Susanna would be faithful to him. Uncertain of his sexual potency, he takes out his anger on his wife. Although Susanna endures his mental cruelty, she cannot forgive Edwin for <b>blinding</b> her faithful, mute stableboy (Shashi Malviya) with a whip. Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip {{with the help of}} Susanna's faithful maid (Usha Uthup), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy.|$|E
5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was contested {{between the}} reigning champions Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode), who were {{accompanied}} by Jacqueline, and The Motor City Machineguns of Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin. After several tag team maneuvers from both teams, Storm spat beer in Sabin's face, <b>blinding</b> him. This allowed Beer Money to lift up and slam Sabin back-first to the mat with their Drinking While Investing (DWI) tag team maneuver to gain the pinfall and retain the championship at 17 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{varieties}} of window <b>blinds</b> include mini <b>blinds</b> (Venetian <b>blinds</b> with very narrow slats, usually 1 inch (25 mm) wide), micro <b>blinds</b> (usually [...] inch (12 mm) wide), louvers, jalousies, brise soleil, Holland <b>blinds,</b> pleated <b>blinds,</b> and roller shades.|$|R
50|$|The term window <b>blinds</b> {{can also}} be used to {{describe}} window coverings generically—in this context window <b>blinds</b> include almost every type of window covering, i.e. shutters, roller <b>blinds,</b> cellular shades (also called honeycomb shades), wood <b>blinds,</b> roman <b>blinds</b> and of course, standard vertical and horizontal <b>blinds.</b> In the United Kingdom, awnings are sometimes called <b>blinds</b> or shades.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} common options {{for dealing with}} {{a player in the}} <b>blinds</b> who must also pay the kill <b>blind.</b> First, they may pay only the kill <b>blind</b> and their {{scheduled}} <b>blind</b> is not posted. Second, the player may be required to post both their scheduled <b>blind</b> and the kill <b>blind</b> for that hand, with only the kill <b>blind</b> being [...] "live" [...] for determining that player's bet amount (this method adds an extra element of risk to the player [...] "under the gun"). Lastly, the player may post their kill <b>blind</b> in this hand, and then [...] "owe" [...] their scheduled <b>blind</b> in the next hand when they no longer have to post the kill <b>blind,</b> similar to the moving button rule of <b>blinds</b> busting out. This can cause a shifting of all <b>blinds</b> to a player who triggered a kill while [...] "under the gun"; the player would first post the kill <b>blind</b> when the big <b>blind</b> was due, then in the next hand (assuming they didn't have to pay the kill <b>blind</b> again) they would pay their big <b>blind</b> instead of the small <b>blind</b> that is now due. On the third hand, with the player on the button, the small <b>blind</b> would be paid and the player is now [...] "caught up".|$|R
5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, <b>blinding</b> flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot {{out as soon}} as they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers and one of our destroyers blew up... From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E
5|$|Andronicus II {{took a deep}} {{interest}} in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous training of the army. The Byzantine Emperor ordered that his court be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General Alexios Philanthropenos to push back the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his <b>blinding</b> {{and the end of}} his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son Michael IX and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at Magnesia and Bapheus in 1302.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} was set free, Theodore {{returned}} to Thessalonica. Lacking any escort or followers, he disguised himself as a beggar in order to enter the city in secret. There he contacted old supporters and favourites, and organized a conspiracy that soon ousted Manuel and took over the city. As Byzantine custom barred him from re-assuming the imperial office due to his <b>blinding,</b> Theodore installed his son John Komnenos Doukas (r. 1237–44) as emperor (without a coronation ceremony), but remained the real ruler of the empire in his son's name. John himself appears to have been mostly interested in religion, and more inclined to enter a monastery than to become emperor. Theodore had to persuade him that being named emperor was a God-given gift, and that he was indeed the rightful Emperor of the Romans due to his imperial descent.|$|E

Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare {{the quality of life}} and social skills between {{students}} who are visually impaired (<b>blind</b> and partially <b>blind)</b> and normal students. The population consisted of all students with visual problems (<b>blind</b> and partially <b>blind)</b> and normal students in secondary schools in Tehran in the academic year 2013 - 2014. Using a multi-stage random sampling method, 40 students were selected from each group. The SF- 36 s quality of life questionnaire and Foster and Inderbitzen social skills questionnaire were used as research tools. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson correlation coefficient. The results showed that normal people had a better quality of life than those who are <b>blind.</b> There were no significant difference between the partially <b>blind</b> people’s quality of life and <b>blind</b> and normal people’s quality of life. The normal people had better social behavior than partially <b>blind</b> and <b>blind</b> people. In terms of other factors, there was no significant difference between the positive social behavior of partially <b>blind</b> and <b>blind</b> people. However, normal people had weaker negative social behavior than partially <b>blind</b> and <b>blind</b> people. The negative social behavior of partially <b>blind</b> people was weaker than <b>blind</b> people...|$|R
5|$|In {{the ending}} cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While {{traveling}} {{down a long}} corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on {{to the core of}} the tower, then a <b>blinding</b> light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, <b>blinding</b> their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently <b>blinding</b> him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including that he wore the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, {{or a combination of}} the two conjectures.|$|E

5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a <b>blinding</b> pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{seems to}} have {{continued}} even after the coronation. According to William of Malmesbury, an otherwise unknown nobleman called Alfred plotted to blind Æthelstan {{on account of his}} supposed illegitimacy, although it is unknown whether he aimed to make himself king or was acting on behalf of Edwin, Ælfweard's younger brother. <b>Blinding</b> would have been a sufficient disability to render Æthelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder. Tensions between Æthelstan and Winchester seem to have continued for some years. The Bishop of Winchester, Frithestan, did not attend the coronation or witness any of Æthelstan's known charters until 928. After that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in 931, but was listed in a lower position than entitled by his seniority.|$|E
5|$|Paul Baras of Brasier set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on his first lap. He {{held on to the}} lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, {{defending}} it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, <b>blinding</b> them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee {{to attack}} German {{shipping}} in Narvik, Norway on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a <b>blinding</b> snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy blew off {{the stern of}} the German flagship, , and killed the German flotilla commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another hit a merchant ship in the stern. A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After regrouping, Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to poor visibility.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} of men {{with the intention of}} capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively <b>blinding</b> the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes.

5|$|The Hungarian mythographer Karl Kerényi, one of {{the founders}} of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in Gods of the Greeks (1951). Kerényi portrays Orion as a giant of Titanic vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were Tityos or Dionysus. Kerényi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his {{stepmother}} and then to the present forms). Orion's <b>blinding</b> is therefore parallel to that of Aegypius and Oedipus.|$|E
