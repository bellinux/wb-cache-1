25|$|In {{the case}} of the T4 phage, the {{construction}} of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins.

25|$|First, {{stakes were}} {{driven into the}} ground to roughly mark out the {{positions}} for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by theodolite measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached {{to the top of}} each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using shears (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several metres apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.|$|E
500|$|There were no new fortifications {{along this}} coast {{at the start}} of World War II. After the fall of France in 1940, the threat of {{invasion}} {{led to the creation of}} new defences. In addition to the installation of anti-tank and other passive obstacles, fourteen coastal batteries, each of two guns, were constructed. Some of these emplacements and other military bases fell within the SSSI area. Four spigot mortar <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> found at Holme dunes may not have originated at that site, since there is no record of such armament there. The marsh at Titchwell was reflooded, and pillboxes built into the beach bank. Between 1942 and 1945, the marsh was used by the Royal Tank Regiment; an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range was established and banks were constructed for firing practice, with targets set at [...] intervals. Some of the still extant islands were built to hold [...] "pop-up" [...] targets, operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations now lie below a bird hide. Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive. Military activities continued in the area after the war, and the Royal Air Force returned to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959. Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower, which was demolished in 1962, leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell's west bank. The remains of two World War II Covenanter tanks, probably used as targets, are sometimes exposed at low tide. The SS Vina, an 1894 cargo steamer, was anchored offshore in 1944 for use as an RAF target, but a gale dragged her to the sands off Titchwell, where the wreck can still be seen at low tide.|$|E

2500|$|A {{rail spike}} (also {{known as a}} cut spike or crampon) is a large nail with an offset head {{that is used to}} secure rails and <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> to {{railroad}} ties (sleepers) in the track. Robert Livingston Stevens is credited with the invention of the rail spike, the first recorded use of which was in 1832. The railroad spike was an invention which resulted from the state of industrialisation in the United States in the early 19th century: English mainline railways of that period used heavy and expensive cast iron chairs to secure T-shaped rails; instead, Stevens added a supporting base to the T rail which could be fixed with a simple spike. In 1982, the spike was still the most common rail fastening in North America. Common sizes are from [...] square and [...] long.|$|E

50|$|The {{artifact}} {{consists of}} three components: the <b>base</b> <b>plate,</b> a circular plate of metals with primary relief, and the secondary relief.

Then the crafting of designs or reliefs is done by jewelers, and the encrusting of the relief is the prerogative of the diamond-setting expert. The procedure of manufacture involves the making of the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> followed by the casting of the copper plate, preparing moulds, and crafting the motifs on copper plates and dyes.

2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E
2500|$|Binding {{angle is}} defined by the degrees off of {{perpendicular}} from the length of the snowboard. A binding angle of 0° is when the foot is perpendicular to the length of the snowboard. Positive angles are pointed towards the front of the board, whereas negative angles are pointed towards the back of the board. The question of how much the bindings are angled depends on the rider's purpose and preference. Different binding angles can be used for different types of snowboarding. Someone who participates in freestyle competition would have a much different [...] "stance" [...] than someone who explores backcountry and powder. The recent advancement and boom of snowboard culture and technology has made binding angle adjustments relatively easy. Binding companies design their bindings with similar baseplates that can easily mount onto any type of snowboard regardless of the brand. With the exception of Burton, and their newly released [...] "channel system", adjusting bindings is something that remains constant among all snowboarders. Done with a small screw-driver or a snowboard tool, the <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> on bindings can be easily rotated to whatever preferred stance. One must un-screw the baseplate, pick their degree angles, and then re-screw the baseplates. Bindings should also regularly be checked to ensure that the screws don't come undone from the movements of snowboarding.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the stiffness and strength of steel storage rack <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assemblies. <b>Base</b> <b>plate</b> assemblies are usually bolted to an upright and to a concrete floor, and {{they are used to}} provide resistance against the flexural buckling of the upright and/or the overall down-aisle buckling of the frame. The semi-rigid stiffness is usually determined by means of a test of two pre-loaded uprights connected to a concrete block in a dual-actuator set-up. Guidance for conducting the test is provided in the European Standard EN 15512. However, several aspects of the test need clarification, notably the test set-up and the transducer arrangement for measuring the rotations of the <b>base</b> <b>plate.</b> This paper provides recommendations for how best to conduct the test, and proposes an alternative test method to that given in the EN 15512 Specification. The paper also identifies the contributions to the deformations of <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assemblies, including the deformations of the supporting floor, the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> assembly itself and the upright, and proposes simple expressions for calculating the stiffness associated with each contributing deformation where applicable. Furthermore, the paper proposes a deformation criterion for determining the ultimate design moment for <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> tests which do not attain a peak moment.
