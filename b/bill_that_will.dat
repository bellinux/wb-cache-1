6000|$|It did {{not occur}} for several years after that simple and platonic passion just described: for though they may talk of youth as the season of romance, it has always {{appeared}} {{to me that there}} are no beings in the world so entirely unromantic and selfish as certain young English gentlemen from the age of fifteen to twenty. The oldest Lovelace about town is scarcely more hard-hearted and scornful than they; they ape all sorts of selfishness and rouerie: they aim at excelling at cricket, at billiards, at rowing, and drinking, and set more store by a red coat and a neat pair of top-boots than by any other glory. A young fellow staggers into college chapel of a morning, and communicates to all his friends that he was [...] "so CUT last night," [...] with the greatest possible pride. He makes a joke of having sisters and a kind mother at home who loves him; and if he speaks of his father, it is with a knowing sneer to say that he has a tailor's and a horse-dealer's <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> surprise [...] "the old governor." [...] He would be ashamed of being in love. I, in common with my kind, had these affectations, and my perpetual custom of smoking added not a little to my reputation as an accomplished roue. What came of this custom in the army and at college, the reader has already heard. Alas! in life it went no better with me, and many pretty chances I had went off in that accursed smoke.|$|E

40|$|Every year {{members of}} Congress vote on {{numerous}} <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> {{have an impact}} on the vitality of our environment. But what factors, if any, contribute to the way in which Members of the House vote on environmental legislation? In this paper, we postulate that religion has a large role in influencing the voting habits of Representatives. In order to test for religion’s impact, we examined the roll call voting of Members of the House of Representatives spread over nine years from 1970 - 2010. We find that self- identified religious affiliation is an independently important factor in determining voting patterns of Members of Congress. This pattern holds constant over time and consistent across party lines...|$|R
