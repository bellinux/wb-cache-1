40|$|The main {{parameter}} for {{determination of}} the possibilities to enhance oil recovery by e. g. CO 2 injection into a specific oil field is the measurement of Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP). This pressure is the lowest pressure for which a gas can obtain miscibility through a multi contact process with a given oil reservoir at the reservoir temperature. The oil formation to which the process is applied must be operated {{at or above the}} MMP. Before field trial this parameter is to be determined at the laboratory which traditionally is done by help of a slim tube or a raising bubble experiments. However, in order to investigate the MMP, we suggest another method by using a supercritical extractor. Spe-ed SFE equipment with oil saturated natural rock samples were used for the purpose. The clean chalk samples were saturated with oil from the Dan field under vacuum. The CO 2 gas was injected into the extractor vessel containing the sample at different increasing pressure levels. The oil displaced in such a way was collected and measured. The volume of extracted oil was plotted against the increasing pressure. The form of the graph is similar to that typically obtained from a slim tube experiment. Following the <b>breakover</b> <b>point</b> criterion the MMP read from the plot was found equal to 20 MPa...|$|E
