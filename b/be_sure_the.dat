5|$|In early August, Major General Ironside {{launched}} his offensive against the 6th Red Army, with the British force subsequently inflicting {{large numbers of}} casualties and taking many prisoners for relatively little loss to themselves. The offensive was mainly fought through thick pine forest and swamp which provided little terrain for manoeuvre and although hugely successful, may have been unnecessary. Indeed, the Bolshevik forces in the region perhaps numbered only 6,000 men, and was probably engaged in holding operations only. It {{has been suggested that}} they probably had no intention of interrupting the Allied evacuation, and may have been caught unprepared by the sudden offensive. To <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> main Red Army activity in early August was on the Siberian front, where Kolchak's White armies were falling back in disarray.|$|E

He was asked what he would do {{in the event of a}} looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E

The secret of transmuting one element into another, specifically base metals into gold or silver, was equally explored by both schools for obvious reasons.|$|E

Davies's and Smith's brigades of Crook's division were assigned to guard the wagon trains when Wells's brigade moved forward. One of Davies's regiments was sent to watch the Boydton Plank Road bridge across Stony Creek.

25|$|Despite the {{official}} version of royal descent, oral traditions {{speak of a}} decidedly less grandiose genealogy: That his parents were commoners from Ngathayauk in Pagan district or Htihlaing village in Toungoo district, and {{that his father was}} a toddy palm tree climber, then one of the lowest professions in Burmese society. The commoner origin narrative first gained prominence in the early 20th century during the British colonial period as nationalist writers like Po Kya promoted it as proof that even a son of a toddy tree climber could rise to become the great emperor in Burmese society. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>the</b> chronicle and oral traditions need not be mutually exclusive since being a toddy tree climber does not preclude his having royal ancestors.|$|E

To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>the</b> neighboring states themselves looked at the newly rising power from Central Myanmar, the traditional home of political power in Myanmar, with caution. In 1370, King Binnya U of the southern kingdom of Ramanya proposed friendly relations. The king of the Mon-speaking kingdom wanted a quiet northern border as he had been facing a serious rebellion in Martaban (Mottama) and the Irrawaddy delta since 1363/64. Swa too wanted a quiet border, and in particular Binnya U's assurance that Ramanya would not assist Toungoo. The two kings met later in the year 1370/71 at the frontier, and signed a treaty demarcating the border.|$|E

25|$|To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>the</b> ethnic {{definitions}} were loose categorisations. Overarching politico-ethnic identities {{were still}} in their early stages of development. In the western mainland, even the so-called major ethnic groups—such as Burmans, Mons, Shans—were themselves divided into rival centres, with distinctive local traditions {{and in many cases}} different dialects. The same was true for smaller minorities still—indeed, terms like Kachins, Karens, and Chins are exonyms given by Burmans that summarily group several different groups. In the central mainland, the main Siamese, Lao and Yuan ethnicities {{were still in}} an embryonic stage, and a chiefly elite concept. In Siam, the Siamese language and ethnicity were the “preserve” of the aristocracy called the munnai, and most commoners in Ayutthaya, according to an early 16th-century Portuguese observer, still spoke Mon dialects rather than still emerging Siamese, and cut their hair like the Mons of Pegu.|$|E
25|$|The Chumphon {{route is}} {{unlikely}} {{to have been the}} main attack route as it was even farther south than Alaungpaya's Kuiburi route. It means the Burmese would have had a longer route to go back up the Gulf of Siam coast. Without the element of surprise that Alaungpaya enjoyed in the 1760 war, the Burmese invasion force of 1765 would have had to fight more than three months it took Alaungpaya {{to break out of the}} coast. Yet, Maha Nawrahta's army was west of Ayutthaya by December. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>the</b> smaller Burmese army that took Tenasserim could have crossed over at Chumphon, and marched up the coast although the most southerly battles reported by the Burmese were at Ratburi and Phetburi, on the northern coast. At any rate, according to the Burmese sources, Chumphon was not the main attack route.|$|E
25|$|The SWANCC {{decision}} {{continues the}} efforts of the five Supreme Court justices generally regarded as conservative to limit federal regulatory power. In 1995 and 2000, the same five justices found that Congress had exceeded Commerce Clause limits in enacting legislation dealing with possession of guns in school zones and violence against women. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court in SWANCC did not reach the constitutional question, but rather disposed of the case on purely statutory grounds. Nonetheless, its analysis of the CWA has, as noted, a strong undercurrent of the same Commerce Clause and federalism concerns. In not addressing the constitutional issue, SWANCC resembles another recent Commerce Clause decision in which, as in SWANCC, the Court used the possibility of Commerce Clause issues being raised by a broad interpretation of a federal statute to support its adoption of a narrow reading. The Court did not grant a petition for certiorari in a similar Commerce Clause challenge to the Endangered Species Act.|$|E

25|$|LoADS {{proposed}} placing one interceptor {{in one of}} the decoy shelters, thus every set of 23 shelters {{would have}} one MX, one LoADS and 21 decoys. At first glance it might appear that only one additional enemy warhead would be needed, using up the LoADS interceptor. However, only the defender knew where the MX was, and LoADS would only fire at the single warhead seen approaching that shelter. That meant that the MX would almost definitely survive a single warhead attack. In order to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> MX was hit, the Soviets would have to attack every shelter with two warheads, assuming one would be lost to the LoADS. For a typical 23-site MPS, 46 warheads would be needed, so if LoADS remained within the 100-interceptor limit of the ABM treaty, 4,600 warheads would be needed to attack just one-half of the 200-strong MX fleet, leaving 100 missiles and 1,000 warheads in the US counterattack. An attack against the entire fleet would require them to break the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks limits on the number of offensive warheads.|$|E
25|$|To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>the</b> self-proclaimed king's realm {{amounted}} {{to just the}} immediate region around his small town. To his west and south, he was still hemmed in by Prome and Dala, ruled by Pagan princes, Thihathu of Prome and Kyawswa of Dala, respectively. To his east, the Martaban (Mottama) province was controlled by another rebel Wareru. To his north, Thawun Gyi {{was in charge of}} Toungoo (Taungoo). Since the king did not control any of their surrounding regions, the Pegu leadership believed that they would be low on the king's priority list, and their defensive preparations progressed slowly. However, to their surprise, the king managed to send a small army to Pegu. When the army showed up at their doorstep, they readily surrendered. They convinced the commander that it had been a misunderstanding all along, and that they remained loyal to the king. Their deception was successful. But later that night, the Pagan general and the staff died from eating the poisoned dried game meat offered to them by Akhamaman's men. After the death of the general, the remaining troops retreated. The king ordered another expedition but Pegu was now ready. The army could not take the well-stockaded town, and had to retreat.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain the}} {{behavior}} of the Yang–Mills theory at high energies, and so to prove asymptotic freedom, one applies perturbation theory assuming a small coupling. This is verified a posteriori in the ultraviolet limit. In the opposite limit, the infrared limit, the situation is the opposite, as the coupling is too large for perturbation theory to be reliable. Most of the difficulties that research meets is just managing the theory at low energies. That is the interesting case, being inherent to the description of hadronic matter and, more generally, to all the observed bound states of gluons and quarks and their confinement (see hadrons). The most used method to study the theory in this limit is to try to solve it on computers (see lattice gauge theory). In this case, large computational resources are needed to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> correct limit of infinite volume (smaller lattice spacing) is obtained. This is the limit the results must be compared with. Smaller spacing and larger coupling are not independent of each other, and larger computational resources are needed for each. As of today, the situation appears somewhat satisfactory for the hadronic spectrum and the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators, but the glueball and hybrids spectra are yet a questioned matter in view of the experimental observation of such exotic states. Indeed, the σ resonance(600) pole and scattering length |journal=Physical Review D |volume=76 |issue=7 |page=074034 |year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.76.074034|arxiv = hep-ph/0701025 |bibcode = 2007PhRvD..76g4034G }} is not seen in any of such lattice computations and contrasting interpretations have been put forward.

25|$|Once again, Akers' {{kick and}} Ware's return placed the Giants in good field position, with Manning {{beginning}} the drive at the Giants' 36-yard line with 1:10 left. However, the drive began with two incomplete passes, {{and after a}} third-down sack by DT Trevor Laws put the Giants at their own 29-yard line, the Giants called a timeout as the play clock was about to expire on fourth down with 12 seconds left. Officials then ruled to reset the game clock to 0:14 as the Giants' punt team and the Eagles' punt return team came onto the field. The snap from long snapper Zak DeOssie to punter Matt Dodge was high, and Dodge hastily kicked a line drive punt to Jackson rather than kicking {{the ball out of}} bounds. Jackson received the ball at the Eagles' 35-yard line and immediately muffed the catch before picking the ball up and backpedaling to the 30-yard line. (This was later claimed by some to cause the Giants' coverage to collapse, ironically assisting Jackson.) Jackson ran through a group of Giants and made it to midfield before receiving a huge block by WR Jason Avant on DeOssie, leaving no one in front of Jackson {{on the way to the}} end zone (Avant actually gave himself a concussion on the block, and both players were left lying on the field for the rest of the play). Ware followed Jackson but could not catch him. After the clock hit 0:00, Jackson ran parallel to the goal line across most of the width of the field—according to Jackson after the game, because he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> clock had expired, though some observers believed it to be due to his showboating nature — before advancing into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. With no flags on the field, Jackson threw the ball into the New Meadowlands stands in celebration as the team gathered around him near the end zone. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin was so livid he threw his play sheet and notes onto the ground and ran onto the field before Jackson even reached the end zone, yelling at Dodge for not punting the ball out of bounds. Per NFL rules, Akers came out to kick the extra point and the Eagles won the game 38–31.|$|E

Nate Boss of Project-Blu described the episode as “filler” and praised the episode's concept, but criticized how the episode was executed. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide also gave the episode a mixed response, and wrote that “'Rap' starts with a clever – if absurd – concept”, but “does little to churn good comedy out of its theme”, and concluded by calling the episode “disappointing”. |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |last=Jacobsson|first=Colin|publisher=DVD Movie Guide}} Writing for Obsessed With Film, Adam Rayner described the episode as “woefully weak” and “an example of the farcical that the series would fall deeper and deeper into”. He did, however, praise the episode for being original. Jennifer Malkowski, reviewing the season for DVD Verdict, was more positive towards the episode. Giving the episode a rating of B+, Malkowski listed “The Parent Rap” among episodes in the season where “We see wacky scenarios force Homer to bond with his family, to a rather heartwarming effect”. Ron Martin of 411Mania was also favorable, calling the episode “decent”.|$|E
