5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began their}} 2007football season with emotion and remembrance. As Virginia Tech {{recovered}} from the worst school shooting in American history, football served {{as a way to}} help the university community emotionally heal. The opening game of the season, on September 1, 2007, was against East Carolina University and featured numerous remembrance ceremonies and commemorations. Buoyed by the emotion of the day, the Hokies earned a 177 victory. Their next game would not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy.</b> One week later, Virginia Tech traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to face the No.2 Louisiana State University Tigers. The Tigers were widely regarded in pre-season polls as favorites to play in the National Championship Game and overwhelmed the Hokies in front of a home crowd, 487.|$|E

25|$|On 22–23 August 1914, {{the first}} major {{engagement}} of the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War occurred at the Battle of Mons. Advancing German forces were thrown back by heavily outnumbered British troops, who suffered heavy casualties and, being outflanked, were forced into rapid retreat the next day. The retreat and the battle were rapidly perceived by the British public as being a key moment in the war. Despite the censorship going on in Britain at the time, this battle was the first indication the British public had that defeating Germany would not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> as some had thought.|$|E

25|$|Zelena and Arthur are in {{the woods}} and come upon the witch’s home and is met by a giant wolf, only to have Zelena throws some {{sleeping}} powder on it to make it sleepy. The witch appears and says she won’t <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> to subdue. Arthur asks for the magic helm and the witch says she already sent someone to look for it. Zelena holds her head near the cauldron and threatens her and the witch says Merida has it. Arthur is shocked that Merida escaped and Zelena promises to make her pay. They then show up with Zelena demanding it while Merida asks why everyone wants it. Arthur says it has the power to make other men fight your battle and says he needs it but Merida says her father wouldn’t use magic to fight his battles. Mulan says they need the helm to protect their people but they don’t have it. Zelena takes Merida's bow to use as a tracking device, and tells her she can console herself with the memories of what a terrible ruler {{he turned out to be}} then tells Arthur they can use it to track the helm and they disappear.|$|E
500|$|Robert Brunner, Apple's head of {{industrial}} design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook [...] "so it would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> {{to use and}} carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers {{of the time and}} also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were beige or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed {{in the middle of the}} computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create a fashion statement with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: [...] "It says something about the identity of the person who is carrying it".|$|E
500|$|However, {{she soon}} {{came to realize}} that writing a book about Madonna would not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> as she had thought. There was already {{abundant}} material available about her life and career and Simone could not find anything else left to be said in her book. The author hoped of [...] "finding some tiny stone left unturned in the giant gravel pit of Madonna studies". She even had to return her book advance given by her publisher for failing to write the biography. Unable to produce a biography, Simone instead decided to pursue a different direction with the material. The author, who had already released the novel called Note to Self (2009) and is also a musician, wanted to focus on her own singing career, self-declared as a [...] "failure". She confessed having a personal affinity for [...] "underdog" [...] musicians, an understanding which was totally opposite to what Madonna stood for with her success.|$|E

2500|$|According to Anyen Rinpoche, {{the true}} meaning is that the student must take the entire path as an {{interconnected}} entity of equal importance. Dzogchen is perfect {{because it is an}} all inclusive totality that leads to middle way realization, in avoiding the two extremes of nihilism and eternalism. It classifies outer, inner and secret teachings, which are only separated by the cognitive construct of words and completely encompasses Tibetan Buddhist wisdom. [...] It can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> as taking Bodhicitta as the method, and failing this is missing an essential element to accomplishment.|$|E
2500|$|The Yahoo! 2006 Buzz Log stated that, [...] "while {{it may not}} <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> on {{the eyes}} as some other popular online RPG games, like World of Warcraft, City of Heroes, or EverQuest, RuneScape {{is still a lot}} better way to kill time than pushing around cells in a spreadsheet". A 2007 JustRPG review {{summarised}} RuneScape as [...] "a fun, addictive game, and while the graphics may not be perfect, for a game written in Java, they aren't bad. The skills are varied, the community is alright, and it'll eat up your time if you aren't careful", giving it a score of 83%.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics were}} {{disappointed}} that the band had stayed {{too close to the}} sound of their previous records, with NME reviewer Emily Mackay saying that [...] "too often you feel the band collapse back into comfy...making music shouldn't always <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> as giving someone a big sonic hug"; Mackay awarded the album six out of ten. Pitchfork Media's Jason Heller, who scored The Take Off and Landing of Everything 6.2 out of 10.0, shared this view, stating that [...] "the album dangles there, an effortlessly leaden exhibition of glum triumphalism—and an example of what makes Elbow, at its least potent, so subtly unsubtle." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stage {{designer}} Oliver Messel was enlisted {{to create}} {{the interior of the}} new Delman-branded store for H. & M. Rayne in Bond Street in 1960. As Alison Settle noted, whereas upmarket shoe stores had been discreet enclaves dressed with curtains and pot plants – with shoes consigned to underground stores – this refit incorporated display stands and cases, some of them illuminated, to show off hundreds of pairs of shoes. Her article in The Observer said: [...] "Mr Messel and Mr Rayne are at one in thinking that shoes to buy should <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> to see and handle as books in a library". The Rayne brand's reputation for supplying shoes to royalty continued; at the marriage of Princess Margaret to Messel's nephew Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1960, the senior female royal party (Queen Mother, Queen, Princess Margaret) were all clad in Rayne shoes.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} several reasons for not enforcing. [...] Firstly and most simply, it is tiring for bowlers to bowl for two {{consecutive}} innings, and it may not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> to dismiss a side cheaply in its second innings as it was in its first. , West Indies batting first declared at 579/9 and Pakistan replied with 106 runs. Pakistan was asked to follow-on on the third day of the six day match. Mohammed Hanif [...] held his ground for 970 minutes, scoring 337 runs, forcing a draw. Secondly, not enforcing the follow-on is a cautious but perhaps prudent tactic which, at the least, prevents a team from possibly losing. [...] If the side batting first has a substantial lead on first innings, it can add to that by taking its second innings straightaway and either scoring enough runs and/or using up enough time to give the side batting second no chance of victory at all. [...] While this does increase the chances of a game ending in a draw, it can also be demotivating for the side batting second to have nothing to play for. [...] Finally, it is also usually considered a disadvantage to bat last, when the pitch has deteriorated by wear and there are more natural variations to its bounce and ability to take spin. [...] A captain who does not enforce the follow-on avoids this risk and allows his own bowlers {{to take advantage of the}} worn pitch.|$|E
