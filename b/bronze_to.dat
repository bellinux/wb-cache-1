5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and <b>bronze,</b> <b>to</b> improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|The US women's 4 x 400 metres {{relay team}} was {{recommended}} by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to be stripped of their gold medal, after the suspension of Crystal Cox for doping.

Hence, the US relay team is still listed as the winner for this event.|$|E

5|$|The {{cephalothorax}} of Z.sexpunctatus is <b>bronze</b> <b>to</b> {{black in}} color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box-like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus ("face") and chelicerae. This covering extends around {{the sides of}} the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang.|$|E
5|$|The golden {{everlasting}} {{has proven}} very adaptable to cultivation. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual cultivars {{in a host}} of colour forms from white to <b>bronze</b> <b>to</b> purple flowers became available. Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial shrubs, which have become popular garden plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed forms are used commercially in the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States {{where it can be}} found in a variety of grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5mm in length. The {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen are <b>bronze</b> <b>to</b> black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix – This mode has {{the player}} race against 7 (or 6) teams, which are {{controlled}} by the computer, {{in a series of}} predetermined courses. The player can choose to race using 3 different engine size classes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. A fourth unlockable class, Mirror Mode, allows the player to race through a mirrored version of the tracks using the 150cc engine size. Since all karts go faster when using higher engine sizes, the 4 classes serve as difficulty levels. There are 16 tracks, divided into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star and Special. A 5th cup has the player race in every track called the All-Cup Tour. The tour always starts with Luigi Circuit and ends with Rainbow Road, but the remaining tracks show up in random order. Every race is three laps long except for Baby Park and Wario Colosseum, which have 7 and 2, respectively. After all the human players cross the finish line, the positions of the computer-controlled teams are immediately locked in and they are given points based on those eight positions, ranging from 0 to 10. At the end of the cup, there will be an award ceremony for the 3 teams, where they will get a trophy ranging from <b>bronze</b> <b>to</b> gold. No matter which position they earned after each race, everyone will move on because of these new rules.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{had been}} {{introduced}} to cultivation in England by 1791. German horticulturist Herren Ebritsch obtained material and developed it at his nursery in Arnstadt near Erfurt in Germany. He bred and sold cultivars of many colours from <b>bronze</b> <b>to</b> white to purple, which spread across Europe in the 1850s. The bracts of these early forms tended to remain cupped around the flower head rather than flatten out like the native Australian forms. These were also annual rather than perennial forms. Many were given cultivar names such as 'atrococcineum' (dark scarlet flower heads), 'atrosanguineum' (dark blood-red flower heads), 'aureum' (golden yellow flower heads), 'bicolor' (red-tipped yellow flower heads), 'compositum' (large multicoloured flower heads), 'macranthum' (large rose-edged white flower heads), and 'monstrosum' (flower heads with many bracts), although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals. Some coloured forms of South African Helichrysum {{are thought to have}} been introduced to the breeding program, which resulted in the huge array of colours. X. bracteatum was one of several species that became popular with European royalty and nobility from the early 19th century, yet were little noticed in Australia until the 1860s, when they became more prominent in Australian gardens.|$|E
