40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete early strength ansite {{in the first}} six hours after application using a partial beam test standard, ASTM C 1 16 - 90. Determining the early-strength development of as-sprayed shotcrete can improve mine safety by identifying appropriate reentry times and providing a convenient means of quality control during application. A more thorough understanding of shotcrete early strength will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall accidents. Background: When shotcrete is used as part of a multi component ground support system, {{it is important to know}} when the material has developed enough strength to be self-supporting and allow for reentry and emplacement of the remaining support elements that require drilling of the shotcrete layer without degradation. Typical reported values for this threshold strength for North American mines range from 1 to 1. 6 MPa (145 to 233 psi) [O'Toole and Pope 2006], with a compressive strength equivalent to 1 MPa (145 psi) being the norm [Rispin et al. 2003; O'Toole and Pope 2006]. Typical ground control support includes a shotcrete flash coat 19 - to 25 -mm (3 / 4 - to 1 -in) thick, followed by screen, plates, bolts, and a second layer of shotcrete bringing the combined thickness to 75 to 100 mm (3 to 4 in). In areas requiring rehabilitation, the second layer of shotcrete is plated and bolted as well. While testing cored samples after 24 hours is standard, this is not practical for the one- to six-hour period following application when shotcrete unconfined compressive strengths are less than 10 MPa (1, 450 psi). Indirect methods are typically used to determine shotcrete strength during the early stages of curing because the partially cured or green material is difficult to sample and test. While problems with inconsistent test results have been reported with the penetrometer-type devices, <b>beam</b> <b>molds</b> have been used successfully for creating shotcrete test specimens in the United States and Canada. Operating the Partial Beam Test System: The test unit is a self-contained, servo-controlled, stiff-frame press. Partial beam test samples are obtained by spraying shotcrete into 102 - x 102 - x 152 -mm (4 - x 4 - x 6 -in) mold boxes. After the samples have been sprayed, tests are conducted at one-hour intervals over the next six hours (one- through six-hour tests). The shotcrete samples are carefully demolded by disassembling the mold fixtures and removing the enclosed sample. Next, a shotcrete sample is placed in a specialized testing fixture and centered under the loading head of the test machine. When the test sequence is initiated, a programmable-logic-controller- (PLC) driven press applies a fixed-rate load to the sample. The load profile is shown on a graphical output display, and the measured test parameters (time, displacement, and load) are stored on a thumb drive. Once the operator observes a well-defined peak in the load profile curve, the test is completed and the test machine's loading platen can be returned to its initial starting position. Peak load is typically reflected by the development of large vertically oriented cracks along the platen-to sample contact edges, which are indicative of the failure plane. There is a marked difference in early-strength gain between sprayed and cast shotcrete. The cast shotcrete samples have a similar strength gain profile to that of cast concrete samples.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the flexural strength of a monolayer of resin composite with that of a bilayer of resin composite and liner. Four types of RC beams were tested: a monolayer control that is an un-lined RC (Tetric EvoCeram, Ivoclar Vivadent) and three “bilayer” specimens that consisted of this same RC lined with one of three liners. The three liners used included two RMGI cements (Vitrebond LC liner; 3 M ESPE and, GC Fuji Lining LC; GC America) and a flowable resin composite (Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent). Each group was tested after water storage for 24 h and 30 d. Altogether, eight, 12 -specimen groups were fabricated and tested. Methods: A 25 x 2 x 2 mm mold was completely filled with the RC to form the control beams. To form the bilayer <b>beams,</b> this <b>mold</b> was filled with 0. 5 mm of the liner and then with 1. 5 mm of the RC. Specimens were stored in 37 oC distilled for either 24 h or 30 d.

Flexural strength was determined using a three-point–bending device. A twoway analysis of variance (ANOVA) with interactions was used to investigate how liner group (or no liner) and storage time affected strength. Results: The interaction between liner type and storage time was significant (p = 0. 0128). The un-lined RC (the monolayer beam) was significantly stronger after 24 h than after 30 d in water (p = 0. 0098). Water storage between 24 h and 30 d did not change the flexural strength of any of the bilayer (lined) beams (p > 0. 05).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this of this essay is to explore the {{construction}} of a conservatory that is livable all year around. When you build a conservatory there are several factors that need to be regarded that usually are of no importance when you build a regular conservatory. The glassed facade needs to have a very good U-value and all the parts of the facade need to be isolated and the construction needs to prevent thermal bridges. In this essay we will start by looking at the shape of the conservatory. Due to the façade consists of glass the conservatory will need to have a good ratio between the area and the façade so that the heat losses will be at a minimum. However, {{due to the fact that}} one of the sides of the façade is connected to the warm house, you quickly realize that the shape of the conservatory is of no importance. There are two common ways to build a foundation for a conservatory, a molded concrete foundation and isolated wooden <b>beams.</b> The <b>molded</b> concrete foundation is usually recommended but if you have a difference in heights on the ground the wooden beams are a good solution. The frame of the conservatory usually consists of gluelam; however there are some exceptions where the frame consists of aluminum. It is very common for the roof of a conservatory to consist of polycarbonate which is a very good at isolating while the price is still relatively low. Depending on how much time of the year you want to spend in the conservatory the thickness of the polycarbonate while differ. It is recommended that the minimum thickness of the roof of a conservatory that is to be used all year round should be 32 mm. The price of the conservatory varies greatly depending on how much time of the year you want to use it. A regular conservatory can cost around 33 000 SEK for an area of 10, 5 m 2 while the same conservatory would cost up to 127 000 SEK. The difference in price arises due to the fact that the demands on a conservatory are higher it is to be used all year round. While a regular conservatory might have a U-value of 6, 7 W/(m 2 *K) the U-value of an all year round conservatory is 1, 1 W/(m 2 *K). The biggest increase in price comes when you go from an almost all year round conservatory to an all year round conservatory. The U-value decreases with 31 % while the price increases with 152 %. This is probably due to the complex process of preventing thermal bridges by installing plastic between the aluminum profiles. In today’s market there are three different categories of facades: sliding facades, folding facades and fixed parties. Even within the different categories there are different facades, they vary depending on how many glasses they consist of. These differentiate in price, this price difference is directly correlated to how much of the facade that you can open. The more you can open, the more expensive the price is. Also, we examine two different ways of heating the room, stoves and floor heating. Floor heating is a popular alternative for all year round conservatories because they usually have a molded concrete foundation. It is rather difficult to install floor heating in isolated wooden beams. That is why we examine another alternative, stove that run on ethanol. Apart from the heat they also add an esthetic appeal. At the end of the essay we will design our own conservatory that is adapted to the house. The final price for the all year round conservatory lands at a whopping 313 300 SEK...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Massmiliano Cavallini, Denis Gentili, Pierpaolo Greco, Francesco Valle & Fabio Biscarini ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{provides the}} instructions for designing and fabricating stamping tools with features ranging from nanometer to micrometer scale, including the fabrication using commercial tools such as compact disks or digital video disks. In particular the reported procedures are oriented towards the tools fabrication for lithographically controlled wetting and soft lithography. Because the versatility of these methods that has almost no restrictions concerning the materials used for the stamps, {{a wide range of}} methods are provided in this protocol including photolithography, electron <b>beam</b> lithography, replica <b>molding,</b> laser engraving and nanoimprinting. ### Introduction **GENERAL INFORMATION** **PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY** Presently the most common method to fabricate rigid stamps (usually in silicon) and masters required for replica molding of the soft stamps is photolithography (see the protocol in ref. (1)). This process, widely used for microfabrication, is based on the selective removing of parts of a film upon the exposition to light (usually UV). This is achieved thanks to some materials known as photoresists, that are light-sensitive, meaning that, according to their composition, they become soluble or insoluble to their developing solution upon illumination. The first family is called positive photoresist and the second negative. The light is sent through a photomask that shadows the parts of the film that, according to the kind of resist used, must be removed or preserved. Different kind of masks can be used but their common feature is the ability to shadow as much as possible some parts of the photoresist below (contrasting power), the most used are transparent foils with pattern drawn by an ink non-transparent to UV-light or highly reflecting foils (usually metallic) where some portion have been removed by laser engraving. The current limits of photolithography is approximately 250 nm and the minimum feature size is 100 nm (2). These values are important on the one hand to define the ranges of fabrication of soft stamps for LCW {{but on the other hand}} for the forthcoming comparison with the feature sizes and resolution that LCW can achieve. The masks are usually drawn using CAD software and then transferred either by common printers on transparent foils, where the marks will represent the shadowed areas, or by laser engraving of highly reflective metallic sheets where the removed part will corresponding to the illuminated path. The photoresist film, upon illumination is then developed in the appropriate solution leaving on the surface only the features that will be used as master for replica molding or directly as stamp. **ELECTRON BEAM LITHOGRAPHY** When the resolution limits required by the process are below those of photolithography (diffraction limit), electron beam lithography (EBL) is usually chosen for fabricating the masters. This technique is in fact able to achieve resolution of 20 - 30 nm in lateral size (see the protocol in ref. (1)), because it make use of an electron beam to locally alter the chemical properties of a material (resist) that will be then removed in a development step. Beside the illustrated resolution advantage one must remind that EBL is an expensive technology and it is a serial technique, thus it is much slower than photolithography. **REPLICA MOLDING** Replica molding (RM) is the most common way of fabricating the elastomeric stamp for soft lithography and LCW and it is one of the most important tools for these techniques. RM is based on the reticulation of the elastomeric precursors onto the master that is then removed, upon curing, by peeling it off. It is worth mentioning that the LCW is not limited to the elastomeric materials as other soft-lithographic methods and it makes wide use of rigid and metallic materials as it is shown other sections of this protocol. Nevertheless replica molding of the elastomeric materials still plays a crucial role because, making use of well known materials such as Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), it allows tuning the surface properties of the stamp by liquid or plasma chemical treatments. Elastomeric stamps made of PDMS are deformed easily under the effect of capillary adhesion. The attractive force, exerted by the solution trapped between the substrate and the stamp, may involve sagging of the PDMS stamp and poor patterning in the region where the PDMS displaced the solution. The capillary force may be estimated according to De Gennes,(3) and needs to be considered during the design of the spacer and the dimensioning of the full PDMS replica. In this case, an effective parameter is the aspect ratio AR, defined as the ratio of width over thickness of the window delimited by the spacer. If we put PDMS Young modulus E ≈ 460 kPa, contact angle of solution θ = π/ 6, and surface tension γ = 0. 02 N/m (organic solvents), we derived the critical value for AR that will induce sagging for various distances between the substrate and the PDMS replica, by finite element calculation (Figure 1). The empirical relationship can be summarized with a linear abacus for fast design, providing that the overall dimension of the stamp is exceeding the window defined by the spacer. **NANOIMPRINT LITHOGRAPHY** Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is another important technique useful to fabricate tools (i. e. master for RM and stamps) for LCW. NIL consists of a physical (morphological) deformation of a thermoplastic material in a temperature and pressure controlled printing process. A silicon stamp fabricated by a conventional lithography such as EBL or photolithography is usually employed. In NIL the thermoplastic material (usually a polymer) is deformed by pressing the stamp into the polymer at a temperature above the polymer’s glass-transition temperature. The polymer is then cooled down below the glass-transition temperature and the stamp is removed. **VACUUM SUBLIMATION OF METALS** One of the advantages of LCW is the versatility with respect to the material of the stamp used for patterning. In this frame, a role is played also by metallic stamps, some of them (gold for instance) can be functionalized using thiol based Self Assembled Monolayers (SAM) to tune their surface properties. These stamps are usually fabricated by vacuum sublimation of a thin metallic layer on a master previously realized by one of the above mentioned techniques. For some substrates such as silicon or mica an adhesive layer (usually made of chromium or titanium) has to be previously evaporated on the underlying material to favour the stability of the metallic film. **COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE MASTER/STAMPS** Commercial metallic grids commonly used for Electron Microscopy experiments have proven to be very suitable for as a stamp for LCW (See Fig 2). When the grid comes as a large sheet that must be cut, it is crucial to cut it with very sharp scissors to avoid large deformations of the areas near the cut. For the most kind of patterning inexpensive masters such as Compact Disc (CD) Digital versatile disk (DVD) or diffraction gratings are commercially available. This kind of devices are made of: Blank CD, parallel stripes 1. 5 µm pitch, 500 nm width and 220 nm depth. Blank DVD, parallel stripes with 750 µm pitch, 300 nm width and 110 nm depth. Written disks contain a pattern o doth and line with the same size containing an information in digital (binary) code. Figure 3 shows typical AFM images CD and DVD masters. ### Reagents 1. Photoresists SU- 8 - SU- 8 developer 1 -Methoxy- 2 -propanol acetate - PolyMethylMethacrylate (PMMA) (Allresist, AR-P 679. 01) - Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer base and Sylgard 184 elastomer curing agent  (Dow Corning). CRITICAL Sylgard 184 is a thermal curable elastomer, which is provided as a two-component kit consisting of the base and the curing agent. The standard ratio between base and the curing agent 1 : 10 small variation led to adjust the softness of cured elastomer (higher value of 10 % led more rigid stamp). Use glove powder-free for these operations. - Ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 459836) - Hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 216763) - Sulfuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 320501) - Masks (supplier Toppan inc.) **REAGENT SETUP** - Piranha solution 3 : 1 mixture of concentrated H 2 SO 4 and H 2 O 2 (30 % vol/vol). Add very slowly and mix with a glass rod one volume of H 2 O 2 to three volumes of H 2 SO 4 in a clean beaker whose volume is at least 10 times the volume of the final solution. - CRITICAL Piranha solution  must be prepared fresh and cooled to room temperature before use. - ! CAUTION Keep attention because there are exothermic processes involved when you add the hydrogen peroxide to the sulphuric acid. Piranha solution can reacts violently with organic compounds, is very aggressive to skin, and should be handled with care. It is important to work in a fume hood and wear personal protective clothing (e. g., nitrile or latex gloves, lab coat, safety glasses) when handling solutions and keep away from organic chemicals ### Equipment 1.
