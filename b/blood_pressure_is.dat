5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> decreased {{not due to}} dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels.

Due to unfavourable anatomy because of non-critical fibromuscular dysplasia {{on the right}} renal artery, renal denervation of only the left renal artery was performed. Before and after the renal denervation, the patient’s <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> monitored by office measurements and ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements (ABPM).

40|$|The {{influence}} of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> studied in anesthetized baboons. Cerebral blood flow {{was measured by the}} 133 Xe clearance method, and arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> decreased by controlled hemorrhage. In normal baboons, the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> approximately 65 % of the base-line value; thereafter, cerebral blood flow decreased when arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> reduced. Superior cervical sympathectomy of 2 - 3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response. In contrast, both acute surgical sympathectomy (cervical trunk division) and a-receptor blockade (1. 5 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine) enhanced the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that cerebral blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> approximately 35 % of the base-line value.

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E

5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the associations of the orthostatic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> changes in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension. METHODS: A total of 2716 patients, 917 men and 1799 women, aged > or = 60 years, were examined at three separate outpatient visits whilst receiving placebo during the single-blind run-in {{phase of the}} Syst-Eur trial. The orthostatic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> changes <b>were</b> calculated by subtracting the average of two <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> readings with the patient in the supine position from the mean of two readings obtained after the patient had stood for 2 min. An orthostatic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> drop by at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic was considered exaggerated. RESULTS: For the three run-in visits combined, the supine <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> 175 +/- 13 mmHg systolic and 86 +/- 6 mmHg diastolic (means +/- SD). With the patients standing the systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> 5 +/- 12 mmHg lower, whereas the diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> 2 +/- 7 mmHg higher. An exaggerated fall in systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> observed on at least 1 visit in 21. 0 % of the patients and on all three visits in 2. 5 %. The corresponding values for diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>were</b> 9. 7 and 0. 4 %. The orthostatic fall in systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> increased with previous antihypertensive treatment, age and smoking, but decreased with a higher sitting pulse rate and usual alcohol consumption versus none. The rise in diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> upon standing <b>was</b> higher in women than in men, was curvilinearly associated with age and increased with the sitting diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> By multiple logistic regression analysis, the odds of having a persistent or occasional exaggerated orthostatic fall in systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>were</b> 22 % higher in women than in men. The odds increased with previous antihypertensive treatment (by 42 %), age (by 1. 4 %/year), electrocardiographic left ventricular mass (by 15 %/mV) and sitting systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (by 0. 9 %/mmHg), but decreased with sitting pulse rate (by 1. 9 %/beat per min). An exaggerated orthostatic fall in diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> 30 % more likely in men; the likelihood increased with age (by 6. 4 %/year) and decreased with sitting diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (by 6. 6 %/mmHg). CONCLUSION: An exaggerated orthostatic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> fall in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension is associated mainly with gender, age and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> level. Previous antihypertensive treatment, a lower pulse rate and a lower electrocardiographic left ventricular mass were also associated with an exaggerated orthostatic fall in systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} associations of left ventricular mass and cardiovascular morbidity/mortality with <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>are</b> stronger for 24 -h ambulatory pressure than for conventional clinic or casual pressure. METHODS: The investigation comprised a review of relevant studies, with particular emphasis {{on the characteristics of}} the conventional <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement. RESULTS: A review of 21 studies on left ventricular mass, published between 1982 and 1993, showed that the relationship between mass and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>was</b> stronger for ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> than for clinic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> but that the methodology and conditions of the conventional <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements <b>were</b> poorly described or standardized in several reports.
