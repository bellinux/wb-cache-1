40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence for}} the nature of early and middle Neolithic farming activity, its impact upon the landscape and environment, and its vulnerability to climatic change, at a sub-peat field system at Belderg Beg, North Co. Mayo, Ireland. Pollen analyses of a 14 C dated peat deposit close to the field system indicates that <b>basin</b> <b>peat</b> accumulated from c. 5590 to 5330 cal. BP, probably triggered by farming activities. The palynological evidence indicates that the field system was constructed for pastoral farming, surrounded by woodland. Sediment-stratigraphic analyses show that the soil in the field system was subject to significant erosion, {{which may have been}} a causal factor in the local cessation of agriculture in the late sixth millennium cal. BP. Peat humification analyses indicate that surface wetness was greatest at c. 4940 cal. BP, several centuries after abandonment of the field system, coincident in age with evidence for higher precipitation from other sites in North Mayo. Comparison with other records of early and mid-Neolithic agricultural activity and abandonment in the region suggests that the well-recognised mid-Neolithic agricultural decline occurred in the broad context of a shift to a more oceanic climate, but that local factors such as soil quality may have been more important in the exact timing of local agricultural abandonment...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the current plant diversity status {{and the impact of}} drivers of change on the <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> of the Kromme River peatland. It was conducted at six sites over sixty one years in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. I reviewed the rapid habitat and biodiversity loss of wetlands globally and discussed the distribution of wetlands and specifically peatlands in South Africa. Plant species diversity was assessed using Modified- Whittaker plots. The influence of environmental variables on floristic composition and distribution was investigated using ordination techniques (DCA and CCA). Land use dynamics were assessed by applying GIS techniques on orthorectified aerial images. Six different <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> were subjectively classified into good, medium and poor condition <b>peat</b> <b>basins.</b> The good condition <b>peat</b> <b>basin</b> (Krugersland) was the most diverse in plant species (4. 1 Shannon-Weiner’s index) (p> 0. 20; F = 11. 04; df = 2), with the highest mean number of plant species (32. 5 ± 3. 4). This was followed by the medium condition class (Kammiesbos) (26. 5 ± 9. 0) and poor condition class (Companjesdrift) (22. 5 ± 8. 9). On average, species composition was not evenly distributed across the <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> (p> 0. 21; F = 0. 94; df = 2), since 77. 8 % of the Shannon-Weiner evenness index obtained were less than one. However, there were variations in plant species richness across six <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> as confirmed by Oneway ANOVA test (p= 0. 0008, F = 1241. 6, df = 4). Key environmental variables that influenced plant species distribution and structure were erosion and grazing intensity, potassium, phosphorus, soil pH and calcium. Total species variance accounted for in the first two axes for ground cover and plant height were 40. 7 % and 56. 4 % respectively. Alien species (e. g. Acacia mearnsii and Conyza scabrida) were common in degraded <b>peat</b> <b>basins,</b> whereas good condition <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> supported indigenous species (e. g., Cyperus denudatus, Chrysanthemoides monolifera and Digitaria eriantha). Analysis of aerial images revealed a general progressive decrease in the peatland area between 1942 and 1969 in the good (Krugersland) and poor (Companjesdrift) condition class, with a marginal increase from 1969 to 2003. Peatland area in the good and poor condition class decreased by 5. 3 % and 8. 3 % respectively between 1942 and 1969, with a marginal increase of 1. 5 % and 4. 1 % respectively from 1969 to 2003. Annual net rate of change in peatland area over the 61 year period was - 0. 32 % (good condition class) and - 0. 79 % (poor condition class). Transformed lands were impacted by drivers of change such as alien invasives, agricultural activities, erosion and sediment transport. The area under alien invasives increased by 50 % between 1942 and 2003, with an annual net rate of change of + 0. 82 (good condition class) and + 1. 63 % (poor condition class) ...|$|R

A clear understanding on the hydrologic behavior of a drained <b>peat</b> <b>basin</b> is the essential factor towards an optimal management of the resource. Hydrological data from Madirono peat catchment located in Johor State, Malaysia was collected and used to characterise its hydrologic characteristics. The characterizations were made using the ordinary quantitative hydrologic approach. The magnitude {{of changes in the}} major hydrologic component of the study catchment was quantified. The study catchment experienced a large variation in runoff coefficient, indicating that a drained <b>peat</b> <b>basin</b> is a highly dynamic hydrologic system. A decaying trend in the annual runoff coefficient was observed. The annual runoff coefficients were large, ranging from 0. 32 to 0. 92. This indicates that the hydrology of the study catchment was extremely dynamics, highly permeable and very flashy. The low flow condition of the basin was extremely small but improving over time indicating that the basin could not sustain river flow during dry spell.

40|$|Peat swamp forests (PSF) in Malaysia, {{which once}} {{occupied}} 2. 4 million hectares have been decreasing rapidly {{as they are}} transformed into other uses. The understanding of PSF is vital in order to conserve the remaining stand and its associated ecosystems {{as well as to}} enable sustainable use of its resources. The Peat Swamp Forest Project (MAL/ 99 /G 31) is an initiative of the Government of Malaysia with the assistance of United Nations Development Programme/Global Environment Facility (UNDP/GEF) in three sites in Malaysia. Started in June 2002, this Project aims to promote conservation and sustainable use of PSF and associated wetland ecosystems in Malaysia. Peat assessment forms one of the many studies undertaken by the Project and is carried out in two parts. The first part is the baseline study of peat while the second deals with gaseous emissions from peat. Reported here is {{the first part of the}} study conducted in one of the project sites (Loagan Bunut National Park (LBNP) Sarawak), which specifically aims to assess the peat depth, topography of the peat swamp <b>basin,</b> <b>peat</b> profile morphology, and physical and chemical properties of the peat in relation to the forest type growing on it. Information obtained from the study will be used for formulating effective management prescriptions for the peat resource of the LBNP to ensure its protection and conservation.

40|$|Methane flux {{measurements}} indicate {{boreal forest}} wetlands are large {{contributors to the}} global CH 4 emission despite the short peak production period, because of the extensive land base covered by wetlands in the north. The Boundary fen, in the boreal forest at the Prince Albert National Park, emitted an average of 0. 148 g CH 4 m- 2 d- 1 during peak production {{from the end of}} June until the end of July, with fluxes reaching 0. 531 g CH 4 m- 2 d- 1. A fen in the Canwood Forest Reserve showed emissions reaching a high of 0. 293 g CH 4 m- 2 d- 1 and averaging 0. 098 g CH 4 m- 2 d- 1 during peak production from the end of June until August 1. These CH 4 fluxes are similar to those reported in freshwater wetlands around the world. Methane fluxes were found to vary in different peat conformations. Areas with floating peat mats and shallow peat under forest had lower CH 4 fluxes relative to open water or deep solid peat locations. Therefore, as a peatland grows with time, the amount of CH 4 flux will change according to the dominant peat conformation type. A small Upland catchment basin in Prince Albert National Park emitted only 0. 0087 g CH 4 m- 2 during the summer of 1992 and all of the CH 4 flux occurred during ice thaw from the beginning of May to the end of June. Methane flux may have been inhibited by sulfate-reduction activity in this site as stimulated by high sulfate levels. Wetlands which are only saturated part of the year appear to have low CH 4 fluxes associated with high sulfate-reduction activity. Field and incubation studies examined the effect of environmental factors on CH 4 fluxes. Methane emissions tended to increase as temperature increased, with the greatest increases above 12 Â°C. However, CH 4 production was still evident even at temperatures. as low as 5 Â°C. Methane fluxes were greatest when the water level was at the peat surface or above the peat. Differences in the concentration of NO 3 -, SO 42 -, and H 2 PO 4 - in interstitial water from the field showed little relationship with measured CH 4 fluxes, but the variations in the amount of these nutrients were small. Incubations of intact peat cores showed CH 4 fluxes to increase greatly with additions of CO 2 substrate, some increase with acetate additions and no significant increase with methanol additions. It appears that the microbial community can utilize CO 2 and acetate to generate more CH 4 and therefore may regularly consume these substrates in the boreal forest wetlands. The greatest increases in CH 4 flux result with temperature increases and substrate additions. l 3 C natural abundance variations were measured in soil and vegetation carbon from three contrasting environments: prairie grassland, parkland forest and boreal forest wetlands. The boreal forest wetlands include the permanently saturated Boundary and Canwood fens and a seasonally saturated Upland catchment basin. The aerobic soils generally become more l 3 C enriched with a higher degree of organic decomposition. l 3 C enrichment was greater in soils under cultivation relative to native soils, and increased with depth possibly because of a greater degree of decomposition under these conditions. In the anaerobic soil, the Upland catchment <b>basin</b> <b>peat</b> deposits had Î´ 13 CPDB values of organic carbon that were constant with depth, whereas deeper layers of the peat in the Boundary fen had areas of 13 C enrichment. The 13 C enrichment may reflect areas of intense CH 4 production in which 13 C enriched residual substrate is left behind during the production of highly 13 C depleted CH 4. Carbonates measured in boreal forest wetland soils were dominantly primary carbonates in the aerobic upland soils as indicated by 13 C values near 0 â€° and secondary in the peat (13 C depleted). Evidence of methane oxidation was shown in the Boundary fen with Î´ 13 C values as low as - 97 â€° in carbonate minerals found in floating peat mats. It is postulated that 13 C depleted CH 4 is oxidized in the mat and reacts with calcium ions to form calcite (identified through x-ray diffraction). Floating peat mats appear to be zones of CH 4 oxidation which lower the CH 4 flux from these areas. Secondary carbonates in the peat of the Upland catchment basin have isotope compositions close to the Î´ 13 C values of the peat organic carbon (- 25 â€°), indicating their origin is from fermentation and possibly from sulfate-reduction...|$|E

The materials from the Philippi <b>peat</b> <b>basin</b> were found to be part of three tephra layers that are widespread in the area of study. The materials from the Myrtöön basin were composed of glass shards, vesicular pumice shards, and mineral fragments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The lithofacies of Baratafia Basin, an interlobe {{basin of}} the Mississippi Delta Plain, were {{established}} from analyses of 115 boreholes. Five organic lithofacies are distinguished by organic matter content, botanical origin {{and degree of}} decomposition. Organic-rich facies accumulated in three stages (A, B, and C) during two depositional events. Stage A developed locally, but stages B and C developed as blankets over abandoned delta lobes, protected from marine influx by a shoreline. Stage B lasted from 2, 300 - 1, 000 yr aP and ended when clastic sediments from renewed deltaic sedimentation blanketed the <b>peats,</b> expanding the <b>basin</b> about 50 km seaward. Peat accumulation of stage C lasted from 900 yr aP to the present and is currently being terminated by subsidence-induced transgression. High-quality stage B peats accumulated beneath erbaceous, freshwater-floating and emergent marshes, mainly above the footwall of a strike-oriented, reactivated growth fault. Above the footwall, the basin was shallower than on the hanging wall, where the deeper basin invited more overbank sedimentation, which increased ash content and diluted peats. Thus, both tectonic and sedimentary factors influenced organic facies. The {{quality and quantity of}} Barataria <b>Basin</b> <b>peats</b> differ from those of many deltaic coals. However, these peats accumulated in only 2, 300 yr immediately after a rapid sea-level rise. Frequent delta-lobe switching increased organic matter preservation potential but did not provide sufficient ime for the accumulation of thick, low ash peats. The geometries of organic and elastic facies {{are similar to those of}} some coal-beating strata...|$|R

40|$|In {{headwater}} peatlands, saturation-excess {{overland flow}} is a dominant source of river discharge. Human modifications to headwater peatlands result in vegetation cover change {{but there is}} a lack of understanding about how the spatial distribution of such change impacts flood peaks. A fully distributed version of TOPMODEL with an overland flow velocity module was used to simulate flood response for three upland <b>peat</b> <b>basins.</b> Bare <b>peat</b> strips adjacent to channels resulted in a higher and faster flow peak; for a 20 mm/hr rainfall event, with bare riparian zones covering 10 % of the basin area, peaks were increased, compared to the current hydrograph, by 12. 8 %, 1. 8 % and 19. 6 % in the three basins. High density Sphagnum ground cover over the same riparian zones reduced flow peaks (e. g. by 10. 1 %, 1. 8 % and 13. 4 % for the 20 mm hr- 1 event) compared to the current hydrograph. With similar total areas of land-cover change, the size of randomly located patches of changed cover had no effect on peak flow for patch sizes up to 40000 m 2. However, cover changes on gentle slope areas generally resulted in a larger change in peak flow when compared with the same changes on steeper slopes. Considering all results for the same proportion of catchment area that undergoes change, land-cover change along narrow riparian buffer strips had the highest impact on river flow. Thus, the protection and revegetation of damaged riparian areas in upland peat catchments may be highly beneficial for flood management...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the importance of}} palynological site selection criteria, speci"cally basin size, {{for the detection of}} vegetation mosaics and small- or local-scale human activity within a spatially diverse, mosaic landscape. Using a site selection strategy which recognizes landscape patchiness, pollen analyses from three small <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> (10 - 56 m diameter) in an open, exposed upland valley (greater than 250 m OD) provide records which are sensitive to local vegetation mosaics and small-scale, localized agriculture. The results indicate c. 4000 14 C years (4400 cal. years) of land use, with spatial and temporal variations in the valley. Contrasts between the sequences suggest that local pollen production remains {{an important component of the}} pollen rain deposited in small <b>peat</b> <b>basins,</b> even in open environments; this is especially true of palynological‘agricultural indicators'. By comparison, sites with regional pollen source areas underestimate the spatial diversity of the upland landscape, and are insensitive to small-scale human activity in an environment where the fragmentary distribution of soils suitable for agriculture favoured a small-scale, dispersed pattern of farming. It is therefore essential to match the spatial resolution of pollen records with the grain size or scale of variations in the environment under investigation in order to sense the scale of mosaics in vegetation and agriculture within patchy landscapes...|$|R

Numerous anthropogenic landforms were formed, including embankments, dams, dykes along the canals, ditches and canals, reservoirs <b>basins,</b> and <b>peat</b> excavations. The drainage resulted in an intensification of the river erosion, straightening, shortening and increase of the river gradient, as well as the increase of quantity of the suspended matter leaving the catchments.

40|$|Tropical lowland <b>peat</b> <b>basin</b> was {{characterized}} prior to stabilization tests which used the cement-filler-air curing technique. Topogenic, clayey, high-ash, shallow peats (with more naturally occurring in-situ mineral soil filler content) at the basin periphery have higher stabilized strength {{compared to the}} deeper, intermediate topogenic to ombrogenic, low-ash peats at the mid-section area (near location KS. TP. 08). Nearly all the stabilized cement-filler-peat mix specimens with added mineral soil (silt, clay and fine sands) fillers tested, exhibited brittle or shear failures with no barrelling failure. Stabilized peat specimens from topogenic, marginal, transitional mangrove to shallow peat areas (location KS. TP. 0 and KS. TP. 02) also exhibited dominantly shear/brittle failures, relatively better, uniform and consistant cylindrical shape, with less deformation, are denser and harder, has lesser cracks, less holes, less indentations or lesser joints/discontinuities at the tamped layer planes. Cement-peat stabilization strength may probably depend highly {{on the amount of}} natural/insitu or added mineral soil filler contained within the peat. Strength enhancement by improved densification of the stabilized peat-cement-mineral soil filler mix can be achieved by supplying increasingly more solid particles in the form of mineral soil fillers content. This study indicates that stabilized strength is at the maximum near the dome/basin margin/periphery, decreases at mid-section and increases back again towards <b>basin</b> centre. Stabilized <b>peat</b> strength may be related to basinal lateral vegetation succession. Field identification and von Post classification of the tropical lowland peat shows that there is a lateral variation of peat humification levels and range, corresponding to fibric, fibric to hemic, sapric and hemic to sapric peats, occurring progressively, from margin towards the near-centre of the tropical lowland <b>peat</b> dome or <b>basin.</b> Variations of dominant peat maceral types observed in this study are probably associated with different levels of diagenesis in the humification or peatification process of the tropical iv lowland peats. Source Rock Analyses (compatible Rock-Eval) results show that there is a lateral variation of organic matter types occurring within the top 0 to 0. 5 metres peat layer. The hopanes are the dominant pentacyclic triterpanes in the peat alkane fractions sampled from basin periphery to mid section and further towards the near centre of a tropical lowland <b>peat</b> <b>basin</b> (at 0 to 0. 5 m depth). The biomarker hopane compounds have 13 to 39 carbons and all show odd over even predominance indicating the true terrestrial depositional environment of the peats. The ββ hopanes biomarkers that indicate immaturity and are commonly present in the peats includes ββ C 30 hopane (17 β, 21 β (H) -Hopane) and ββ C 31 hopane (17 β, 21 β (H) -Homohopane. The other common hopanes present are C 29 hopane (Norhopane), 22 Sαβ C 31 hopane (17 α, 21 β (H) -Homohopane) and 22 Rαβ C 31 hopane (17 α, 21 β (H) -Homohopane). Logging observations indicate a vertical, downwards, general decrease of peat humification levels with depth. Based on pollen analyses and field observations, the studied peat profiles can be interpreted as part of a progradational deltaic succession. Continued regression of sea levels, gave rise to the development of peat in a transitional mangrove to floodplain/floodbasin environment, followed by a shallow, topogenic peat depositional environment with riparian influence at approximately 2420 ± 30 years (B.

[...] More recent analysis of the fossil flora, however reconstructs for the Princeton Chert flora a moist warm temperate climate with mean annual temperature 13.1 ± 3.1 °C, with mild winters (cold month mean temperature 5.3 ± 2.8 °C), and mean annual precipitation 114 ± 42 cm per year. Several of the smaller chert layers are separated by volcanic ash layers, indicating nearby volcanic activity. It is thought that fossils were pervaded with silicic acid due to this volcanic activity. Subsequently, water charged with minerals flowed from springs or geysers into the low lying basin where the Princeton chert was located. Here, the water surrounded organisms as they grew, along with plant debris which had been accumulated. Many organisms were preserved in situ, in the lake or small pond {{environment in which they}} lived.

30|$|The lignite samples {{collected}} from Giral lignite field of Barmer basin {{have been subjected}} to petrological investigation. The data generated has been discussed to understand the evolution of the paleomires of these lignites. The present study reveals that these low rank C coals are chiefly composed of huminite group macerals, mainly telohuminite and detrohuminite, while liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in subordinate amounts. Not much variation in the maceral composition from Seam-I to Seam-VIII has been observed. Barmer lignites are characterized by a very high GI (> 10) and moderate TPI indicating topogenous mire in the basin which was permanently flooded. The GI and TPI values and the petrography-based facies critical models indicate that these lignites originated mostly under wet forest swamp to clastic marsh having telmatic to limno-telmatic conditions with a moderate rate of subsidence and a very slow fall in ground water table. Further, the GWI and VI values are suggestive of mesotrophic to rheotrophic hydrological conditions having the dominance of herbaceous to marginal aquatic vegetation. There were spells of periodic drowning of peat especially during the formation of Seam-VII. Moderately high concentration of calcium in these lignites along with the presence of framboidal pyrite indicate enhanced sulphate-reducing bacterial activity present in carbonate and sulphate-rich waters in the <b>basin</b> during <b>peat</b> formation.|$|R

As a consequence, Sphagnum reintroduced within restored areas may be subjected to extended periods of flooding, particularly following snow melt or heavy rainfall. This paper examines two aspects {{of the effect of}} flooding on growth and development of Sphagnum: (1) the production of innovations (growth buds and shoots) and capitula from plant fragments (six species) under continuous, intermittent or non-flooding conditions, and (2) the growth response of whole plants (10 species) under long-term continuous shallow flooding. The development response of Sphagnum fragments to short-term continuous (8 – 10 cm), inter-mittent (− 1 to + 1 cm) or non-flooding conditions (− 3 to 0 cm), was investigated in growth cham-bers. Environmental parameters were selected to investigate the possible differential effects of early spring flooding (10 : 7 ◦C, day:night), or inundation following heavy rainfall events later in the season (20 – 25 : 20 ◦C, day:night).

The river proper rises from a lake called Jezioro Czarne and flows in a south and south-eastern direction through a series of nine postglacial lakes: Rospuda Filipowska, Kamienne, Długie, Garbas, Głębokie, Sumowo, Okrągłe, Bolesty, and The Rospuda Augustowska into which it finally empties. The Rospuda flows through typical young glacial landforms: postglacial channel lakes, eskers (long, narrow, winding ridges composed of stratified sand and gravel), and flat outwash plains. This landscape results from Scandinavian ice sheet activity during the Baltic glaciation: the postglacial channel in which the Rospuda flows was dug by a stream flowing underneath the ice sheet; eskers were composed of material accumulated by flowing water, and the outwash is a vast alluvial cone of sand and gravel deposited by a subglacial meltwater stream. In {{the upper reaches of the}} river, in the stretches between lakes, the Rospuda has a narrow winding channel of a rocky bed with rapids, for which it slightly resembles a mountain stream. The Rospuda flows through forests and meadows, within a narrow steep-sided valley with numerous bends, gorges, and felled trees. Narrow postglacial channel lakes flow for miles: Rospuda Filipowska and Bolesty, the longest two, are 3.6 mi long and only 0.25 - 0.5 mi wide. Their banks are high and forested or covered in meadows and cut across with ravines. These interesting landforms are attributable to erosion, the outcome of flowing rainwaters. In the lower reaches of the river, where it enters Augustów Primeval Forest, the Rospuda changes into a typically lowland river. It meanders through reeds within a boggy riparian valley, passing Święte Miejsce and Młyńsko, sacred sites in the region. The channel of the river gets wider forming a <b>basin</b> of <b>peat</b> bog, i.e. the Rospuda Valley (Pol. Dolina Rospudy).|$|R

Attention focused on upland sites by Loch Doon and Loch Dee. Upland areas by Clatteringshaws Loch and a site at Palnure near the coast provided a late and relatively incomplete record respectively. Two cores were collected at each of Loch Doon and Loch Dee to enable comparison of microfossil stratigraphies. At Loch Doon several cores were analysed across the rise in Alnus. Preliminary counts were made from a core from Loch Doon itself. Radiocarbon dating gave additional confidence to the chronological framework. The availability of comparable pollen data enabled some distinction between local and more regional vegetational events. The charcoal profiles were more problematical to interpret, but the contrast between a very low level of charcoal prior to a rise in the early postglacial (Fl I) at both Loch Doon and Loch Dee may prove to be of regional significance. The strongest evidence for local Mesolithic disturbance came from Loch Dee. The results from the small-basin sites were contrasted with those previously recorded from larger mires and loch sediments...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to (1) summarize the natural and human history of Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s peatlands, (2) compare peatland frequency and distribution to surface physiography, (3) investigate effects of basin morphometry on peatland formation, (4) reconstruct the development of Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s peatlands using subfossils, and (5) characterize the vegetation of Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s peatlands along environmental and temporal gradients. Historic accounts of nearly 100 peatlands indicate that the previous abundance of bogs and fens in Indiana had a significant effect on agriculture and industry. Characteristic soils show over 62, 000 ha of peatland in Indiana. The highest concentrations are within the former boundaries of the stagnant Saginaw Lobe of Wisconsin glaciation (ca. 15, 000 yrs. BP). Within this area, peatlands were significantly more frequent in mixed drift resulting from collapse of sub-ice tunnels and open ice-walled channels. Peatlands were significantly less frequent in morainal topography and loam till of Trafalfgar formation, sand and gravel deposits in outwash fans, and ice-contact sand and gravel ridges. The most significant morphometric qualities of individual <b>basins</b> favoring <b>peat</b> formation were small surface area and protection from wave erosion. The mean surface area of non-peat-forming basins was significantly larger. Maximum, mean, and relative depth, volume, and shoreline development were variable among peatland basins. Acid-forming, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands had smaller watersheds and deeper clay and silt hardpans than strongly minerotrophic fens. Coring and macrofossil analysis of ten non-riparian peatlands showed that all began as mesotrophic or eutrophic lakes, developed into marshes characterized by emergent vegetation (Nuphar, Nymphaea, and Brasenia), and the moss Drepanocladus aduncus (submergent form). Ninety percent of the basins developed a fen mat characterized by the mosses Calliergon trifarium and Meesia triquetra. While some basins became forested immediately after the fen stage, many became Sphagnum-dominated leatherleaf bogs and produced up to 4. 5 m of Sphagnum peat. The flora of leatherleaf bogs exhibits a mixed geographic affinity characteristic to the southern Great Lakes region. Peatland plant assemblages in southern Michigan and Indiana are different from those in northern Michigan, Ohio, and the northeast. Regardless of their trophic origins, all Indiana peatlands senesce into lowland forests dominated by Acer rubrum. ...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePrevious {{research}} {{acknowledges the}} ancient and complex land-use history of European mountainous areas, which are characterised by a remarkable regional variability {{in terms of}} human practices and patterns of occupation during the Holocene. However, the combined palaeoenvironmental and archaeological study of highland human management at a micro-regional scale remains a largely unexplored research field, especially in the Pyrenees. A combined pollen, stomata, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) and macrocharcoal studywas carried out at three nearby alpine and subalpine <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> from a relatively small territory (ca. 1700 ha) at the Madriu valley (Andorra, eastern Pyrenees), following a fine spatialresolution strategy. The purpose was to test the suitability of high altitudinal palaeoecological sequences when reconstructing past small-scale land-use variability. The palaeoecological results of those peat records are compared and further integrated with archaeological local data, and together underline the marked complexity of high mountain land-use system over the Holocene period. Main phases of microregional land-use and landscape variability can be distinguished from the middle Neolithic to the early Bronze Age and from the Roman Period to the Modern Era. Conversely, several phases of homogeneous landscape management are distinguishable during the early Neolithic, and from the late Bronze to the late Iron Age. Results drawn from this study show that landscape variability is not necessarily connected to topographic or climatic parameters, and underline the role of social, economical and cultural parameters in the land-use organisation and the landscape shaping of high mountain spaces since Prehistory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} spatial and {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} macroscopic charcoal record in 11 forested <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> in a boreal forest landscape in southeast Norway. The areas of the basins ranged from 200 to 6400 m 2 and our study is based on 247 peat sequences that were sampled from randomly selected positions. In total we found 1228 charcoal layers in these peat sequences, which altogether had a length of 551 m. The number of charcoal layers per sequence ranged from 0 to 31 and {{the average number of}} charcoal layers per sequence was 3. 99 / 0. 3 SE, giving a mean fire frequency of one per 475 years. The average charcoal layer contained 170 charcoal particles / 0. 28 mm per 10 cm 2, of which 30 were / 1 mm. Peat sequences that totally lacked macroscopic charcoal were found at all sites. Nonetheless, all sites have burned recurrently during the Holocene, since at least one sequence from each site had seven or more charcoal layers. Neither the number of layers nor particle size decreased with increasing distance to the surrounding forests, indicating an in situ charcoal production and deposition. The charcoal record was characterized by a striking spatial variability. Geostatistical analyses revealed a strong spatial structuring on fine scales, ie, c. 0. 251. 5 m, but there was no evidence for spatial structuring at between-site scales, demonstrating that the sites have idiosyncratic fire histories. The rate of charcoal deposition was greater for the period prior to establishment of Picea abies than for the post-establishment period...|$|R
40|$|The large <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> of North America are an {{important}} reservoir in the global carbon cycle and {{a significant source of}} atmospheric methane. The authors investigated carbon cycling in the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands (GLAP) of Minnesota. Initially in 1990, they identified a dramatic change in the concentration of methane in the pore-waters of the raised bogs in the GLAP during an extreme drought. This methane dissipated when the drought broke in 1991 and the occurrence of deep methane is related to changes in the direction of groundwater flow in the peat column. The production of methane and its diffusive loss to the atmosphere was modeled and was about 10 times less than that measured directly in chambers at the land surface. It is clear from the reversals in hydraulic heat, changes in pore-water chemical composition over time, and paleostratigraphic markers, that regional ground water flow systems that are controlled by climate change are unexpectedly a major control over methanogenesis and carbon cycling in GLAP. Seismic profiles made showed that buried bedrock ridges particularly deflect regional groundwater flow upwards towards the land surface and towards raised bog landforms. In addition, high-resolution GPS measurements from data stations funded by this DOE project have shown this year that the peakland land surface elevation changes daily on a scale of cms, and seasonally on a scale of 10 s of cm. This most recent observation is exciting because it may reflect episodic degassing of free phase methane from the peat column to the atmosphere, a source for methane previously unaccounted for by methane researchers...|$|R

The record runs from the Lower Pleistocene (ca. 1 Ma B. P.) to the mid-Holocene (ca. 4. 5 ka B. P.) with, in general, little diagenesis (removal of components). Two markedly different hydrogeological scenarios were interpreted: (1) From ca. 1 Ma to ca. 400 ka B. P. run-off recharge was significant and water depths were greater (lacustrine scenario). From ca. 400 to 4. 5 ka B. P., the Padul <b>Basin</b> became a <b>peat</b> bog s. s. with the major water input coming from groundwater inflow. From ca. 400 to ca. 180 ka B. P. alternating episodes with either predominant grasses, trees or aquatic macrophytes which were linked to wet/dry phases, took place. An important deglaciation episode has been interpreted to occur between ca. 180 and 170 ka B. P. The global climatic changes occurring from ca. 170 to 25 ka B. P. were not recorded in the proxies, though they do show important variations linked to the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of}} the Holocene (ca. 25 - 10 ka B. P.) : (2) Cold phases coexisting with dry periods produced the recession of forests and the development of grasses. After these periods, as both temperature and precipitation increased, forests expanded and the water level, linked to thaw, rose, especially at ca. 20 ka B. P. Few changes occurred during the Holocene, although there were short alternations between wet and dry episodes. Overall, the techniques applied proved to be excellent palaeoenvironmental proxies for studvina the basin's palaeoclimatological and palaeohydrological evolution...|$|R
40|$|The Goukou Wetland is a 700 ha unchannelled {{valley bottom}} wetland {{near the town}} of Riversdale in the Western Cape of South Africa. The wetland is {{approximately}} 16 km long and between 200 and 800 m wide, with peat deposits up to 8 m deep that get progressively shallower downstream. The Goukou Wetland {{is one of the last}} remaining intact peatlands of significant size in the Western Cape. However, there is increasing human pressure on these peat wetlands, where the dominant plant is palmiet (Prionium serratum), which is endemic to the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa. Palmiet is viewed as a problem plant by farmers as it is believed to block waterways and promote inundation of arable land and infrastructure. Many landowners therefore actively remove palmiet from peatlands, threatening the integrity of these wetlands. Although the hydrogeomorphic origin of large, non-peat floodplain and valley bottom wetlands has been investigated in South Africa, unchannelled valley-bottom wetlands with deep peat accumulations are rare features and have not been well studied. The hydrogeomorphic factors leading to peat accumulation have been documented elsewhere in Southern Africa, where aggradation due to sedimentation along trunk streams may block a tributary stream, elevating the local base level of the tributary, creating the accommodation space for organic sedimentation. Alternatively, sedimentation along a trunk stream at the toe of a tributary stream may similarly block a trunk stream, promoting organic sedimentation along the trunk stream upstream of the tributary. This pattern of peat accumulation is associated with declining peat thickness upstream of the blocked valley. In the case of the Goukou Wetland, however, peat depth and organic content was found to increase consistently upstream from the toe to the head of the wetland. The Goukou Wetland was graded along its length, with gradient increasing consistently upstream in response to longitudinal variation in discharge. There was no clear relationship between peat formation and tributary streams blocking the wetland. Instead, the distribution of peat and the extent of the wetland appeared to be controlled by the plant palmiet, whose clonal nature and robust root, rhizome and stem system allowed it to grow from channel banks and islands into fast-flowing river channels, slowing river flows and ultimately blocking the channel. The promotion of diffuse flows within the dense, monospecific stands of palmiet creates conditions conducive to water retention and peat accumulation. By growing across the full width of the valley floor, the plant is able to constrict the stream, trapping sediment and slowing flows such that the fluvial environment is changed from a fast flowing stream to one with slow, diffuse flow. These processes appear to lead to the formation of organic sediment, accumulating to form a deep <b>peat</b> <b>basin.</b> The sustained input of water from the folded and fractured quartzite lithologies of the Cape Supergroup that make up the Langeberg Mountains, which provide the bulk of the water supply to the wetland, is also important in promoting permanent flooding in the wetland. A feature that characterized the wetland was the fact that bedrock across the valley beneath the peat deposits exhibited a remarkably uniform elevation. This suggests that over long periods of time (tens to hundreds of thousands of years), bedrock has been laterally planed across the valley floor. It is proposed that valley widening associated with lateral planning of Uitenhage Formation rocks has taken place during periods of episodic very high flows. During these episodes, erosion cuts into the peat wetland and valley sides, cutting to bedrock and planing the valley floor to a uniform elevation for a given distance from the head of the wetland. Periods of episodic degradation are followed by periods of renewed peat accumulation associated with palmiet establishment, such that the wetland valley is shaped by repeated cycles of cutting and filling. Palmiet can be considered an “ecosystem engineer” that is integral to the formation of these deep <b>peat</b> <b>basins.</b> Removal of palmiet from these systems is likely to have negative consequences for the wetland and its functions in that water storage will be reduced, erosion will increase dramatically, and the water-purification function of the wetlands will be lost. Management of these wetlands, which are close to the geomorphic threshold slopes for their size, is therefore essential if they are to be preserved for the benefit of human well-being...|$|R
40|$|Small <b>peat</b> <b>basins</b> (c. 10 - 50 m diameter) {{were used}} to obtain fine spatial {{resolution}} pollen-stratigraphic records of Holocene vegetation and land-use history in upland West Glen Affric and adjacent lowland Kintail, north-western Scottish Highlands. These data provide evidence for remarkably diverse and dynamic early to mid-Holocene vegetational mosaic and sustained later Holocene upland land-use. While acidophilous Pinus sylvestris-Betula-Calluna vulgaris communities on lower hillslopes appear comparable with {{other areas of the}} Highlands, data from floodplain and alluvial fan sediments in West Affric indicate a greater woodland diversity. Betula-dominated alluvial woods included a species-rich mix of arboreal, fen, tall-herb and ruderal herbaceous taxa, with Pinus forming small populations, confined to marginal soils. Ulmus was {{an important component of the}} lowland Betula-Alnus woods. Spatial differences in soil forming processes, particularly nutrient and base status, played a primary role in determining community composition, structure, dynamics, species diversity and stability. Inferred climatic shifts during the mid-Holocene, initially to drier, more continental conditions, followed by increased oceanicity, are suggested to have made woodland communities increasingly vulnerable to low intensity grazing disturbance and anthropogenic interference during the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age. These stresses resulted in widespread woodland decline, including that of Pinus, with the spread of blanket peat and heath on poorer hillside soils, and grassland communities on alluvial sediment. Bronze Age agricultural expansion is followed by several phases of expansion and/or intensification, with sustained pastoral and arable activity in the lowlands and on small 'islands' of richer soils in the uplands. There is little evidence for abandonment and the longevity of agricultural activity, particularly cultivation, above 250 m OD clearly indicates that the unqualified assumption of upland marginality is inappropriate. The implications for the interpretation of land-use in the Highlands from conventional palynological and archaeological records are discussed. The level of spatial and temporal detail regarding the palaeoecology of plant communities and adaptive land management evident in the present study is not afforded by conventional pollen analyses. This suggests that fine-spatial resolution palynology has the potential to contribute previously unrecognised information at scales which are directly applicable to ecological and human understanding and which can be more successfully integrated with neoecological and archaeological research, fostering closer collaboration between the disciplines...|$|R
40|$|Sphagnum farming (or cultivation) is {{a recent}} land {{management}} strategy in reclaimed peatlands. The goal of Sphagnum farming is to cultivate Sphagnum fibers on a cyclic basis. Sphagnum moss is non-vascular and requires high and stable moisture availability at the growing surface to reduce capillary stresses. However, specific hydrological requirements to maximize Sphagnum biomass accumulation (CO 2 uptake) are uncertain, and there is interest in evaluating the water management design (i. e. irrigation) that is best suited for effective water distribution in Sphagnum farming operations. The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the hydrological thresholds to increase Sphagnum CO 2 uptake in an experimental Sphagnum farming site, and to provide recommendations on how irrigation {{can be used to}} increase productivity and upscale the size of operations. The experimental site is in a block-cut peatland south of Shippagan, New Brunswick. From May to July 2014, six 20 x 50 m Sphagnum cultivation basins were established within the lowered trenches of the block-cut peatland, each with a different type of active water management design. The CO 2 fluxes were monitored with the closed chamber method, along with hydrological data collected from July 10 to August 14 in 2014, and May 11 to August 22 in 2015. A CO 2 and water balance were calculated for each basin for the 2015 study period. Research has demonstrated that CO 2 uptake by Sphagnum moss in post-extraction peatlands is affected by the position of the water table (WT). At this experimental site, CO 2 uptake by the moss was not limited by dry (WT - 15 to - 25 cm) or wet (WT < - 15 cm) treatments. When the mean WT was shallow (< 25 cm), the fluctuations in WT were found to be more important in limiting/increasing CO 2 uptake. Carbon dioxide uptake was highest where the range in seasonal WT position was < 15 cm. A WT position of - 10 to - 15 cm is recommended to reduce WT fluctuations and limit excess moisture at the surface. Productivity {{has the potential to be}} further improved by maintaining the daily WT fluctuations < ± 7. 5 cm from the seasonal WT mean. When these conditions were met, moss grew by a mean of 1. 8 mm/month. To maintain hydrological conditions necessary for maximum biomass accumulation, topographical features of the reclaimed peatland, such as baulks, drainage canals and adjacent trenches, are important considerations for site scale water flow. Water regulation canals are important hydrological features because they have stabilizing effects on WT levels when they are water input sources, and behave as water sinks when water tables are high in the <b>peat</b> <b>basins.</b> The majority of the water flow occurred towards the deep primary drainage canals. The baulks not adjacent to drainage canals formed water mounds, limiting water flow between the basins. An unmanaged trench that is a relic of the block-cut extraction outside but adjacent to the experimental area, was a large source of ground water input to the site. Leveling the site to a common datum and establishing buffer zones adjacent to drainage canals and adjacent un-restored trenches could reduce water transfer within the sites. Pumping water into the canals was necessary to reduce the water deficit from high ET and low P during a dry study period. The variability in WT position increased with distance from the water input feature (canals or sub-surface pipes). Increasing the irrigation density (ratio of pipe/canal length to basin area) of the water management design will assist in maintaining stable WT positions. To upscale production sites, irrigation features (canals and pipes) should be installed in ways that complement the topography of the site. Installing these features upslope, and increasing their density (maximum spacing of 12 m) will reduce pumping demands and maintain a stable WT. Post-extraction vacuum harvested sites may be better suited for Sphagnum farming than block-cut sites, as they are more accessible to machinery and less landscape manipulation is required. Future studies should evaluate the feasibility of establishing Sphagnum farming sites on post-extraction vacuum harvested peatlands...|$|R
