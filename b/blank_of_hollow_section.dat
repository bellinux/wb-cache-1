The seismic {{performance}} of the bridge piers is a basic study in seismic analysis <b>of</b> bridges. <b>Hollow</b> <b>section</b> piers have high bending strength and stiffness, as well as reduced amount of reinforced concrete needed and thus good economic returns, which have been widely applied in the high-pier, large-span bridges in high-intensity area of western China. Current study status and future development trends about the seismic behavior <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> reinforced concrete piers were presented. The necessity of carrying out seismic performance studies <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> reinforced concrete bridge piers was also pointed out. 1 Summary of the application of hollow-section bridge piers In recent decades significant improvement has been achieved {{in the construction of}} bridges with the rapid development of economy, technology and industry in China. Current development directions of bridge engineering are large span, heavy load and high speed limit [1]. A large number of high-pier, large-span bridges have been constructed in the mountain areas of western China, the surface of deep sea, intercity rail and highways, as shown in Table 1. Rigid frame bridge piers with continuous spans are mostly in the form <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> piers because the <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> piers have large flexural strength and stiffness while greatly reducing th...|$|R
40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{has been}} {{generally}} accepted by civil engineers {{as an alternative}} for steel reinforcing bars (rebar) due to its advantageous specific tensile strength and non-corrosiveness. Even though some {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) rebars are available on a market, GFRP is still somewhat uncompetitive over steel rebar due to their high cost and relatively low elastic modulus, and brittle failure characteristic. If the price of component materials of GFRP rebar is not reduced, it would be another solution to increase the performance of each material to the highest degree. The tensile strength generally decreases with increasing diameter of FRP rebar. One of the reasons is that only fibers except for fibers in center resist the external force {{due to the lack of}} force transfer and the deformation of only outer fibers by gripping system. Eliminating fibers in the center, which do not play an aimed role fully, are helpful to reduce the price and finally FRP rebar would be optimized over the price. In this study, the effect <b>of</b> the <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> in a cross-section of a GFRP rebar was investigated. A GFRP rebar with 19 mm diameter was selected and an analysis was performed for the tensile test results. Parameter was the ratio <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> over solid cross-section.

It is established that as a typical structural component a <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> distinguishes itself from its solid counterpart with two characteristic features of the response. First, a considerably larger kinetic energy is generated in the <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> beam as the impulsive load is imparted on the upper flange of the beam having a significantly lower mass than the member. Second, a considerable proportion of the blast energy can be absorbed by the local collapse of the section. A two-phase analytical model is proposed.

The design models for these limit states in general are derived from tests. The ultimate limit {{state of the structure}} in general is attained when in these load or deformation controlled tests the maximum of the load deformation curve is reached. An important analysis method for determining the resistance of frames is the plastic hinge method basing on the plastic resistance of hinges and the rotation capacity on the plateau of these resistances. For <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> so far sufficient test data and behaviour models for plastic resistance and rotation capacity to permit the application of plastic hinge methods were not yet available. The objective of this work is therefore to carry out such tests to obtain the moment-rotation-curves <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> beams, to explain the behaviour with theoretical models and to draw conclusions for the resistance and rotation capacity <b>of</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>sections</b> in dependence <b>of</b> the geometry, the steel grade and the production method.

For rotation capacity that must be greater than the rotation requirement when the plastic hinge method shall be used the planning, execution and evaluation of tests is first described. The influence of the production method being either hot- or cold-rolling on the moment-rotation-behaviour has been clarified.

40|$|Recently, water-assisted {{injection}} molding was {{employed in the}} automobile industry to manufacture three-dimensional hollow tube-type products with functionalities. However, process optimization is difficult {{in the case of}} water-assisted {{injection molding}} because of the various rheological interactions between the injected water and the polymer. In this study, the boiling phenomenon that occurs because of the high melt temperature when injecting water and the molding characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> during the water-assisted injection process were analyzed by a water-assisted injection molding analysis. In addition, the changes in the residual wall thickness accompanying changes in the process conditions were compared with the analysis results by considering water-assisted injection molding based on gas-assisted injection molding. Furthermore, by comparing the cooling characteristics and inner wall surface qualities corresponding to the formation <b>of</b> the <b>hollow</b> <b>section</b> by gas and water injections, a water-assisted injection molding technique was proposed for manufacturing hollow products with functionality...|$|R
