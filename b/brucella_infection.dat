In the present study, we examined the effects of <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection</b> on human peripheral monocytes and monocyte-derived polarized macrophages. We showed that <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection</b> led to an increase in the proportion of CD 14 ++CD 16 − monocytes and the expression of the autophagy-related protein LC 3 B, and the effects of Brucella-induced monocytes are inhibited after 6 [*]weeks of antibiotic treatment. Additionally, the production of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10, and TNF-α from monocytes in patients with brucellosis was suppressed through the LC 3 -dependent autophagy pathway during <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection.</b> Moreover, <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection</b> inhibited macrophage polarization. Consistently, the addition of 3 -MA, an inhibitor of LC 3 -related autophagy, partially restored macrophage polarization. Intriguingly, we also found that the upregulation of LC 3 B expression by rapamycin and heat-killed Brucella in vitro inhibits M 2 macrophage polarization, which can be reversed partially by 3 -MA. Taken together, these findings reveal that Brucella dysregulates monocyte and macrophage polarization through LC 3 -dependent autophagy. Thus, targeting this pathway may lead to the development of new therapeutics against Brucellosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Brucellosis {{may cause}} serious infections in healthy {{individuals}} living {{in countries that}} are endemic for the infection. However, reports of <b>brucella</b> <b>infections</b> in immunocompromised hosts are relatively rare. Case Presentations Reported here are two patients with acute leukemia who developed Brucella melitensis bacteremia during their follow up at the Armed Forces Hospital in Riyadh. The first patient developed B. melitensis bacteremia during the transformation of his myelodysplasia into acute myeloid leukemia. The second patient developed B. melitensis bacteremia while his acute lymphoblastic leukemia was under control. Interestingly, he presented with acute cholecystitis during the brucella sepsis. Both <b>brucella</b> <b>infections</b> were associated with a marked reduction in the hematological parameters {{in addition to other}} complications. The bacteremic episodes were successfully treated with netilmicin, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. Conclusion Brucellosis can cause systemic infections, complicated bacteremia and serious morbidity in patients with acute leukemia living in endemic areas. These infections may occur at the presentation of the leukemia or even when the leukemia is in remission. Nevertheless, the early diagnosis of brucellosis and the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for sufficient duration usually improves the outcome in these immunocompromised patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|In China, {{brucellosis}} is an {{endemic disease}} typically caused by <b>Brucella</b> melitensis <b>infection</b> (biovars 1 and 3). <b>Brucella</b> canis <b>infection</b> in dogs has not traditionally {{recognized as a}} major problem.

First, we employed a 16 -marker VNTR assay (Brucella MLVA- 16) to assess the diversity and epidemiological relationship of 29 Brucella canis isolates from diverse locations throughout China with 38 isolates from other countries. MLVA- 16 analysis separated the 67 Brucella canis isolates into 57 genotypes that grouped into five clusters with genetic similarity coefficients ranging from 67. 73 to 100 %.

40|$|During {{the complex}} {{interaction}} between an infectious agent {{and a host}} organism, the pathogen can interfere with the host cell's programmed death to its own benefit. Induction or prevention of host cell apoptosis {{appears to be a}} critical step for determining the infection outcome. Members of the gram-negative bacterial genus Brucella are intracellular pathogens which preferentially invade monocytic cells and develop within these cells. We investigated the effect of Brucella suis infection on apoptosis of human monocytic phagocytes. The present study provides evidence that <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection</b> inhibited spontaneously occurring apoptosis in human monocytes. Prevention of monocyte apoptosis was not mediated by Brucella lipopolysaccharide and required bacterial survival within infected cells. Both invaded and noninvaded cells were protected, indicating that soluble mediators released during infection were involved in the phenomenon. Analysis of Brucella-infected monocytes revealed specific overexpression of the A 1 gene, a member of the bcl- 2 family implicated in the survival of hematopoietic cells. <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection</b> also rendered macrophage-like cells resistant to Fas ligand- or gamma interferon-induced apoptosis, suggesting that <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection</b> protected host cells from several cytotoxic processes occurring at different steps of the immune response.

A total of 897 serum samples were randomly collected from 55 farms along with animal level data such as sex, age and parity. Sera were screened for presence of anti-Brucella antibodies using Rose Bengal Test (RBT) and positive samples were confirmed using competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). At animal level, seroprevalence was estimated at 7. 9 % (95 % CI: 4. 4 - 11. 4 %) in the Lusaka province and 18. 7 % (95 % CI: 7. 5 - 29. 9 %) for Chibombo district. Brucellosis seroprevalence varied according to district, with Chongwe district recording the highest compared to other districts. Seroprevalence also varied according to sex with bulls (n = 96) having higher seroprevalence (12. 5 %; 95 % CI: 3. 8 - 21. 1 %) compared to females (8. 1 %; 95 % CI: 4. 6 - 11. 6). Similarly, seroprevalence varied according to age groups, with the age category 1 - 4 years recording the highest (10. 7 %).

Although {{recent studies have}} demonstrated that Brucella spp. replicate within an intracellular compartment that contains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins, the molecular mechanisms by which the pathogen secures this replicative niche remain obscure. Here, we address this issue by exploiting Drosophila S 2 cells and RNA interference (RNAi) technology to develop a genetically tractable system that recapitulates critical aspects of mammalian cell infection. After validating this system by demonstrating a shared requirement for phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) activities in supporting <b>Brucella</b> <b>infection</b> in both host cell systems, we performed an RNAi screen of 240 genes, including 110 ER-associated genes, for molecules that mediate bacterial interactions with the ER.

40|$|Brucella is an {{intracellular}} zoonotic pathogen {{that causes}} animal and human brucellosis worldwide. As natural hosts, Brucella infects various animal species including cows, goats, and pigs, causing abortion and birth of weak offspring. Humans are infected as incidental hosts, causing a febrile disease known as Malta fever that can develop into chronic infections with more severe {{symptoms such as}} endocarditis or meningitis. Therefore, brucellosis is a significant threat {{to the economy and}} general health in endemic areas. Brucella is able to invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells and replicates in an intracellular compartment known as the Brucella-containing vacuole (BCV). Following entry into a host cell, the BCV traffics along the endocytic pathway and despite interacting with endo-lysosomal compartments, degradation in these compartments are avoided. At later stages of infection when intracellular proliferation occurs, the BCV is found in close association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite many advances in the field, the molecular mechanisms on how Brucella enters cells, avoids lysosomal degradation, and finally establishes an intracellular niche remain largely unknown. To study Brucella entry and replication in human cells, we performed a genome-wide, high-throughput microscopy-based RNA interference (RNAi) screen in HeLa cells.

A {{survey of the}} {{occurrence}} of symptoms commonly attributed to chronic brucellosis {{was carried out by}} questionnaire in four different occupational groups in Northern Ireland—veterinary surgeons working in private practice, veterinary surgeons employed by the Ministry of Agriculture, general medical practitioners, and a group of forestry workers. The veterinary surgeons generally had a higher incidence of symptoms than the other two groups. This could not be accounted for by age, heavy physical exertion or professional familiarity with disease but could be related to contact with cattle and hence to possible <b>brucella</b> <b>infection.</b> Of the symptoms investigated, sweating, weakness, malaise, irritability, depression, rheumatism, arthritis, and backache occurred significantly more often in the veterinary surgeons than in the others, with selective differences between the types of veterinary practice: the alimentary system symptoms, headache, and insomnia were more evenly distributed between all groups and their inclusion as part of the chronic brucellosis symptom complex must be seriously questioned. The lack of specificity of the symptoms, their occurrence in normal persons, and the finding of high serological brucella antibody titres in asymptomatic persons who are exposed to <b>brucella</b> <b>infection</b> emphasize the need for caution against overdiagnosis. This need is illustrated by the fact that a higher proportion of Ministry veterinary surgeons unexpectedly complain of symptoms now than five years ago.
