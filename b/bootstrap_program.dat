25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton. John Schwarz and Joel Scherk came {{to the same conclusion}} and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced Kaluza–Klein theory as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>program</b> in the dustbin of history.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of computer networks, {{there has been a}} persistent need for client systems which can boot appropriate software images, with appropriate configuration parameters, both retrieved at boot time from one or more network servers. This goal requires a client to use a set of pre-boot services, based on industry standard network protocols. Additionally, the Network <b>Bootstrap</b> <b>Program</b> (NBP) which is initially downloaded and run must be built using a client firmware layer (at the device to be bootstrapped via PXE) providing a hardware independent standardized way to interact with the surrounding network booting environment. In this case the availability and subjection to standards are a key factor required to guarantee the network boot process system interoperability.|$|E
25|$|DHCP is used {{to provide}} the {{appropriate}} client network parameters and specifically the location (IP address) of the TFTP server hosting, ready for download, the initial <b>bootstrap</b> <b>program</b> (NBP) and complementary files. To initiate a PXE bootstrap session the DHCP component of the client's PXE firmware broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet containing PXE-specific options to port 67/UDP (DHCP server port); it asks for the required network configuration and network booting parameters. The PXE-specific options identify the initiated DHCP transaction as a PXE transaction. Standard DHCP servers (non PXE enabled) {{will be able to}} answer with a regular DHCPOFFER carrying networking information (i.e. IP address) but not the PXE specific parameters. A PXE client {{will not be able to}} boot if it only receives an answer from a non PXE enabled DHCP server.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{machines}} {{accelerated the}} bootstrap process {{by allowing the}} operator to set the switches to contain one or two machine language instructions and then directly executing those instructions. Other machines allowed I/O devices to be explicitly commanded from the front panel (for example, [...] "Read-In Preset" [...] on the PDP-10 or the accessing of memory-mapped I/O devices on a PDP-11). Some machines also contained various <b>bootstrap</b> <b>programs</b> in ROM and all that was required to boot the system was to start it executing at {{the address of the}} correct ROM program.|$|R
50|$|A Volume Boot Record (VBR) (also {{known as}} a volume boot sector, a {{partition}} boot record or a partition boot sector) {{is a type of}} boot sector introduced by the IBM Personal Computer.

25|$|Over {{the next}} years, {{hundreds}} of physicists worked {{to complete the}} <b>bootstrap</b> <b>program</b> for this model, with many surprises. Veneziano himself discovered that for the scattering amplitude to describe the scattering of a particle that appears in the theory, an obvious self-consistency condition, the lightest particle must be a tachyon. Miguel Virasoro and Joel Shapiro found a different amplitude now understood {{to be that of}} closed strings, while Ziro Koba and Holger Nielsen generalized Veneziano's integral representation to multiparticle scattering. Veneziano and Sergio Fubini introduced an operator formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes that was a forerunner of world-sheet conformal theory, while Virasoro understood how to remove the poles with wrong-sign residues using a constraint on the states. Claud Lovelace calculated a loop amplitude, and noted that there is an inconsistency unless the dimension of the theory is 26. Charles Thorn, Peter Goddard and Richard Brower went on to prove that there are no wrong-sign propagating states in dimensions {{less than or equal to}} 26.|$|E
2500|$|TFTP {{has always}} been {{associated}} to network booting. One of the first attempts in this regard was the Bootstrap Loading using TFTP standard RFC 906, published in 1984, which established the 1981 published Trivial File Transfer Protocol standard RFC 783 {{to be used as}} the standard file transfer protocol for bootstrap loading. It was [...] followed shortly after by the Bootstrap Protocol standard RFC 951 (BOOTP), published in 1985, which allowed a disk-less client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a TFTP server, and the name of a Network <b>Bootstrap</b> <b>Program</b> (NBP) to be TFTP transferred, loaded into memory, and executed. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol standard RFC 2131 (DHCP) published in 1997 improved BOOTP capabilities. Finally, the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) version 2.0 was released in December 1998, and the update 2.1 was made public in September 1999 counting on TFTP as its file transfer protocol. Intel has recently decided to widely support PXE within the new UEFI specification extending the TFTP support to all EFI/UEFI environments.|$|E

40|$|Transcription {{factors can}} either {{activate}} or repress target genes by binding onto short nucleotide sequence motifs in the promoter regions of these genes. Here, we present POBO, a promoter <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>program,</b> for gene expression data. POBO {{can be used}} to detect, compare and verify predetermined transcription factor binding site motifs in the promoters of one or two clusters of co-regulated genes. The program calculates the frequencies of the motif in the input promoter sets. A bootstrap analysis detects significantly over- or underrepresented motifs. The output of the <b>program</b> presents <b>bootstrapped</b> results in picture and text formats. The program was tested with published data from transgenic WRKY 70 microarray experiments. Intriguingly, motifs recognized by the WRKY transcription factors of plant defense pathways are similarly enriched in both up- and downregulated clusters. POBO analysis suggests slightly modified hypothetical motifs that discriminate between up- and downregulated clusters. In conclusion, POBO allows easy, fast and accurate verification of putative regulatory motifs. The statistical tests implemented in POBO can be useful in eliminating false positives from the results of pattern discovery programs and increasing the reliability of true positives.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} feature {{discovery in}} fault diagnosis using bootstrap processing and genetic <b>programming.</b> <b>Bootstrap</b> {{is one of}} the powerful computer-simulated statistical techniques. It integrates classical statistics with the numerical calculations of a computer. This paper uses bootstrap to preprocess the operational data acquired from a running machine. Then, genetic programming evolves with the preprocessed data samples. The main aim is to discover an efficient tree-like structure {{on the basis of a}} group of simple initial candidate features. The best compound feature found by genetic programming can discriminate among the four kinds of commonly operating statuses of the machine. This novel approach is demonstrated by fault diagnosis of the fuel system in a diesel engine. Significance: The proposed feature discovery and analysis approach, which has been tested in a diesel engine fuel system, will significantly enhance the classification performance of fault diagnosis by combing <b>bootstrap</b> processing, genetic <b>programming,</b> and engineering knowledge...|$|R

This methodology allows the ordinal ranking of the 11 provinces of the DRC {{in terms of}} their wellbeing based upon the probability of their domination. This empirical application obviates the need to adopt a weighting scheme for the deprivation indicators or to rely on the signs of other cross-derivatives for comparison. We execute a <b>bootstrap</b> linear <b>programming</b> algorithm on seven deprivation indicators for three age groups of children derived from the DRC 2007 Standard Demographic and Health Survey.

50|$|The {{computer}} term bootstrap {{began as}} a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a hardwired program to read a <b>bootstrap</b> <b>program</b> from an input unit. The computer would then execute the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>program,</b> which caused it to read more program instructions. It became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions. As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1953.|$|E
