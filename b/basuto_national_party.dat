2500|$|A {{separate}} party {{called the}} [...] "National Party" [...] was formed. The name was initially disallowed after objections from the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> in Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania but later formalised as the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> of Australia (WA). Disaffected {{members of the}} <b>National</b> Country <b>Party</b> joined including three Members of the Legislative Assembly, Cowan, McPharlin and Matt Stephens, and one Member of the Legislative Council, Thomas McNeil. The <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> operated as an independent force whilst the <b>National</b> Country <b>Party</b> remained in the Coalition. The two parties worked {{independently of one another}} whilst quietly (and occasionally, publicly) feuding. In the 1980 state election the <b>National</b> Country <b>Party</b> maintained the Coalition whilst the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> agreed with the Labor Party not to contest each other's seats and Cowan publicly stated his party was willing to support a Labor minority government if it had the largest number of seats. The election saw each party return its three sitting MLAs, with the Coalition retaining power. On 12 May 1982, McPharlin resigned from the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> and rejoined the <b>National</b> Country <b>Party.</b>|$|R

50|$|After the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> of J.B.M.

F. Malan. Malan, Strijdom and their followers distrusted Smuts and opposed his pro-British policy. Most of the <b>National</b> <b>Party's</b> MPs stayed with Hertzog, and as Strijdom was loyal to Malan, he was the only MP from Transvaal to support Malan's ideals.|$|R
50|$|In 1917, the Labor Party split over conscription, and Coneybeer {{followed}} Vaughan and Verran {{into the}} new <b>National</b> <b>Party.</b> The Vaughan government soon fell, and the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> immediately entered into a coalition government with their former rivals, the Liberal Union, with the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> as junior partner. Coneybeer remained Speaker throughout, only losing office when lost his seat in 1921, as the coalition split and the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> was resoundingly defeated statewide. The Liberal and <b>National</b> <b>parties</b> merged to form the Liberal Federation in 1923, and Coneybeer was elected to his old seat as a Liberal at the 1924 election. He was re-elected in 1927, but lost his seat to a Labor candidate in 1930.|$|R

50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Nacional) of Chile, {{also known}} as the Montt-Varist Party (Partido Monttvarista) was a Chilean {{political}} party formed in 1857 as a split from the Conservatives by the supporters of President Manuel Montt and Interior Minister Antonio Varas. The <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> had a liberal ideology and was primarily supported by businessmen and bankers, particularly the influential Edwards family.
