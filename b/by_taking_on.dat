5|$|The game also {{received}} an international demo titled Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The idea behind Episode Duscae {{was to give}} players a personal look at the game due to its long absence from the public eye, as well as demonstrate its gameplay {{and the fact that}} it was being actively developed. It was named after one of the regions in the game. The demo is set during the opening segment of XV, where the party temporarily lose their car and must gather funds for its repair <b>by</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> jobs in the region.

The character Cindy was also included. A summon with a simplified method of acquirement was also put into the game: originally intended to be Titan, it was replaced with Ramuh due to the former being a key character in the story.|$|E
