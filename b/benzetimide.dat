N-Carboethoxy-4-piperidone was used to make Lorcainide.|$|E
40|$|Human {{red blood}} cells bind d,l-[3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, a potent muscarinic cholin-ergic antagonist, with high {{affinity}} (apparent KD= 0. 26 nM) and low capacity as determined by equilibrium binding experiments. Nonspecific binding determined as binding {{in the presence of}} atropine is hyperbolic, and saturable within the same concentration range as total binding. The d- but not the 1 -isomer of <b>benzetimide</b> weakly inhibits ligand binding, which parallels the stereoselectivity but not the potency of drug antagonism to muscarinic receptors in other tissues. While treatment of brain homogenates with Triton X- 100 (0. 5 %) destroys all d,l-[3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to that tissue, similar detergent treatment of red blood cell membranes fails to greatly alter either total or certain drug-displaced ligand binding. These results show that the red blood cell membrane binding site for d,l-[3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate differs in some important aspects of its binding characteristics, pharmacology, and physical properties from muscarinic receptors simi-larly studied in other nervous and nonnervous tissue. Further characterization of the red blood cell cholinergic ligand binding site is necessary to establish its identity as either a different form of muscarinic receptor or as an acceptor site on other membrane cholinergic enzymes or carrier proteins...|$|E
