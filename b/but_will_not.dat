5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the decision making in tamarins and marmosets. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of electric charge {{is known as}} an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> flow through an electrical insulator.|$|E
5|$|As Diane {{has missed}} her flight, she {{suggests}} to Ric that they visit his father's grave. At the graveside, Ric tells Diane about his troubled {{relationship with his}} father, and confesses that he has feelings for her. They see a woman nearby who Diane recognises, having seen Paulina giving her money the day before. Ric confronts her, and discovers she is Esi Griffin (Gloria Acheampong), his father's last wife and widow. She has a son who is not in school, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> explain her circumstances and tells Ric to speak to Kumi.|$|E

5|$|Bart enlists Nelson's {{other victims}} in his army and trains them for combat. Herman {{commands}} from Bart's treehouse as Bart leads his forces into battle. Ambushing Nelson and his sidekicks, they commence saturation bombing with water balloons. Nelson's thugs surrender, and Nelson is taken prisoner. He threatens {{to beat up}} Bart {{as soon as he}} is untied. Herman drafts the armistice treaty, which states that Nelson will retain his position and name, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> hold any actual power. Then, Bart and Nelson sign the treaty. Then, Marge enters with cupcakes, and peace prevails.|$|E
5|$|During the TGS afterparty, new {{cast member}} Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson) admits to his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that he has}} been having an office romance <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> {{disclose}} the woman's name. While in attendance at a New York Knicks game, Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals details, such as she has never let a man see her feet. This results in Jack's realization that the woman is the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), and he is displeased.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E

Agnes refuses to accept this, and tells Jekyll she loves him. He relents, saying that she will help him control himself, and leaves. Sir Danvers joins his daughter, and they talk about their time in Mangalore, India. When Hyde suddenly enters, Sir Danvers tells Agnes to leave the room. The men argue, and Hyde strangles Sir Danvers.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{proposed for}} the DART Light Rail network are classified as deferred. As defined by DART, a deferred station {{is one that has}} been identified, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be constructed until land use changes warrant the construction of a station. In addition to the deferred stations, the network also features a single ghost station, the Knox–Henderson Station. The underground station was excavated {{at the time of the}} original construction of the Red and Blue Lines, only to have plans subsequently scrapped due to neighborhood opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E

5|$|A port to iOS devices {{done by the}} 2K China {{studio was}} {{released}} on August 27, 2014. The iOS version is content complete and functionally equivalent to the original Xbox 360 and Windows version, featuring either the use of touch-screen virtual gamepad controls {{or the use of}} a Bluetooth-enabled controller, and with a graphics engine optimized for iOS devices. The game was later delisted from the App Store in September 2015; the game had become unplayable for many that upgraded to iOS 8.4 on their devices, and while a patch had been discussed, a 2K representative stated that the decision to remove the game came from the developer. 2K later clarified that they will be working on resolving the issues with the game's compatibility with the new firmware and will re-release the title once that has been completed. However, by January 2017, 2K officially stated that it will no longer support the title, the game will remain on the App Store, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> receive additional updates.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} vision of Stoller being stabbed in her car, Black warns her that she may be in danger, which she rebukes. However, she is {{approached}} by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before pulling into a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that someone is hiding {{in the back seat}} of her car, and manages to bring her to the safety of his office. Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call.|$|E

5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted {{that at the end of}} the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> likely be used due to Dio's death.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E

5|$|When Khaldun {{fails to}} meet with Tom, the team worry that he had deceived them. However, that night, Khaldun sneaks into Tom's bedroom at the {{university}} campus, and warns him that Rachid is keeping explosives, and a suicide attack will take place the next day, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> disclose where. Tom turns to Parkmount's imam Fazul Azzam (Roshan Seth), who opposes Rachid's radicalised views. After learning Fazzul's daughter Aminah (Praveen Sond) is involved, he forces her into revealing {{the location of the}} planned attack. Rachid is placed under arrest when explosives are found in his prayer room. Khaldun meanwhile, kills Rachid's men in an empty building, and attempts to disarm the bomber, young Abu Hassan (Taahir Husein), but he runs away into a playground. As Tom's team and local police surround the playground, Khaldun attempts to talk Abu out of the attack. However, when he fails, Khaldun throws himself as Abu detonates the bomb, in order to avoid further casualties. Later, CIA liaison Christine Dale voices disappointment towards Khaldun's death, but appears grateful that Tom is unharmed.|$|E
