Objective functions that are based on the Mahalanobis or <b>Bhattacharyya</b> <b>distances</b> and that are closely related to the probability of misclassification are derived, as well as their subspace gradients.

In order to improve the robustness and accuracy of multi-modal rigid {{image registration}}, a novel learning-based dissimilarity function is proposed in this paper. This novel dissimilarity function is based on measuring the dissimilarity between the joint intensity distribution of the testing image pair and the expected intensity distributions, which is learned from a registered image pair, with <b>Bhattacharyya</b> <b>distances.</b> Then, {{the aim of the}} registration process is to minimize the dissimilarity function. Eight hundred randomized CT- T 1 registrations were performed and evaluated by the Retrospective Image Registration Evaluation (RIRE) project.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel unsupervised color segmentation scheme named ROI-SEG, {{which is based}} on the main idea of combining a set of different sub-segmentation results. We propose an efficient algorithm to compute subsegmentations by an integral image approach for calculating <b>Bhattacharyya</b> <b>distances</b> and {{a modified version of the}} Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) detector. The sub-segmentation algorithm gets a region-of-interest (ROI) as input and detects connected regions having similar color appearance as the ROI. We further introduce a method to identify ROIs representing the predominant color and texture regions of an image. Passing each of the identified ROIs to the sub-segmentation algorithm provides a set of different segmentations, which are then combined by analyzing a local quality criterion. The entire approach is fully unsupervised and does not need a priori information about the image scene. The method is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on the Berkeley image database, where it shows competitive results at reduced computational costs. 1...|$|R

40|$|Effective Feature Subset Selection (FSS) is an {{important}} step when designing engineering systems that classify complex data in real time. The electromyographic (EMG) signal-based walking assistance system is a typical system that requires an efficient computational architecture for classification. The performance of such a system depends largely on a criterion function that assesses the quality of selected feature subsets. However, many well-known conventional criterion functions use less relevant features for classification or they have a high computational cost. Here, we propose a new criterion function that provides more effective FSS. The proposed criterion function, known as a separability index matrix (SIM), provides features pertinent to the classification task and a very low computational cost. This new function produces to a simple feature selection algorithm when combined with the forward search paradigm. We performed extensive experimental comparisons in terms of classification accuracy and computational costs to confirm that the proposed algorithm outperformed other filter-type feature selection methods that are based on various distance measures, including inter–intra, Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and <b>Bhattacharyya</b> <b>distances.</b> We then applied the proposed method to a gait phase recognition problem in our EMG signal-based walking assistance system. We demonstrated that the proposed method performed competitively when compared with other wrapper-type feature selection methods in terms of class-separability and recognition rate...|$|R

The method is based on optimizing the parameters of the distance measure in order to minimize correspondence classification errors on training data. Because the learning process involves relative (rather than absolute) visual content between image pairs, the learned distance measure may also be applied to other images with very different visual content.

The presented approach reached a mean kappa coefficient that was significantly larger (at the 95 % level) than that obtained after training networks with randomly initialized weights. Also, the observed variances on the obtained accuracies were significantly lower when compared to networks that were randomly initialized.

By using special probabilistic puncturing, we prove that, for a given mother turbo code ensemble [C] with a finite noise threshold c [C] 0, if the asymptotic puncturing rate λ satisfies log λ < −c [C] 0, there exists a finite noise threshold c [CP] 0 for the punctured turbo code ensemble which is bounded by a function of c [C] 0 and λ. Based on this result, we prove that, on any binary-input memoryless channel whose <b>Bhattacharyya</b> noise <b>distance</b> is greater than c [CP] 0, the average ML decoding word error probability of the punctured turbo code ensemble approaches zero at least as fast as n −β, where β is the well known “interleaver gain ” exponent.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{an approach that}} both creates crosslingual acoustic monophone model sets for speech recognition tasks and objectively predicts their performance without target-language speech data or acoustic measurement techniques. This strategy {{is based on a}} series of linguistic metrics characterizing the articulatory phonetic and phonological distances of target-language phonemes from source-language phonemes. We term these algorithms the Combined Phonetic and Phonological Crosslingual Distance (CPP-CD) metric and the Combined Phonetic and Phonological Crosslingual Prediction (CPP-CP) metric. The particular motivations for this project are the current unavailability and often prohibitively high production cost of speech databases for many strategically important low- and middle-density languages. First, we describe the CPP-CD approach and compare the performance of CPP-CD-specified models to both native language models and crosslingual models selected by the <b>Bhattacharyya</b> acoustic-model <b>distance</b> metric in automatic speech recognition (ASR) experiments. Results confirm that the CPP-CD approach nearly matches those achieved by the acoustic distance metric. We then test the CPP-CP algorithm on the CPP-CD models by comparing the CPP-CP scores to the recognition phoneme error rates. Based on this comparison, we conclude that the CPP-CP algorithm is a reliable indicator of crosslingual model performance in speech recognition tasks...|$|R

We experimentally compare three subset selection procedures: the commonly used best individual feature selection based on information gain, the same based on individual <b>Bhattacharyya</b> <b>distance,</b> and the Oscillating Search to maximize <b>Bhattacharyya</b> <b>distance</b> on groups of features. The obtained feature subsets are then tested on the standard Reuters data with two classifiers: the multinomial Bayes and the linear SVM.

Multimodality surveillance videos pose specific challenges to tracking algorithms, due to, for example, low or variable light conditions {{and the presence of}} spurious or camouflaged objects.
