40|$|The {{potential}} effect of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> or emollients {{in the prevention}} of work-related hand eczema has mostly been documented in a laboratory setting on experimentally damaged skin. Publications on real intervention studies of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> or emollients in a workplace setting are scarce: only four such studies could be identified. The relatively short follow-up of most studies, and the small numbers of subjects enrolled, may reflect the organisational complexity of such studies. The observed effect is a combination of the intervention effect to be measured, and a number of disturbing variables. These disturbing variables are not just measurement error, but also phenomena such as the course of the disease, confounding and effect modification. In hand-eczema studies, the outcome parameters that should form the basis of the intervention effect are ill defined. Moreover, the study itself (i. e. the investigators) influences the results because there is rarely a single intervention: unknowingly, there are improvements in glove wearing, hand-washing habits or occupational hygiene in general. The performance of a blind study is often difficult or impossible. Large numbers of subjects have to be enrolled if a meaningful reduction in incidence of hand eczema is to be detected. One can demonstrate this by calculating the required enrolment in a study among employees in a nursing home...|$|R

50|$|Avoiding {{triggers}} may {{be useful}} as may a <b>barrier</b> <b>cream.</b> Treatment is generally with steroid cream. High strength steroid creams may be required {{for the first week}} or two. Antihistamines may be used to help with the itch. If this is not effective steroid pills, tacrolimus, or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) may be tried.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{approach}} is to block moisture from reaching the skin, and commonly recommended remedies using this approach include oil-based protectants or <b>barrier</b> <b>cream,</b> various over-the-counter [...] "diaper creams", petroleum jelly, dimethicone and other oils. Such sealants sometimes accomplish the opposite if the skin is not thoroughly dry, in which case they serve to seal the moisture inside the skin rather than outside.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> varies by product. Three categories of barrier creams are used: water repellent creams, water-soluble creams, and creams designed for special applications. Moisturizing <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> {{acts as a}} lubricating film on the skin to prevent depletion of water (transepidermal water loss) in the skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum. This may have a protective effect against irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, which often result from such depletion. These barrier creams can be classed as occlusives (which prevent loss through a hydrophobic effect), humectants (which absorb water from the dermis and environment due to hygroscopy), or hydrating agents (which both moisturize the skin and maintain its water content). Barrier creams may contain substances such as zinc oxide, talc or kaolin to layer over the skin. Other barrier creams are intended to protect the skin from some external agents, though they are not sufficient to provide a complete barrier.|$|E

5000|$|Some sources {{claim that}} diaper rash {{is more common}} with cloth diapers, yet others claim {{that the type of}} diaper makes no difference, but that cloth diapers can speed up the healing process. [...] Others claim the {{material}} of the diaper is relevant insofar as it can wick and keep moisture away from the baby's skin. Possible treatments include minimizing diaper use, <b>barrier</b> <b>creams,</b> mild topical cortisones, and antifungal agents. A variety of other inflammatory and infectious processes can occur in the diaper area and an awareness of these secondary types of diaper dermatitis aids in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients.|$|R
40|$|Suffering from {{dry skin}} on the hands is a common feature in the general population. This {{condition}} is influenced by daily habits and occupational duties. It commonly corresponds to the expression of irritation dermatitis modulated by climatic and other environmental conditions.

In the common discrete irritative type, a specifically designed cosmetic product may considerably improve the discomfort experienced by the patient. By contrast, the efficacy of most <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> remains unconfirmed. The chronic use of topical corticosteroids can lead to dependency and to progressive cutaneous atrophy.

50|$|The {{efficacy}} of barrier creams is controversial. They {{have not been}} demonstrated to be useful in preventing hand eczema. A 2010 Cochrane review {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence to determine whether <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> could prevent occupational contact dermatitis. They are a poor substitute for protective clothing for workers. Gloves provide a greater protection than barrier creams. However they are reasonably effective for the protection of face against some airborne substances.|$|E

40|$|MOST hand infections {{cannot be}} traced to a precise source, though {{it is likely that}} in all of them a minor, unnoticed breach of skin surface has allowed entry of pyogenic organisms.

Industrial and household gloves and <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> are also useful.

5000|$|For hand {{care they}} are {{designed}} to protect against the harm from detergents and other irritants. To help prevent the spread of pathogens, health care providers are required to wash their hands frequently. Frequent hand washing can result in chronic damage termed irritant contact dermatitis which includes dryness, irritation, itching, and more seriously, cracking and bleeding. Irritant contact dermatitis is very common among nurses, ranging from 25% to 55%, with as many as 85% relating a history of having skin problems.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{prompted}} {{interest in the}} use of epidermal <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> as protective biofilms for very low birthweight preterm infants. The key to understanding the role of epidermal barrier films is an elucidation of their interaction with water and a basic knowledge of their composition. In this study, we investigated the morphologic properties and elemental composition of the naturally occurring biofilm, vernix caseosa. This biofilm is typically lacking in preterm infants and its production coincides in utero with terminal differentiation of the epidermis and formation of the stratum corneum. Significantly, vernix (80. 5 ± 1. 0 % H 2 O) had a much higher water content than other <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> (Eucerin: 17. 1 [*]± 0. 6 %, Aquaphor: 0. 33 ± 0. 03 %, Ilex: 0. 19 ± 0. 02 %, petrolatum: 0. 03 ± 0. 01 %; all p < 0. 05). Phase contrast microscopy of vernix showed multiple cellular elements with nucleic ‘‘ghosts’' embedded in a putative lipid matrix. Transmission electron microscopy revealed flattened structures approximately 1 – 2 [*]μm in thickness with distinct cellular envelopes indicative of differentiated corneocytes. Compared with mature corneocytes in adult stratum corneum, vernix corneocytes appeared swollen, the density of the keratin filaments was less, and there was a relative lack of tonofilament orientation. Cryofractured specimens were examined by cryoscanning electron microscopy with subsequent elemental localization by X-ray beam analysis. The findings indicate the high water content of vernix is largely compartmentalized within fetal corneocytes. These results are consistent with the novel view of vernix as a ‘‘fluid phase’' stratum corneum consisting of a hydrophobic lipid matrix with embedded fetal corneocytes possessing unique biomechanical and water-binding properties...|$|R
