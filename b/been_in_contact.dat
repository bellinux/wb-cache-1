5|$|Less {{than three}} weeks before the primary, Comer's former girlfriend told the Courier-Journal in a letter that Comer had abused her {{physically}} and mentally in 1991 and that he had accompanied her to an abortion clinic. Other newspapers, including the Lexington Herald-Leader, which citied the Courier-Journal, then reported the allegations. The Lexington Herald-Leader had reported earlier that the Lexington-area blogger who had been publishing stories about the allegations for months had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with the husband of Heiner's running mate, K. C. Crosbie.|$|E
5|$|Lowell Reese, of Kentucky Roll Call, {{reported}} on September 28, 2015, that the Comer campaign had {{leaked to the}} Herald-Leader emails showing that the husband of Crosbie had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with the blogger. By doing so, the campaign was able to deny the allegations of abuse that had circulated for months in Frankfort, the state capital, and put Heiner's campaign on the defensive.|$|E

It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with the Crew had ended. The MLS ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew.|$|E
5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more {{time to get a}} computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's {{marriage}} to Louis was celebrated in Buda on 20 June 1353. The couple were related within the prohibited degree of kinship, Duke CasimirI of Kuyavia being Elizabeth's maternal great-great-grandfather and Louis' maternal great-grandfather. A papal dispensation was thus necessary, {{but it was}} only sought four months after the wedding took place. The historian Iván Bertényi suggests that the ceremony may have been hastened by an unintended pregnancy, as the couple had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> for years. If so, the pregnancy likely ended in a stillbirth. Elizabeth's mother had apparently died {{by the time she was}} married. Louis was dismayed when, upon his father-in-law's death later the same year, Elizabeth's young and ambitious cousin Tvrtko ascended the Bosnian throne. In 1357, Louis summoned the young Ban to Požega and compelled him to surrender most of western Zachlumia as Elizabeth's dowry.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging {{the results of his}} tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E

His parents divorced when he was seven. McAvoy's mother suffered from poor health and subsequently decided it was best that he live with his maternal grandparents, Mary and James Johnstone, a butcher {{who lived in a}} terraced council house in the nearby Drumchapel area of Glasgow. His mother lived with them intermittently. McAvoy has a sister, Joy, and a younger half-brother, Donald. McAvoy has not <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with his father since childhood.|$|E

5|$|Musical {{instruments}} {{used by the}} Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking {{similarity to}} those of Mesopotamia, leading historians {{to conclude that the}} civilizations must have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess. However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years. Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} believed to have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with the heat shield. This fault may have caused chafing and {{may lead to a}} fuel leak. The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and could eventually detach, leading to a loose-fitting windscreen.|$|E
5|$|People in the Vanni districts {{considered}} themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula {{but the two}} groups did intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists {{of a number of}} highland settlements within forested lands using irrigation tank-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as water buffalo and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts. Historically, the Vanni area has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with what is now South India, including during the medieval period (see Vanniar). Northern Tamils follow customary laws called Thesavalamai, codified during the Dutch colonial period.|$|E

5|$|Su Dingfang was a {{commander}} from south-central Hebei who, {{earlier in his}} career as an officer, was responsible for leading the attack against the military camp of Illig Qaghan, qaghan of the Eastern Turks.

Su was a general with military experience in Central Asia, and was familiar with the culture of the steppes. He had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with military leaders from the region. He was one of nine multi-ethnic commanders invited by Emperor Gaozong to a military event in 655.

The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability.
