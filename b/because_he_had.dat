'And {{the claims}} to the honour are so opposite,' said Lucian Gay; 'one, {{on account of his}} large estate; another, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> none; one, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a well-grown family to {{perpetuate}} the title; another, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no heir, and no power of ever obtaining one.' ...|$|R

5|$|Henry became King of England {{following}} the death of William Rufus, who had been shot while hunting. On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the New Forest, accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry. An arrow was fired, possibly by the baron Walter Tirel, which hit and killed William Rufus. Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was a risky activity, and such accidents were common. Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fired the fatal shot, or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a scapegoat for the King's death.|$|E
5|$|In July, Carlsen and Berge Østenstad (then {{the reigning}} Norwegian champion) tied for {{first in the}} Norwegian Chess Championship, each scoring 7/9.

50|$|Philippe Audi-Dor {{has stated}} that the film was {{inspired}} by his own struggles with his sexuality during his early 20s. Audi-Dor knew <b>he</b> wasn't straight <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had sexual experiences with men, but didn't feel comfortable identifying as gay <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had sexual experiences with women as well. The director also stated that writing the character of Olivier was the easiest character to write, since he identified with Olivier's struggle with his sexuality.|$|R

5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a criminal record in his home country.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, {{which could be used}} for revolution—he had felt as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E

5|$|Although ministers are {{entitled}} to obtain views from other departments or ministries when making decisions, they must consider objections and not disable themselves from exercising their discretion.

5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself.

After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} not only <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to live beyond his salary {{to maintain the}} lifestyle expected of the office, but also {{because he could not}} pay down his obligation from the land company purchase.

He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater.
