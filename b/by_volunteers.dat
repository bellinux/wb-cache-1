5|$|Despite the {{upheaval}} on shore, {{the arrival of}} the British blockade squadron provoked Renaud into taking action. Although the defences of Île de France were well prepared under Malartic's orders, food supplies were running low, with only rice still available in quantity. The potential for famine and consequent social unrest among the slave population was severe and Renaud sailed immediately to intercept Centurion and Diomede. The French squadron comprised the 40-gun frigate Cybèle under Captain Pierre Tréhouart, the 36-gun Prudente under Renaud, and the 14-gun brig Coureur under lieutenant de vaisseau Garaud. The 20-gun privateer corvettes Jean-Bart and Rosalie, as well as the aviso Sans-Culotte, accompanied the two frigates. The ships' crews were heavily augmented <b>by</b> <b>volunteers,</b> including a young Robert Surcouf on Cybèle, as well as a detachment of soldiers.|$|E
