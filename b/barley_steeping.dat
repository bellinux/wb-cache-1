Water diffusivities in the whole grains, were found to vary between 5. 28 and 7. 61 * 10 12 m 2 /s, whereas those of the endosperms were 5 - 7 -fold higher, ranging between 35. 2 and 49. 5 * 10 12 m 2 /s. These differences highlighted the potential barrier role of the grain outer layers. The relationships between maximal water uptake, water diffusivity and grain biochemical and structural parameters (i. e. hardness and other less studied parameters such as vitreousness and porosity) was investigated. The lowest water diffusivity value was obtained for the barley sample displaying the lowest porosity, highest hardness and vitreousness but the highest enzymatic activity during malting, in contradiction with what is generally stated. Water diffusion was not found as the limiting factor for malt quality and, thus, its role during <b>barley</b> <b>steeping</b> has to be reconsidered...|$|E
40|$|A high {{concentration}} of phytate (myo -inositol hexaphosphate) in cereals is known to impair absorption of dietary minerals. The aim of this work was to optimize a malting procedure to degrade phytate and/or increase phytase activity in barley to improve iron availability and to preserve the content of &# 946;-glucan, since &# 946;-glucan is associated with health promoting properties and is therefore of nutritional interest. Moreover, the capacity of a high-phytase yeast strain to hydrolyze phytate was investigated in an in vitro digestion model. The effect of different steeping and germination conditions was studied in a naked and a covered <b>barley.</b> <b>Steeping</b> at 48 °C gave small changes in the content and molecular weight of &# 946;-glucan. By an addition of lactic acid (LA), this was combined with a strong phytate reduction (? 70 %) but a low phytase activity. Steeping at 15 °C with LA rendered a higher phytase activity (> 60 % of raw material), a lower phytate reduction and a somewhat delayed the development of &# 946;-glucanase activity. With a subsequent soaking step at 48 °C and porridge preparation, phytate was virtually completely removed. The molecular weight of &# 946;-glucan was slightly changed only in porridge made from malt prepared by steeping at 15 °C with LA. Simulated digestion in a dynamic gastrointestinal model revealed a higher iron dialyzability of malt porridges (7. 9 and 5. 9 %) compared to the reference porridge (0. 4 %). Accordingly, iron absorption by Caco- 2 cells was higher from dialysates collected during digestion of barley malt porridges. In all porridges, &# 946;-glucan was continually degraded during digestion but was best preserved in the porridge made from malt prepared by steeping at 48 °C with LA. A high-phytase Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was studied at a simulated gastric pH gradient and intestinal pH values with digestive enzymes using growth medium and wheat gruel as model meals. A cell density corresponding to 1 mg d. m. per ml resulted in a degradation of extracellular phytate up to 60 % during the early gastric phase. The acid conditions in the late gastric phase limited further degradation in the intestinal phase. The work shows the potential to improve iron availability in barley and still limit the degradation of polysaccharides during malting, soaking and digestion. It also shows that modified yeast is a promising gastrointestinal carrier of phytase activity...|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} hydration {{of barley}} {{is essential for}} the production of malt suitable for use in brewing and distilling. Therefore the focus of this study is on the uptake of water during <b>steeping</b> of <b>barley</b> with a view to shortening steeps and reducing water use. As an additional way of reducing water consumption at malting plants, efforts are being made to find appropriate treatments so that steep water can be recycled. The aim of our research is to minimise the volume of water required for steeping, maximise the potential to recycle steep water and also minimise the length of steeping time. Bryce et al. (2010) showed that when <b>barley</b> was <b>steeped</b> in water continuously for either 8 h or 16 h, hydration of endosperm materials was suboptimal and modification of endosperm materials of barley malt was inadequate. The malt produced under these steeping regimes gave poor friability scores and produced a large number of whole grains. When <b>barley</b> was <b>steeped</b> for 24 h on a continuous basis, or when a regimented standard steeping method was used, the malt produced gave higher friability scores and a much lower number of whole grains. This suggests that a very short steep, essentially a washing of barley, followed by a single steep should be able to produce excellent malt...|$|R
40|$|Barley is a {{valuable}} cereal with an old tradition in malt, food and feed. With new food applications this cereal can be rediscovered. Addition of a malting step in a food process can change the texture and taste of a product. It is also a process with high potential for improvement of nutrient availability. Extractable cell-wall polysaccharides {{have been linked to}} some positive health effects in humans. In cereals, these polysaccharides are mainly beta-glucan and arabinoxylan. The structure of extractable arabinoxylan and the content of bound ferulic acid dimers were studied in different cereals. For determination of amount and molecular weight of beta-glucan a high performance size-exclusion chromatography system (HPSEC) was set up with detection based on the specific binding of Calcofluor to β-glucan. This system was calibrated using a purified β-glucan fractionated into known narrow molecular weight ranges. A naked and a covered <b>barley</b> <b>steeped</b> and germinated at different temperatures and with different additions in the steeping water were studied. The total content and the average molecular weight of beta-glucan in the treated samples showed small changes after steeping at high temperature (48 °C), while steeping at lower temperature (15 °C) gave a significantly lower content. This was correlated with a strong increase of beta-glucanase activity over the time of germination. Addition of lactic acid to the steeping water at 48 °C decreased the beta-glucanase activity. Porridges made from two malts with a low phytate content and intact beta-glucan were introduced into a dynamic gastrointestinal model. Yield of beta-glucan was found to increase with time spent in the model, while average molecular weight of beta-glucan decreased...|$|R

It is shown that exposure of germinating barley to PEE affects radicle emergence without significantly affecting the seeds gross metabolic activity, as quantified by isothermal calorimetry. An exploration of protein 2 -DE profiles of both the embryo and the starchy endosperm showed that, at the studied time scale, no significant changes were found in proteins present at concentrations higher than the detection limit.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Butyric acid is {{produced}} by degradation of dietary fibre by microbiota and is crucial for maintaining a healthy colon. The physicochemical properties are important for butyric acid formation, and this study aimed {{to evaluate the use}} of malting to tailor the functional characteristics of barley dietary fibre. The effect of different steeping conditions was evaluated in laboratory-scale malting experiments with three different <b>barley</b> varieties. RESULTS: <b>Steeping</b> at 35 °C and with 0. 4 % (v/v) lactic acid resulted in a higher content of β-glucan and soluble fibre in malts than in those steeped at lower temperature and lower lactic acid concentration. Resistant starch increased, whereas the content of soluble arabinoxylan was lower. Dietary fibre components in Tipple were more affected by steeping conditions than the other varieties. The total contents of iron, phytate and amylose were little influenced by steeping conditions. CONCLUSION: The selection of steeping conditions during malting influences composition and the characteristics of dietary fibre in barley. However, the choice of barley variety is also important for tailoring of functional ingredients beneficial for colonic health...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the investigation of}} several strains of LAB for biopreservation using in vitro and in situ studies, {{as well as for}} acidification of wort to be applied during sour brewing and as novel beverages. The impact of bacterial carboxylic acids, with emphasis on phenolic antifungal compounds, was assessed against Fusarium culmorum, a common fungal spoilage organism in malt. The contribution of phenolic acids to the overall fungal inhibition was found to be limited unless combined with lactate and acetate in a low pH environment, suggesting their contribution in a complex, synergistic mechanism. An antifungal ingredient was produced by fermenting wort with Lactobacillus brevis R 2 Δ. When this substrate was applied on <b>barley</b> during <b>steeping</b> and germination, it significantly reduced the amount of fusaria infection, detoxified the substrate and increased the extract yields. To enrich even more bacterial metabolites in wort, an extension of acidification could be achieved by promoting the release of free amino nitrogen through a longer proteolytic rest during mashing or the addition of protease. Up to 12. 8 g/L LA were achieved in buffered-wort before nutrient-related deficiencies inhibited further acidification. A comparison between acidification methods during production of sour beers showed that, depending on the time point of souring, the beers differed significantly in their processability and flavour profile. Acidification of wort before the boil step was chosen as the preferred technique due to its safer implementation and minimal effect on organoleptic properties. Finally, the sensory profile of fermented, non-alcoholic malt-based beverages revealed that lactic fermentation increased acidity and flavour complexity of these drinks, and reduced compounds that elicit “malty” notes, while increasing the “dairy”, “bready”, and “honey” character. Forced ageing led to an increase in typical beer off-flavours in all samples, but fermented beverages showed a better organoleptic stability than the unfermented control...|$|R
40|$|Malt has {{a complex}} {{microbial}} population, which changes as the malting process commences. Little {{is known about}} the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in each of the malting phases. In this study, we determined the number of LAB present in the different phases of malting with Clipper and Prisma barley cultivars. The strains were identified to species level by using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, RAPD-PCR banding patterns and 16 S rRNA sequencing. The number of viable LAB in the <b>barley</b> before <b>steep</b> was higher in Prisma than Clipper (7. 6 × 104 and 1. 2 × 103 cfu/g, respectively). Despite this, the number of viable cells recorded in the first steep water was slightly higher for Clipper (9. 0 × 105 cfu/g) than Prisma (5. 5 × 105 cfu/g). More or less, the same cell numbers were recorded for the two barley cultivars after the first and second dry stands. Both cultivars displayed {{more or less the same}} cell numbers (3. 7 × 107 for Clipper and 3. 2 × 107 cfu/g for Prisma) after the third day of germination. However, a higher number of LAB were detected in the kilned Prisma malt (6. 9 × 104 cfu/g) than the Clipper malt (1. 5 × 104 cfu/g). Leuconostoc argentinum, Le. lactis and Weissella confusa were the most predominant in both cultivars. A few strains were identified as W. paramesenteroides (four strains), Lactobacillus casei (five strains), Lactococcus lactis (five strains) and Lb. rhamnosus (two strains). Lb. casei and Lb. rhamnosus were not isolated from the Prisma cultivar, while W. paramesenteroides and Lc. lactis were absent in the Clipper cultivar. Kilned malt of the Clipper cultivar contained predominantly Le. argentinum, whereas the Prisma cultivar contained mainly Lc. lactis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of LAB in Clipper and Prisma barley and the various malting phases. The influence of the various groups of lactic acid bacteria on the fermenting ability of brewers' yeast is currently being determined. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Published {{version is}} a large file {{containing}} all poster presentations. During malting, <b>barley</b> grains are <b>steeped</b> in water and then allowed to germinate under controlled conditions. This process is generically termed modification. The overall degree and relative proportion of starch, protein and cell wall modification during malting are critical in determining {{the quality of the}} final product. The modification process is greatly influenced by both the variety investigated and the environment in which the variety is grown. Currently, there are a large number of high malting quality varieties being grown worldwide that differ dramatically {{in the way in which}} they modify. These varieties are adapted to vastly different growing environments and often perform poorly when removed from their ideal environment. In this study, twelve international malting varieties were grown in Scotland, Canada and Australia in 2002 and 2003, in order to compare their modification profiles. They were malted in a Phoenix micromalter using a standard micromalting regime from each country. These regimes varied greatly, with large differences in both the number and length of steeps and the length of time for germination. Both the country and micromalter schedule had large effects on the degree of modification of the grain. The implications of these results will be discussed. H. M. Collins, J. S. Swanston, B. G.

40|$|Selenium is an {{essential}} micronutrient for human health and is reported {{to play a role}} in a number of physiological and metabolic processes. It has antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-viral functions, and there is evidence suggesting that Se could reduce alcohol-induced liver damage and the risk of prostate cancer. In South Korea, 70 percent of soil consists of granite and basalt with very low contents of selenium, potentially leading to Se deficiencies in the population. A study was undertaken to biofortify barley. The biofortified barley was then malted and brewed to determine if Se is available in the final beer. Two means of biofortifying barley were undertaken. Firstly, the application of sodium selenate to barley in the field, and secondly, the addition of sodium selenate and sodium selenite to <b>barley</b> during the <b>steeping</b> and watering phases of the malting process. A concentration of up to 2. 7 ppm Se was achieved in barley from foliar application, and 8. 4 ppm Se was achieved in malt from additions during the germination phase of malting, around 25 to 80 times higher than un-biofortified barley. The bio-fortified barley was micro-malted and brewed through both laboratory and pilot-scale processes. A mass balance of this bio-accumulated Se was conducted throughout the various intermediary and by-products of the malting and brewing process. Beer from both brewing methods contained appreciable concentrations of Se. The laboratory brew from malt containing 2. 2 ppm Se contained 38 ppb, while 20 L and 500 L pilot brews from malt with approximately 0. 4 ppm resulted in beer with a concentration of 17 and 15 ppb, respectively. Typically, Australian beer contains around 3 ppb (our unpublished data), while a survey of European beer found a mean Se level of just 1. 4 ppb, suggesting that beer made from Se-biofortified barley has elevated Se levels, and may be used to alleviate Se deficiency...|$|R
40|$|Barley endoproteolytic enzymes are {{important}} to germination because they hydrolyze endosperm storage proteins to provide precursors for new protein synthesis. We recently developed an electrophoretic method utilizing gel-incorporated protein substrates to study the endoproteinases of 4 -d-germinated barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Morex) grain. This work extends those findings to determine the temporal pattern of {{the appearance of the}} endoproteinases during germination, the sensitivities of the proteinases to class-specific proteinase inhibitors, and where, in germinating caryopses, the proteinases reside. Six endoproteinase activity bands (representing a minimum of seven enzymes) were present in 5 -d-germinated barley grain extracts subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels at pH 8. 8. The activities of two of the enzyme bands (“neutral” proteinases) increased as the pH was increased from 3. 8 to 6. 5. The activities of the remaining four (“acidic”) bands diminished abruptly as the pH increased above 4. 7. Two proteinase bands hydrolyzed gelatin but not edestin, four of the proteinases hydrolyzed both gelatin and edestin at nearly the same rates, and one enzyme degraded only edestin. One neutral endoproteinase was sensitive to diisopropyl fluorophosphate inhibition, and the other was not inhibited by any of inhibitors tested. Four of acidic enzymes were cysteine proteinases [inhibited by trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4 -guanidino) butane and N-ethylmaleimide]; the other was an aspartic acid endoproteinase (sensitive to pepstatin). Only the aspartic proteinase was detected in either ungerminated or <b>steeped</b> <b>barley</b> grain. During the germination (malting) process, the aspartic endoproteinase activity decreased until the second day of germination and then increased until germination day 5. The first endoproteinase(s) induced during germination was a neutral enzyme that showed activity on the 1 st day of the germination phase after steeping. Most of the endoproteinases became active on the 2 nd or 3 rd germination day, but one cysteine proteinase was not detected until the 5 th day. Acid cysteine proteinases were present in the aleurone, scutellum, and endosperm tissues but not in shoots and roots. The aleurone layer and endosperm contained almost exclusively band B 1 neutral proteinases, whereas the scutellum, shoots, and roots contained both B 1 and B 2 bands. This work shows that germinating barley contains a complex set of proteinases whose expression is temporally and spatially controlled. But, at the same time, it also shows that this electrophoretic method for separating and studying individual enzymes of this complex will allow us to more readily characterize and purify them...|$|R
40|$|Non-starch polysaccharides, such as beta-glucans and arabinoxylans, {{present in}} the cell walls of barley grains, are {{important}} contributors to wort filtration problems due to their viscous nature. Since nowadays it is the current practice to produce well-modified malts in the malting plant, the role of beta-glucans in reduced filtration rate is of minor importance because of their advanced degradation during malting. Conversely, {{a lot of the}} filtration problems to date are associated with arabinoxylans which are not extensively degraded during malting, as the endogenous enzymes that hydrolyse arabinoxylans, i. e. xylanases, are produced relatively late in the germination process. Furthermore, because of the relatively low temperature stability of endogenous xylanases, arabinoxylans are insufficiently degraded during the brewing process. In addition, it is well-known that a substantial part of the malt xylanolytic activity originates from the microbial community present on the barley kernels, representing a second metabolically active compound in the malting ecosystem. Against this background, this doctoral study aimed to generate insights into the xylanase-producing bacterial community present during barley malting. Special emphasis was put on the bacterial glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 xylanases, since they degrade arabinoxylans very effectively and are resistant to xylanase inhibitors present in barley. As traditional culture-dependent approaches are known to underestimate the microbial species diversity, molecular culture-independent 454 amplicon pyrosequencing was successfully applied to investigate the structure and dynamics of the bacterial communities associated with industrial malting. The bacterial community structure in the malting ecosystem was found to be complex and community dynamics appeared to differ from year to year and to be influenced by the malting process steps. Although many bacteria were found to occur from the harvested barley kernel up {{to the end of the}} malting process, the observed differences between two harvest years could not be explained by a different microbial load initially present on the barley kernels. Environmental parameters such as varying seasonal weather conditions and, as a consequence of this, adjustments of the air circulation pattern in the maltings, could potentially explain the differences in bacterial community structure of germinated barley and kilned malt samples between both investigated years. The bacterial community structure was also found to change along the malting process, but eventually the kilned malt samples were more similar to their corresponding harvested barley sample than to the germinating barley samples. Also at the phylum level, clear differences could be observed between both harvest and malting years. In order to explore the arabinoxylan-degrading microbial community present during barley malting, the genetic diversity and distribution of GH 10 xylanase genes during malting were examined using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing. Most of the GH 10 xylanases detected in the malting barley samples showed a high identity with known xylanases. The GH 10 xylanase sequences obtained in this study were mainly related to xylanases from the phylum Bacteroidetes, in particular from the genus Sphingobacterium. The second part of this study focuses on the availability of xylanolytic bacteria and their exploitation during malting. Therefore, the diversity of the arabinoxylan-degrading bacterial community during barley malting was assessed by microbial isolation, cultivation on different media enriched with arabinoxylan, and identification. As such, 33 species-level operational taxonomic units belonging to 25 genera were found. Most of the arabinoxylan-hydrolysing bacteria isolated during malting could be assigned to Sphingobacterium species. Genetic fingerprinting revealed shifts in S. multivorum populations during the process, especially during germination. Furthermore, the xylanase produced by an isolate showing the highest activity (identified as Cellulomonas flavigena) was partially purified and characterised with respect to temperature stability, revealing a relatively thermostable enzyme. A filtration assay which is relevant to current brewing practices, was successfully applied to study the lautering performance of kilned malts. Addition of commercially available, thermostable xylanases at mashing-in was highly efficient to increase the wort filtration rate, especially when GH 10 xylanases were applied. Besides direct application in mashing, the addition of exogenous GH 10 xylanase during barley germination also resulted in improved lautering performance. Furthermore, the addition of two xylanolytic bacteria (Cellulomonas flavigena or Enterococcus casseliflavus), originating from malting <b>barley,</b> into the <b>steeping</b> or germination process resulted in an increased wort filtration rate without negative effects on malting performance or on standard malt quality characteristics. This knowledge opens up new perspectives for the application of xylanolytic bacteria during steeping or germination on an industrial scale. In conclusion, this doctoral study contributes to the existing body of knowledge of bacterial diversity during malting and leads to a better understanding of the role of bacteria in the malting process. In particular, this study may provide a basis for microbiota management during malting, aiming at an increased mash filtration rate since introducing more xylanase activity in the malting/brewing process shows high potential in this respect. As improved wort filtration is linked to lower heat load and reduced production of aldehydes, it may ultimately also result in enhanced beer flavour quality, including flavour stability. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|R
