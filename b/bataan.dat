5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds blew away roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One man was electrocuted while another man was crushed by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to have died and 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby <b>Bataan</b> after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in <b>Bataan</b> were due to drownings; the city was also the hardest hit by the storm. Throughout the area near <b>Bataan,</b> 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|By March 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to <b>Bataan,</b> while his headquarters and {{his family moved to}} Corregidor. The doomed defense of <b>Bataan</b> captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|A Philippine {{military}} base, Camp Antonio Luna in Limay, <b>Bataan,</b> {{was named}} after the general. It is currently the Office of the Director of the Government Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards {{came the}} <b>Bataan</b> Death March, {{which was the}} forcible transfer, by the Imperial Japanese Army, of 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war after the three-month Battle of <b>Bataan</b> in the Philippines during World War II. The death toll of the march is {{difficult}} to assess as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), {{and it is not}} known how many died in the fighting that was taking place concurrently. All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O'Donnell.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Virgilio N. Cordero, Jr., USA, was the Battalion Commander of the 31st Infantry Regiment in the Philippines. Survivor of {{the infamous}} <b>Bataan</b> Death March, he was awarded three Silver Star Medals and a Bronze Star Medal.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, General Douglas MacArthur {{requested}} Casey's {{services as}} his chief engineer. Casey arrived in Manila in October, {{shortly before the}} outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. He acquired construction equipment from the National Power Corporation that was being used on the Caliraya project. Casey supervised demolitions as MacArthur's troops retreated to <b>Bataan,</b> {{for which he was}} awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Unlike the rest of MacArthur's headquarters, Casey, who was promoted to colonel on 19 December 1941 and brigadier general on 25 January 1942, did not relocate to Corregidor but remained on <b>Bataan</b> with a small staff of five officers. However, he joined MacArthur and sixteen other members of his staff in their escape from Corregidor by PT boat in March 1942. For his service in the 1942 campaign in the Philippines, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1945, Chase {{took over}} {{command of the}} 38th Infantry Division, which was then confronted by enemy fortifications at Zig-Zag Pass on the <b>Bataan</b> Peninsula. It took Chase a week of hard {{fighting}} to reduce this position. A battalion of the 151st Infantry under Chase's personal command landed at Mariveles on {{the southern tip of}} <b>Bataan</b> on 14 February. The 38th Infantry Division participated in the final actions on Corregidor. Units of the 38th Infantry Division assaulted and captured Caballo Island on 27 March, Fort Drum on El Fraile Island on 13 April, and Carabao Island on 16 April. Meanwhile, other elements of the 38th Infantry Division engaged enemy forces in the mountainous Fort Stotsenburg area. In the midst of these operations, Chase was promoted to Major General in March.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{considered}} successful—489 POWs were liberated, along with 33 civilians. The total included 492Americans, 23British, threeDutch, twoNorwegians, oneCanadian, and oneFilipino. The rescue, {{along with the}} liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the prisoners to tell of the <b>Bataan</b> and Corregidor atrocities, which sparked {{a new wave of}} resolve for the war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese {{operations}} to invade the Philippines began. Forty-three planes bombed Tuguegarao and Baguio in the first preemptive strike in Luzon. The Japanese forces then quickly conducted a landing at Batan Island, and by December 17, General Masaharu Homma gave his estimate that {{the main component of}} the United States Air Force in the archipelago was destroyed. By January 2, Manila was under Japanese control and by January 9, Homma had cornered the remaining forces in <b>Bataan.</b> By April 9, the remaining of the combined Filipino-American force was forced to retire from <b>Bataan</b> to Corregidor. Meanwhile, Japanese invasions of Cebu (April 19) and Panay (April 20) were successful. By May 7, after the last of the Japanese attacks on Corregidor, General Jonathan M. Wainwright announced through a radio broadcast in Manila the surrender of the Philippines. Following Wainwright was General William F. Sharp, who surrendered Visayas and Mindanao on May 10.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. MacArthur's plan for holding all of Luzon against the Japanese collapsed as it spread out the American-Filipino forces too thin. However, he reconsidered his confidence {{in the ability of}} his Filipino troops after the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at Lingayen Gulf on 21 December, and ordered a retreat to <b>Bataan.</b> Within two days of the Japanese landing at Lingayen Gulf, MacArthur had reverted to pre-July 1941 plan of attempting to hold only <b>Bataan</b> while waiting for a relief force to come. Most of the American and some of the Filipino troops were able to retreat back to Baatan, but without most of their supplies, which were abandoned in the confusion. Manila was declared an open city at midnight on 24 December, without any consultation with Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commanding the Asiatic Fleet, forcing the Navy to destroy considerable amounts of valuable material.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{served as}} General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's chief {{engineer}} during the Battle of <b>Bataan,</b> {{in the jungles}} and mountains of New Guinea and the Philippines, and during the occupation of Japan. In the Battle of Leyte, he commanded the Army Support Command (ASCOM), which was responsible for all construction and logistics activities in the forward area. He hoped to become Chief of Engineers, but President Harry S. Truman passed him over. Later, Casey worked for Schenley Industries from 1951 {{until his retirement in}} 1965, and was chairman of the New York City Transit Authority from 1953 to 1955.|$|E
5|$|During the war {{the efforts}} of Filipino and American {{defenders}} during the Battle of <b>Bataan</b> were widely covered by the press, as were {{the actions of the}} 100th and 442nd Infantry. After the war, {{the efforts of}} the 442nd continued to be lauded, with the 1951 film Go for Broke! portraying their endeavors. By contrast, the activities of the Filipino Infantry Regiment and her sister units were largely unpublicized; {{it was not until the}} documentaries Unsung Heroes and An UnTold Triumph that any significant visual media covered the history of the Regiment. In 1984 an association of veterans of the Regiment erected a marker in Salinas in honor of their former unit.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{resigned}} on 1 March, {{mainly in}} resentment for the rearmament of the Kawit Battalion as the Presidential Guard. Aguinaldo hesitantly accepted the resignation. As a result, Luna was {{absent from the}} field for three weeks, during which the Filipino forces suffered several defeats and setbacks. One such defeat {{would be at the}} Battle of Marilao River on 27 March. Receiving the depressing reports from the field through his La Independencia correspondents, Luna went to Aguinaldo and asked to be reinstated with more powers over all the military heads, and Aguinaldo promoted him to Lieutenant General and agreed making him Commander-in-Chief of all the Filipino forces in Central Luzon (Bulacan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, <b>Bataan,</b> Zambales).|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{responsible}} for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the <b>Bataan</b> Death March and Manila massacre. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and {{of which he was}} probably unaware. Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila was ending.|$|E
5|$|Offshore <b>Bataan,</b> eight {{fishermen}} {{were initially}} rendered missing after a boat capsized. In Olongapo City, seven people were buried {{due to a}} landslide. In the downtown Santa Cruz area, all forms of transportation except for the railroad were immobile. The Makati area sustained waist-deep flooding. Due to both Irma and Hal, 14communities in Tarlac were flooded, leaving 375,000people displaced, 116,963of whom were evacuated to 46 evacuation centers. Seven bridges were also damaged. Overall, 511,067people, or 94,661families were directly affected by the typhoon. A total of 253homes were destroyed, with 1,854others partially damaged. Nationwide, 65people were killed due to the typhoon. The storm inflicted $13.7million in damage to infrastructure and $2.3million in damage to agriculture, totaling to approximately $16million.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{independence}} {{over the next}} decade were interrupted by World War II when the Japanese Empire invaded and the Second Philippine Republic of José P. Laurel was established as a collaborator state. Many atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war such as the <b>Bataan</b> Death March and the Manila massacre that culminated with the Battle of Manila. In 1944, Quezon died in exile in the United States and Sergio Osmeña succeeded him. The Allied Forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the Philippine archipelago, in the process, retaking territory conquered by Imperial Japan.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} World War I-era service in Mexico and Europe, his {{overseas}} postings {{had been in}} Asia and the Pacific. During World War II, {{he had become a}} national hero and had been awarded the Medal of Honor for the unsuccessful defense of the Philippines in the Battle of <b>Bataan.</b> He had commanded the Allied armies in the New Guinea Campaign and Philippines Campaign, fulfilling his famous promise to return to the Philippines. In 1944 and 1948, he had been considered a possible Republican candidate for president. After the war, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), he had overseen the Occupation of Japan and played an important part in the post-war political and social transformation of that country.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1907, U.S. naval and {{military}} planners {{had concluded that}} it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the <b>Bataan</b> peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s it was estimated that they could do so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the planners had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippine should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{returned}} to Melbourne, where he devoted himself to business affairs, to writing, and to promoting {{the welfare of}} ex-service personnel. In September 1948, Blamey {{paid a visit to}} Japan, where he was warmly greeted on arrival at Iwakuni by Horace Robertson, the commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, who also provided an RAAF honour guard. MacArthur sent his own aircraft, the <b>Bataan,</b> to collect Blamey and bring him to Tokyo, where he met Blamey at the airport and gave him another warm greeting. In the late 1940s Blamey became involved with The Association, an organisation similar to the earlier League of National Security, which was established to counter a possible communist coup. He {{was the head of the}} organisation until ill health forced him to stand down in favour of Morshead in 1950.|$|E
5|$|In case {{a doctor}} was needed, Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from <b>Bataan</b> to {{accompany}} the party. The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur's staff. They were loyal and experienced, {{and some of them}} had been with MacArthur for years. Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from private that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{spent his}} {{graduation}} furlough {{with his parents}} at Fort Mason, California, where his father, now a major general, was serving as commander of the Department of the Pacific. Afterward, he joined the 3rd Engineer Battalion, which departed for the Philippines in October 1903. MacArthur was sent to Iloilo, where he supervised {{the construction of a}} wharf at Camp Jossman. He went on to conduct surveys at Tacloban City, Calbayog City and Cebu City. In November 1903, while working on Guimaras, he was ambushed by a pair of Filipino brigands or guerrillas; he shot and killed both with his pistol. He was promoted to first lieutenant in Manila in April 1904. In October 1904, his tour of duty was cut short when he contracted malaria and dhobi itch during a survey on <b>Bataan.</b> He returned to San Francisco, where he was assigned to the California Debris Commission. In July 1905, he became chief engineer of the Division of the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the rescue}} was {{released}} to the public on February 2. The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as the raid had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of <b>Bataan</b> and Corregidor. Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them {{of the rescue}}. News of the raid was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages. The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of the raid. The enthusiasm over the raid was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The raid was soon followed by additional successful raids, such as the raid of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, the raid of Bilibid Prison on February4, and the raid at Los Baños on February23.|$|E
5|$|The Huks {{began their}} anti-Japanese {{campaign}} as five 100-man units. They obtained needed {{arms and ammunition}} from Philippine army stragglers, which were escapees from the Battle of <b>Bataan</b> and deserters from the Philippine Constabulary, in exchange of civilian clothes. The Huk recruitment campaign progressed more slowly than Taruc had expected, due to competition with U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE) guerrilla units in enlisting new soldiers. The U.S. units already had recognition among the islands, had trained military leaders, and an organized command and logistical system. Despite being restrained by the American sponsored guerrilla units, the Huks nevertheless took to the battlefield with only 500 men and much fewer weapons. Several setbacks {{at the hands of}} the Japanese and with less than enthusiastic support from USAFFE units did not hinder the Huks growth in size and efficiency throughout the war, developing into a well trained, highly organized force with some 15,000 armed fighters by war's end. The Huks attacked both the Japanese and other non-Huk guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was one of}} {{the first}} nations to commit units to the fighting, playing a small but {{sometimes}} significant part in the United Nations Command, which was initially led by General Douglas MacArthur. Forces deployed in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) formed the basis of the Australian response, with P-51 Mustang fighter-bombers from No. 77 Squadron RAAF flying their first missions on 2 July, while the frigate HMAS Shoalhaven and the destroyer HMAS <b>Bataan</b> were also committed to naval operations. During this time the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), which had been preparing to return to Australia prior to the outbreak of the war, remained in Japan, however on 26 July the Australian government announced that it would also commit the under-strength and poorly equipped infantry battalion to the fighting, following a period of preparation. Training and re-equipment began immediately, while hundreds of reinforcements were hastily recruited in Australia as part of K Force; they soon began arriving to fill out the battalion. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green. An officer with extensive operational experience fighting the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War, Green took over from Walsh due to the latter's perceived inexperience.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period Australia contributed significant {{forces to the}} Allied occupation of Japan {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling 13,500 personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P-51 Mustangs, initially based at Bofu from March 1946, before transferring to Iwakuni in 1948. However, by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan. A total of ten RAN warships served in Japan during this period, including HMA Ships Australia, Hobart, Shropshire, Arunta, <b>Bataan,</b> Culgoa, Murchison, Shoalhaven, Quadrant and Quiberon, while HMAS Ships Manoora, Westralia and Kanimbla also provided support.|$|E
25|$|Many Kapampangans {{joined a}} group of stronghold {{soldiers}} that survived the invasion and officially trained under the 31st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army. USAFFE was stationed in Pampanga on July 26, 1941 before the surrender by the Japanese to April 9, 1942. After the Battle of <b>Bataan</b> in 1942, some Kapampangan soldiers of the USAFFE 31st Infantry Division fought four years of battles against Japanese troops. After the fall of <b>Bataan</b> on April 9, 1942, many Kapampangan soldiers of the USAFFE 31st Division surrendered to the Japanese and then participated in the Death March of <b>Bataan</b> Death March from Mariveles, <b>Bataan</b> to Capas, Tarlac.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of <b>Bataan</b> {{is famous}} {{in history as}} one of the last stands of American and Filipino {{soldiers}} before they were overwhelmed by the Japanese forces in World War II. The <b>Bataan</b> Death March was named after the province, where the infamous march started.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1942, General MacArthur {{declared}} the capital city, Manila, an open city to prevent its destruction. The Philippine defense continued {{until the final}} surrender of United States-Philippine forces on the <b>Bataan</b> Peninsula in April 1942 and on Corregidor in May of the same year. Most of the 80,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese at <b>Bataan</b> were forced to undertake the infamous <b>Bataan</b> Death March to a prison camp 105kilometers to the north. About 10,000 Filipinos and 1,200 Americans died before reaching their destination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bataan</b> {{paid off}} at Sydney on 18 October 1954, and was laid up in reserve {{awaiting}} conversion to an anti-submarine escort. The conversion was cancelled in 1957, with <b>Bataan</b> {{placed on the}} disposal list, then sold for scrap to T. Carr and Company of Sydney in 1958.|$|E

25|$|The two P-40s on <b>Bataan</b> both {{flew out}} on 8 April, the P-40E to Iloilo City on Panay, where it landed wheels up, and the P-40B to Cebu. The two P-35s on Mindanao {{flew back to}} <b>Bataan</b> Field on 4 April and {{evacuated}} three pursuit pilots in their baggage compartments. A Navy Grumman J2F Duck that the 20th Pursuit Squadron raised from Mariveles Bay and placed in service again on 24 March evacuated five officers. <b>Bataan</b> surrendered the next morning. The P-40B reached Mindanao but crashed on 14 April trying to land at Dalirig in a heavy rain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bataan</b> is {{politically}} subdivided into 11 municipalities and one component city.|$|E
25|$|Renewable energy, {{primarily}} solar power, forms a {{small portion}} of power generation in <b>Bataan,</b> with a total capacity of 48.1 MW, and are concentrated on {{the northern part of the}} province. Existing renewable energy power plants include the <b>Bataan</b> 2020 Cogen Power Plant (12.5 MW), YH Green Energy Solar Power Plant (12.6 MW), Citicore Solar Power Plant (18 MW), and Morong Solar Power Plant (5 MW). Three renewable energy power plants, namely the Solana Solar Alpha Inc. (20 MW), <b>Bataan</b> Solar Power Project (150 MW), and Santa Rita Wind Power Project (50 MW), are awarded to increase the capacity by 220 MW.|$|E
25|$|The present-day {{design of}} the Philippine flag {{features}} the eight-ray sun, which, some of the provinces that Blanco took under martial law on August 30, 1896 took a representation. The eight {{rays of the sun}} represent the eight provinces that initiated revolution against Spain: Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, <b>Bataan,</b> Laguna and Batangas, though historian Ambeth Ocampo listed Tarlac instead of <b>Bataan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ex- was {{transferred}} to the Philippine Navy on 31 October 1960, as a loan {{under the terms of the}} Military Assistance Program; on 21 April 1961, the ship was sold outright to the Philippines. Rajah Soliman served as the Philippine Navy's flagship during its entire time service. In June 1964, the ship entered a refit period at the <b>Bataan</b> National Shipyard, located in Mariveles, <b>Bataan,</b> for repairs to its engines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bataan</b> is a {{location}} of bulk power generation, whose {{most of the}} power produced are sent to the Luzon Grid. Most power plants in <b>Bataan</b> rely on fossil fuels, like oil and coal, but renewable energy sources, primarily solar power, forms part of the generation. The total output of existing power plants equals to 2068.1 MW, and new power plants to start operation will increase the output to 4224.1 MW.|$|E
