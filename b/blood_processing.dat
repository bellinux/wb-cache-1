25|$|Pseudohyperkalemia {{occurs when}} the {{measured}} potassium levels is falsely elevated. This condition is usually suspected when patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysed blood sample. Since exercise can cause elevated potassium levels, repeated fist clenching can cause transient rise in potassium levels. Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may only become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. On the other hand, processing of heparinised, unclot blood does not cause falsely elevated potassium. In addition to that, high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases red blood cells fragility, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during <b>blood</b> <b>processing.</b> This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because formation of clot protect the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia may also be present, and is characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.|$|E

As in Wells' novel, the tripod's three legs are completely flexible, even rubber-like in their appearance and movement, with no visible mechanical joints or pivot-points; they propel themselves by truly [...] "walking" [...] over any terrain. This {{can be viewed as}} faithful to the original novel, where Wells describes the fighting machines as being more organic than mechanical in their appearance. Spielberg's tripods also emit loud, deep bellows, which seem to be a means of calling out to one other, similar to how Wells' originally described them doing in his novel. The sounds used by the tripods in the film consist of one loud 113 Hz blast (between A2 and A#2 on the musical scale) for three seconds, followed by a deep 136 Hz blast (near C#3) for another three seconds, sounding very much like Earth lighthouse foghorn blasts. The fighting machines are also equipped with numerous retracting and expanding tentacles for capturing humans and for other tasks. They also have two possibly detachable metal-wire cages attached directly underneath along the rear and {{on each side of the}} machine's main body, used for temporary human prisoner storage; a metal hatch in the body over each cage dials open, revealing an organic hole that then opens to allow a smaller tentacle to reach into the cage, pulling a captured victim into the machine every few minutes for off-camera <b>blood</b> <b>processing.</b> At one point, it is revealed that a human with explosives, after getting put into one of the cages and later being pulled into the tripod, destroys its interior by detonating the explosives, demonstrating an effective, yet highly risky method of bringing down a tripod.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{dried blood}} spot (DBS) method, {{which is a}} simple {{technique}} for <b>blood</b> sample <b>processing</b> involving the placement of a drop of whole blood onto filter paper, has been used recently in clinical pharmacology to determine blood concentrations of various drugs. This study examined the feasibility of the clinical application of the DBS method for individual busulfan dose adjustments. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of blood samples for busulfan measurements determined using the DBS method were compared with those using plasma separation (the conventional method). Blood samples were collected from patients receiving i. v. busulfan as a conditioning regimen before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at Toranomon Hospital, Japan. Samples collected 2, 4, and 6 [*]hours {{after the start of}} the first drip infusion were processed by DBS or the conventional method. The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) and other PK parameters were calculated to compare the 2 methods. Divergence of < 20 % in each parameter was considered acceptable. The divergence range for each parameter was as follows: blood concentration at 2 [*]hours after the start of drip infusion,. 6 to 8. 2 %; at 4 [*]hours,. 3 to 10. 0 %; at 6 [*]hours,. 3 to 14. 2 %; and AUC 0 –∞,. 0 to 10. 3 %. None of the PK parameters showed a divergence between the DBS method and the conventional method exceeding 20 %, suggesting that both methods are well correlated. The clinical application of <b>blood</b> sample <b>processing</b> with the DBS method in the measurement of blood busulfan concentration may therefore be feasible, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
