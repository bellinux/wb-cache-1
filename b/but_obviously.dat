5|$|In 1907, whilst back in Paris, Hunter met Alice Toklas, whom he {{had known}} {{previously}} in San Francisco. She took {{him to see the}} collection at 27 rue de Fleurus, that was being started by Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo Stein. Toklas wrote of this re-meeting that Hunter was at first shocked by the style of artists such as Matisse, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> strongly impressed.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm {{demonstrated}} a rare {{ability to survive}} among early Scottish kings by reigning for twenty-nine years. He was a clever and ambitious man. Brehon tradition provided that the successor to Malcolm was to be selected by him from among the descendants of King Aedh, {{with the consent of}} Malcolm's ministers and of the church. Ostensibly in an attempt to end the devastating feuds in the north of Scotland, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> influenced by the Norman feudal model, Malcolm ignored tradition and determined to retain the succession within his own line. But since Malcolm had no son of his own, he undertook to negotiate a series of dynastic marriages of his three daughters to men who might otherwise be his rivals, while securing the loyalty of the principal chiefs, their relatives. First he married his daughter Bethoc to Crinan, Thane of The Isles, head of the house of Atholl and secular Abbot of Dunkeld; then his youngest daughter, Olith, to Sigurd, Earl of Orkney. His middle daughter, Donada, was married to Finlay, Earl of Moray, Thane of Ross and Cromarty and a descendant of Loarn of Dalriada. This was risky business under the rules of succession of the Gael, but he thereby secured his rear and, taking advantage of the renewal of Viking attacks on England, marched south to fight the English. He defeated the Angles at Carham in 1018 and installed his grandson, Duncan, son of the Abbot of Dunkeld and his choice as Tanist, in Carlisle as King of Cumbria that same year.|$|E
25|$|The Late Tang {{poetry of}} Du Mu's type tended toward a clear, robust style, often looking back upon {{the past with}} sadness, perhaps {{reflecting}} the times. The Tang dynasty was falling apart, {{it was still in}} existence, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> in a state of decline.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{parabola}} is symmetrical, {{the travel}} {{away from the}} board as the diver passes it is twice {{the amount of the}} forward travel {{at the peak of the}} flight. Excessive forward distance to the entry point is penalized when scoring a dive, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> an adequate clearance from the diving board is essential on safety grounds.|$|E
25|$|Peak {{accelerations}} can {{be increased}} by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by {{a reduction in the}} fuel load and tankage and associated structures, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. <b>But,</b> <b>obviously,</b> negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

25|$|Besides content filtering, other {{imperfect}} {{methods for}} cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One {{example is the}} use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.|$|E
25|$|Greg Madden {{is found}} dead weeks later. In {{the months that}} follow, Zach and Kendall enjoy their time with the newborn child. Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped to define it. The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> still very much alive and that all he wanted is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will not let it go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E
500|$|The general {{pattern of}} {{reaction}} has been typified by Bob Kerrey, {{president of the}} New School and former Senator from Nebraska, who originally stated that Hsu had been [...] "a terrific member" [...] of the New School board. After Hsu resigned as a board member, Kerrey said the university did not do background checks of prospective trustees and that he hoped that Hsu [...] "didn't break the law." [...] After Hsu became a two-time fugitive, Kerrey remarked, [...] "I thought that I knew him, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> I didnâ€™t." ...|$|E

Joey retaliated Willie's statement the following day in a 15-minute-long monologue on Eat Bulaga! by advising his rival to [...] "explain before you complain"; not mentioning Willie or Wowowee directly at all during the speech, but clearly directing the speech at him. He also accused Willie of resorting to personal attacks in order to dodge questions about the incident. [...] Joey also clarified in the address that he was not directly accusing Willie or the Wowowee staff of cheating; noting that the only information he got about the incident was through video postings on YouTube and text messages he had received about the incident.|$|E
500|$|Irving {{was dismayed}} by the storyline which saw Meyer shot in a road rage incident, {{describing}} filming the scenes as an [...] "unpleasant experiences", the worst aspect being that Meyer loses his spleen {{as a result of}} his injuries. Of the later storyline which sees Meyer investigated by Tom Campbell-Gore on behalf of the hospital Board, Denis Lawson explained: [...] " [...] actually rather fancies Meyer's job but if he finds against him in the investigation he cannot get the job because it's a conflict of interest. So he has to play a rather clever game, which he does." [...] On taking over as head of the cardiothoracic surgery department, he commented: [...] "George is fantastic in the show, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> I'm going to do something very, very different, so I don't feel that I'm stepping into his shoes." ...|$|E
500|$|Lars Larson, {{the first}} {{interview}} subject, was infuriated after seeing the finished program. He had {{been led to believe}} that the episode would present a far more positive picture of American gay life. Larson, whose interview had been altered to make him seem less happy, filed a formal fraud complaint and withdrew his release. [...] "They had some rather nasty, angry anti-gay people on there who were treated as professionals," [...] he said. [...] "I had no problem with Harry Morgan or Mike Wallace because they were thorough. <b>But</b> <b>obviously</b> others in the decision-making process were truly upset with homosexuality.

500|$|Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), in the meantime, invites her {{co-workers}} to her {{art show}} after work. At the show, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{and his partner}} Gil critique her art, with Gil dismissing it as [...] "motel art", not realizing that she is standing right behind them. None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> does so as a [...] "boyfriend's gesture" [...] with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip {{back to the office}} to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building. Pam embraces him as her eyes tear up. Michael hangs Pam's drawing on the wall next to his office.|$|E
500|$|The New York Dolls and Morton {{produced}} little original material {{together and}} had to record cover songs and re-recorded some of the band's earlier demos to complete Too Much Too Soon; [...] "Babylon", [...] "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", [...] "It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Human Being" [...] had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, [...] "Teenage News" [...] and [...] "Too Much Too Soon", before working with Morton, but neither were considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling {{he had been in}} a rush: [...] "He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts." ...|$|E
500|$|The club began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month â€“ with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2â€“1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone. They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King. Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed, which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad, but a third consecutive 1â€“0 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off, signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager. Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice. [...] "It's a sad day, <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> a happy day for me because I'm getting my chance to be a manager in the league," [...] said the former striker. [...] "He's a great friend of mine. The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other." [...] His first match was a 2â€“0 defeat at Preston North End, but he took positives from the performance.|$|E

500|$|Colin Moriarty of IGN {{considered}} the narrative and characters {{one of the}} best features, stating that it's where the game [...] "really shines". Metros Jenkins also praised the story, stating that the mix of tones is [...] "bizarre <b>but</b> <b>obviously</b> intentional". Matt Sakuraoka-Gilman of Computer and Video Games called the narrative [...] "intelligently written, brilliantly voiced and highly polished". Kotaku's Mike Fahey felt somewhat divided about the story, initially finding the attempts at emotion too obvious, but ultimately feeling satisfied, calling it [...] "spectacular". He also praised the characterization of Blazkowicz in the game. GamesRadar's Taljonick also felt mixed about the game's characters, finding Blazkowicz interesting, but feeling as though the supporting characters were quite undeveloped, leaving players to forget about them during gameplay. Conversely, Matt Bertz of Game Informer noted that the attempts to give Blazkowicz more depth feel odd in reflection to his brutal actions during other parts of the game. VideoGamer.com's Miller also felt negatively about the narrative, calling it [...] "awful". Joystiq's Ludwig Kietzmann commented on the drastic changes in the narrative's pacing, feeling that it [...] "dragged down" [...] whenever the player is forced to search for ammunition; Steven O'Donnell of Good Game believed otherwise, feeling like he was [...] "gearing up and patching up" [...] after each fight.|$|E
500|$|Doctor Who had {{previously}} aired two related specials for Comic Relief. The {{first was the}} 1999 spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, which was also written by Steven Moffat. The spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures produced its own mini-episode [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] for the 2009 Comic Relief appeal. Unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] {{are considered to be}} canonical. The canonicity of the two mini-episodes was affirmed by Moffat in Doctor Who Magazine. Moffat stated that, unlike Curse of the Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] is not a spoof or a sketch, but rather [...] "a little miniature story" [...] {{in the style of the}} Children in Need mini-episodes. He described it as [...] "A moment of life aboard the TARDIS. <b>But</b> <b>obviously</b> life about the TARDIS instantly gets you into terrible jeopardy, and all of causality is threatened. As I'm sure it is every day when they get up and have their coffee..." [...] The concept of a TARDIS inside the TARDIS had been previously explored in The Time Monster (1972) and Logopolis (1980), though both times it was the TARDIS of the Master. Amy also repeats one of her lines from [...] "The Big Bang" [...] at the end of [...] "Space".|$|E
