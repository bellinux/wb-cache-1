25|$|An {{engineer}} who {{is often seen}} hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> seen occasionally now. He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs and becoming possessed), so it is likely that he is rehired and brought back to life in a similar way to the other main characters who die and come back. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and kids who are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion.

500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{tries to}} avoid meeting with Wesley (Michael Sheen), the British man she met and flirted with {{while under the}} {{influence}} of anesthesia. Liz finds him to be annoying, but they continually run into each other, which leads them to believe they are meant to be together. However, after visiting the dentist office where they met, Liz and Wesley {{come to terms with the}} fact that the anesthesia was the cause of whatever they experienced, and agree to stop seeing each other. But when they run into each other yet again, Wesley suggests that they should probably just [...] "settle" [...] for one another. Liz is horrified at this prospect and consults Jack for advice, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> disconsolate at the prospect of [...] "settling" [...] for a company without upward momentum, and cannot help her. Later, Liz meets Wesley to tell him her answer is no, and she believes both of them can do better than being with each other; she is further dismayed to learn he shares his name with actor Wesley Snipes.|$|E
500|$|To put {{it another}} way, a thing or person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. [...] "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the same person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete [...] "occasions of experience" [...] that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as [...] "the essence of a thing" [...] or [...] "the identity/core of a person" [...] is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. [...] Identities do not define people, people define identities. [...] Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an [...] "enduring essence" [...] misses the fact that [...] "all things flow", though it is often a useful way of speaking.|$|E

You thought, the boy seeks something, seeks such a special subtlety, that color {{descending}} like stars {{from the sky}} and landing, bright and transparent, like snow on our roofs. Where did he get it? How would it come to a boy like him? I don't know why he couldn't find it with us, in the city—in his homeland. Maybe the boy is [...] "crazy", but [...] "crazy" [...] {{for the sake of}} art. ...You thought: [...] "I can see, I am etched in the boy's heart, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> 'flying,' he is still striving to take off, he has 'wind' in his head." ...

A scan revealed that Bale had suffered ligament damage to his right ankle, consigning him to an extended period on the sidelines. Bale had exploratory surgery on 11 December 2007. By February 2008, {{it became clear that}} Bale was to miss {{the rest of the season}} through injury. Sporting Director, Damien Comolli said, [...] "Even if the examination reveals that Gareth's foot is stable, the decision has been taken to bring him back slowly to ensure he does not get a repeat of the injury or suffer any further damage.

2500|$|In April 2015, Hobden scored 65* in a Sussex record tenth-wicket {{partnership}} of 164 with Ollie Robinson.

The then Sussex captain Ed Joyce defended him, saying [...] "I think Matt will be a fantastic cricketer for Sussex in the future <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> young and learning his trade at the moment", and then coach Mark Robinson said that: [...] "This is Matt’s first full year as a professional and we rate him highly", and [...] "in terms of his long-term future {{what happened in the}} Middlesex game {{could turn out to be}} brilliant for him as it helps mould who you are."

Mervin Wendell (Anthony Zerbe), his wife Maude (Lois Nettleton), and young son Philip (Doug McKeon) come to town. The Wendells are ostensibly itinerant actors but in reality they are charlatans and con-artists working {{their way across the}} new railroad towns {{one step ahead of the}} law. Their favorite con is called the [...] "badger game". The con works on the local pastor and the Wendells reap large blackmail proceeds. Their plan turns sour when they try it on a worldwise businessman, Soren Sorenson (Sandy McPeak). He recognizes their trick, too late, and threatens to expose them. Wendell attacks him. [...] They struggle and Sorenson is killed by Maude Wendell. While looking through his belongings, they find a large fortune in cash that Sorenson was going to use to finance a real estate purchase. Philip hides the body in a subterranean cave along the riverbank. [...] They keep the money but realize that they cannot spend it as it will expose their guilt.|$|E
