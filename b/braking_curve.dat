2500|$|Where a {{train is}} {{approaching}} a speed restriction the control center will transmit a packet with an XG location set {{to a point}} behind the speed restriction such that a train, decelerating based on its <b>braking</b> <b>curve,</b> will arrive at the correct speed {{at the start of}} the speed restriction. This, as well as deceleration to zero speed, is illustrated with the green line in the [...] "Permitted and supervised speed calculation" [...] figure.|$|E

50|$|On-board device Mirel VZ1 unlike older devices generates <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> {{according}} to received restrictive signal. Nevertheless, the trackside {{part of the}} LS-system offers too little information to generate a usable <b>braking</b> <b>curve.</b> Thus, this <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> is so restrictive that its use is questionable. The driver has two choices then. He has to regulate the speed so that {{is lower than the}} generated speed, otherwise emergency braking is applied; or he can use manual mode and there is no <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> (only checking the driver’s vigilance). But the Mirel VZ1 has an optional ability to decoding the Hungarian signals of the EVM 120. Therefore the newest Škoda locomotive 380/381 (they will be operated also in Hungary) were equipped with Mirel VZ1 instead of LS90 board unit.|$|E
50|$|It is an {{extension}} of RS4 Codici. While RS4 Codici is a simple cab signalling system that only requires the driver to acknowledge any change in the aspect of the next signal, SSB (On board sub system) RS9 equipment also continuously monitors the train speed and computes <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> according to the train's length, mass, and braking ability.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 Adif, the {{state-owned}} Administrator of Rail Infrastructure, began a systemic renewal process which would {{become known as}} [...] "ASFA Digital". The changes in the new system do not affect the beacons, which continue to transmit their information in analogue form, but rather just the signal processing equipment in the train which once digitalised will allow {{for the use of}} <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> or a better representation of the received signals in the cabin.|$|R
40|$|Part 3 : Infrastructure SecurityInternational audienceIn {{the railway}} infrastructure, {{positive}} train control (PTC) is an automated method for controlling and monitoring train movements to ensure safe travel by enforcing safe braking distances and speed limits, {{even if the}} locomotive driver fails to act within the specified guidelines. Obviously, {{it is vital to}} assure the timely delivery of control messages to the on-board computer system that implements PTC for a locomotive. In particular, the parameters for the timely delivery of control messages must be evaluated and specified. The delivery times of the control messages are directly impacted by the locomotive speed and braking characteristics. Train braking is characterized by <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> that express speed as a function of distance or position. This paper utilizes numerical techniques to convert <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> into functions of time to specify safety-driven requirements for the upper bounds on message delivery delays. Message delivery time requirements are combined with the requirement that the probability of erroneously stopping a train is very small. Rules are derived for scheduling re-transmissions of train control messages to ensure timely train braking in the event of driver error...|$|R
5000|$|ACSES {{provides}} railway trains {{with positive}} enforcement of [...] "civil" [...] speed restrictions (those {{based on the}} physical characteristics of the line). The on-board components keep track of a train's position and continuously calculates a maximum safe <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> for upcoming speed restrictions. If the train exceeds the safe <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> then the brakes are automatically applied.|$|E
5000|$|The SSB {{takes several}} {{variables}} into account, especially when computing the <b>braking</b> <b>curve,</b> such as: ...|$|E
50|$|The 500 Hz {{inductor}} can {{be found}} shortly before a main signal which actives a speed control for next 250 m. This will extend the <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> Vü1 from the 1000 Hz up to the main signal. The restricted mode after a 1000 Hz {{is followed by a}} <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> Vü2 to reduce the speed up to the main signal. While the switch speed was at 10 km/h after the 1000 Hz speed limiter (reflecting a full stop of the train) it does now follow <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> being again no more than 10 km/h at the position of the main signal. The actual braking curves depend again on the train type (which is based on the braking percent the train driver has calculated).|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} update of PZB90 to version 1.6 had important {{changes to the}} braking curves: for most train types the target speed was lowered while allowing a longer time interval. This is a change on the old Indusi specification that had fixed intervals. The new software version can use uneven times - for example train type O must have 85 km/h after 23 seconds which had been previously specified as 95 km/h after 20 seconds. The new <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> have been found by extensive simulation to get at a better tradeoff between security and efficiency so that train operation is optimized.|$|R
50|$|Charles Terront won the event, {{covering}} the 1196 km in 71 hours 22 minutes, riding a Humber bicycle from the Beeston works in England, which weighed 21.5 kilograms and {{was equipped with}} Michelin's prototype pneumatic tyres (which were patented in 1891), front <b>brake,</b> <b>curved</b> handlebars, and a chain guard. He passed his main rival Jiel-Laval from Adolphe Clément's Dunlop Clément team as he slept during the third night. Both had suffered punctures in their pneumatic tyres, but still enjoyed an advantage over riders on solid tires. Terront's arrival in Paris was watched by a crowd of 10,000 people, {{many of whom had}} waited throughout the night.|$|R
50|$|The PZ80 is a {{independent}} development of GDR based company Geräte- und Reglerwerk Teltow. There {{was a need}} for efficient train protection systems by the East-German Deutsche Reichsbahn. They wanted to gain independence of the technically obsolete I 60 supply by the West-German Siemens manufacturer and replacement imports of the Romanian I 60 Icret. The PZ80 supported all Indusi 60 modes enhanced with a number of new modes including speed control in steps of 10 km/h, continuous <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> and a restrictive mode. In 1990 the developer was sold by Treuhand institution to Siemens. So this system was the foundation of the upcoming PZB90 system.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} on board the locomotive must continually calculate the trains' current speed relative to a speed target some distance away governed by a <b>braking</b> <b>curve.</b> If the train risks {{not being able to}} slow to the speed target given the <b>braking</b> <b>curve,</b> the brakes are automatically applied and the train is immediately slowed. The speed targets are updated by information regarding fixed and dynamic speed limits determined by the track profile and signaling system.|$|E
50|$|The {{target speed}} and {{location}} {{are used to}} display the target speed and distance to the driver. The train's permitted speed is calculated using the trains <b>braking</b> <b>curve,</b> which can vary by train type, and the XG location, which is {{the distance from the}} start of the 100 m zone that is used to address the train. If the train is approaching a red signal or the beginning of an occupied block the location will match the location of the signal or block boundary. The on-board equipment will calculate the permitted speed at any point so that the train, decelerating at the deceleration indicated by its <b>braking</b> <b>curve,</b> will stop by the stopping point.|$|E
5000|$|The {{red line}} in the figure shows the [...] "monitoring speed", which is the speed which, if exceeded, the train will {{automatically}} apply the emergency brakes. When running at constant speed this is 8.75 km/h above the permitted speed for transited emergency braking (until speed is reduced) or 13.75 km/h above the permitted speed for continuous emergency braking. When approaching a stopping point, the monitoring speed follows a <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> similar to the permitted speed, but with a higher deceleration, that will bring it to zero at the stopping point. When approaching a speed restriction, the monitoring speed <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> intersects the speed restriction point at 8.75 km/h above the constant speed.|$|E
50|$|Most current PTC {{implementations}} {{also use}} the speed control unit to store a database of track profiles attached {{to some sort of}} navigation system. The unit keeps track of the train's position along the rail line and automatically enforces any speed restrictions as well as the maximum authorized speed. Temporary speed restrictions can be updated before the train departs its terminal or via wireless data links. The track data {{can also be used to}} calculate <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> based on the grade profile. The navigation system can use fixed track beacons or differential GPS stations combined with wheel rotation to accurately determine the train's location on the line within a few feet.|$|R

Under experimental conditions, the rotation speed had limited {{impact on the}} tribological properties of C/C-SiC composites when the pressure was 0. 48 MPa. The pressure had approximately {{the same effect on}} the wear rate when the rotation speed was 0. 3 m/s. The wear mechanism was mainly abrasive grain wear. While under real brake conditions, the coefficient of friction (COF) of C/C-SiC composites reached 0. 50 and the wear rate was up to 5. 95 mg/times. The COF curves showed the typical saddle shapes <b>brake</b> <b>curves.</b> Abrasive grain wear mechanism and adhere wear mechanism appeared in the early and last stages in real brake conditions...|$|R

50|$|In {{a moving}} block system {{as shown in the}} second figure, the train {{position}} and its <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> is continuously calculated by the trains, and then communicated via radio to the wayside equipment. Thus, the wayside equipment is able to establish protected areas, each one called Limit of Movement Authority (LMA), up to the nearest obstacle (in the figure the tail of the train in front).|$|E
5000|$|E.g.: if the SSB gets {{informed}} by a PI that the approaching signal is [...] "Yellow", it then automatically {{assumes that the}} next signal {{is going to be}} [...] "Red" [...] and elaborates a <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> accordingly.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design of an {{innovative}} active braking control system for two-wheeled vehicles which can handle panic <b>braking</b> on <b>curves.</b> In the field of two-wheeled vehicles the spread of electronic control systems its still in its infancy, as today only a few commercial motorbikes are equipped with Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS). Moreover, the few ABS systems available are certified to work only when panic braking occurs on straight road. As will be shown, to guarantee safety when <b>braking</b> on <b>curves,</b> the designed controller needs to rely on an online measure of the vehicle roll angle. Thus, to prove the industrial applicability of the proposed control algorithm, we also describe how such quantity can be effectively estimated via a suitable algorithm based on a low-cost sensors configuration, whose effectiveness is assessed in simulation and also on an instrumented test vehicle. The results concerning the active braking control system will be tested on a very detailed multibody simulation model of a two-wheeled vehicle, MSC BikeSi...|$|R
40|$|The IMAGINE {{railway traffic}} noise source model is described, {{which is a}} further {{elaboration}} and completion of the Harmonoise model. Within the EU project Harmonoise, a model was proposed including most of the main railway noise sources. In the IMAGINE project, complete formulation was put forward taking all relevant physical sources but also main operating conditions into account, and default source data was proposed. At a given section of track with a given traffic flow, {{for each type of}} rolling stock, a combination of operating conditions and physical sources may occur. The operating conditions are constant speed, acceleration, <b>braking,</b> <b>curving</b> and stationary operation. The physical sources are rolling noise, impact noise, traction noise, curve squeal in points or curves, broadband or tonal braking noise and aerodynamic noise. The IMAGINE models for each physical source are presented and their relevance for each operating condition is discussed. Some examples of default input data are given and measurement methods to obtain source data are outlined...|$|R
5000|$|The cab {{display unit}} (CDU) is the {{interface}} between the train operator and the cab signalling system. Early CDU's displayed simple warning indications or representations of wayside railway signals. Later on many railways and rapid transit systems would dispense with miniature in-cab signals in favour of an indication of what speed the operator was permitted to travel at. Typically this was in conjunction {{with some sort of}} Automatic Train Control speed enforcement system where it become more important for operators to run their trains at specific speeds instead of using their judgement based on signal indications. One common innovation was to integrate the speedometer and cab signal display, superimposing or juxtaposing the allowed speed with the current speed. Digital cab signalling systems that make use of datagrams with [...] "distance to target" [...] information can use simple displays that simply inform the driver when they are approaching a speed penalty or have triggered a speed penalty or more complex ones that show a moving graph of the minimum <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> permitted to reach the speed target.|$|R
5000|$|After {{acknowledging}} the warning signal the train {{has to stay}} below the <b>braking</b> <b>curve</b> (German [...] "Bremskurve") - fast trains may travel up to 165 km/h and they must reduce the speed to below 85 km/h after 23 seconds. Note that the operation of high speed trains beyond 165 km/h {{is not based on}} visual wayside signals or PZB inductors (using LZB or European Train Control System cab-signalling instead in Germany).|$|E
5000|$|Where a {{train is}} {{approaching}} a speed restriction the control center will transmit a packet with an XG location set {{to a point}} behind the speed restriction such that a train, decelerating based on its <b>braking</b> <b>curve,</b> will arrive at the correct speed {{at the start of}} the speed restriction.

50|$|The system {{begins with}} passive transponders {{attached}} between the tracks which are electrically powered by an electromagnetic field when a locomotive passes over them. The transponders digitally convey their identification information and other relevant {{bits of information}} via wires to a trackside Base Station Controller (BCM), which uses a data radio {{to communicate with the}} locomotive’s on-board computers, allowing the locomotives to know precisely when they have reached a particular waypoint.

40|$|In {{recent years}} on board digital train event {{recorder}} have been developed: these devices allow to collect very detailed data about train movements and signal status. The new Italian ATC SCMT on board subsystem {{is combined with}} the DIS (Driver Information System) that collects both kinetic behaviour and all signal and balises messages. Unfortunately, this large amount of data is normally stored but not used except for failure and maintenance management. At {{the same time the}} use of micro simulation tools has been extended to large scale problems. As known a problem exists in the calibration and validation of these models. In this paper a new tool is presented. This tool allows to analyse real-life collected data, to perform very detailed analysis of train movements, pointing out speed depending on position and signal aspects, acceleration, <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> and dwell time graphically and by means of parameters. Train behaviour can also be connected to punctuality, to find out differences between on time and late running. This tool may be very useful for: large scale model validation, definition of the stochastic behaviour of the system (travel time, dwell time, initial delay), calibration of <b>braking</b> and acceleration <b>curves</b> for various train types, acceleration percentage depending on different conditions. In other words, it allows to set up a link between real data and micro simulation models. The tool has been tested in the north-eastern part of Italy. In this case study, a significant precision increase in the stochastic simulation results has been reached...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} a comparison {{has been made}} between on one side the Dutch signalling system with ATB-EG train protection {{and on the other}} side the European signalling system ETCS Level 2. The minimum feasible headway times at bottlenecks for both systems have been compared. A selection has been made of the 22 most relevant train sequences on six often occurring infrastructure layouts. For each layout, the positioning of signals (for ATB) or block limits (for ETCS) has been sought that leads to the lowest feasible headway time for between one and four train sequences. To enable fast calculation and comparison of the headway times at different signal positionings a spreadsheet calculation model has been developed for both signalling systems. In 15 of the 22 train sequences, the European system ETCS L 2 yielded a shorter headway time than the Dutch system ATB-EG. The improvements ranged from 1, 1 s to 21, 3 s, which corresponds to savings of up to 21 %. In the other 7 train sequences, the headway times found in {{this research}} for ETCS L 2 were higher than those that could be reached in the Dutch signalling system when applying the appropriate signal positions. When averaged over all 22 train sequences, ETCS L 2 gives a 4, 5 % reduction of the headway time. When only averaging the 16 train sequences that don’t involve freight trains, the reduction more than doubles to an average of 9, 3 %. The main differences between the two signalling systems that contribute to the better performance of the European system are the fact that the <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> are block-independent, train-dependant and speed-dependant and that there is a very low minimum block length. The research presented three types of limitations that could prevent signals from being placed on the exact location where they would be needed (level crossings, overhead section breaks and neutral overhead section breaks) and investigated the sensitivity of the found minimum headway times, which showed that the values found for ETCS L 2 are much more robust and that the required block limit positionings contain much more flexibility. The results from the research were applied on the corridor Weesp – Almere Oostvaarders, showing again that ETCS would bring more buffer time increases and require less infrastructure adaptations. To improve the accuracy of future studies comparing the Dutch and European signalling systems, focus should be put on obtaining more certainty about the ETCS <b>braking</b> <b>curves</b> of the representative Dutch passenger rolling stock.
