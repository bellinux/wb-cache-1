5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> {{typically}} monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
5|$|Although OR-7 was {{the first}} gray wolf to visit California in nearly 100 years, other wolves have since {{migrated}} to Siskiyou County, {{just south of the}} Oregon–California border. In 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) released a photo of the Shasta Pack, consisting of two adults and five pups. The <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> came from the same pack as OR-7, making them his siblings. In 2017, the CDFW and the U.S. Forest Service determined that at least three wolf pups from a second pack, the Lassen Pack, can be traced to OR-7. One of OR-7s male offspring mated with another wolf to produce the pups, the birth of which made Journey a grandfather. The Lassen Pack, which lives in Lassen National Forest, is California's second pack since wolves were eradicated from the state in the 1920s. In June 2017, CDFW biologists fitted the female of the Lassen Pack <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> with a tracking collar.|$|E
5|$|Local people {{sometimes}} take pups for the exotic pet trade or as pets for themselves, but the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates {{the story of}} an Arawak Indian who took two pups from their parents. While revealing of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was a profound blow to the <b>breeding</b> <b>pair,</b> which went on to lose their territory to competitors.|$|E

5000|$|The sparsely vegetated islands, with a {{collective}} area of 163 ha, {{have been identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because together they support over 1% of the world populations of short-tailed shearwaters (c. 950,000 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs),</b> fairy prions (c. 27,000 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs),</b> little penguins (c. 16,500 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs)</b> and black-faced cormorants (up to 230 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs).</b> [...] Pacific gulls and sooty oystercatchers also nest in the islands.|$|R
50|$|Bowen Island {{is home to}} an {{important}} little penguin colony, with some 5000 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs.</b> The population has increased from 1000 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> in 1979, to 1500 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> in 1985 and 2500 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> in 1993. In 2012, just over 50 individuals were marked {{as part of a}} little penguin research project. DNA samples were also collected and some birds were micro-chipped. The Bowen Island colony was revisited several times in 2013 with results to be published in a forthcoming PhD thesis.|$|R
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|Ideal tank mates for convict {{cichlids}} {{consists of}} robust similar sized fish. Such fish include T-Bar cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E
40|$|Four {{species of}} {{albatross}} breed on Macquarie Island, a small subantarctic island located halfway between Australia and Antarctica. Three {{of these species}} (Wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), Black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophrys) and Grey-headed albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma)) are particularly at risk from elevated mortality levels due to {{the small size of}} the breeding populations. Wandering albatrosses have the smallest breeding population of approximately ten <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> each year (total breeding population estimated as 19 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs),</b> followed by Black-browed albatrosses with approximately 40 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> each year (total breeding population 38 - 45 pairs) and Grey-headed albatrosses, with 65 - 75 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> each year (total breeding population 100 - 120 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs).</b> Light-mantled sooty albatrosses (Phoebetria palpebrata) are more abundant on Macquarie Island (total breeding population estimated at 1500 - 1800 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs)</b> and this population represents around 5 - 10...|$|R
50|$|The IBA was {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of West Indian whistling ducks (with 135 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs),</b> least terns (with 60 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs)</b> and white-crowned pigeons.|$|R

5|$|Details {{of giant}} otter {{reproduction}} and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided {{much of the}} information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, {{with an average of}} two. Research over five years on a <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{both parents}} care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the {{responsibility}} of only one sex. In some species, other members of the same species—usually close relatives of the <b>breeding</b> <b>pair,</b> such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.|$|E
5|$|The European {{population}} of the storm petrel has been estimated at 430,000–510,000 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> or 1,290,000–1,530,000 individual birds and makes up 95% of the world total numbers.

In 2007 74 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> were recorded at the fishponds at Irmapuszta, which is about 40 percent of the recognized <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> at Lake Balaton and its surroundings and 6 - 10 percent of the total <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> in Hungary...|$|R
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the war in the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E
5|$|Nominate T. merula may {{commence}} breeding in March, but {{eastern and}} Indian races are {{a month or}} more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as ivy, holly, hawthorn, honeysuckle or pyracantha. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate T. merula are 2.9×2.1centimetres (1.14×0.93in) in size and weigh 7.2grammes (0.25oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.|$|E
5|$|When hunting large prey, {{the coyote}} often works in pairs or small groups. Success in killing large {{ungulates}} depends on {{factors such as}} snow depth and crust density. Younger animals usually avoid participating in such hunts, with the <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> typically {{doing most of the}} work. Unlike the wolf, which attacks large prey from the rear, the coyote approaches from the front, lacerating its prey's head and throat. Like other canids, the coyote caches excess food. Coyotes catch mouse-sized rodents by pouncing, whereas ground squirrels are chased. Although coyotes can live in large groups, small prey is typically caught singly. Coyotes have been observed to kill porcupines in pairs, using their paws to flip the rodents on their backs, then attacking the soft underbelly. Only old and experienced coyotes can successfully prey on porcupines, with many predation attempts by young coyotes resulting in them being injured by their prey's quills. Coyotes sometimes urinate on their food, possibly to claim ownership over it.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} birds {{plummeted}} to three pairs in 1983 but intensive conservation efforts {{were put in}} place and numbers increased so that in 1998 the population totalled some 25 to 30 birds with 10 to 12 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> spread over three breeding sites. Numbers have continued to increase and by 2006 had reached 30 to 40 individuals including 12 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs.</b> Five years later, numbers have increased again to 40 to 45 individuals and around 10 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|R
40|$|From 13 to 18 December 1998, {{we counted}} Chatham Island Oystercatchers (Haematopus chathamensis) on {{approximately}} 310 km (96 - 97 %) of the coastlines of Chatham, Pitt, Rangatira, and Mangere Islands, and 100 km (100 %) of {{the shore of}} Te Whanga Lagoon, Chatham Island. A total of 142 adult Chatham Island Oystercatchers, including 34 confirmed <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> and seven additional possible <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs,</b> was found. This is an increase of 20 to 40 adults over any previous count or estimate.

5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a <b>breeding</b> <b>pair</b> and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A <b>breeding</b> <b>pair,</b> with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
50|$|The lake is an {{important}} breeding ground for terns. It is estimated that the lake is home to over 1,200 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> of Sandwich terns and, more importantly, to 150 <b>breeding</b> <b>pairs</b> of the rare roseate tern; {{this is the second}} largest colony in Europe.|$|R
