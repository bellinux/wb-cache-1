This paper presents a bird strike simulated by blocking four stator blade passages. It includes the numerical {{results of the}} unsteady low-frequency aerodynamic forces and the aeroelastic behaviour caused by a non-symmetric upstream flow affecting the first two rotor <b>blade</b> <b>stages</b> in the axial-compressor of a jet engine. The obtained results show that disturbances in the engine inlet strongly influence the level of unsteady forces acting on the rotor blades. With a partially blocked inlet the whole spectrum of low-frequency harmonics is observed. Such harmonics can lead to rotor blade damage. The low-frequency amplitudes are higher in the first <b>stage</b> rotor <b>blades</b> than in the second stage.

Development a MHT with multi <b>stage</b> <b>blade</b> (runner) for water velocity ranges from 0. 5 m/s to 1. 0 m/s is the novelty of this research. Findings of literature review on MHT and simulation results of ANSYS CFD software are the basis of designing this research project. The vital parameters involved in designing the turbine were <b>blade</b> area, <b>blade</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>blades</b> position against water flow direction, spacing between blades, blade materials; and other technical factors associated with turbine operations. The study revealed that the turbine had started to extract energy at water velocity 0. 3 m/s at 35 RPM turbine speed. At water inlet velocity 1. 1 m/s, the velocity drop across blade was 25. 6 % and the energy extraction efficiency was 48. 3 %.

40|$|The {{exhaust hood}} of a steam turbine is a vital area of {{turbomachinery}} research its performance strongly influences the power output of the last <b>stage</b> <b>blades.</b> It {{is well known that}} accurate CFD simulations are only achieved when the last <b>stage</b> <b>blades</b> are coupled to the exhaust hood to capture the strong interaction. This however presents challenges as the calculation size grows rapidly when the full annulus is calculated. The size of the simulation means researchers are constantly searching of methods to reduce the computational effort without compromising solution accuracy. This work uses a novel approach, by coupling the last <b>stage</b> <b>blades</b> and exhaust hood by the Non-Linear Harmonic Method, a technique widely used to reduce calculation size in high pressure turbine blades and axial compressors. This has been benchmarked against the widely adopted Mixing Plane method. The test case used is the Generic Geometry, a representative exhaust hood and last <b>stage</b> <b>blade</b> geometry that is free from confidentiality and IP restrictions and for which first calculations were presented at last year’s conference [1]. The results show that the non-uniform exhaust hood inlet flow can be captured using the non-liner harmonic method, an effect not previously achievable with single passage coupled calculations such as the mixing plane approach. This offers a significant computational saving, estimated to be a quarter of the computation time compared with alternative methods of capturing the asymmetry with full annulus frozen rotor calculations...|$|R

40|$|Currently tip timing {{methods are}} the pseudo {{industry}} standard for measuring Gas Turbine blade vibration. The physical placement of tip timing probes is however reasonably prohibitive {{due to the}} high pressure/temperature environment of a turbine. A simpler method of sensor setup would be {{through the use of}} externally mounted accelerometers to measure the casing vibration response and relate this back to the internal blade vibration. The vibration of a gas turbine casing is driven by the strong rotating pressure which develops around the rotating <b>blade</b> <b>stages.</b> The oscillating motion of the rotor blades phase modulates this pressure signal. An analytical formulation of the internal pressure signal is developed in this paper. The effects of blade motion on this internal pressure signal is then investigated as the speed of the engine is increased/decreased such that the driving frequency traverses a rotor blade natural frequency. Experimental measurements on a simplified test turbine are presented comparing the results of the analytical internal pressure signal along with results of the measured casing vibration during engine run up/down. It is shown that the spectrum of the internal pressure and casing vibration signal contains information which can be used to estimate the rotor blade natural frequencies...|$|R

The aerodynamic performance of turbine stage {{can be improved}} by using swept blade. In this paper, the RANS method and the RNG k-ε turbulence mode were adopted to investigate the unsteady flow characteristics and excitation force of swept <b>blade</b> <b>stage.</b> According to the results, for the swept blade, the fluid of boundary layer shifts in radial direction due {{to the influence of}} geometric construction. It is observed that there is similar wake development for several kinds of stators, and the wake has a notable effect on the boundary layer of the rotor blades. When compared with straight blade, pressure fluctuation of forward-swept blade is decreased while the pressure fluctuation of backward-swept blade is increased. The axial and tangential fundamental frequency excitation force factors of 15 °forward-swept blade are 0. 139 and 0. 052 respectively, which are the least, and all excitation force factors are in the normal range. The excitation factor of the forward-swept blade is decreased compared with straight blade, and the decreasing percentage is closely related to the swept angle. As for backward-swept blades, the situation is the other way around. Additionally, the change of axial excitation factor is more obvious. So the vibration reduction performance of forward-swept blade is better...|$|R
