40|$|Summary. This {{report is}} an {{extension}} of previous theoretical investigations of the elastic buckling in shear of flat plates reinforced by transverse stiffeners. The plates are treated as infinitely long and simply-supported along the long sides. Stiffeners are spaced at regular intervals, dividing the plate into a nuraber of panels of uniform size. The effect of bending and torsional stiffnesses of the sLiffeners upon the <b>buckling</b> shear <b>stress</b> is calculated for the complete range of stiffnesses, for panels with ratios of width to stiffener spacing of 1, 2 and 5. The results are presented in tabular and graphical forms. 1. I~¢troduction. [...] Accurate knowledge of the <b>buckling</b> shear <b>stresses</b> of flat plates is necessary for the design of web beams and of panels in fuselage skins and wing surfaces. In this report <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> are obtained for infinitely-long flat plates, simply-supported along the edges and reinforced by equally spaced transverse stiffeners that have both bending and torsional stiffness. But these <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> can be used with little error in calculating the <b>buckling</b> shear <b>stress</b> of finite sheet-stringer combinations if the buclding pattern is repeated several times along the length. <b>Buckling</b> shear <b>stresses</b> of infinitely-long plates with transverse stiffeners were calculated by Schmieden 1, SeydeP and Wang a for plates with weak stiffeners, and by Budiansky, Conner an...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} column tests on cold-formed steel {{built-up}} closed sections with intermediate stiffeners {{is presented in}} this paper. The test specimens were first brake pressed from structural steel sheets to form open sections with intermediate web stiffeners, then two of the open sections were connected at their flanges using self-tapping screws to form the built-up closed sections. The high strength structural steel sheets had the measured 0. 2 % proof stress up to 586 MPa. Initial and overall geometric imperfections as well as material properties and residual stresses of the test specimens were measured. Tests were performed over a range of lengths such that column curves could be obtained. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the direct strength method in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures.

The strength of the cold-formed steel sections is calculated using the Direct Strength Method, and the rules developed in the present work to automatically determine the local and distortional elastic <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> from the Finite Strip and constrained Finite Strip Methods are discussed. The rules are verified against conventional and optimum sections yielded in this research, and found to accurately predict the elastic <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses.</b> The optimisation method is applied to singly-symmetric (mono-symmetric) cold-formed steel columns, and the operators behind the method for the special case of singly-symmetric open profiles are introduced in this paper. "Optimum" cross-sections for simply supported columns, 1. 2 mm thick, free to warp and subjected to a compressive axial load of 75 kN are presented for column lengths ranging from 1000 to 2500 mm. Results show that the optimum cross-sections are found in a relatively low number of generations, and typically shape to non-conventional "bean", "oval" or rounded "S" sections. The algorithm optimises for distortional and global buckling, therefore likely subjecting the cross-sections to buckling interaction.

40|$|In routine {{design of}} steel storage rack frames, {{it is far}} more common to perform two {{dimensional}} (2 D) rather than three dimensional (3 D) linear buckling analyses. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the global buckling behavior of high-rise steel storage rack frames may not be revealed by 2 D buckling analyses as 3 D interaction modes are involved. It is shown that the monosymmetric upright columns of a high-rise rack frame fail in a flexural–torsional mode due to the shear-center eccentricity of the sections, and that the 3 D frame buckling analysis is more reliable in determining the critical members of a rack frame. Current steel storage rack design standards combine independent 2 D flexural buckling analyses and simplified flexural–torsional buckling analysis of individual columns to account for 3 D behavior. Comparisons between the <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> of the rack columns determined from 3 D buckling analyses and the <b>buckling</b> <b>stresses</b> determined in accordance with the steel storage racking standards are presented.
