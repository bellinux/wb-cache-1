Braking system concept always follows principle of normal force which it is using friction force method for rubbing on <b>lining</b> <b>pad</b> of disc brake. Braking system must able to overcome circumstances when working on high level of velocity and stopping on safe circumstances. In this research field orientation, a number of disc brake with sum of different venting holes are being tested by giving variable of velocity from 20 to 80 km/hours and being interfaced by different braking pressure (4 to 6 kg) on <b>lining</b> <b>pad</b> of disc brake on stationary test. In conclusion, the results show 24 venting holes which have been giving effective performing amongst all of the other of venting holes. Similar to other of venting holes with pertaining velocity of vehicle and braked pressure can be explained clearly with significant chart when it is going to develop by interfacing control system for finding effective stopping time especially when brake pad of disc brake will be produced in manufacturing process as product consideration...|$|R

50|$|A similar use {{has been}} adopted by {{programming}} language compilers such as Java compiler to point out where a compilation error has occurred. In addition to indicating the line number and column number of the error location, the compiler prints out the faulty line of code and uses a single caret on the next <b>line,</b> <b>padded</b> by spaces, to give a visual indication of the error location. The caret acts as an upwards-pointing arrow in the text-based print out of the error details.|$|R

To this end they contained up to three chambers in which a single machine gun could be placed.

2500|$|As {{part of the}} war {{planning}} {{conducted by}} Schlieffen and then Moltke between 1898 and 1914, a plan had been made to isolate Antwerp, to counter the possibility that Belgian forces reinforced by British troops, would threaten the northern flank of the German armies involved in the invasion of France.

In 1914 the siege was conducted by only six divisions, one of which was needed to guard the Liège–Brussels railway between Tienen and Brussels and the ground between Brussels and Antwerp.
