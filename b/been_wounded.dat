5|$|After {{crossing}} the Rio Grande and arriving at Ojo de Agua at approximately 1am, the Mexican raiders attacked the village's garrison. The American {{soldiers who had}} been sleeping in a wooden building stubbornly resisted. The Americans were heavily outgunned, though, as the Signal Corps personnel were armed only with pistols.

5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having <b>been</b> <b>wounded</b> in action.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{soldiers}} {{had not been}} eligible for the Victoria Cross until 1911, instead they received the Indian Order of Merit, an older decoration originally {{set up in the}} days of East India Company rule in India.

The operation (codenamed Operation Khukri) was eventually launched on 10 July. Two RAF Chinooks transported Indian special forces {{to the outskirts of}} Kailahun. The helicopters returned to Freetown with Harrison, his fellow UNMOs, and several Gurkhas who had <b>been</b> <b>wounded</b> during the siege.

5|$|A second scandal {{occurred}} in 1936 when Blamey attempted {{to cover up}} details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O'Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. The story put about was that Brophy had taken two women friends and a chauffeur along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While {{they were waiting for}} the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself <b>been</b> <b>wounded.</b> In order to cover up the identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release to the effect that Brophy had accidentally shot himself (three times). The Premier, Albert Dunstan, gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.|$|E
5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already <b>been</b> <b>wounded</b> several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E
5|$|As {{detected}} by the British, repairs to Tirpitz following Operation Tungsten progressed quickly. Work on repairing the battleship began in late April, and 157 shipyard workers and special equipment were transported from Kiel in Germany to Kaafjord {{to accelerate the}} project. Assisted by the long hours of daylight at Kaafjord's latitude during summer, three shifts of personnel worked on Tirpitz each day. The battleship was capable of moving under her own power by 2 June, and ready to begin gunnery exercises {{at the end of}} that month. The repair works concluded in mid-July, though the battleship's starboard propeller shaft could only be used to drive her forwards. Captain Wolf Junge assumed command of the battleship in May 1944, replacing Captain Hans Meyer who had <b>been</b> <b>wounded</b> during Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5000|$|It's {{just as if}} a man <b>were</b> <b>wounded</b> with {{an arrow}} thickly smeared with poison.
