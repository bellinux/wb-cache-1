XRD data are noticeably different for the two materials {{and the presence of}} an intercalated new phase is obvious for the first material. Elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicate that intercalated LDH contains much more <b>benzoyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> than adsorbed LDH, while TGA further suggests stronger interactions between the host and the organic anion in the former case. The Fourier transform/infra red (FT/IR) spectrum of the intercalated sample shows no modification of the carbonyl vibration of the <b>benzoyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> moiety upon intercalation within LDH, whereas the diffuse reflectance UV (DRUV) spectrum is strongly modified relative to that of the adsorbed sample. Both intercalated and adsorbed LDHs proved to be efficient and selective sensitizers for the photo-oxidation of di-n-butylsulfide in oxygenated acetonitrile solution. The intercalated photo-sensitizer was efficiently recycled for three successive runs. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the material after irradiation, the major drawback of these supported sensitizers is the partial replacement of the benzoate anion within the LDH by sulfate and sulfonate anions arising from sulfide oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{patterns}} of pediculocidal drug resistance towards head louse {{laid the foundation}} for research in exploring novel anti-lice agents from medicinal plants. In the present study, various extracts of Pongamia pinnata leaves were tested against the head louse Pediculus humanus capitis. A filter paper diffusion method was conducted for determining the potential pediculocidal and ovicidal activity of chloroform, petroleum ether, methanol, and water extracts of P. pinnata leaves. The findings revealed that petroleum ether extracts possess excellent anti-lice activity with values ranging between 50. 3 % and 100 % where as chloroform and methanol extracts showed moderate pediculocidal effects. The chloroform and methanol extracts were also successful in inhibiting nymph emergence and the petroleum ether extract was the most effective with a complete inhibition of emergence. Water extract was devoid of both pediculocidal and ovicidal activities. All the results were well comparable with <b>benzoyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> (25 % w/v). These results showed the prospect of using P. pinnata leave extracts against P. humanus capitis in difficult situations of emergence of resistance to synthetic anti-lice agents...|$|E

40|$|Anaerobic {{mineralization}} of ethylbenzene by the denitrifying bacterium Azoarcus sp. strain EB 1 {{was recently}} {{shown to be}} initiated by dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to 1 -phenylethanol. 1 -Phenylethanol is converted to <b>benzoate</b> (<b>benzoyl</b> coenzyme A) via acetophenone as transient intermediate. We developed in vitro assays to examine ethylbenzene dehydrogenase and 1 -phenylethanol dehydrogenase activities in cell extracts of this strain. With p-benzoquinone as the electron acceptor, cell extracts of Azoarcus sp. strain EB 1 catalyzed ethylbenzene oxidation at a specific rate of 10 nmol min− 1 [mg of protein]− 1 and an apparent Km for ethylbenzene of approximately 60 μM. The membrane-associated ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity was found to oxidize 4 -fluoroethylbenzene and propylbenzene {{but was unable to}} transform 4 -chloro-ethylbenzene, the ethyltoluenes, and styrene. Enzymatic ethylbenzene oxidation was stereospecific, with (S) -(−) - 1 -phenylethanol being the only enantiomer detected by chiral high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. Moreover, cell extracts catalyzed the oxidation of (S) -(−) - 1 -phenylethanol but not of (R) -(+) - 1 -phenylethanol to acetophenone. When cell extracts were dialyzed, (S) -(−) - 1 -phenylethanol oxidation occurred only in the presence of NAD+, suggesting that NAD+ is the physiological electron acceptor of 1 -phenylethanol dehydrogenase. Both ethylbenzene dehydrogenase and 1 -phenylethanol dehydrogenase activities were present in Azoarcus sp. strain EB 1 cells that were grown anaerobically on ethylbenzene, 1 -phenylethanol, and acetophenone, but these activities were absent in benzoate-grown cells...|$|R
