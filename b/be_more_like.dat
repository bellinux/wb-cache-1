5|$|The Jackson's {{hartebeest}} {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. The African Antelope Database (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest. From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to {{the southern part of the}} Rift Valley it tends to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Coke's hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because {{of the amount of}} diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans for}} the moving of Star Trek: The Experience stalled when Neonopolis lost the license due to {{noncompliance}} with {{the terms of the}} contract caused by a lack of funding.

25|$|Most {{of these}} {{shortcomings}} on Olympic would {{be addressed in}} her 1913 refit, which altered the configuration of Olympics First-Class sections to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> those of Titanic. Although the A-Deck Promenade remained open for the entirety of Olympics career, the B-Deck promenade was vetoed and staterooms added like those on Titanic, {{as well as a}} Café Parisien and enlarged restaurant.|$|E

Elasticity and general chemical behaviour <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> nonmetals. Electrical conductivity, band structure, ionization energy, electronegativity, and oxides are intermediate between the two.|$|R

25|$|Because of {{the covert}} nature {{surrounding}} this particular {{branch of the}} Wizarding government, the Department of Mysteries can be likened to real-world intelligence agencies like the CIA or MI6 in that most of their operations are kept in total secrecy from the general wizard populace. However, the primary operations of the department seem to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> those of scientists {{as they attempt to}} uncover the sources and rules that govern magic.|$|E
25|$|The contra-auguste {{plays the}} role of the {{mediator}} between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.|$|E
25|$|Catherine Earnshaw: First {{introduced}} to the reader after her death, through Lockwood's discovery of her diary and carvings. The description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume. She seems unsure whether she is, or wants to become, more like Heathcliff, or aspires to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Edgar. Some critics have argued that her decision to marry Edgar Linton is allegorically a rejection of nature and a surrender to culture, a choice with unfortunate, fateful consequences {{for all the other}} characters.|$|E

25|$|Marianne Dashwood – the romantically {{inclined}} and eagerly expressive second {{daughter of}} Mr and Mrs Henry Dashwood. She is 16 {{years old at}} the beginning of the book. She is the object of the attentions of Colonel Brandon and Mr Willoughby. She is attracted to young, handsome, romantically spirited Willoughby and does not think much of the older, more reserved Colonel Brandon. Marianne undergoes the most development within the book, learning her sensibilities have been selfish. She decides her conduct should <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of her elder sister, Elinor.|$|E
25|$|Other proa {{designers}} {{blur the}} lines between Atlantic and Pacific style proas. The Harryproa from Australia uses a long, thin hull to lee, and a short, fat hull, containing the cabin, to windward. This would normally <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an Atlantic proa, but the rig is on the lee hull, leaving it technically a Pacific design. This and other similar proas place {{the bulk of the}} passenger accommodations on the ama, in an attempt to make the vaka as streamlined as possible, and put much of the mass in the lee side to provide a greater righting moment.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, {{money market}} funds fell under the {{jurisdiction}} of the SEC as they appeared to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> investments (most similar to traditional stocks and bonds) vs. deposits and loans (cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers). Although {{money market funds}} are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator, the SEC, has zero mandate to control the supply of money, limit the overall extension of credit, mitigate against boom and bust cycles, etc. The SEC’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk, and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets. After adequate disclosure, the SEC adopts a hands off, let the buyer beware attitude.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} {{elements}} of period 8 {{are expected to}} be ununennium and unbinilium, elements 119 and 120. Their electron configurations should have the 8s orbital being filled. This orbital is relativistically stabilized and contracted and thus, elements 119 and 120 should <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> rubidium and strontium than their immediate neighbours above, francium and radium. Another effect of the relativistic contraction of the 8s orbital is that the atomic radii of these two elements should be about the same of those of francium and radium. They should behave like normal alkali and alkaline earth metals, normally forming +1 and +2 oxidation states respectively, but the relativistic destabilization of the 7p3/2 subshell and the relatively low ionization energies of the 7p3/2 electrons should make higher oxidation states like +3 and +4 (respectively) possible as well.|$|E
25|$|Athena {{is shown}} to have an aegis diagonally across her peplos in the sculpture. The aegis has a {{miniature}} Gorgon's head on it along with a border of snakes. Its small dimensions make it to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a marker of Athena’s identity than an actual piece of armament. The diagonal positioning of the aegis is seen to give Athena a swaying motion — some say {{in order to have}} the viewer’s eye look towards what Athena was holding in her right hand. There is a hole in the palm of the right hand and the right thumb indicating that Athena was originally holding an item, but that item's identity it is not certain. Some suggest it might have been an owl or the representation of victory, Nike. It is also thought that Athena may have held in her left hand a spear or a shield.|$|E
25|$|As President, Erdoğan has overseen {{a revival}} of Ottoman tradition, {{greeting}} Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas with an Ottoman-style ceremony in the new presidential palace, with guards dressed in costumes representing founders of 16 Great Turkish Empires in history. While serving as the Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdoğan's AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling their supporters 'grandsons of Ottomans' (Osmanlı torunu). This proved controversial, since it was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of modern Turkey founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In 2015, Erdoğan made a statement in which he endorsed the old Ottoman term külliye to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word kampüs. Many critics have thus accused Erdoğan of wanting to become an Ottoman sultan and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of the Republic. When pressed on this issue in January 2015, Erdoğan denied these claims {{and said that he}} would aim to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom rather than like an Ottoman sultan.|$|E
