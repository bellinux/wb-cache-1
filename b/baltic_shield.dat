25|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} Europe traces {{back to the}} formation of the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield</b> (Fennoscandia) and the Sarmatian craton, both around 2.25billion years ago, followed by the Volgo–Uralia shield, the three together leading to the East European craton (≈ Baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia. Around 1.1billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading {{to the formation of}} Pangea. Around 190million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago.|$|E

During a two-day meeting prior to the field trip, twelve North American and eleven Soviet geologists presented papers, and participants discussed a variety of problems and ideas in Precambrian stratigraphy, sedimentology, tectonics, magmatism, industrial minerals, and metallogeny. Special emphasis was placed on problems of correlation.

50|$|The <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as the Fennoscandian Shield, is located in Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden and Finland), northwest Russia, northern Denmark and under the Baltic Sea. The <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield</b> is defined as the exposed Precambrian northwest segment of the East European Craton. It is composed mostly of Archean and Proterozoic gneisses and greenstones which have undergone numerous deformations through tectonic activity (see Geology of Fennoscandia map http://www.nrm.se/theswedishmuseumofnaturalhistory/researchandcollections/geology/laboratoryforisotopegeology/geologyoffennoscandia.291_en.html). The <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield</b> contains the oldest rocks of the European continent. The lithospheric thickness is about 200-300 km. During the Pleistocene epoch, great continental ice sheets scoured and depressed the shield's surface, leaving a thin covering of glacial material and innumerable lakes and streams.

40|$|A 2 -D pro¢le for the {{shear wave}} {{velocity}} and anisotropy between Egypt and Spitsbergen is presented. The pro¢le is constructed using fundamental- and higher-mode Love and Rayleigh waves recorded by stations of the NARS-DEEP, IRIS and GEOFON networks. The surface wave data have been inverted for shear velocity and anisotropy using a waveform inversion. In the eastern Mediterranean lithosphere we observe a large di¡erence (7 per cent) between SH and SV velocities. We interpret this anomaly as an anisotropic oceanic lithosphere beneath the eastern Mediterranean, an inter-pretation {{which is consistent with}} tectonic reconstructions of the region. The east European continent is imaged as a high-velocity body whose thickness increases with the estimated age of the lithosphere. The continental root of the Ukrainian and <b>Baltic</b> <b>shields</b> and east European platform extends to a depth of 200 km. This is in contrast to the surrounding younger continental regions which appear to be less than 100 km thick. We further studied the structure of the continental lithosphere by investigating a possible relation between seismic velocities and tectonic age. Both a logarithmic and a square root relation have been ¢tted to the average seismic velocities in each tectonic region. The data slightly favour a logarithmic relation but a square root relation cannot be excluded. Key words: anisotropy, continental evolution, eastern Europe, seismic tomography, surface waves. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The Palaeoproterozoic {{crust and}} upper mantle {{in the region}} between the Ukrainian and <b>Baltic</b> <b>shields</b> of the East European Craton were built up finally during {{collision}} of the previously independent Fennoscandian and Sarmatian crustal segments at c. 1. 8 - 1. 7 Ga. EUROBRIDGE seismic profiling and geophysical modelling across the southwestern part of the Craton suggest that the Central Belarus Suture Zone is the junction between the two colliding segments. This junction is marked by strong deformation of the crust {{and the presence of}} a metamorphic core complex. At 1. 80 - 1. 74 Ga, major late to post-collisional extension and magmatism affected the part of Sarmatia adjoining the Central Belarus Zone and generated a high-velocity layer {{at the base of the}} crust. Other sutures separating terranes of different ages are found within Sarmatia and in the Polish-Lithuanian part of Fennoscandia. While Fennoscandia and Sarmatia were still a long distance apart, orogeny was dominantly accretionary. The accreted Palaeoproterozoic terranes in the Baltic-Belarus region of Fennoscandia are all younger than 2. 0 Ga (2. 0 - 1. 9, 1. 90 - 1. 85 and 1. 84 - 1. 82 Ga), whereas those in Sarmatia have ages of c. 2. 2 - 2. 1 and 2. 0 - 1. 95 Ga. Lithospheric deformation and magmatism at c. 1. 50 - 1. 45 Ga, and Devonian rifting, are also defined by the EUROBRIDGE seismic and gravity models...|$|R

50|$|Thought to be {{formerly}} part of {{an ancient}} continent, the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield</b> grew in size through collisions with neighbouring crustal fragments. The mountains created by these tectonic processes have since been eroded to their bases, the region being largely flat today. Through five successive Pleistocene glaciations and subsequent retreats, the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield</b> has been scoured clean of its overlying sediments, leaving expansive areas (most within Scandinavia) exposed. It is therefore of importance to geophysicists studying the geologic history and dynamics of eastern Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{distinguishable}} physiographic {{aspect of}} the East European Craton is the extensive 3-km and more-thick Riphean (middle to late Proterozoic) sedimentary cover over its 3000-km-wide platform area (East European Platform, EEP, also {{formerly known as the}} Russian Platform) [...] This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} exposed northwest portion of the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield,</b> and the Ukrainian Shield in the southwest. The lithospheric thickness also varies widely from 150-200 km in Ukraine to 120 km in southern Russia to over 250 km thick in the NE <b>Baltic</b> <b>Shield,</b> with extremely wide thickness fluctuations of the crustal layers. A shield in any craton is the area of exposed crystalline crust while the other part of the craton is the “platform” where the crystalline crust or basement is overlaid by younger sedimentary cover.

40|$|Late Proterozoic and Palaeozoic (pre-Permian) palaeomagnetic {{data from}} all regions {{involved}} in, or adjacent to, the Caledonian-Appalachian orogenic belt are reviewed. Between about 1100 and about 800 Ma the Laurentian and <b>Baltic</b> <b>shields</b> were close together, {{prior to the}} opening phase of the Caledonian-Appalachian Wilson cycle. The problems of tectonic interpretation of Palaeozoic palaeomagnetic data from within and around the belt derive mostly from differences of typically 10 °- 20 ° between the pole positions. These can variously be interpreted in terms of (i) relative displacements between different continents or terranes, (ii) differences in ages of remanence and (iii) aberrations due to inadequacy of data or geomagnetic complexity, {{and it is not}} always easy to discriminate between these alternatives. If the Pangaea A 2 reassembly of continents around the northern and central Atlantic is taken as the end-product of Caledonian-Appalachian orogenesis, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. Lower Palaeozoic palaeolatitude differences between the N American and British-Scandinavian margins of the Caledonides are small; hence any convergence must have been mainly E-W. 2. There are additional differences which could be due to major pre-Carboniferous strike-slip (more than 1000 km), although later strike-slip on this scale is no longer considered likely. 3. The Lower Palaeozoic apparent polar wander paths for Northern Scotland and N America disagree on face value, but must be reconciled if their conventionally assumed geographic relation is correct. 4. Lower Old Red Sandstone data from Britain and Norway disagree, but this {{is more likely to be}} due to magnetic overprinting in the Norwegian rocks than to remnant oceans between the regions of Old Red Sandstone facies. 5. Armorica seems to have been far to the S, adjacent to Gondwana, in Ordovician time. The latest view is that it collided with Euramerica in early Devonian time to form the Old Red Continent. 6. The timing of Gondwana's collision with the Old Red Continent is controversial; it is within either the late Devonian or the Carboniferous. If it occurred early in that time range, much of Hercynian-Alleghanian orogeny post-dated it...|$|R

40|$|Some Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) {{revealed}} low velocity layers in {{the upper}} and middle crust of old platforms. The layers are often characterised by a lower electrical resistivity. It is not clear, however, how reliable the layers recognized from DSS data are, if they are regular or occasional events and how they correlate with other geophysical parameters. To answer these questions the experimental DSS data obtained in the <b>Baltic</b> and Ukranian <b>shields</b> by different institutions were reinterpreted by the author with unified methods. The shield areas are well studied using both the DSS and high-frequency magnetotelluric sounding (MTS) methods. As a result a marked velocity inversion (waveguide) was observed in a 10 to 20 km depth range {{in the majority of}} the DSS profiles. An increase in the electrical conductivity is typical for the waveguide. A comparison of the results with the data from other platform regions allow the conclusion that this low velocity and high electrical conductivity layer has a global significance. In the continental crust, the layer is characterised by changes in the reflectivity pattern, earthquakes number and changes in velocity pattern where the block structure is transformed into a subhorizontal layering. These structural features suggest that the layers separate brittle and weak parts of the crust. Usually they play the role of detachment zones at crustal block moving. A possible factor responsible for this phenomenon is an increase in porosity and in the salinity of the waveguide pore water compared with the upper crust. This suggestion is confirmed by the Kola superdeep borehole data. Porosity increasing in the middle crust is explained by the change in rock mechanical properties with depth, by fracturing porosity and by dilatancy effect, at a depth of 10 - 20 km...|$|R
