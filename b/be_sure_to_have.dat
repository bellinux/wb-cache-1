In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose [...] "Rock Around the Clock" [...] had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{will be so}} nice! And then I shall <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{you with}} me the first moment I see them. I shall think it very awful when I first meet your father." ...|$|E
60|$|Precious {{the books}} {{will be to}} me. I hope not to wait to read them till they reach me, {{as there is a}} {{bookseller}} here who will <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them. Thank you, thank you.|$|E
