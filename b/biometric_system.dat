50|$|Adaptive {{biometric}} Systems aim to auto-update the templates or {{model to}} the intra-class variation of the operational data. The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive <b>biometric</b> <b>system,</b> one no longer needs to collect {{a large number of}} biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to re-enroll or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a <b>biometric</b> <b>system.</b> Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the <b>biometric</b> <b>system,</b> cause adaptation using impostor sample.
