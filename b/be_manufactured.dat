5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria.

Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E

5|$|The He 111 design quickly {{ran through}} a series of minor design revisions.

The dimensions of the new design had a wing span of 22.6m (74ft 1¾in) and an area of 87.60m² (942.90ft).|$|E
5|$|Wood's {{statement}} led to {{speculation that}} the new ride might <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> by Sally Corporation. On 22 February 2012, Warner Bros.

The following day, a billboard advertising the ride was installed outside the defunct Batman ride. This was followed in May 2012 with a recruitment poster featuring Superman. Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D was officially announced by Warner Bros. Movie World on 25 May 2012. On 5 June 2012, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported that the ride would <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> by Sally Corporation and would cost A$9 million.

5|$|After {{their success}} {{in the first month}} of the war, mass {{production}} was ordered and the development of other models proceeded. The Katyusha was inexpensive and could <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> in light industrial installations which did not have the heavy equipment to build conventional artillery gun barrels. By the end of 1942, 3,237 Katyusha launchers of all types had been built, {{and by the end of}} the war total production reached about 10,000.|$|E

5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} AgustaWestland and Lockheed Martin was {{selected}} as the winners of the US VXX competition to replace the President's Marine One helicopters of the United States Marine Corps. A variant of the AW101, designated VH-71 Kestrel, was to <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> domestically and had proceeded into the flight testing stages. However the programme encountered significant cost overruns and political opposition, which led to the procurement being scrapped in June 2009. Separately, the Marine Corps had also conducted studies into the adoption of the EH101 as a fallback option to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor during the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} meet {{production}} targets, GAF was required to complete 1.5 Hornets per month. Production fell behind schedule {{during the first half}} of 1987, however, as a result of inefficiencies at the company's factory and industrial relations problems. GAF was able to accelerate production later in the year, though some components that were planned to <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> in Australia were purchased from companies in the United States instead. The final cost of the Hornet project was A$4.668 billion; after adjusting for the depreciation of the Australian dollar this was $186 million less than the initial estimate.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nearly {{fifteen of}} the tenders {{remained}} wedded {{to their original}} locomotives, others received new partners - the very first tender to <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined tenders were de-streamlined, {{it was difficult to}} spot any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type 'A' streamlined tenders were married to unstreamlined locomotives.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Among other points, the NATO group cited {{superior}} effectiveness (27 percent greater) for the 5.7×28mm against unprotected {{targets and}} equal effectiveness against protected targets. It also cited less sensitivity to extreme temperatures for the 5.7×28mm, and cited a greater potential risk of barrel erosion with the 4.6×30mm. In addition, the group {{pointed out that}} 5.7×28mm {{is close to the}} 5.56×45mm NATO by its design and manufacture process, allowing it to <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> on existing production lines. The group also noted that 5.7×28mm firearms had existed {{for a longer period of}} time than 4.6×30mm firearms, and that the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol was already in production at that time, while the 4.6×30mm Heckler & Koch UCP pistol was a new concept.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> to tighter tolerances.|$|E
