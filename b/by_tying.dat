5|$|Charles advised {{his brother}} of the French Directory's offer, but it was flatly refused by the Emperor and the {{civilian}} military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via the Rhine. The Aulic Council still believed Austrian forces could relieve Mantua. Consequently, <b>by</b> <b>tying</b> Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the highly defensible Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and Hüningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After {{it became clear that}} Charles was locked into place on the Rhine, Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.|$|E

Montreal lost their third-round series to the Philadelphia Flyers, but Cammalleri's 13 goals led all playoff scorers despite the fact Montreal failed to reach the final.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} 2017 playoffs as the {{defending}} Stanley Cup champions, the Penguins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets {{in five games}} before meeting the Capitals in Round 2. After winning {{the first two games}} on the road, Crosby sustained a concussion after getting injured on a slash and cross-check from Alex Ovechkin and Matt Niskanen in Game 3. He missed Game 4 but returned to practice the next day and played in Game 5. The Penguins would eventually eliminate the Capitals in Game 7, with Crosby assisting on the series-winning goal. The Penguins then defeated the Ottawa Senators in a gruelling seven-game series to secure their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final. Crosby had the primary assist on the series-clinching goal, scored by Chris Kunitz in double overtime. Facing the Nashville Predators in the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals, Pittsburgh jumped out to a two-game lead, despite being outplayed for long stretches in both games. The Predators responded <b>by</b> <b>tying</b> up the series, winning Game 3 and 4 at home. In Game 5, the Penguins' captain delivered a dominant performance, adding three assists in a 6–0 win, passing Lemieux for most Stanley Cup Final points (20) in franchise history. After defeating the Predators 20 in Game 6, the Penguins became the first team to repeat as Stanley Cup champions since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings, and the first {{to do so in the}} salary cap era. Crosby won his second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, only the third player to do so, after Bernie Parent (1974, 1975) and Mario Lemieux (1991, 1992). He finished second in scoring behind Evgeni Malkin with 27 points (eight goals, 19 assists) in 24 games.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 {{season was}} the Steelers' seventh {{as members of}} the AFC North Division. Pittsburgh defended their {{division}} title from the 2007 season, which they obtained <b>by</b> <b>tying</b> the Cleveland Browns' 10–6 record, but holding the tie-breaker with two wins over the Browns. Through 2008, Pittsburgh is the only team to have won the AFC North four times, since its inception prior to the 2002 NFL season. Entering the 2008 season, the Steelers were chosen to win the division by sportswriter Ron Borges, as well as nine of 13 analysts interviewed by ESPN.com. Four NFL.com analysts predicted that the Steelers would finish with a 10–6 record. The Steelers finished the regular season with a record of 12–4, going undefeated against opponents in the AFC North and winning 12games for the fourth season since 1979. The team clinched the second seed in the AFC for the playoffs and received a bye {{the first week of the}} post-season. The Baltimore Ravens finished at second place in the AFC North with an 11–5 record, clinching a playoff seed as an AFC wild card. The Cincinnati Bengals finished 4–11–1, winning their final three games of the season. The Cleveland Browns finished in the AFC North's fourth position at 4–12; the team fired head coach Romeo Crennel after the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, <b>by</b> <b>tying</b> one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5|$|After a bye in {{the first}} round of the 2016 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, Michigan played Northwestern on March 10. Michigan scored 16 {{consecutive}} points early to take a 16–3 lead. Northwestern cut the lead to two points before Michigan took a nine-point lead into the half. Michigan opened up a 12-point lead a couple of times in the second half before Northwestern took a 55–54 lead with 3:27 remaining. On Northwestern's final possession of regulation, Alex Olah forced overtime with a rebound and a field goal. In overtime, Robinson made a three-point shot to tie the score at 70 with 46.5 seconds remaining. Irvin scored the game-winning basket in front of his hometown crowd at Bankers Life Fieldhouse with 3.3 seconds left. Robinson led the way with 21 points; while Irvin added 19 points and eight rebounds and Abdur-Rahkman posted 14 points. This was just the second overtime game in Michigan's Big Ten Tournament history. Michigan defeated Purdue, 79–73, on March 14, 1999. The game marked Irvin's 100th career game with Michigan, becoming just the 64th Wolverine to reach the milestone. On March 11, Michigan defeated No. 1-seeded (#10/#10) Indiana in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten Tournament, 72–69. Kameron Chatman scored the game-winning three-pointer as time expired to give the Wolverines the win. Irvin led the way with a team-high 17 points, while Walton set a Big Ten Tournament single-game record with 12 assists. Robinson again put Michigan in position to win <b>by</b> <b>tying</b> the score with a three-point shot with 46 seconds remaining. Michigan recorded six three-pointers in the game, to set a new single-season program record for three-pointers in a season with 320, surpassing the previous record of 319 set during the 2013–14 season. On March 12, Michigan lost to (#13/#13) Purdue in the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament, 59–76. Purdue opened the game with an 8–0 scoring run and took a 38–30 lead into halftime. After trailing by as many as 17 early in the second half, the Wolverines fought back to within six only to be outscored 16–5 in the last 7:35 of the game. Abdur-Rahkman led the way with 15 points, while Walton added 14 points and Irvin posted 11 points. Michigan recorded six three-pointers in the game to extend their single-season record for three-pointers in a season to 326. With five assists in the game, Walton is now tied for third-most assists in a single Big Ten Tournament with 22, with Brent Darby (2003). Robinson recorded his 90th three-pointer of the season, becoming just the fifth Wolverine in history to reach the milestone in a single season. Irvin was selected to the All-Tournament Team.|$|E

5|$|Central to Edward III's {{policy was}} {{reliance}} on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects. Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new earls on the same day. At the same time, Edward expanded {{the ranks of the}} peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of duke for close relatives of the king. Furthermore, Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the Order of the Garter, probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the Round Table of King Arthur never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward's wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–7) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward III, especially {{at the time of the}} institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early fifteenth-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter, but the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a round table game. Thus there was some overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter. Polydore Vergil tells of how the young Joan of Kent, Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her garter at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd <b>by</b> <b>tying</b> the garter around his own knee with the words honi soit qui mal y pense – shame on him who thinks ill of it.|$|E
5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and {{deferred}} {{until the second}} half. The Bears special teams unit struggled, with returner Marc Mariani muffing the return on both of the Vikings' first two punts. Despite this, the Bears took the lead with Robbie Gould's 55-yard field goal. However, Minnesota scored on Marcus Sherels's 65-yard punt return touchdown, the third return touchdown allowed by the Bears in 2015. Despite this, Sherels muffed his return on the ensuing punt; Blair Walsh eventually kicked a 43-yard field goal {{in the second quarter}} to make the score 10–3. After the game's next three drives ended in punts (twice by the Bears), the first turnover of the game occurred when Kyle Fuller intercepted Bridgewater's pass for Stefon Diggs. The Bears capitalized on the takeaway with Cutler's 21-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, who jumped over Rhodes to make the catch in the left corner of the endzone. In the third quarter, the Bears reclaimed the lead with Gould's 33-yard field goal, and after the Vikings punted, had the chance to increase the margin to six points on Gould's 51-yard attempt. However, Gould's kick went wide left, his first miss of the season and ending a 17-kick streak. Minnesota took advantage <b>by</b> <b>tying</b> the game via Walsh's 48-yard field goal. The game's next two possessions ended with touchdowns for both teams: the Bears scored with Cutler, whose targets (Jeffery and Mariani) were unavailable, running four yards and colliding with safety Harrison Smith at the goal line for the touchdown. Afterwards, the Vikings tied the score with Bridgewater throwing a pass to Diggs, who escaped Sherrick McManis to score on the 40-yard play. With 1:49 left in the game, the Bears' next drive ended with a punt to the Vikings' 22-yard line. However, aided by Bridgewater's 35-yard pass to Charles Johnson, Walsh kicked a 36-yard field goal as time expired to seal the win.|$|E
