5|$|The {{video of}} the song {{features}} {{the majority of the}} film's cast at a celebration event where this song is performed. To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant lady with a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's get-up which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's <b>bum</b> with a marigold flower, using a slingshot. Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's <b>bum</b> again with a marigold flower. Following this, Prem jumps off the balcony and hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita try to run away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie. The clip has a large group of female dancers dancing in-sync in the background. Amongst the prominent star cast of the film, Bindu, Himani Shivpuri, Priya Arun, Laxmikant Berde, are also seen throughout the video.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bum</b> Phillips {{was fired}} {{three days after}} Houston's loss in the wild-card game, and {{defensive}} coordinator Ed Biles was given the head coaching job. In 1981, the Oilers finished 7–9 and {{failed to make the}} playoffs {{for the first time with}} Campbell on the roster. Also for the first time, Campbell did not claim the rushing yards title, as he finished fifth in yards with 1,376 and seventh in touchdowns with 10. The highlight of the season was back-to-back rushing performances of over 180 yards, against the Bengals in Week 5 and the Seahawks in Week 6. His 39 carries against the Seahawks set an Oilers single-game record. Campbell was invited to his fourth Pro Bowl, but failed to make an All-Pro roster. A players' strike in 1982 shortened the season to nine games and the Oilers finished with a 1–8 record. Campbell had just two touchdowns and 538 rushing yards, an average of 59.8 yards per game—far below his average of 104.1 per game over the previous four seasons.|$|E
5000|$|Many in {{the local}} Portland scene had {{expected}} the Dharma <b>Bums</b> {{to be a big}} breakthrough [...] "alternative" [...] act of the Northwest music scene, but Nirvana, a frequent opening act for the Dharma <b>Bums,</b> was to become the symbol of the genre instead. Some biographers, such as Melissa Rossi, author of Courtney Love: Queen of Noise (...) , and Poppy Z Brite, author of Courtney Love: The Real Story, write that Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain first met each other at a Dharma <b>Bums</b> concert in Portland—where Nirvana served as the opening act. However, Everett True argues in his book Nirvana: The Biography that while Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love did not meet {{for the first time at}} a Dharma <b>Bums</b> concert, it is possible that Courtney Love first saw Nirvana perform when they were the opening act for Dharma <b>Bums</b> at a performance at the Portland, Oregon, club Satyricon.

25|$|Skirts {{were held}} in the proper shape by a farthingale or hoop skirt. In Spain, the {{cone-shaped}} Spanish farthingale remained in fashion into the early 17th century.

In England, the Spanish farthingale was worn through the 1570s, and was gradually replaced by the French farthingale.
