40|$|As {{previous}} {{research has indicated that}} humans' ability to localize auditory stimuli is greater in front <b>space</b> compared to <b>back</b> <b>space,</b> this study aimed to investigate whether this pattern is also true for memory. Therefore, the accuracy and speed with which individuals remembered a series of verbal stimuli in front and <b>back</b> <b>space</b> was investigated. Participants listened to a series of auditory stimuli from the conditions of colours, shapes and full objects, presented randomly to a speaker in front of the head or to a speaker behind the head, and were then given a series of visual representations from which to choose which of these images represented one of the stimuli they had heard. Results indicate that there is no significant effect of front <b>space</b> versus <b>back</b> <b>space</b> in auditory memory. It was also found that in both front and <b>back</b> <b>space,</b> colours were remembered better than shapes, and both were remembered better than full objects...|$|R

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{scalability}} of the random keys schemes, two random <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> schemes [5, 7] {{have been proposed}} independently at ACM CCS 2003. These two works are similar in nature, except that they apply different <b>key</b> <b>space</b> models, which will be summarized in Subsection 3.1. Each sensor preloads several keying shares, with each belonging to one <b>key</b> <b>space.</b> Two sensors can establish a shared key if they have keying information from the same <b>key</b> <b>space.</b> References [7] also proposes to assign one <b>key</b> <b>space</b> to each row or each column of a virtual grid. A sensor residing at a grid point receives keying information from exactly two <b>key</b> <b>spaces.</b> This realization involves more number of <b>key</b> <b>spaces.</b> Note that these random <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> schemes also improve resilience and key-sharing probability because more <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> are available, and because two sensors compute a unique key within one <b>key</b> <b>space</b> for their shared links.|$|R

VelociTap enables users to seamlessly choose from three word-delimiter actions: pushing a <b>space</b> <b>key,</b> swiping to the right, or simply omitting the <b>space</b> <b>key</b> {{and letting the}} decoder infer spaces automatically. We demonstrate that VelociTap has a significantly lower error rate than Google's keyboard while retaining the same entry rate.

40|$|In {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis, the absorption performance of flexible micro-perforated panels with finite-depth air <b>backing</b> <b>spaces</b> has been studied experimentally and analytically. Perforated materials are relatively stiff and robust compared to fibrous materials from a structural point-of-view and can perform as well as fibrous materials in certain frequency ranges when combined with a finite-depth air backing. To predict the acoustical performance of perforated panels, several models were developed. The modeling effort was divided into two types, based on the assumed size of sample: finite or infinite. For the finite model, it is also divided into two parts: normal incidence in a duct, and arbitrary incidence angles in free space with an infinite array of finite-size, flexible micro-perforated panel with segmented and unsegmented <b>backing</b> <b>spaces.</b> For the infinite size sample, the Maa model, which is a well known theory for the impedance of rigid micro-perforated panels, was studied. Though the Maa model works reasonably well, the panel {{is assumed to be}} rigid in his model which can cause differences between measurements and predictions, especially for lightweight materials. In the experiments, the absorption coefficient and transmission loss of various samples were measured in an impedance tube. A model was developed for the finite-sized samples by making use of two frequency-dependent properties: the end correction and flow resistance. According to the results, the absorption performance of finite-size, perforated membranes can be tuned to a certain frequency range by adjusting hole size, number of holes per unit area, hole depth, mass per unit area of the material, flexural stiffness and size of the panel. The air backing depth is another important parameter determining the location of the absorption peak. As the <b>backing</b> <b>space</b> increases, the low frequency absorption increases. In the arbitrary incidence angle model, segmented and unsegmented <b>backing</b> <b>spaces</b> were studied and it was found that a segmented <b>backing</b> <b>space</b> generated a locally reacting field that causes higher absorption at lower frequencies. From the comparison between measurement and prediction, {{it was found that the}} predictions and measurements showed reasonable agreement. ...|$|R
