40|$|Hashing based {{methods have}} {{attracted}} considerable attention for efficient cross-modal retrieval on large-scale multimedia data. The core problem of cross-modal hashing {{is how to}} learn compact <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> that construct the underlying correlations between heterogeneous features from different modalities. A majority of recent approaches aim at learning hash functions to preserve the pairwise similarities defined by given class labels. However, these methods fail to explicitly explore the discriminative property of class labels during hash function learning. In addition, they usually discard the discrete constraints imposed on the to-be-learned <b>binary</b> <b>codes,</b> and compromise to solve a relaxed problem with quantization to obtain the approximate binary solution. Therefore, the <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> generated by these methods are suboptimal and less discriminative to different classes. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel cross-modal hashing method, termed discrete cross-modal hashing (DCH), which directly learns discriminative <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> while retaining the discrete constraints. Specifically, DCH learns modality-specific hash functions for generating unified <b>binary</b> <b>codes,</b> and these <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> are viewed as representative features for discriminative classification with class labels. An effective discrete optimization algorithm is developed for DCH to jointly learn the modality-specific hash function and the unified <b>binary</b> <b>codes.</b> Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets highlight the superiority of DCH under various cross-modal scenarios and show its state-of-the-art performance. </p...|$|R

We propose to construct <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> for users and items such that the preference of users over items can be accurately preserved by the Hamming distance between their respective <b>binary</b> <b>codes.</b> By using two loss functions measuring the degree of divergence between the training and predicted ratings, we formulate the problem of learning <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> as a discrete optimization problem. Although this optimization problem is intractable in general, we develop effective relaxations that can be efficiently solved by existing methods. Moreover, we investigate two methods to obtain the <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> from the relaxed solutions.

3000|$|Another way {{of making}} LBP {{rotation}} invariant is introduced in [9, 23]. The occurrences of rotation codes within the rotation groups are not summed, as in LBP_N,R^ri, but Fourier transformed and the resulting power spectrum is used as the feature vector. The descriptor is called LBP histogram Fourier features (LBP_N,R^HF). Since the Fourier features are computed on the global histogram of <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> in the region/patch investigated, LBP_N,R^HF achieves rotation invariance globally, and hence, retains the relative distribution within rotation groups [23]. However, the LBP_N,R^HF descriptor in [9] only considers uniform <b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> (<b>binary</b> <b>codes</b> with at the most two transitions between 0 and 1).

25|$|Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber {{built the}} first {{electromagnetic}} telegraph used for regular communication in 1833 in Göttingen, connecting Göttingen Observatory and the Institute of Physics, covering {{a distance of about}} 1km.

The resulting induction current was transmitted through two wires to the receiver, consisting of a galvanometer. The direction of the current could be reversed by commuting the two wires in a special switch.
