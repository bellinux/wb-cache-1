5|$|Additional minor classifications {{included}} the combativity classification, {{which was a}} compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Alessandro Petacchi was the original winner, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his 2007 Giro results forfeited, it appears there is no official winner of this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. Petacchi originally won this as well.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed. The {{provisional}} arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{has seen}} a huge {{increase}} in the wildlife refuge system.

25|$|Born of actors, he had {{a passion}} for the theater and for an improvised, {{theatrical}} life. <b>But</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his talents, he frequently succumbed to the quest for pleasure and sex, often avoiding sustained work and established plans, and got himself into trouble when prudent action would have served him better.

25|$|The Northrop X-21 was a {{modified}} WB-66D with an experimental wing, designed to conduct laminar flow control studies. Laminar-flow control {{was thought to}} potentially reduce drag {{by as much as}} 25%. Control would be by removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations. Northrop began flight research in April 1963 at Edwards Air Force Base, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the problems encountered, and money going into the war, the X-21 would be the last experiment involving this concept.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the 3-series was introduced, {{continuing}} the main {{models of the}} 2-series. In 1990, the new L113 became available, with a longitudinally rear-mounted engine which was inclined 60° to the left, to make a lower height than the K113. The 4-series was launched in 1997, continuing all model characteristics from the 3-series, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of them being just modular configurations of the basic chassis. The 8.5-litre engine {{was replaced by a}} 9-litre, and the 11-litre was replaced by an 11.7-litre. They were joined by a 10.6-litre engine in 2000.|$|E

This meant that the Minneapolis, Chicago, Iowa-Nebraska, Indianapolis and Idaho-Utah versions of the championship were all abandoned, replaced by the AWA World Tag Team Championship that was recognized in all of those territories.|$|E

25|$|Within the kingdom, Hugh {{intensified}} his existing {{habit of}} giving any available offices or lands to relations, including his numerous legitimate and illegitimate progeny, {{and a small}} circle of old and trusted friends. The effect this had on Italian nobles who saw this as threatening themselves eventually resulted in rebellion. In 941, Hugh expelled Berengar of Ivrea from Italy and abolished the March of Ivrea. In 945, Berengar returned from exile in Germany and defeated Hugh in battle. By a diet Berengar held at Milan, Hugh was deposed, though he managed {{to come to terms}} by which he nominally kept the crown and the title rex (king) but returned to Provence, leaving Lothair as nominal king, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> real power in Berengar's hands.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. <b>But</b> <b>with</b> <b>All</b> or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music.
