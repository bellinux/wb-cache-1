Naungdawgyi, who had <b>been</b> <b>putting</b> down multiple rebellions since his accession, was eager to lead a peaceful reign. He chose not to renew a war with Siam despite Siam's active support of the Lan Na rebellion and continued sheltering of Mon rebels.

500|$|The {{effect of}} commercialization {{on the music}} became an {{increasingly}} contentious issue. As observed by scholar Ross Haenfler, many punk fans [...] "'despise corporate punk rock', typified by bands such as Sum41 and Blink182". At the same time, politicized and independent-label punk continued to thrive in the United States. Since 1993, Anti-Flag had <b>been</b> <b>putting</b> progressive politics {{at the center of}} its music. The administration of George W. Bush provided them and similarly minded acts eight years of conservative government to excoriate. Rise Against was the most successful of these groups, registering top ten records in 2006 with The Sufferer & the Witness and two years later with Appeal to Reason. Leftist punk band Against Me!'s New Wave was named best album of 2007 by Spin. Politicized DIY punk also sustains active and inter-linked communities across Europe, as demonstrated by independent international events such as Fluff Fest in Czechia.|$|E

[...] Robert Everett-Green for The Globe and Mail praised the song, writing [...] "Fool in Love rings down the curtain with a towering anthem that somehow squeezes fresh feeling from a tired lyrical concept." [...] Katherine St Asaph for Popdust emoted a mixed response to [...] "Fool in Love", giving the song {{three and a half}} stars out of five and writing that it is [...] "so-bad-it's-good".

First, however, she needs to retrieve some of this evidence from her apartment. Meanwhile, Starkweather orders the chief of the Carcer City Police Department, Gary Schaffer, to bring both Cash and the journalist to him, blackmailing him that he will expose his corruption to the Liberty City Supreme Court if he does not comply.|$|E
500|$|The {{strain of}} the hard work Monteverdi had <b>been</b> <b>putting</b> into these and other {{compositions}} was exacerbated by personal tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer Caterina Martinelli, intended for the title role of Arianna, died of smallpox in March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo's minister Annibale Chieppio in November of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) [...] "an honourable dismissal". Although the Duke increased Monteverdi's salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned to continue {{his work at the}} court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere. After publishing his Vespers in 1610, which were dedicated to Pope Paul V, he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a seminary, but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was being printed, with a similar intention.|$|E
500|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts had thought General Trần Văn Đôn {{was involved in}} the coup with Phát and Thảo, but altered their assessment when he stayed in the mountain resort town of Da Lat instead of heading for the capital. Their changed assessment was reinforced by the announcement that Khiêm would be leading the replacement government if the coup was successful. Eight months after the coup was over, Đôn told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin [...] that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but said the Dai Viet and Kiem had insisted on installing the Catholic Khiêm. A month earlier, American {{intelligence analysts}} thought Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don. Ambassador Khiêm had <b>been</b> <b>putting</b> pressure on his bitter rival Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists", {{and as soon as the}} coup broke, he was immediately deemed by media analysts as a key figure behind the action.|$|E

She had prominent roles in Show Folks and Ned McCobb's Daughter (both 1928), where reviewers observed that she made a [...] "good impression" [...] and was [...] "worth watching". The following year, Pathé elevated Lombard from a supporting player to a leading lady. Her success in Raoul Walsh's picture Me, Gangster (also 1928), opposite June Collyer and Don Terry on his film debut, finally eased the pressure her family had <b>been</b> <b>putting</b> on her to succeed. In Howard Higgin's High Voltage (1929), her first talking picture, she played a criminal {{in the custody of}} a deputy sheriff, both of whom are among bus passengers stranded in deep snow. [...] Her next film, the comedy Big News (1929), cast her opposite Robert Armstrong and was a critical and commercial success. Lombard was reunited with Armstrong for the crime drama The Racketeer, released in late 1929. The review in Film Daily wrote, [...] "Carol Lombard proves a real surprise, and does her best work to date. In fact, this is the first opportunity she has had to prove that she has the stuff to go over." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to his Catholic background, Thảo {{was able}} to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. With Khánh's grip on power shaky, an {{anonymous}} source said that Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thao acted first, {{out of fear that}} if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khanh and get rid of him as well. He knew that if the others overthrew Khanh his fate would be worse than Khanh's." [...] During this time, Thảo kept in touch with elements of the CIA in an attempt to get American backing. Meanwhile, Khiêm had <b>been</b> <b>putting</b> pressure on Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists". At the same time, Khánh's relationship with the Americans—particularly Ambassador and retired General Maxwell Taylor—had broken down over a series of policy disputes and personal arguments, and the Americans were trying to encourage Khánh's colleagues to overthrow him so that more hawkish policies could be enacted. The other generals wanted to overthrow Khánh and were aware that Thảo—who was widely distrusted—was planning to make a move. They anticipated trouble in trying to keep their subordinates, who were becoming impatient with Khánh's ongoing tenure, from joining Thảo. Between January and February, Thảo continued to finalize the details of his own counter-coup, using the contacts he had cultivated over the past decades.|$|E
