5|$|An {{ideal is}} <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> {{unattainable}} {{in a given}} time and space. However, by persistently and dynamically approaching it, the process results in a sustainable system.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, an {{extension}} <b>by</b> <b>definitions</b> [...] of T is not {{distinguished from the}} original theory T. In fact, the formulas of [...] {{can be thought of}} as abbreviating their translations into T. The manipulation of these abbreviations as actual formulas is then justified by the fact that extensions <b>by</b> <b>definitions</b> are conservative.|$|R

5|$|By {{mathematical}} induction, a setQ is convex if and onlyif every {{convex combination}} of members ofQ also belongs toQ. <b>By</b> <b>definition,</b> a convex combination of an indexedsubset{v0,v1,...,vD} of a vector space is any weighted average for some indexedset of non-negative real numbers{λd} satisfying the equation=1.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{conceptual}} truth (or, so to speak, true <b>by</b> <b>definition)</b> that God is a being than which none greater can be imagined (that is, the greatest possible being {{that can be}} imagined).|$|E
5|$|Most {{thunderstorms}} {{come and}} go fairly uneventfully; however, any thunderstorm can become severe, and all thunderstorms, <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> present the danger of lightning. Thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before, during, and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage.|$|E

5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s also bind to the benzodiazepine {{binding site}} on the GABAA receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.|$|E
5|$|Thus, <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> if God {{exists as}} an idea in the mind but does not {{necessarily}} exist in reality, then we can imagine something that is greater than God.|$|E
5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>definition,</b> {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Departure {{times for}} these flights as {{specified}} during booking are <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> approximate, with the settlement service optimised {{on the fly}} depending on local demand for a given day. Settlement flights in the Disko Bay region are unique {{in that they are}} operated only during winter and spring. During summer and autumn, transport between settlements is only by sea, with services operated by Diskoline, a government-contracted ferry service based in Ilulissat.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{formulate}} a sufficient criterion {{in order for}} the first order theory with finite set of axioms to be represented <b>by</b> <b>definitions</b> in predicate calculus. We prove the corresponding theorem. According to this criterion such theories as the theory of equivalence relation, the theory of partial order and many theories based on the equality relation with finite set of functional and predicate symbols are represented <b>by</b> <b>definitions</b> in the first-order predicate calculus without equality...|$|R

50|$|<b>By</b> an {{alternative}} <b>definition,</b> cladodes are distinguished by their limited growth {{and that they}} involve {{only one or two}} internodes. <b>By</b> this <b>definition,</b> some of the most leaf-like structures are cladodes, rather than phylloclades. <b>By</b> that <b>definition,</b> Phyllanthus has phylloclades, but Ruscus and Asparagus have cladodes.|$|R
5|$|Enforcement {{of federal}} civil rights law in the South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt v. United States (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (<b>by</b> <b>definition)</b> involuntary.|$|E
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} <b>by</b> <b>definition.</b> It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness. However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E

5|$|In microeconomics, the PPF {{shows the}} options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two-good world. <b>By</b> <b>definition,</b> each {{point on the}} curve is productively efficient, but, {{given the nature of}} market demand, some points will be more {{profitable}} than others. Equilibrium for a firm will be the combination of outputs on the PPF that is most profitable.|$|E
5|$|In non-competitive inhibition, {{the binding}} of the {{inhibitor}} to the enzyme reduces its activity {{but does not}} affect the binding of substrate. As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the concentration of the inhibitor. Vmax will decrease due to the inability for the reaction to proceed as efficiently, but Km will remain the same as the actual binding of the substrate, <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> will still function properly.|$|E
5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{is placed}} in the South by the United States Census Bureau, but lies fully or {{partially}} in the Midwest, Southwest, and Southern cultural regions <b>by</b> varying <b>definitions,</b> and partially in the Upland South and Great Plains <b>by</b> <b>definitions</b> of abstract geographical-cultural regions. Oklahomans have a high rate of English, Scotch-Irish, German, and Native American ancestry, with 25 different native languages spoken.|$|R
