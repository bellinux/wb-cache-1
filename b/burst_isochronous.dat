5000|$|<b>Isochronous</b> <b>burst</b> {{transmission}} {{is a method}} of transmission. In a data network where the information-bearer channel rate {{is higher than the}} input data signaling rate, {{transmission is}} performed by , at controlled intervals, the data stream being transmitted.|$|R
5000|$|Note 1: <b>Burst</b> {{transmission}} in <b>isochronous</b> form enables {{communication between}} data terminal equipment (DTE) and data networks that operate at dissimilar data signaling rates, {{such as when}} the information-bearer channel rate {{is higher than the}} DTE output data signaling rate.|$|R
40|$|The study {{measured}} listener {{sensitivity to}} increments in the inter-onset intervals (IOIs) of successive 20 -ms 4000 -Hz tone <b>bursts</b> in <b>isochronous</b> sequences. The stimulus sequences contained two-six tone bursts, separated equally by silent intervals, with tonal IOIs ranging from 25 to 100 ms. Difference limens (DLs) for increments of the tonal IOIs were measured to assess listener sensitivity to changes of sequence rate. Comparative DLs were also measured for increments {{of a single}} interval located within six-tone isochronous sequences with different tone rates. Listeners included younger normal-hearing adults and two groups of older adults with and without high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The results, expressed as Weber fractions (DLâˆ•IOI), revealed that discrimination improved as the sequence tone rate decreased {{and the number of}} tonal components increased. Discrimination of a single sequence interval also improved as the number of sequence components increased from two to six but only for brief intervals and fast sequence rates. Discrimination performance of the older listeners with and without hearing loss was equivalent and significantly poorer than that of the younger listeners. The discrimination results are examined and discussed within the context of multiple-look mechanisms and possible age-related differences in the sensory coding of signal onsets...|$|R
