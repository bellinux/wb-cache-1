500|$|Dylan humorously {{commented on}} the song's moral {{perspective}} {{at a press conference}} at KQED television studio on December 3, 1965. When a reporter, suggesting that the song adopted a harsh perspective on a girl, asked Dylan, [...] "Are you hard on [...] <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> torment them? Or to change their lives and make them know themselves?", Dylan replied while laughing, [...] "I want to needle them." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret {{to attend}} court. Writing {{that she wanted}} to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: [...] "Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children". When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine {{pressured}} her hard, playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris. Frieda dismisses this accusation based on the fact Catherine had nothing to gain from her death, once the marriage contract had been signed, although Frieda considered Catherine responsible for Philibert le Vayer, who was Duke of Anjou's favourite.|$|E
500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have a good time. I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eddy Merckx {{who had won}} the Tour on five occasions, commented: [...] "my {{heart is}} no longer in it" [...] in {{response}} to his support for the Tour. [...] Another Belgian rider Johan Museeuw (who had previously received a two-year ban for doping), suggested doping and drug use were a possible consequence of the difficulty of riding the Tour in its current format. Questioning why stages had to be so long and [...] including several arduous 'out-of-category' mountain climbs. However, Prudhomme defended the Tour telling reporters that [...] "you do not cheat because it is too hard, you cheat <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be first." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the meeting}} {{when one of}} the Princes {{nominated}} Prince Yodying Prayurayot Krom Muen Bovorn Vichaichan as the next Front Palace, many in the council objected. The most notable objection of this nomination came from Prince Vorachak Tharanubhab. The Prince argued that the appointment of such an important position was the sole prerogative of the king and not of the council, and that the council should wait until the king was old enough to appoint his own. Furthermore, the position was not hereditary and the appointment of the son of the former could set a dangerous precedent. [...] The nomination [...] of Vichaichan however was supported by the powerful Regent Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse (Chuang Bunnag) who wanted to secure a line of succession by appointing an able and experienced Front Palace (as the first-in-line to the throne). Si Suriyawongse was determined, he retorted by accusing the Prince of wanting to be appointed himself, saying: [...] "You don't agree. Is it <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be (Uparaja) yourself?" [...] ("ที่ไม่ยอมนั้น อยากจะเป็นเองหรือ"). The Prince replied wearily [...] "If you want me to agree then I agree" [...] ("ถ้าจะให้ยอมก็ต้องยอม"). As a result, Prince Vichaichan, at the age of 30, was appointed Front Palace (Krom Phra Rajawang Bovorn Sathan Mongkol) and Second King without the full consent of the incoming monarch. The relationship between Chulalongkorn and the Vichaichan would remain difficult {{for the rest of the}} latter's life, based on this fact. On 11 November 1868 Vichaichan's cousin Chulalongkorn was crowned Supreme King of Siam at the Grand Palace.|$|E

"There," [...] {{said the}} Squire with an {{expression}} of infinite disgust, [...] "there, that's just like your way, your horrid cadging way; the idea of telling a man to be 'round about the Poplars' sometime or other to-day, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> speak to him about a fell. Why didn't you write him a letter like an ordinary Christian and make an offer, instead of dodging him round a farm for half a day like a wild Indian?

2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It is <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of... the way you manipulate and distort the documents".|$|E
2500|$|The Nacirema Dream was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Reed Jackson of XXL praised his storytelling, colorful metaphors and overtly complex word play. He also said, [...] "The production is so outdated you can’t help but think that these songs have literally just been sitting around this whole time. But ultimately, The Nacirema Dream should be celebrated – not only for it’s long overdue release, but because Papoose actually made the album he had always planned on making." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "The Nacirema Dream {{is a prime example}} of how hip-hop can serve as a platform for storytelling. Papoose confirms that the hype around his lyrical prowess was real. However, the album isn’t without its faults. Coming out seven years behind schedule, the production is noticeably a little dated. [...] While the beats are solid, The Nacirema Dream isn’t an album that you’ll be listening to <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear great production. It also could have benefited from being slightly trimmed. Listeners might feel fatigued while sitting through the 75 minutes that this album has to offer. Regardless, The Nacirema Dream is an admirable achievement. Papoose fought through label issues and made the album that he wanted to make, even if it took him seven years to finally get that album out to the public." [...] Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! gave the album a six out of ten, saying [...] "Papoose gamely battles on, delivering some of his trademark punch lines, and you can tell he genuinely attempted to deliver a well-rounded record. However, there's not enough innovation to interest casual fans in the project." ...|$|E
