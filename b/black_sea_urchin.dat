The poison is only irritating and not lethal. In Thai, the name is hoi men (หอยเม่น).|$|R
50|$|Digestion of {{food can}} {{take a long time}} in the Port Jackson shark. Food moves from the mouth to the J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial {{digestion}} occurs. Unwanted items may never get any further than the stomach, and are coughed up again. They have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and spit it out of their mouths to get rid of any unwanted contents.One of the biggest differences in digestion in the shark when compared to mammals is the extremely short intestine. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a very long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a very long surface area for the digestion of food, requiring it to pass around inside the apparently short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass by. The most obvious internal organ in sharks is the huge liver, which often fills most of the body cavity.Dietary items include <b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> molluscs, crustaceans, and fishes. <b>Black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> (Centrostephanus rodgersii) are often eaten. Port Jackson Sharks forage for food at night when their prey are most active. They often use caves and rocky outcrops as protection during the day.|$|R

50|$|The reef urchin is an {{important}} grazer on fleshy algae in the Caribbean area. Its abundance is reduced by predation by fish, especially the jolthead porgy (Calamus bajonado), the queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), the ocean triggerfish (Canthidermis sufflamen) and the hogfish (Lachnolaimus maximus). Because of this predation, the reef urchin avoids open reef flats and in these locations there is an overgrowth of fleshy algae.

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However {{there has been}} much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range of sizes of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> was exposed to three sizes of rock lobsters in a caging experiment, juvenile <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> were eaten more frequently than larger <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> by all sizes of rock lobster, but only the largest rock lobsters (N 120 mm CL) were able to consume large adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins.</b> Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> to rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, rock lobsters were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly rock lobsters, exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Injuries {{caused by}} sea urchins {{are the most}} common caused by marine animals in humans in Brazil, with the <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> (Echinometra lucunter) causing the most {{injuries}} to bathers. METHODS: This study observed 314 human wounds with emphasis on the early observation of clinical signs and symptoms and their implications on the recommended treatment. RESULTS: All the injuries were caused by black sea urchins and were observed in bathers. The lesions and the pain were associated with penetration of the spines; there was no early inflammation or pain without pressure on the wounded places. Complications arising from this kind on injury, including infections and foreign body granulomas, are associated with the permanence of the spines in the wounds. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that this kind of injury is the most common accident caused by aquatic animals in Brazil. The main therapeutical recommendation is early removal of the spines to prevent late complications, such as infections and the formation of foreign body granulomas...|$|E
40|$|Spatio-temporal {{variability}} in the population structure of long-spined <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin,</b> Diadema antillarum, was investigated at two islands (Gran Canaria and Tenerife) in the Canarian Archipelago over a year. The mean abundance of D. antillarum across all counts was 2. 70 ± 0. 07 ind m− 2 (mean±SE, N= 1440), while the mean biomass was 105. 76 ± 3. 75  g m− 2 (mean±SE, N= 1440). Abundances and biomasses of D. antillarum differed consistently between vegetated and unvegetated bottoms; however, locations within each habitat at each island fluctuated following different trends. For the overall study, mean densities and biomasses in the barren locations varied between 3. 36 – 6. 97 ind m− 2 and 93. 76 – 405. 13  g m− 2, respectively; while mean densities and biomasses in the algal stand locations varied between 0 – 0. 33 ind m− 2 and 0 – 7. 34  g m− 2, respectively. Striking differences existed in the size-structure among locations; however, larger size-classes (test diameter 3 ̆e 3. 5  cm) were present at all locations, and usually dominated in terms of abundance.

40|$|We {{present the}} global phylogeography of the <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Arbacia lixula, an amphi-Atlantic echinoid with {{potential}} to strongly impact shallow rocky ecosystems. Sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene of 604 specimens from 24 localities were obtained, covering {{most of the}} distribution area of the species, including the Mediterranean and both shores of the Atlantic. Genetic diversity measures, phylogeographic patterns, demographic parameters and population differentiation were analysed. We found high haplotype diversity but relatively low nucleotide diversity, with 176 haplotypes grouped within three haplogroups: one is shared between Eastern Atlantic (including Mediterranean) and Brazilian populations, the second is found in Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean {{and the third is}} exclusively from Brazil. Significant genetic differentiation was found between Brazilian, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, but no differentiation was found among Mediterranean sub-basins or among Eastern Atlantic sub-regions. The star-shaped topology of the haplotype network and the unimodal mismatch distributions of Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic samples suggest that these populations have suffered very recent demographic expansions. These expansions could be dated 94 – 205 kya in the Mediterranean, and 31 – 67 kya in the Eastern Atlantic. In contrast, Brazilian populations did not show any signature of population expansion. Our results indicate that all populations of A. lixula constitute a single species. The Brazilian populations probably diverged from an Eastern Atlantic stock.

40|$|The traits {{related to}} {{foraging}} and eating {{are crucial to}} our understanding of food webs. The use of signals to detect predators has strong relevance for prey survival. The <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Echinometra lucunter cohabits with the green sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus and a generalist echinivorous predator, the cushion sea star Oreaster reticulatus. Because black sea urchins evolved under the same predation pressure as green sea urchins and, consequently, were exposed to the same sensory cues, they are hypothesised to be able to detect echinivorous predator odours and chemical cues from green sea urchins as well as from injured conspecifics to elicit antipredator responses. Black sea urchins responded strongly to predators fed on a diet of conspecifics, showed a weak response to predators fed on green sea urchins and did not respond to a starved predator. The failure of black sea urchins to respond to hungry cushion sea stars probably increases their risk of being consumed. Black sea urchins, however, responded strongly to injured conspecific and, to a lesser degree, to heterospecific prey. In addition to the dilution effect imposed by the habit of living in dense assemblages, black sea urchins use the defence strategy of detecting an upcoming threat via chemical cue from injured prey when cues emanating from the echinivorous predator itself are not detectable...|$|E
40|$|The {{community}} {{structure of}} Jamaican coral reefs has undergone drastic change since mass mortalities of the long-spined <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Diadema antillarum Philippi occurred in 1983. In {{the absence of}} Diadema, algal abundance has increased enormously, up to a mean of 95 % cover or 4. 6 kg wet weight · m − 2. Coral cover, which was already low on some reefs following Hurricane Allen in 1980, has been further reduced {{by as much as}} 60 % since 1983 by competition with algae. Densities of D. antillarum at 10 sites in 1986 ranged from 0 to 12 % of pre- 1983 levels. Other echinoids, which might potentially compensate for the lack of herbivory from D. antillarum, have not increased significantly in density. Numbers of herbivorous scarids and acanthurids also remain at relatively low levels, because of overfishing. In the absence of high densities of fish and sea urchins, it is likely that recent changes in community structure will continue, resulting in further replacement of corals by algae in shallow water. The impact of the urchin mass mortalities is qualitatively similar to previous experimental removals of this species. In both cases, removal of echinoids resulted in substantial increases in macroalgae. However, quantitatively, the responses of algal and coral communities to the natural die-off were significantly greater, probably due to wide differences in spatial and temporal scales of the respective perturbations...|$|E

In La Parguera, Puerto Rico, urchins were totally absent from reef localities until 1996, when isolated, medium size individuals were observed in shallow reef habitats. To assess the status (distribution, densities and size structure) of populations of D. antil-larum 17 years after the die-off, twelve 20 m (10 x 2 m) band transects in each of four depth interval (0 - 3, 3 - 7, 7 - 11 and> 11 m) in each of four fringing coral reefs, and six-eight band-transects in each of two depth intervals (0 - 3 and> 3 m) in three lagoonal mounds were surveyed in 2001. All urchins present in the band transects in two depth intervals (0 - 3 and 3 - 8 m) were collected and measured (test diameter) in situ to determine the aver-age size and size (age) structure of populations. Overall, average densities were low and not significantly dif-ferent (F= 1. 29, p = 0. 125) across reef sites (0. 83 - 1. 39 ind/m) and the seagrass mounds (1. 09 ± 0. 6 - 1. 30 ± 0. 6 ind/m).

40|$|Coastal marine assemblages {{are shaped}} by {{interactions}} between physical factors, biological interactions, and almost ubiquitously, human impacts. Large-scale manipulations of human access replicated over a range of physical and biological conditions can generate insights over the processes shaping marine assemblages. We examined the relative roles of human impacts and hydrographic conditions on assemblages of shallow (3 – 10 m depth) rocky reefs by comparing no-take reserves with fishing areas occurring in gradients of exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves around two Mediterranean islands, Capraia and Giannutri, Italy. We hypothesized that fishing influences assemblages directly by reducing populations of target fish species, and indirectly by reducing predation on sea urchins, intensifying herbivory, and causing ‘‘barrens’’ of encrusting coralline algae. We examined how the possible effects of fishing varied with physical exposure of the coastline. The composition of fish assemblages differed significantly between sites within no-take reserves and fished reference sites. Abundances and sizes of predatory fishes targeted by local fisheries were greater in no-take reserves than in fished areas. Sea urchin densities, the extent of coralline barrens, {{and the structure of}} the algal and invertebrate benthic assemblages showed clear variation associated with exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves, but weak effects of protection from human use. Densities of the <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Arbacia lixula were significantly greater along the windward than along the leeward sides of the islands, and were positively correlated with the extent of coralline barrens. In contrast, the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus was more abundant along the leeward sides of islands and showed indirect responses to protection at Giannutri, where purple sea urchins tended to have greater densities at fished than at protected sites. Protection from fishing influenced fish assemblages directly, and benthic assemblages indirectly, but the latter effect was observed only at sites with lower physical exposure. Indirect effects of fishing and recovery of assemblages within marine protected areas through cascading trophic interactions are likely to vary depending on local physical conditions and on the characteristics of species that are locally dominant...|$|E

This work attempts to characterize better {{the community of}} these organisms associatedto coral reefs in this region using band transects of 50 m length by 1 m width. Two samplings were carried out in 2004, one in the rainy season and other in the dry season. Ten species, three Asteroidea,six Echinoidea and one Holothuroidea, were found. The mean values obtained for diversity in the 13 study sites (1. 036 bits ind- 1) are considered low {{when compared with the}} maximum possible diversity(3. 322 bits ind- 1), and this is likely due to the dominance of the <b>black</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Diadema mexicanum and the starsh Phataria unifascialis, with densities reported of 1. 45 ± 0. 60 ind m- 2 and 0. 12 ± 0. 02 ind m- 2, respectively. The highest diversity was associated with low tide, which is not different between localities. The spatial arrangement of the echinoderm species composition obtained by the multidimensional scaling analysis denotes the formation of ve conglomerates according to similarity, where the substratum and reef cover are the possible determinant variables. The four predominant species (D. mexicanum, P. unifascialis, Toxopneustes roseus and Hesperocidaris asteriscus), whose densities were compared with those of other sites of the Oriental Tropical Pacic, show, in general, inferior values for Echinoidea and intermediate values for the Asteroidea. For the specic case of D. mexicanum, there are differences in the densities between localities, depths, and time of year, and the mean value obtained of 1. 45 ± 0. 60 ind m- 2 was low compared to densities recorded in other zones. Also, it was observed that in some localities, such as Playa Coral, Caleta de Chon, Punta del Cerro Colorado, and Zacatoso, the sea urchin densities increased considerably during the rainy season, and these high densities maintain a positive correlation with coral cover, which is indicative of a balanced ecosystem. It was also detected that in localitiesclose to Acapulco, which undergo more tourist activity, such as Isla Roqueta, Ensenada de Llantos, and Pichilingue, the diversity of echinoderms is lower (0. 6 bits ind- 2) and the abundance of D. mexicanum is higher. These results, plus those of other studies at Acapulco Bay, suggest that pertinent actions should be taken to avoid similar phase shifts on reefs of Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, which are currently considered to be the best developed in the Mexican Tropical Pacic...|$|E
