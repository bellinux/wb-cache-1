5000|$|Spectrophotometry is an {{important}} technique used in many biochemical experiments that involve DNA, RNA, and protein isolation, enzyme kinetics and biochemical analyses. A brief explanation of the procedure of spectrophotometry includes comparing the absorbency of a <b>blank</b> <b>sample</b> that does not contain a colored compound to a sample that contains a colored compound. This coloring {{can be accomplished by}} either a dye such as Coomasie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye or by an enzymatic reaction as seen between β-galactosidase and ONPG (turns sample yellow). The spectrophotometer is used to measure colored compounds in the visible region of light (between 350 nm and 800 nm), thus {{it can be used to}} find more information about the substance being studied. In biochemical experiments, a chemical and/or physical property is chosen and the procedure that is used is specific to that property in order to derive more information about the sample, such as the quantity, purity, enzyme activity, etc. Spectrophotometry can be used for a number of techniques such as determining optimal wavelength absorbance of samples, determining optimal pH for absorbance of samples, determining concentrations of unknown samples, and determining the pKa of various samples. Spectrophotometry is also a helpful procedure for protein purification [...] and can also be used as a method to create optical assays of a compound. Spectrophotometric data can also be used in conjunction with the Beer-Lambert Equation, A= -log10T=εcl=OD, in order to determine various relationships between transmittance and concentration, and absorbance and concentration. Because a spectrophotometer measures the wavelength of a compound through its color, a dye binding substance can be added so that it can undergo a color change and be measured. Spectrophotometers have been developed and improved over decades and have been widely used among chemists. Additionally, Spectrophotometers are specialized to measure either UV or Visible light wavelength absorbance values. It is considered to be a highly accurate instrument that is also very sensitive and therefore extremely precise, especially in determining color change. This method is also convenient for use in laboratory experiments because it is an inexpensive and relatively simple process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{implementation}} of a quality-assurance system (QAS) in low-level measurements is very important, espe-cially when routine environmental monitoring of natural radionuclides is needed. All steps of analyses must be done accord-ingly to procedures in the Book of Procedures and in the Quality Manual of the testing laboratory. The following activities are required: proper registration of samples {{and management of the}} data (in confidence); validation of the method (if appropriate for analyzed samples); training of the staff (analysis of blind samples; internal tests, etc.); analysis of the results of measure-ment for <b>blank</b> <b>samples,</b> radium standards, and reference samples; case analysis of uncertainties and errors (if necessary); par-ticipation in national and international intercomparison measurements; and external audits performed periodically (annually). Our procedure for calculating results {{is based on the assumption}} of the long-term stability of the background of our liquid scintillation (LS) spectrometers. Background subtraction and calibration (measured Ra standards) is done on the basis of a quarterly average value from the previous period.
