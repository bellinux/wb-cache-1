The head of the figure is often surrounded by the glowing halo-like rings of a glory—rings of coloured light that appear directly opposite the sun when sunlight meets a cloud of uniformly-sized water droplets.|$|E

In 1780 Silberschlag observed and described the <b>Brocken</b> <b>bow</b> (also called Brocken spectre). In his book Geonetics or Explanation of the Mosaic Creation according to Physical and Mathematical Foundations (Geogonie oder Erklärung der mosaischen Erderschaffung nach physikalischen und mathematischen Grundlagen) he tried to reconcile theology and science. The lunar crater Silberschlag is named after him.|$|E
