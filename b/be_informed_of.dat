5|$|Once an {{individual}} has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act. The detainee is to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> the grounds of detention as soon as possible, unless their disclosure is against the national interest. He or she is to be served {{with a copy of}} the detention order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the detention order was made.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Amendment {{protects against}} double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain. The amendment {{was the basis for}} the court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which established that defendants must <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> their rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.|$|E

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital did not need to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E

5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known hatt-ı hümayun {{is the one}} sent by Sultan Murad I to Evrenos Bey in 1386, commending {{the commander}} for his conquests and giving him {{advice on how to}} administer people. Until the reign of Murad III, Viziers used to present matters orally to the Sultans, who would then give their consent or denial, also orally. While hatt-ı hümayuns were very rare prior to this, they proliferated afterward, especially during the reigns of Sultans such as Abdülhamid I, Selim III and Mahmud II, who wanted to increase their control and <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> everything.|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{continued}} during autumn 1938. The Soviets {{reduced their}} demands: a Red Army operation {{was not an}} option anymore and the focus was shifted on securing the Gulf of Finland. The Soviets wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> key elements of the Finnish–Estonian Gulf blockade, the secret military plan against the Baltic Fleet. Furthermore, Yartsev suggested that the Finns fortify the Suursaari island, but that the Soviets would take care of its defence. During the negotiations, Rudolf Holsti resigned as foreign minister, although not for reasons associated with the negotiations, and his place was taken by Eljas Erkko. Holsti was rather anti-German, so the resignation set off rumours, quickly quelled by the Finnish government, that he had been forced to resign by a Finnish government sympathetic to the Germans. The Finns attempted to appear even-handed, and the interior ministry issued an order banning the extreme-right IKL. The ban was reversed by the Finnish courts as being unconstitutional. Many years later, the minister in charge at that time, Urho Kekkonen, admitted that this was a simple gesture, to suggest to Moscow that Finland did not harbour a German fifth column.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> <b>of</b> all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E
