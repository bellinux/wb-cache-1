5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the <b>breast</b> <b>with</b> a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E

25|$|Babies feed {{differently}} {{with artificial}} nipples {{than from a}} <b>breast.</b> <b>With</b> the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. Drinking from a bottle takes less effort and the milk may come more rapidly, potentially causing the baby to lose desire for the breast. This is called nursing strike, nipple strike or nipple confusion. To avoid this, expressed milk can be given by means such as spoons or cups.|$|E

25|$|With this Classical style {{came the}} {{willingness}} to expose the <b>breast.</b> <b>With</b> the new iconography of the Revolution {{as well as a}} change in emphasis on maternal breast-feeding, the chemise dress became a sign of the new egalitarian society. The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the breasts were emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to walk around with their breasts exposed. Some women took the “fashionable maternity” a step further and wore a “six-month pad” under their dress to appear pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Sucking on {{the nipple}} offsets {{the fall in}} {{prolactin}} as the internal stimulus for them is removed. The sucking activates mechanoreceptors {{in and around the}} nipple. These signals are carried by nerve fibers through the spinal cord to the hypothalamus, where changes in the electrical activity of neurons that regulate the pituitary gland increase prolactin secretion. The suckling stimulus also triggers the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland, which triggers milk let-down: Prolactin controls milk production (lactogenesis) but not the milk-ejection reflex; the rise in prolactin fills the <b>breast</b> <b>with</b> milk in preparation for the next feed.|$|E

25|$|Measuring 19–21cm (8in) in length, {{this small}} vibrant and brightly {{coloured}} parrot is sexually dimorphic. The male has a scarlet chest, a cobalt blue face, and bright green upperparts. The lower breast and underparts are yellow, and the wing coverts are pale blue. The tail is green, {{the eyes are}} brown and the bill is blackish, and legs are brown-grey. The female likewise has a blue face, although the coloration is less extensive, green upperparts and green <b>breast,</b> <b>with</b> yellow underparts.

25|$|The {{inferior}} pedicle (central mound) {{features a}} blood vessel supply (arterial and venous) for the nipple-areola complex (NAC) from an inferior, centrally-based {{attachment to the}} chest wall. The skin pedicle maintains the innervation and vascular viability of the NAC, which produces a reduced, sensitive <b>breast</b> <b>with</b> full lactational capability and function. The volume and size reduction of hypertrophied breasts is performed with a periareolar incision to the nipple-areola complex, which then extends downwards, following the natural curve of the breast hemisphere. After cutting and removing the requisite quantities of tissue (glandular, adipose, skin), the nipple-areola complex is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere; thereby the inferior pedicle technique produces an elevated bust with breasts that are proportionate to the woman's person. Nonetheless, breast-reduction with an inferior pedicle, occasionally produces breasts that appear squared; yet, the technique effectively reduces the very enlarged breasts of macromastia and gigantomastia.|$|E
25|$|The {{breasts are}} apocrine glands that produce milk for the feeding of infant children; each breast has a nipple within an areola (nipple-areola complex, NAC), the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown, and has sebaceous glands. Within the mammary gland, the lactiferous ducts produce breast milk, and are {{distributed}} throughout the <b>breast,</b> <b>with</b> two-thirds of the tissue within 30mm of {{the base of the}} nipple. In each breast, 4–18 lactiferous ducts drain to the nipple; the glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in lactating women, and to 1:1 in non-lactating women; besides milk glands, the breast is composed of connective tissue (collagen, elastin), adipose tissue (white fat), and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. The peripheral nervous system innervation of the breast is by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth, fifth, and sixth intercostal nerves, while the thoracic spinal nerve 4 (T4) innervating the dermatomic area supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 23 March 1935, Rattenbury was {{discovered}} in his sitting room with severe head injuries. He had sustained a series of blows with a carpenter's mallet, the blows savage enough to remove the back of his skull; he died four days later. His wife confessed, but Stoner admitted to the housekeeper that it was actually he who had carried out the deed. Alma Rattenbury and Stoner were both charged, although Alma was to retract her confession after her elder son Christopher visited her in prison. Stoner was convicted and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment following the submission to the Home Secretary of a petition signed by over 300,000 people who felt that the young man had been manipulated into committing murder by the older woman. Alma, represented by Ewen Montagu, was acquitted of murder and of being an accessory after the fact but committed suicide a few days later on 4 June 1935, stabbing herself six times in the <b>breast</b> <b>with</b> a dagger before throwing herself into the River Stour at Christchurch.|$|E
25|$|NET has a {{terminal}} half-life of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, {{with a mean}} terminal half-life of 8.0 hours. The metabolism of NET {{is very similar to}} that of testosterone (and nandrolone) and is mainly via reduction of the Δ4 double bond to 5α- and 5β-dihydro-NET, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 keto group to the four isomers of 3,5-tetrahydro-NET. These transformations are catalyzed by 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues such as the pituitary gland, uterus, prostate gland, vagina, and <b>breast.</b> <b>With</b> the exception of 3α,5α- and 3β,5α-tetrahydro-NET, which have significant affinity for the ER and are estrogenic to some degree, the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of NET are inactive in terms of affinity for sex steroid receptors (specifically, the PR, AR, and ER). A small amount of NET is also converted by aromatase into EE. NET is metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation as well, mainly by CYP3A4. Some conjugation (including glucuronidation and sulfation) of NET and its metabolites occurs in spite of steric hindrance by the ethynyl group at C17α. The ethynyl group of NET is preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{focussed}} on evaluating fast 3 D near-infrared breast imaging {{using the}} optical contrast agent indocyanine green (ICG) as a non-invasive technique for functional tissue examination. Currently optical breast imaging {{is not able}} to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions merely using intrinsic tissue contrast of hemoglobin, lipids and water. The use of ICG aimed on improvement of the detection und characterization of breast masses. Methods: 30 patients <b>with</b> suspicious <b>breast</b> lesions underwent fast 2 Hz 3 D optical mammography before, during, and after administration of a 25 mg ICG bolus prior to needle biopsy (gold standard). The bolus kinetics of each volume segment of the breast was analysed using the two common perfusion parameters ‘Peak Amplitude’ (PA) and ‘Time to Peak’ (TTP). Aiming on an objective reader-independent differentiation of benign and malignant lesions a third perfusion parameter based on combination of PA and TTP was introduced: the ‘Peaktime-Amplitude’ (PTA). With help of a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis a PTA cut-off was calculated which allowed separation of both groups. Results: Functional NIR-Images basing on PA and TTP for ICG perfusion revealed higher peaks at early time points for <b>breasts</b> <b>with</b> malignant lesions. For 22 breasts (22 patients) the cut-off-based PTA analysis allowed correct detection for 12 of 14 malignant lesions (tumor size: 8 – 80 mm; sensitivity 85, 7 %). Two malignant lesions were missed (IDC, 15 mm; ILDC, 16 mm). In the benign study group only 1 fibroadenoma (10 mm) was detected falsely positive (specificity = 87, 5 %). Separate analysis of <b>breasts</b> <b>with</b> high glandular densitiy (13 <b>breasts</b> <b>with</b> BI-RADS 3 or 4) showed a decreased sensitivity (75 %) at similar specificity (83, 3 %). Statistical analysis of PTA-values for both groups yielded {{a significant difference between the}} benign and malignant group (Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0, 05). A total of 8 patients were excluded from data analysis due to insufficient coupling of the breast to the interface, large breast size (exceeding the breast interface) or because of rare histological findings (T-cell lymphoma, melanoma metastasis). Conclusions: Early perfusion of ICG enhanced 3 D fast optical mammography presented different enhancement patterns for <b>breasts</b> <b>with</b> malignant compaired to <b>breasts</b> <b>with</b> benign lesions. A reader-independent analysis offered a high sensitivity (85, 7 %) and specificity (87, 5 %). After further investigation this technique might be applicable as an add-on tool in clinical diagnostics...|$|R
