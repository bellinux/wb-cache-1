On the morning of November 6, Greta transitioned into an exceptionally large and intense extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first formed on August20 {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea from a broad area of low pressure, based on weather reports from weather stations and ships in the vicinity. Moving steadily to the west-northwest towards the western Caribbean, the disturbance slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm strength by 1200UTC the next day. Prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, however, the system was analyzed to be an open trough up until August22. The tropical storm <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> more towards {{the west in the}} Gulf of Mexico after clipping the Guanahacabibes Peninsula—the westernmost region of Cuba—late on August22.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened rapidly as it <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> west-northwest. Later that morning, MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression. That very day, the JTWC reported that winds of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the {{morning hours of}} April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E
