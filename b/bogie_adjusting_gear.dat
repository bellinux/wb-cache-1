40|$|Pulse fishing, {{or fishing}} heavily at regular {{intervals}} rather than continually, has often been suggested to produce higher yields than constant fishing with a lower effort. Existing models, however, are largely {{based on the assumption}} that the gear selectivity cannot be adjusted. In many such cases, whilst pulse fishing with equal selectivity for all fish above the age of recruitment is superior to continually fishing with the same gear, the yield can be improved still further by <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear</b> selectivity and fishing continually. This paper modifies the existing model of DeKlerk and Gatto and shows that nonselective pulse fishing may generate higher yields than either nonselective continual fishing or continual fishing for only the most valuable single cohort...|$|R
50|$|As {{the brake}} linings wear, the shoes must travel a greater {{distance}} {{to reach the}} drum. When the distance reaches a certain point, a self-adjusting mechanism automatically reacts by adjusting the rest position of the shoes {{so that they are}} closer to the drum. Here, the adjusting lever rocks enough to advance the <b>adjuster</b> <b>gear</b> by one tooth. The adjuster has threads on it, like a bolt, so that it unscrews a little bit when it turns, lengthening to fill in the gap. When the brake shoes wear a little more, the adjuster can advance again, so it always keeps the shoes close to the drum. Typically the adjusters only operate when the vehicle is going in reverse and the brakes are engaged.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{disadvantage}} {{is the lack of}} multiple gears, and the flexibility in pedaling cadence and resistance made available through gear shifting. Hilly or uneven mountainous terrain with steep grades can be particularly challenging, as the rider cannot <b>adjust</b> the <b>gearing</b> to match the terrain.|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} when using an {{electro-mechanical}} actuator, it is preferred {{to have some}} type of speed control.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, views on {{fisheries}} management have oscillated between alarm {{and trust in}} management progress. The predominant policy for remedying the world fishing crisis aims at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear</b> selectivity and fishing effort. Here we report a case study on how striving for higher yields from the Eastern Baltic cod stock by increasing selectivity has become exceedingly detrimental for its productivity. Although there is a successive increase in numbers of undersized fish, growth potential is severely reduced, and fishing mortality in fishable size has increased. Once density-dependent growth is introduced, the process is self-enforcing {{as long as the}} recruitment remains stable. Our findings suggest that policies focusing on maximum yield while targeting greater sizes are risky and should instead prioritize catch rates over yield. Disregarding the underlying population structure may jeopardize stock productivity, with dire consequences for the fishing industry and ecosystem structure and function...|$|R

40|$|When a {{uniaxial}} {{tensile test}} is performed to investigate tension softening behavior of concrete, a secondary flexure occurs inevitably {{because of the}} heterogeneous nature of concrete, even {{in the case of}} no eccentricity in the applied load. The secondary flexure causes a significant reduction in the observed peak load, and then makes the estimated observed tensile strength unreliable. Therefore, the prevention of the flexure occurrence is essential to obtain reliable experimental results. In order to meet this requirement, the authors have developed a unique test procedure, which consists of a manually operated <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear</b> system. Although the system has provided successful and informative results, it also has an intrinsic drawback, i. e. human related malfunction. The main objective {{of this study is to}} establish and to qualify automation for the prevention of the secondary flexure, using computer-controlled DC motors instead of manual operations. Consequently, the application of the automatic system on the uniaxial tensile test not only provides better test results but also reduces long time efforts...|$|R
40|$|Case StudyCentrifugal {{compressor}} {{train in}} a refinery experienced high vibration problem due to torsional resonance. Sidebands in the VFD output current based on VFD control loop frequencies {{were identified as}} the root cause. In this VFD, stator current was used for torque and speed control, hence control loop frequencies had a potential to generate such sidebands. Frequencies {{of this type of}} sidebands widely vary with the rotation speed (proportional to harmonics of the fundamental frequency), hence it is difficult to avoid resonance at the train torsional natural frequency. In addition, even if a compressor system is proven to have sufficient safety margin against high cycle fatigue failure due to the torque pulsation by this mechanism, such minute torque pulsation may have a potential to excite high lateral vibration at speed <b>adjusting</b> <b>gear.</b> If unpredicted or overlooked during design stage, such high vibration may disturb plant operation.

40|$|Fisheries {{managers}} go {{to great}} lengths to reduce cod catches in the North Sea, aiming for recovery of the cod stock. The Dutch government asked IMARES to provide an overview of all measures that are in place in various countries around the North Sea for reducing cod catches. The Dutch fisheries managers were specifically interested in the existence of gear adjustments, which might also be applicable in Dutch fisheries. With a complete overview of possible measures, the government, fishing industry and gear scientists can decide together which gear adjustments may be effective and feasible in Dutch fisheries. Whether a gear adjustment is effective, depends on changes in selectivity of the <b>adjusted</b> <b>gear</b> compared to the standard gear. Selectivity depends on the shape and size of fish and on the shape and size of meshes in the cod-end. Also behavioural differences between species determine selectivity. IMARES and ILVO made an inventory of existing gear adjustments for reduction of the cod catch.

50|$|Before {{the safety}} bicycle, {{bicycles}} {{did not have}} chains and the pedals were typically attached directly to the drive-wheel, thus limiting top speed by {{the diameter of the}} wheel and resulting in designs with front wheels as large as possible. Various linkage mechanisms were invented to raise the effective gear ratio, but with limited success. Using chain drive allowed the mechanical advantage between the drive and driven sprockets to determine the maximum speed, thereby enabling manufacturers {{to reduce the size of}} the driving wheel for safety. It also allowed for the development of variable gearing, allowing cyclists to <b>adjust</b> their <b>gearing</b> on the fly, to terrain or road inclination and their strength, obtaining an efficient and workable cadence at various speeds.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} {{design for}} a human powered automatic transmission intended for use on an ordinary touring bicycle is presented. The transmission is intended to automatically <b>adjust</b> the <b>gearing</b> of the bicycle to maintain an optimum pedal force, regardless of the current riding conditions. Therefore, the transmission {{eliminates the need for}} the cyclist to manually <b>adjust</b> the bicycle <b>gearing.</b> The entire transmission is a self-contained unit designed to bolt onto the rear wheel of an otherwise unmodified 27 -inch bicycle. The transmission combines a unique adaptation of a commercially popular continuously variable traction drive with a totally mechanical integral feedback controller. The features of the traction drive unique to its application to a bicycle are outlined in detail, along with an analysis of the important traction drive design parameters. The control system is also uniquely adapted to the requirements of bicycling. A detailed classical analysis of the controller is presented to verify its desirable performance characteristics. In addition, a numerical simulation of the transmission is included to accurately predict its performance under typical operating conditions. A knowledge of typical pedal force profiles for normal touring cycling is prerequisite for the design of the constant force bicycle transmission. This data has not been previously published. An instrumentation package was developed especially to determine this data. A description of the system and a summary of the results are presented. These results are reduced to a set of design criteria for the constant force transmission...|$|R

50|$|Some drill presses {{and milling}} {{machines}} contain a pulley-based CVT where the output shaft has {{a pair of}} manually adjustable conical pulley halves through which a wide drive belt from the motor loops. The pulley on the motor, however, is usually fixed in diameter, or may {{have a series of}} given-diameter steps to allow a selection of speed ranges. A handwheel on the drill press, marked with a scale corresponding to the desired machine speed, is mounted to a reduction gearing system for the operator to precisely control the width of the gap between the pulley halves. This gap width thus <b>adjusts</b> the <b>gearing</b> ratio between the motor's fixed pulley and the output shaft's variable pulley, changing speed of the chuck. A tensioner pulley is implemented in the belt transmission to take up or release the slack in the belt as the speed is altered. In most cases, the speed must be changed with the motor running.|$|R

This system promotes streak cameras&# 39; abilities on spatial discrimination and time resolution. This paper focuses on the instruction of the piezoelectric motor&# 39;s principle based on field-effect tubes. Filter wheel is driven by piezoelectric motor. It can effectively avoid the influences of high field produced by streak tube. Finally we achieve auto regulation at different gears and promote the efficiency of operations and guarantee the safety of researchers. CD 4046 introduces the driven clock of this system and we use an inverter to get two synchronous inverted signals. These signals are amplified by field-effect tubes to more than 300 V. The amplified ones are integrated at the output terminals to generate sinusoidal signal. The test shows that in this filter system piezoelectric motor operates at its resonance frequency under a control signal of 62. 5 KHz. Its working current is 1. 9 A and driving power is almost 10 W.

50|$|Hull trim is the {{adjustment}} of a boat's loading {{so as to}} change its fore-and-aft attitude in the water. In small boats, it is done by positioning the crew. In larger boats, {{the weight of a}} person has less effect on the hull trim, but it can be <b>adjusted</b> by shifting <b>gear,</b> fuel, water, or supplies. Different hull trim efforts are required for different kinds of boats and different conditions. Here are just a few examples: In a lightweight racing dinghy like a Thistle, the hull should be kept level, on its designed water line for best performance in all conditions. In many small boats, weight too far aft can cause drag by submerging the transom, especially in light to moderate winds. Weight too far forward can cause the bow to dig into the waves. In heavy winds, a boat with its bow too low may capsize by pitching forward over its bow (pitch-pole) or dive under the waves (submarine). On a run in heavy winds, the forces on the sails tend to drive a boat's bow down, so the crew weight is moved far aft.|$|R
