5|$|On {{the ensuing}} possession, Boston College needed only seven plays and just under {{three minutes to}} travel 74yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback {{scramble}} for a touchdown. Duane Brown, who had <b>blocked</b> <b>the</b> first Boston College field goal attempt, again charged through the Boston College offensive line and <b>blocked</b> <b>the</b> extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced {{into the hands of}} Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive two-point conversion. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point. With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 169 in favor of Boston College.|$|E

5|$|The PVA 38th Corps, on {{the other}} hand, was marching towards the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road {{virtually}} unopposed. On 7 a.m. at November 28, the PVA 113th Division of the 38th Corps occupied the town of Samo-ri, placing it right {{in the path of}} the 5th Cavalry Regiment and besides the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road. An hour and half later, the advance platoon from the 5th Cavalry Regiment was ambushed and destroyed. With its advance <b>blocked,</b> <b>the</b> 5th Cavalry Regiment tried to dislodge the Chinese garrison, but it was forced to turn back by the afternoon. The 113th Division then occupied the valley containing the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road at that night and <b>blocked</b> <b>the</b> retreat route of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Upon receiving the news on November 29, 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, part of 27th Brigade, tried to clear the valley from the south, but the attack was halted due to the lack of heavy weapons.|$|E

5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City.

5|$|After {{peace talks}} between the Germans and the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April, the true battle for the capital of Finland began. On 12 April, at 5 a.m. 2,000–3,000 German {{soldiers}} from the Brigade von Tshirsky attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the Helsinki-Turku railway. The Germans broke through the area between Munkkiniemi and Pasila, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Chinese plan {{to capture}} Seoul, the PVA 42nd and the 66th Corps were tasked with {{protecting}} the Chinese left flank by eliminating the ROK 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions, while cutting the road between Chuncheon and Seoul. Following instructions, the two Chinese corps struck quickly after midnight on New Year's Eve. The PVA 124th Division first penetrated the flanks of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division, then <b>blocked</b> <b>the</b> division's withdrawal route. The trapped ROK 17th and 32nd Regiments of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division were then forced to retreat in disarray. With the PVA 66th Corps pressuring the ROK 5th Infantry Division's front, the PVA 124th Division then advanced eastward in the South Korean rear and <b>blocked</b> <b>the</b> ROK 5th Infantry Division's retreat route as well. The maneuver soon left the ROK 36th Regiment of the ROK 5th Infantry Division surrounded by Chinese, and the ROK 36th Regiment had to escape by infiltrating the Chinese lines using mountain trails. By January 1, the ROK III Corps was in full retreat, while the corps' headquarters had lost contact with the 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions. Responding to the crisis on the central front, the ROK III Corps sector's defense was handed over the US X Corps.|$|E

Edward's British ministers felt that, in proposing the speech, Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown.|$|E
