5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which is somewhat undermined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid hemorrage due to {{arterial}} rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends {{into the}} V4 {{section of the}} artery. This may be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arterial wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.|$|E
5|$|Their {{longevity}} may {{be explained}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets. Although derived from earth products, concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures.|$|E

She explains the choice of <b>the</b> city <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> her two daughters decided to study in London ...|$|R
50|$|This is {{balanced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a spellcaster must save against spell drain. In BESM d20, this is represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a spell drains energy points. In a regular Fantasy d20 game, this is represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> spellcaster inflicting non-lethal damage on himself or herself.|$|R
5000|$|The {{diffusion}} model of osmosis is rendered untenable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> osmosis can drive water across a membrane toward a higher concentration of water. The [...] "bound water" [...] model is refuted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> osmosis {{is independent of}} the size of the solute molecules—a colligative property—or how hydrophilic they are.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stern had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic {{with the provision that}} Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Imelda's Blue Ladies—specifically Maria Luisa, a {{daughter}} of the rich Madrigal family and the wife of Dr. Vasquez—contributed to the fashion spending of Imelda. In 1968, Maria Luisa accompanied Imelda on an overseas trip, during which Imelda and daughter Imee spent $3.3 million. It was also {{at this time that}} Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a Citibank account. On November of the same year, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account. An allegation that Imelda and Fernanda Vasquez {{are one and the same}} is validated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> notations for the bank account had Imelda Marcos's handwriting.|$|E

50|$|Local {{authorities}} {{have the power}} to instigate legal action, enter into contracts, acquire land and employ staff. However, these powers are somewhat curtailed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they are subordinate to the Central Government and Provincial Councils and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> other state institutions (such as the District Secretary) enjoy similar powers as the local authority.|$|R
5000|$|Geologists {{have tried}} to use hotspot {{volcanic}} chains to track {{the movement of the}} Earth's tectonic plates. This effort has been vexed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of very long chains, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> many are not time-progressive (e.g. <b>the</b> Galápagos) and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> hotspots {{do not appear to be}} fixed relative to one another (e.g. Hawaii and Iceland.) ...|$|R
5|$|Lampugnano, {{unfortunately}} for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano {{was killed in the}} uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further compounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, {{less than half of the}} animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
40|$|Behavioural {{genetics}} {{is about}} partitioning {{the sources of}} individual differences in any trait that can be measured reliably. The fundamental {{question is how much}} of the observed variability in a given trait can be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> people have different genes, and how much can be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> people have been exposed to different environments...|$|R
50|$|Spin glasses {{differ from}} {{ferromagnetic}} materials <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> after <b>the</b> {{external magnetic field}} is removed from a ferromagnetic substance, the magnetization remains indefinitely at the remanent value. Paramagnetic materials differ from spin glasses <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> after <b>the</b> external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization rapidly falls to zero, with no remanent magnetization. The decay is rapid and exponential.|$|R
25|$|This is evinced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{a trivial}} bundle always admits a flat connection.|$|R
5|$|Persistent {{rumors of}} her {{possible}} escape circulated after her death, fueled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> location of her burial was unknown during {{the decades of}} Communist rule. The mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held {{the remains of the}} Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991, and the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter—either Anastasia or her older sister Maria—were discovered in 2007. Her possible survival has been conclusively disproved. Forensic analysis and DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family, showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Poaching is {{a serious}} problem in the country, {{particularly}} of elephants for the profitable ivory industry and a threat to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poaching. The problem is worsened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.|$|E
5|$|The Uprising and its {{repression}} caused {{trauma that}} continues to manifest in the Malagasy population. Many Malagasy nationals fought each other and struggle to reconcile themselves to the remorse and guilt. Healing {{at the national level}} is further complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same leaders who proclaimed Madagascar's independence in 1960 were those who had been major players in the PADESM political party, which had been favored by the colonial administration after the crushing of the revolt.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{dromedary}} probably {{evolved in}} the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was {{closely related to the}} earliest Old World camels. This hypothesis is supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dromedary foetus has two humps, while in the adult male an anterior vestigial hump is present. A jawbone of a dromedary that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.|$|E
5|$|The new law was {{met with}} {{considerable}} resistance, especially in the towns and cities, where Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage {{in dealing with the}} alcohol trade among African Americans. Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{pretext of}} {{exercises}} allowed the Egyptians to conceal their preparations. These were further facilitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian Second and Third Field Armies were normally stationed along the Suez Canal for defence. Troops, armor, and crucially, the bridging equipment, {{were moved to}} their concentration areas {{over a period of}} fifteen nights up to the night of October 5/6, with a peak of activity during the final five nights.|$|E

5|$|The retreat {{was made}} even more serious <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gendarmes, tasked with {{stabilising}} the front and catching deserters, also fled in panic. The town itself was badly damaged, and the commanding officer of the 46th Regiment, Colonel Bronisław Krzywobłocki, was forced to order the retreat of {{the remainder of his}} forces south-west from the town. The rest of the division had no option but to fall back to the line of First World War trenches. During the chaotic withdrawal all the artillery sub-units got lost. By 19:00 hours the town was in Russian hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} {{has also}} been made that Jack and Jill represent Louis XVI of France, who was deposed and beheaded in 1793 (lost his crown), and his Queen Marie Antoinette (who came tumbling after), a theory made difficult <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> earliest printing of the rhyme pre-dates those events. There is also a local belief that the rhyme records events {{in the village of}} Kilmersdon in Somerset in 1697 when a local spinster became pregnant; the putative father is said to have died from a rock fall and the woman died in childbirth soon after.|$|E
5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it {{after the end of}} the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
