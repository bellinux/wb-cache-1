25|$|In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or {{the thick}} {{supernatant}} water from overcooked rice, {{is known as}} kanji. Kanji or Congee is also prepared with different grains available {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, <b>broken</b> <b>wheat,</b> maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state kanji, and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. Kanji is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the kanji depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice kanji is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. Ragi kanji is prepared by drying ragi sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. Ragi kanji can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses jevvarisi (sago in English, sabudana in Hindi) in kanji. Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{total and}} phytic phosphorus and endogenous phytase activity in cereals, oilseeds and by-products, feed ingredients used in animal {{production in the}} tropics were evaluated. The cereals and by-products were yellow corn, sorghum, hard <b>wheat,</b> <b>broken</b> rice, <b>wheat</b> bran, fine and gross defatted corn germ and bran, and rice polishing; the oilseeds and by-products were cotton seed and cotton meal, and soy, palm oil and coconut meals. In five samples of each ingredient, phytic acid was measured by a colorimetric procedure and phytase activity with an enzymatic-colorimetric method. In addition, mineral and chemical components were determined by conventional methods. Crude protein, ether extract, ash and mineral content were similar to values reported in feed composition tables. Total P concentration in cereal grains and by-products ranged from 0. 12 to 1. 57 %, and in oilseeds and by-products, from 0. 43 to 1. 34 %. In cereals and oilseeds, phytic acid concentrations varied from 0. 08 to 0. 49 %, and in by-products, from 0. 24 to 1. 13 %. Significant regressions were found between total and phytic P in cereals and by-products, and in oilseeds and by-products. In the former, correlations were also found between phytic P and Mg, K and Ca content. Phytase activity (U/kg) was significantly higher in wheat (1565). Rice, wheat bran and rice polishing had values > 100 U/kg. The remaining grains and by-products did not show phytase activity...|$|R

The present work intended to optimize the production method of inoculum (R. oligosporus), while adding value to food industry (<b>broken</b> rice, <b>wheat,</b> corn and rye flours). The follow objective consisted in optimizing the production process of tempeh, using traditional Portuguese legumes (pea and lupine) in comparison with soy tempeh. Finally, texture parameters (firmness and cohesiveness) were evaluated by a TPA. Instrumental colour parameters, throughout the fermentation and after storage at refrigeration temperature were also evaluated. The results showed the viability of producing the inoculum using food industry by-products (5 days, 29 ° C), with rye, rice “carolino” and long grain rice flours yielding a higher sporulation. Soybean and pea tempeh complete fermentation after 48 h at 29 and 37 °C, respectively, while the lupine tempeh only after 72 h at 37 ° C.

40|$|In the tropics, {{insect pests}} account for large losses of food grains and other commodities. The {{knowledge}} of the biological parameters to establish suitable models of growth becomes necessary for programs of integrated pest management. Some insect pests of stored products can attack the grains {{in the field and}} in the wharehouse, as it happens with the Cathartus quadricollis (Guerin-Meneville). In Brazil, surveys showed the presence of this insect in the field. However, surveys evidencing the presence of this species in grains during the storage are lacking. Due to the occurrence of C. quadricollis in stored grains, the determination of their biological parameters such as the population growth becomes necessary. We determined the instantaneous rate of population increase (ri) of C. quadricollis, natural mortality and grain loss in three different stored grains. The experiment on population growth and grain loss was carried out using Petri dishes with 40 g of <b>broken</b> maize, <b>wheat</b> and sorghum grains (13 % moisture content). Ten Petri dishes were infested with 20 non-sexed adults (2 - 4 weeks old) at 25 ºC and 70 % RH. The number of alive and dead insects was counted after 60 days. Insects on broken maize showed a higher ri. Insects on wheat and sorghum showed the smallest ri. The wheat and sorghum grains showed the higher weight loss among the three feeding substrate. The insect natural mortality was higher on wheat grains...|$|R

In 1988 and 1989, 96 and 93 % of the total wheat samples delivered were accepted respectively. Exceeding dockage content (max. limits 12 %) was the most important reason for rejection, followed by insect infestation. The major components of dockage were barley (39 %), <b>wheat</b> <b>broken</b> kernels (22. 5 %), shrunken kernels (19. 2 %), and weed seeds (15 %). Four beetles species were detected in the infested samples. The most commonly occurring species was Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). The number of insects per 1 kg relatively low and was correlated with period of storage, and percentage of dockage. A discriminate analysis was used to differentiate between free infested and infested samples on the basis of five discriminating variables (moisture content, dockage, test weight, protein content, and the length of storage in weeks). The accuracy of this formula was 89. 9 - 100 % and 84. 6 - 86. 3 % for free infested and infested samples respectively.

30|$|Şalgam is a purplish red colored, cloudy {{and sour}} soft {{beverage}} which is produced using some fermentation {{steps of a}} mixture of turnips, black carrot, bulgur (<b>broken</b> <b>wheat),</b> flour, salt, and water (Altay et al. 2013; Kabak and Dobson 2011). A similar product known as Kanji is produced in India (Rati Rao et al. 2006). Boza has a pale yellow color, viscous consistency and sweet or sour taste. It is produced from millet, maize, wheat, or rice semolina or flour by yeast and lactic acid fermentation. Boza is widely consumed in Turkey, Bulgaria, and some other countries of the Balkan generally in winter months. Kefir has a viscous, smooth, slightly foamy consistency and a whitish color. It is a fermentation product of milk using kefir grains. Kımız also known as koumiss, airag, kumys, or kumis, is a beverage made from mares’ milk with milky-grey color and acidic taste.

40|$|Coupling of {{phosphorylation}} to electron transport {{was examined}} {{by measuring the}} photosynthetic control ratio for <b>broken</b> <b>wheat</b> plastids isolated from seedlings at different greening stages. The photosynthetic control ratio progressively increased during greening and tight coupling was noted after granal stacking and thylakoid elongation. ADP impaired nonphosphorylating (state 2) electron transport rates of plastids at extremely early stages of greening and interfered with photosynthetic control measurements. Partially developed plastids exhibited low nonphosphorylating electron flow rates but did not exhibit high phosphorylating or uncoupled electron transport rates {{to the same extent}} as nearly developed plastids. Prolamellar body dispersal, primary thylakoid production, and the development of photosynthetic control were stimulated equally by 48 minutes of low irradiance, in cycles of 2 minutes every 2 hours, or by 9 hours of continuous light of moderate irradiance. Wheat plastids that greened for 6 hours in continuous light of moderate intensity did not exhibit photosynthetic control or much differentiation beyond the etioplast stage. It is concluded that plastid differentiation and the development of photosynthetic control early in greening under continuous light were limited by developmental time (dark time) rather than by either light intensity or duration...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the newly developed anticoagulant rodenticide, difethialone was evaluated against various rodent species in laboratory and fields. Difethialone at 0. 025 % concentration {{in the form of}} loose bait (<b>broken</b> <b>wheat</b> and rice + vegetable oil + garlic powder) gave absolute mortality in Rattus rattus, Mus musculus, Funambulus pennanti, and Meriones hurrianae during ‘no-choice’ tests in one day feeding. No significant difference was noted in poison bait intake and mean days to death between two and three days poison feeding. Mean days to death were ranged between 2. 9 to 5. 70 in all the species tested. In fields, baiting with the same loose bait (0. 025 %) was performed in the live burrows and 88. 89 % control recorded on the 4 th day after treatment.

40|$|Purpose Underlying {{mechanisms}} of the beneficial {{health effects of}} low glycemic index starchy foods are not fully elucidated yet. We varied the wheat particle size to obtain fiber-rich breads with a high and low glycemic response and investigated the differences in postprandial glucose kinetics and metabolic response after their consumption. Methods Ten healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, crossover study, consuming C- 13 -enriched breads with different structures; a control bread (CB) made from wheat flour combined with wheat bran, and a kernel bread (KB) where 85 % of flour was substituted with <b>broken</b> <b>wheat</b> kernels. The structure of the breads was characterized extensively. The use of stable isotopes enabled calculation of glucose kinetics: rate of appearance of exogenous glucose, endogenous glucose production, and glucose clearance rate. Additionally, postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, incretins, cholecystokinin, and bile acids were analyzed. Results Despite the attempt to obtain a bread with a low glycemic response by replacing flour by broken kernels, the glycemic response and glucose kinetics were quite similar after consumption of CB and KB. Interestingly, the glucagon- like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) response was much lower after KB compared to CB (iAUC, P < 0. 005). A clear postprandial increase in plasma conjugated bile acids was observed after both meals. Conclusions Substitution of 85 % wheat flour by broken kernels in bread {{did not result in}} a difference in glucose response and kinetics, but in a pronounced difference in GLP- 1 response. Thus, changing the processing conditions of wheat for baking bread can influence the metabolic response beyond glycemia and may therefore influence health...|$|E
40|$|Inert dusts are {{increasingly}} becoming {{an integral part}} of programs for protection of cereal grains from stored-product insects. The intention in this study was therefore to conduct preliminary tests of insecticidal potentials of the natural zeolite formulation Minazel SP (66 % SiO₂, particle size ≤ 50 μm) originating from Serbia in controlling S. oryzae, R. dominica and T. castaneum. Dust effectiveness was tested in the laboratory (24 ± 1 ºC and 50 - 55 % r. h. for parents and 24 ± 1 ºC and 60 ± 5 % r. h. for F₁ progeny) by exposing insects to wheat treated with 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00 g/kg of Minazel SP. Mortality was determined after 7, 14 and 21 days of insect contact with threated wheat, and total mortality after an additional 7 days of recovery on untreated <b>broken</b> <b>wheat.</b> Progeny production in F₁ generation was also determined for each insect species after 8 - 12 weeks. After seven days of exposure and 7 days of recovery of all tested species, the highest efficacy of 62 % was observed after the highest application rate of 1. 00 g/kg against S. oryzae. The highest efficacy after 14 and 21 days was achieved with the same application rate against T. castaneum (100 %), S. oryzae (96 - 98 %) and R. dominica (70 - 82 %). Progeny reduction (IR – inhibition rate) of all tested species depended on the duration of parents exposure to treated wheat. After 7 days of exposure progeny reduction rates were 49 - 67 % for S. oryzae, 42 - 68 % for R. dominica and 47 - 78 % for T. castaneum. After 14 days of exposure, inhibition rates were 55 - 78 % for S. oryzae, 72 - 81 % for R. dominica and 53 - 90 % for T. castaneum, while progeny reductions of S. oryzae were 51 - 85 %, R. dominica 80 - 96 % and T. castaneum 87 - 99 % after 21 days of exposure...|$|E
40|$|Jackals live {{in almost}} any {{environment}} in humid forest country or in dry open plains, or desert. They have been found at height of 3600 m in the Himalayas (Prater, 1980). Though jackals are scavengers, but many times they hunt small animals in pair or in packs (Chhangani, 2000). They are also reported feeding on melon, sugarcane, bare (Prater, 1980). On 14 th September 2002, I was coming from village Khejarli (a Bishnoi village) some 25 km, southeast to Jodhpur. I was on the survey {{to assess the impact}} of drought on mammals in Luni tehsil of Jodhpur district. At about 9. 30 p. m. after 2 km of driving by jeep on the way to Jodhpur from Khejarli, I saw a animal look like dog feeding on the road on some thing from a broken pitcher. I turned the light of jeep towards the animals, it was jackal. I took the jeep about 5 meters, close to the animal but the jackal did not run away and kept on continuously feeding. I took my camera out and took 4 - 5 photographs of the jackal feeding on the artificial food (Figure 1 W). Suddenly one truck came from the other side and jackal ran away from the road. I came out from the jeep and went to examine the food eaten by the jackal. I was surprised to see the food; it was Lapsi (a local sweet dish made by <b>broken</b> <b>wheat</b> grains, butter and sugar). I observed jackal feeding on it about 5 - 7 minutes continuously, he must have been very hungry. This change in feeding or adaptation in diet must be the main cause of the successful survival of jackals through out the Indian region. This may be also due to severe drought this year, because most of the livestock and cattle have migrated from the area. Therefore the scarcity of carcasses food forces them to feed on such vegetarian food...|$|E
