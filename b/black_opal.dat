25|$|Ammolite {{is neither}} easily nor often imitated; however, a few {{materials}} have a passing resemblance that may deceive the unfamiliar. These include: labradorite (also known as spectrolite), an iridescent feldspar that {{may also be}} of Canadian origin; and broad-flash <b>black</b> <b>opal.</b> Neither are convincing substitutes, and the latter is actually of greater value than ammolite. Indeed, ammolite is often used as an imitation of <b>black</b> <b>opal.</b> An even less convincing possibility is Slocum stone, a common glass-based imitation of opal. Blues and purples are much more pervasive in labradorite, and in both it and opal the play of color is seen to roll across the stone unlike the comparatively restricted play of color in ammolite. In Slocum stone, the play of color {{takes the form of}} tinsel-like patches. The visible structure is also considerably different; in the imitations, the body of the stone is transparent to translucent from certain angles, whereas ammolite is entirely opaque.|$|E
25|$|Japan is {{the largest}} market for ammolite; {{this may be due}} to its use as an {{imitation}} of increasingly scarce <b>black</b> <b>opal,</b> or its aforementioned use in Feng Shui. Secondary markets include Canada, where it is used both by artisans who sell their creations to tourists of Banff National Park and in fine jewelry production; and the Southwest United States, where it is used by Zuni and other Native American craftspeople.|$|E

50|$|While {{still in}} high school, Cowdery {{published}} three poems in 1927 in <b>Black</b> <b>Opals,</b> the new literary journal founded that year. It was co-founded in 1927 by Arthur Fauset, a folklorist and teacher, and Nellie Rathbone Bright, a teacher and poet who later published four novels. They {{were part of a}} literary and intellectual group in Philadelphia who also became known as the <b>Black</b> <b>Opals.</b>|$|R

Although it was published in Philadelphia, the magazine was considered part of the larger artistic world of the Harlem Renaissance. Similar literary groups and magazines sprang up in Boston and Washington, DC.|$|R
500|$|Larger-scale {{agriculture}} {{occurs on}} rubber and cashew plantations. Other economic {{activities in the}} province include gem mining and commercial logging. The most abundant gem in Ratanakiri is blue zircon. Small quantities of amethyst, peridot, and <b>black</b> <b>opal</b> are also produced. Gems are generally mined using traditional methods, with individuals digging holes and tunnels and manually removing the gems; recently, however, commercial mining operations have been moving into the province. Logging, particularly illegal logging, {{has been a problem}} both for environmental reasons and because of land alienation. This illegal logging has been undertaken by the Cambodian military and by Vietnamese loggers. In 1997, an estimated 300,000 cubic meters of logs were exported illegally from Ratanakiri to Vietnam, compared to a legal limit of 36,000 cubic meters. John Dennis, a researcher for the Asian Development Bank, described the logging in Ratanakiri as a [...] "human rights emergency".|$|E
2500|$|As in {{many other}} parts of South Australia, Aborigines were {{reportedly}} the first people to find opal at Mintabie. [...] They sold <b>black</b> <b>opal</b> at Coober Pedy during the first world war but it was many years before miners braved the harsh conditions to mine the area. [...] The first miners to work in Mintabie found the sandstone too hard to successfully mine. [...] It was not until 1976, when large machinery was introduced, that the potential of Mintabie was fully realized and the fledgling township was established.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1920s Fauset {{was part}} of a Philadelphia {{literary}} group called the <b>Black</b> <b>Opals,</b> typical of African-American groups springing up in several major East Coast cities, and inspired by activities in Harlem. In 1927 they founded a literary magazine called <b>Black</b> <b>Opals,</b> which he co-edited with Nellie Rathbone Bright. She also published poetry in the magazine, as did Mae V. Cowdery; both their pieces were praised by Countee Cullen, the new literary editor of Opportunity. [...] Bright was a teacher in the Philadelphia schools. Another member of the intellectual group and artistic director of the magazine was Allan Randall Freelon, a painter. They published the magazine for one year.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} structure of precious opal makes it diffract light. Depending on {{the conditions in}} which it formed, it can take on many colors. Precious opal ranges from clear through white, gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, magenta, rose, pink, slate, olive, brown, and black. Of these hues, the <b>black</b> <b>opals</b> are the rarest, whereas white and greens are the most common. Opals vary in optical density from opaque to semitransparent.|$|R
50|$|Lightning Ridge {{is a town}} in {{north-western}} New South Wales, Australia, in Walgett Shire, {{near the}} southern border of Queensland, about six kilometres east of the Castlereagh Highway, and is served in commercial activities by the town of Walgett, some 75 km to the south. Lightning Ridge is a flourishing tourist town with numerous caravan (camper-trailer) and camping parks, the previously very rustic Diggers' Rest pub (which has burned down for the third time) and a well-appointed bowling club with its eight artificial-grass bowling greens. Temperatures in summer can reach into the high 40s Celsius, but below ground the temperature remains continually at around 22 degrees, year round. The Lightning Ridge area is a world-renowned centre of the mining of <b>black</b> <b>opals</b> and other opal gemstones. Lightning Ridge has the largest known deposits of <b>black</b> <b>opals</b> in the world. The name Lightning Ridge {{is said to have}} originated when in the 1870s some passers by found the bodies of a farmer, his dog and 200 sheep which had been struck by lightning.|$|R

Their literary group became known by the same name; these young people in Philadelphia were typical of literary groups that arose in numerous East Coast cities, inspired by the Harlem Renaissance. Bright and Fauset intended their journal as a quarterly but ceased publication in 1928 after only three issues, as the journal failed to gain a large enough readership.|$|R

5000|$|For {{gemstone}} use, most opal is cut {{and polished}} {{to form a}} cabochon. [...] "Solid" [...] opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a [...] "solid" [...] may be combined with other materials to form attractive gems. An opal doublet consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or <b>black</b> common <b>opal</b> (potch), onyx, or obsidian. The darker backing emphasizes the play of color, and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet {{is similar to a}} doublet, but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear quartz or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often of lower quality. Triplet opals therefore have a more artificial appearance, and are not classed as precious opal. Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching.Combined with modern techniques of polishing, doublet opal produces a similar effect to <b>black</b> or boulder <b>opal</b> {{at a fraction of the}} price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.|$|R
