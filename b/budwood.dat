40|$|The use of {{tolerant}} rootstocks and preimmunization has satisfactorily controlled losses {{associated with}} the Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). Several researchers have shown that CTV mild isolates that are selected in the same region where they are used are superior to isolates obtained from other areas. Thus, <b>budwoods</b> of 20 outstanding citrus trees were collected in north and northwestern Paraná state (Brazil) citrus-producing areas and established {{to be used in}} a preimmunization program. These <b>budwoods</b> were tested to evaluate the potential protection of the inherently present viral complex. Based on biological indexing and molecular characterization of the capsid protein gene by RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism, which indicated that the plants were infected with mild isolates of CTV), some of the selected plants could be used in a preimmunization program. These potentially mild and protective isolates were challenged with severe 'Rolândia' isolate inoculations by grafting and by the brown citrus aphid (Toxoptera citricida Kirkaldy) vector, which was faster in transmitting the virus. Some isolates had a better protective value than others, particularly when challenged with the severe CTV isolate. The SSCP (single strand conformational polymorphism) molecular analysis was an excellent complementary tool for monitoring the performance of the experiments and the stability of the viral complex present in the plants. Isolate number 1, collected in the municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul (CS- 1), was the most promising for protecting commercial Pêra sweet orange (C. sinensis L.) orchards in northern and northwestern Paraná. The Rolândia severe CTV isolate was stable and had a high genetic divergence among the severe isolates used as a control (Capão Bonito and Barão B) and all of the isolates tested...|$|R

In this study, the global gene changes in leaves of ponkan (Citrus reticulata) mandarin trees following psyllid-transmission of HLB were analyzed at the early symptomatic stage (13 weeks post inoculation, wpi) and late symptomatic stage (26 wpi) using digital gene expression (DGE) profiling. At 13 wpi, 2452 genes were downregulated while only 604 genes were upregulated in HLB infected ponkan leaves but no pathway enrichment was identified. Gene function analysis showed impairment in defense at the early stage of infection. At late stage of 26 wpi, however, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in carbohydrate metabolism, plant defense, hormone signaling, secondary metabolism, transcription regulation were overwhelmingly upregulated, indicating that the defense reactions were eventually activated. The results indicated that HLB bacterial infection significantly influenced ponkan gene expression, and a delayed response of the host to the fast growing bacteria might be responsible for its failure in fighting against the bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{establishment}} in 1966, the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR) has received assistance {{through a series}} of UNDP/FAO projects. The purpose of this Phase V project was to meet the need for additional assistance in the fields of horticulture, dryland farming, and soil-water management in the semi-arid lowlands, and also for the ongoing manpower development programme. More precisely, the immediate research objectives were: - to develop and initiate an expanded programme of research on horticultural crops aimed at introducing new varieties resistant to major pests and diseases and adapted {{to a wide range of}} the climatic conditions of the country, and at developing appropriate agri- cultural practices for their use; - to establish a continuous research programme on soil and water management practices appropriate for irrigation, drainage and salinity control in respect of lowland crops in the semi-arid areas of the country; and - to strengthen research programmes in water conservation, tillage and soil management, varieties, cropping patterns and farming systems appropriate to dryland farming in the semi-arid areas of the countryAlthough positive results were achieved in each of these areas, the long-term nature of the research involved meant that further work was still required. To this end, the project made several recommendations based on the technical findings and conclusions of the research activities. A sixth phase of assistance was being provided through project ETH/ 87 / 001 which would enable these issues to be addressedWith regard to horticulture, the continuation of the evaluation and adaptability trials for priority horticultural crops, such as citrus, grape, banana, onion, shallot and hot pepper, which are of economic importance to the country, was strongly recommended, and attention should be given to the identification of varieties that are tolerant or resistant to the major pests and diseases. The results should be made available for use in small-scale as well as large-scale farming operations. There was a great need for certified disease-free planting material for use in horticultural research and production. In this context, top priority should be given to the establishment of foundation and reference blocks to produce virus-free certified <b>budwoods</b> to support the massive citrus plantings by the state farmsEffective techniques needed to be developed for the reclamation of salt-affected and waterlogged soils in the semi-arid areas, as well as for the drainage of heavy problem soils. The continuation of studies on the efficient use of irrigation water in the semi-arid areas was highly recommendedThe priority need in the area of dryland farming was for viable cropping systems that would maintain the soil resource, minimize erosion and conserve soil moisture, as well as realize economic yields. Such systems should be suitable for use by both small- scale and large-scale farmersThe human resources required to carry out these research programmes needed to be further strengthened and increased. It was recommended that a programme of in- service and overseas training be developed to meet the needs of each research sub-project. Steps should be taken to ensure that fellows trained by the project return to the IAR so as to maintain the continuity of research activitiesThe placing of horticulture, dryland farming and irrigation/soil-water management within the framework of a single project implied an interdependence and complementarity of the disciplines that was not readily discernible in practice. However, horticulture makes use of dryland farming concepts, physiology and irrigation; dryland farming uses horticultural crops and irrigation to evolve suitable cropping systems; irrigation/soil-water management could be applied to horticulture as well as to dryland farming to extend cropping periods. It was recommended that the interrelationships between the three disciplines be exploited to the full during the sixth phase of project assistance, ETH/ 87 / 001, through the design and implementation of integrated and coordinated research and development activities. Such an approach could produce composite, rather than piecemeal, solutions to farming problems for verification by producers as a packag...|$|R

5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the melon (cotton aphid) Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown citrus aphid Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected <b>budwood</b> for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|E
5000|$|When CTV {{was first}} {{discovered}} quarantine {{was the best}} management strategy, now quarantining only works for areas where {{a small amount of}} trees are infected. The other approach that was adopted after T. citricida came to the U.S. was destroying any tree in which the <b>budwood</b> was not free of CTV. [...] This is a more drastic measure but must be done due to how fast T. citricida can spread the virus. If there is any CTV in the area, avoid grafting trees on sour orange rootstock and instead graft on tristeza-tolerant rootstock. Since the virus has been in Asia a long time they have used rootstock from trifoliate orange, Sunki, and Shiikuwasha (C. depressa Hayata) for many years. Some hybrids, such as Troyer citrange or Swingle citromelo, show promise as resistant root-stock. Also, using scion varieties tolerant to stem pitting is recommended. The production of virus-free trees by shoot-tip grafting or heat treatment is very important. If it is possible to keep the field permanently free of CTV, the planting of virus-free trees is practical. In areas where it is difficult to find a virus-free field, preinoculation with a mild CTV strain protects trees against infection with a severe strain of CTV. Bud-stock trees should be inoculated with a mild CTV strain at least four to six months prior to propagation. They should then be kept in a greenhouse, under aphid-free conditions. It is also recommended that nurseries of young plants grown for propagation should be kept vector-free. Top-grafting with pre-inoculated buds onto interstock trees infested with severe CTV is not effective, because the tree has little protection against the disease. It is necessary to spray nursery plants and young trees with insecticide occasionally, to control aphids. This should retard any re-infection with the virus. A biological approach has been to bring in a parasitoid wasp from Asia that naturally controls A. spiraecola. This approach was stopped when T. citricida arrived due to it not being a parasite of the more important aphid. There is a natural parasite of aphids in Florida in the gall midge family Cecidomiidae that attempts to keep aphid levels down, however due to the influx in aphid population it {{has not been able to}} keep populations down.|$|E
