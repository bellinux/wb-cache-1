60|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{nothing to}} eat anywhere, and still less to drink.|$|E
60|$|Tom looked; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{nothing in}} the middle of the pool, but one peaked iceberg: and he said so.|$|E
60|$|Falkner did not reply. There was an {{interval}} of silence, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from {{the movement of}} George's shoulders that he was shaking with suppressed laughter.|$|E
60|$|Whitney {{looked hard}} at him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> the Scot's face well.|$|R
60|$|Bradley was silent. He {{sympathized with}} her feeling, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> very much hope in a revolt.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{approached}} him; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her, lying {{with his}} face turned up to the night sky.|$|R
60|$|Scrooge glanced {{about him}} on the floor, in the {{expectation}} of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing.|$|E
60|$|He had the queerest {{impression}} {{that something had}} just peeped over the hedge at him, a queer big head. With round ears! He peered hard, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did poppa tell you?" [...] she asked, with {{a certain}} defiance. She held her head up fiercely, and spoke steadily, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the pulse beating in her pretty neck.|$|E
60|$|Matt {{tried to}} peer about him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> far, {{owing to the}} sheets of rain which fell all around.|$|R
60|$|Lawson {{put down}} his knife and fork. His green eyes flashed fire, he gasped with rage; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> {{imposing}} calm upon himself.|$|R
60|$|The {{employer}} {{came and}} stood beside him. He {{felt he was}} being a little hard on the bishop, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> any way of making things easier.|$|R
60|$|He stared {{all round}} him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{no more than}} the mocking Bandar-log {{scudding}} through the trees, and Mor, his tail spread in full splendour, dancing on the slopes below.|$|E
60|$|He felt to {{make sure}} that the bill was safe in his pocket, and then {{continued}} on his journey. Several times he looked back, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing of the Rover boys or their friends.|$|E
60|$|He {{went up the}} half-flight {{of stairs}} to Noel's narrow little room, next the nursery. No voice {{answered}} his tap. It was dark, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her at the window, leaning far out, with her chin on her hands.|$|E
60|$|That froze Lenore. Her heart quaked. She {{gazed down}} upon him {{with all her}} soul in her eyes. She knew it and did not care. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{kept his}} eyes fixed on hers, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> them change from their pity of him, or light up with a sense of any squalor in his history.|$|R
50|$|Carl von Ghega {{was next}} {{assigned}} to {{the building of a}} railway in Transylvania, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> this project to its end because of his death in Vienna from tuberculosis.|$|R
60|$|He remembered {{all about}} George Lechmere now. He had the {{reputation}} of being the best judge of cattle in the neighbourhood, and a thoroughly steady fellow, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no resemblance in the shrunk and wasted face to that he remembered.|$|E
60|$|She gave {{no actual}} reply, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her profile {{straight}} and white, the curved lips firmly pressed together, the brow slightly puckered, {{and from the}} expression of her face and of her whole attitude, {{he knew that she}} had heard.|$|E
60|$|But now, as {{it turned}} to charge again, the man had no guide whereby to direct his point. He heard the {{scraping}} of the padded feet upon the rocky floor. He knew the thing was charging down upon him once again, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing.|$|E
60|$|The night {{came and}} Jasper {{returned}} to his cell.... He leant against the door, looking out through the little window, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> the darkness. And he likened it to the darkness in his own soul.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice trailed}} off. He {{was not a}} very {{intelligent}} young man, <b>but</b> even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that his was not a position where righteous indignation could be assumed with any solid chance of success. As a substitute he tried pathos.|$|R
60|$|We grumbled a good deal. We {{thought he}} might, at least, {{have had it}} {{whitewashed}} or tarredâ€”had something done to it to distinguish it from {{a bit of a}} wreck; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> any fault in it.|$|R
60|$|It was a windy, whispering, moonless night. To guide {{himself he}} opened under a lamp a map he had brought. The breeze ruffled and fluttered it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> enough {{to decide on}} the {{direction}} he should take to reach the heart of the place.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} dim in the place, {{except for the}} light thrown up into it from the turmoil of lights outside, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that there was nothing}} of the smiling mockery on Jeff's face which habitually {{expressed}} his inner hardihood. It was a frowning mockery.|$|E
60|$|Then {{becoming}} {{aware that she}} had not obscured the windows she came forward to do so, candle in hand. It was too dark for her to see Jude without, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her face distinctly, and there was an unmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long-lashed eyes.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{looked all}} around the room, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> any opening, except the chimney and the door, and the little crevices, which he had {{observed}} about the finishing of the room. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not find any place.|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} rapidly failing, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>see</b> {{the faces of}} the men, who turned to him as though {{uncertain}} what to do. Tomlinson stood still among the rest, and his voice and attitude were both unmistakably compassionate.|$|R
60|$|Osborne {{was partly}} {{reassured}} by her voice. She spoke in her normal tone, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her better.|$|R
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} Dickory {{was in his}} canoe, {{paddling}} to the town. When {{he was out of}} the little inlet, on the shore of which lay his mother's cottage, he looked far up and down the broad river, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing of the good ship Sarah Williams.|$|E
60|$|His sight was {{not equal}} to his comrade's, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{a smear of}} blue vapour curl athwart the pines, for he had banked the fire with wet fuel, so that it should smoke all day in case Tom of Okanagan had {{overtaken}} the horse and was following their trail.|$|E
60|$|Yes, Mr. Ends had the address, and {{the check}} would be mailed {{the first thing}} in the morning. Martin's {{knowledge}} of banks and checks was hazy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no reason why they should not give him the check on this day just {{as well as on the}} next.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{felt his}} heart beat as he saw Clare. She was dressed in white, and the silver clasp gleamed against a {{lavender}} band at her waist. It was significant that she wore it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her face clearly. Then Ida beckoned Jake.|$|R
60|$|And {{then there}} was a little {{conversation}} carried on between these ladies so entirely sotto voce that the reporter of this scene was unable to hear a word of it. <b>But</b> this <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> that Miss Todd bore by far the greater part in it.|$|R
60|$|Wetzel's {{powerful}} arm {{forced him}} so {{hard against the}} log that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not complete the exclamation; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>see.</b> Girty had not heard that stifled cry, for he continued his slow wading, and presently his tall, gaudily decorated form passed out of sight.|$|R
