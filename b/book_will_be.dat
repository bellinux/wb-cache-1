500|$|Reviews of the {{new book}} were as {{complimentary}} as those for its predecessors. The Times Literary Supplement wrote, [...] "French Provincial Cooking needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this <b>book</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> well repaid by dishes such as La Bourride de Charles Bérot and Cassoulet Colombié." [...] The Observer said that it was difficult to think of any home that could do without the book and called David [...] "a very special kind of genius".|$|E

500|$|Simon Heffer, {{writing in}} the Daily Mail, said that Peel [...] "does not write with {{sufficient}} detachment" [...] or rigorously enough, but that the <b>book</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{of great interest to}} those who want to know [...] "what is really wrong with the British Establishment"—Heffer {{made it clear that he}} felt Chenevix-Trench should never have been Headmaster of Eton in the first place, and that other people's appointments in the [...] "British Establishment" [...] were equally flawed. Paul Foot wrote a personal recollection for the Diary section of the London Review of Books, reprinted in the Guardian, in which he described the book as [...] "a wretched hagiography, full of clichés and bad jokes", and objected to its portrayal of Chenevix-Trench as [...] "a heroic figure".|$|E
500|$|Whether {{or not the}} <b>book</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{adapted to}} film remains a matter of speculation.

[...] Many critics have considered the possibility of a sequel in their reviews of Eragon. One critic said that 20th Century Fox's plans to adapt Eldest was [...] "" [...] and that [...] "they will have a tough time convincing anyone but the most die-hard fans to return for another helping." [...] Even some critics who gave the film positive reviews were skeptical towards the possibility of a sequel: [...] "That the studio hopes to build a franchise on this, now that—that is expecting way too much." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1979 the Publications Appeal Board, on the {{recommendation}} of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, overruled the banning of Burger's Daughter. The state security specialist reported the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board [...] "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that [...] "t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [...]" [...] Notwithstanding the unbanning, the chairman of the Appeal Board told a press reporter, [...] "Don't buy —it is not worth buying. Very badly written... This is also why we eventually passed it." [...] The Appeal Board described the book as [...] "one-sided" [...] in its attack on whites and the South African Government, and concluded, [...] "As a result... the effect of the <b>book</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> counterproductive rather than subversive." ...|$|E
500|$|Butters soon does, in fact, write a {{novel of}} his very own, The Poop That Took a Pee, which {{consists}} solely of simple descriptions of scatological acts. The four boys are convinced the <b>book</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a disaster and expose Butters as a fraud over the first book. However, much to their surprise, readers actually find it an even deeper, more profound book, and continue reading their own allegorical messages into the text. After finishing the book, one crazed reader storms onto the set of reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians and murders the entire Kardashian family with a pump-action shotgun. Both The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs and The Poop That Took a Pee are banned as a result, and Butters is devastated, mainly because he always saw Kim Kardashian as [...] "the {{most beautiful woman in}} the world". Stan and Kyle suggest that rather than reading books and mindlessly discovering false messages in them, people should simply watch television instead. Cartman also tricks Butters into thinking that he dressed Sarah Jessica Parker in a moose costume, and was therefore responsible for her being shot in the woods. Butters starts to panic at first, but calms down and shrugs because of how [...] "ugly" [...] she was anyway.|$|E
500|$|In 2011 an {{agreement}} was reached with the Jesuit British Province for the British Library to buy the book for £9million. [...] This required the purchase money to be raised by 31 March 2012, and a public appeal was launched. [...] In the early stages the emphasis was on raising large individual donations, which included £4,500,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which distributes {{some of the money}} from the profits of the National Lottery, £250,000 pledged by the Art Fund, and [...] "a similar sum" [...] by The Garfield Weston Foundation, and a large gift from the Foyle Foundation. [...] By early March 2012 the British Library reported that there was [...] "only £1.5M left to raise", and on 17 April announced that the purchase had been completed, after their largest ever public appeal. [...] The purchase [...] "involved a formal partnership between the Library, Durham University and Durham Cathedral and {{an agreement}} that the <b>book</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> displayed to the public equally in London and the North East." [...] There was a special display at the British Library until June 2012, and after coming off display for detailed investigation the book went on display in Durham in July 2013 in Durham University's Palace Green Library. [...] Subsequently it has been on display in both London and Durham, but in 2017 was resting off display. [...] All the pages are accessible on the British Library website.|$|E
