"Yes, an Englishman," [...] replied Hammond; [...] "a <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister,</b> [Endnote: 5] in fact, of Lincoln's Inn, who, {{having little}} or nothing to detain him at home, has come to spend a few idle months in seeing the new {{republic}} which has been made out of English substance." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course I am {{much too}} good-natured {{a friend of}} both parties not to tell Gray of Goldmore's opinion in him, and the nabob's astonishment at the of the <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister</b> having any dinner at all. Indeed, Goldmore's saying became a joke against Gray amongst us wags at the Club, {{and we used to}} ask him when he tasted meat last? whether we should bring him home {{something}} from dinner? and cut a thousand other mad pranks with him in our facetious way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will {{whisper to}} you confidentially {{that my sister}} was engaged to Serjeant Shirker--a fellow whose talents one cannot deny, and be hanged to them, but whom I have always known to be mean, selfish, and a prig. However, women don't see these faults in the men whom Love throws in their way. Shirker, who has about as much warmth as an eel, made up to Polly years and years ago, and was no bad match for a <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister,</b> as he was then.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We don't have meat every day, Mr. Goldmore,' he continued, 'and it's a {{treat to}} {{me to get a}} dinner like this. You little know, you gentlemen of England, who live at home at ease, what hardships <b>briefless</b> <b>barristers</b> endure.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then he related his {{interview}} with Colby, to the amusement of his nieces, all three of whom approved the course he had taken and were already prepared to vouch for the <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister's</b> ability, {{on the grounds that}} eccentricity meant talent.|$|R

60|$|We sat {{and talked}} together, we four, for some time. I found {{the young man}} with the lugubrious countenance {{improved}} immensely on closer acquaintance. His talk was clever. He {{turned out to be}} the son of a politician high in office in the Canadian Government, and he had been educated at Oxford. The father, I gathered, was rich, but he himself was making an income of nothing a year just then as a <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister,</b> and he was hesitating whether to accept a post of secretary that had been offered him in the colony, or to continue his negative career at the Inner Temple, for the honour and glory of it.|$|E
60|$|On {{hearing this}} magnanimous resolution, the widow's heart was greatly cheered; for, in fact, she might {{probably}} {{have considered the}} Doctor's perseverance in the plan, of which she had expressed such high disapprobation, as little less than a symptom of absolute defection from his allegiance. By an accommodation, therefore, which suited both parties, it was settled that the Doctor should attend his loving widow to Shaws-Castle, without mask or mantle; and that the painted screen should be transferred from Quackleben's back to the broad shoulders of a <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister,</b> well qualified for the part of Wall, since the composition of his skull might have rivalled in solidity the mortar and stone of the most approved builder.|$|E
6000|$|... "In your spare time!" [...] Mrs. Cosham echoed. [...] "That is a {{proof of}} devotion, indeed." [...] She half closed her eyes, and indulged {{herself in a}} {{fascinating}} picture of a <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister</b> lodged in a garret, writing immortal novels {{by the light of}} a farthing dip. But the romance which fell upon the figures of great writers and illumined their pages was no false radiance in her case. She carried her pocket Shakespeare about with her, and met life fortified by the words of the poets. How far she saw Denham, and how far she confused him with some hero of fiction, {{it would be hard to}} say. Literature had taken possession even of her memories. She was matching him, presumably, with certain characters in the old novels, for she came out, after a pause, with: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} one night {{being in the}} Fair myself, at an evening party. I observed old Miss Toady there also present, single out for her special attentions and flattery little Mrs. <b>Briefless,</b> the <b>barrister's</b> wife, who is of a good family certainly, but, as we all know, is as poor as poor can be.|$|R
6000|$|There is a {{house or}} two in Town where you may meet on certain evenings, everybody; where duchesses and unfledged poets, bishops and red republican refugees, fox-hunting noblemen and <b>briefless</b> <b>barristers</b> who have taken to politics, are jumbled {{together}} {{for a couple of}} hours, to make what they can out of each other, to the exceeding benefit of them all. For {{each and every one of}} them finds his neighbour a pleasanter person than he expected; and none need leave those rooms without knowing something more than he did when he came in, and taking an interest in some human being who may need that interest. To one of these houses, no matter which, Elsley was invited on the strength of the [...] "Soul's Agonies;" [...] found himself, for the first time, face to face with high-bred Englishwomen; and fancied--small blame to him--that he was come to the mountains of the Peris, and to Fairy Land itself. He had been flattered already: but never with such grace, such sympathy, or such seeming understanding; for there are few high-bred women who cannot seem to understand, and delude a hapless genius into a belief in their own surpassing brilliance and penetration, while they are cunningly retailing again to him the thoughts which they have caught up from the man to whom they spoke last; perhaps--for this is the very triumph of their art--from the very man to whom they are speaking. Small blame to bashful, clumsy John Briggs, if he did not know his own children; and could not recognise his own stammered and fragmentary fancies, when they were re-echoed to him the next minute, in the prettiest shape, and with the most delicate articulation, from lips which (like those in the fairy tale) never opened without dropping pearls and diamonds.|$|R
60|$|There in a stuffy {{court in}} London, a grimy oblong box of a room, during the {{exceptional}} {{heat of the}} May of 1956, the leading counsel of the day argued and shouted over a miserable little matter of more royalties or less and whether the Dass-Tata company might not bar the Holsten-Roberts' methods of utilising the new power. The Dass-Tata people were indeed making a strenuous attempt to secure a world monopoly in atomic engineering. The judge, after the manner of those times, sat raised above the court, wearing a preposterous gown and a foolish huge wig, the counsel also wore dirty-looking little wigs and queer black gowns over their usual costume, wigs and gowns that were held to be necessary to their pleading, and upon unclean wooden benches stirred and whispered artful-looking solicitors, busily scribbling reporters, {{the parties to the}} case, expert witnesses, interested people, and a jostling confusion of subpoenaed persons, <b>briefless</b> young <b>barristers</b> (forming a style on the most esteemed and truculent examples) and casual eccentric spectators who preferred this pit of iniquity to the free sunlight outside. Every one was damply hot, the examining King's Counsel wiped the perspiration from his huge, clean-shaven upper lip; and into this atmosphere of grasping contention and human exhalations the daylight filtered through a window that was manifestly dirty. The jury sat in a double pew {{to the left of the}} judge, looking as uncomfortable as frogs that have fallen into an ash-pit, and in the witness-box lied the would-be omnivorous Dass, under cross-examination....|$|R
6000|$|But {{then not}} one novelist in a {{thousand}} ever does tell us {{the real story of}} their hero. They linger for a dozen pages over a tea-party, but sum up a life's history with [...] "he had become one of our merchant princes," [...] or [...] "he was now a great artist, with the world at his feet." [...] Why, there is more real life in one of Gilbert's patter-songs than in half the biographical novels ever written. He relates to us all the various steps by which his office-boy rose to be the [...] "ruler of the queen's navee," [...] and explains to us how the <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister</b> managed to become a great and good judge, [...] "ready to try this breach of promise of marriage." [...] It is in the petty details, not in the great results, that the interest of existence lies.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. E. O. Pleydell-Bouverie has endowed the novel-writing {{fraternity}} {{with a new}} {{formula for}} the composition of titles. After J. S.; or, Trivialities {{there is no reason}} why we should not have A. B.; or, Platitudes, M.N.; or, Sentimentalisms, Y.Z.; or, Inanities. There are many books which these simple titles would characterise much more aptly than any high-flown phrases--as aptly, in fact, as Mr. Bouverie's title characterises the volume before us. It sets forth the uninteresting fortunes of an insignificant person, one John Stiles, a <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister.</b> The said John falls in love with a young lady, inherits a competence, omits to tell his love, and is killed by the bursting of a fowling-piece--that is all. The only point of interest presented by the book is the problem as to how it ever came to be written. We can scarcely find the solution in Mr. Bouverie's elaborately smart style which cannot be said to transmute his 'trivialities' into 'flies in amber.' ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course it}} was a great catch for a landless and <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister</b> like myself--dependent on a small fortune in South American securities, and my {{precarious}} earnings as a writer of burlesque--to secure such a valuable prospective property as Editha Fitz-Simkins. To be sure, the girl was undeniably plain; but I have known plainer girls than she was, whom forty thousand pounds converted into My Ladies: and if Editha hadn't really fallen over head and ears in love with me, I suppose old Fitz-Simkins would never have consented to such a match. As it was, however, we had flirted so openly and so desperately during the Scarborough season, {{that it would have been}} difficult for Sir Peter to break it off: and so I had come to Egypt on a tour of insurance to secure my prize, following in the wake of my future mother-in-law, whose lungs were supposed to require a genial climate--though in my private opinion they were really as creditable a pair of pulmonary appendages as ever drew breath.|$|E
60|$|At the {{windlass}} {{are standing}} two men, whom {{we may have}} seen in past years, self-satisfied in countenance, and spotless in array, sauntering down Piccadilly any July afternoon, or lounging in Haggis's stable-yard at Cambridge any autumn morning. Alas! how changed from the fast young undergraduates, with powers of enjoyment only equalled by their powers of running into debt, are those two black-bearded and mud-bespattered ruffians, who once were Smith and Brown of Trinity. Yet who need pity them, {{as long as they}} have stouter limbs, healthier stomachs, and clearer consciences, than they have had since they left Eton at seventeen? Would Smith have been a happier man as a <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister</b> in a dingy Inn of Law, peeping now and then into third-rate London society, and scribbling for the daily press! Would Brown have been a happier man had he been forced into those holy orders for which he never felt the least vocation, to pay off his college debts out of his curate's income, and settle down on his lees, at last, in the family living of Nomansland-cum-Clayhole, and support a wife and five children on five hundred a-year, exclusive of rates and taxes? Let them dig, and be men.|$|E
60|$|Every word of {{information}} {{that had come to}} Phineas about Loughshane since Mr. Mildmay had decided upon a dissolution, had gone towards making him feel at first that there was a great doubt as to his re-election, and at last that there was almost a certainty against him. And as these tidings reached him they made him very unhappy. Since he had been in Parliament he had very frequently regretted that he had left the shades of the Inns of Court for the glare of Westminster; and he had more than once made up his mind that he would desert the glare and return to the shade. But now, when the moment came in which such desertion seemed to be compulsory on him, when there would be no longer a choice, the seat in Parliament was dearer to him than ever. If he had gone of his own free will,--so he told himself,--there would have been something of nobility in such going. Mr. Low would have respected him, and even Mrs. Low might have taken him back to the friendship of her severe bosom. But he would go back now as a cur with his tail between his legs,--kicked out, as it were, from Parliament. Returning to Lincoln's Inn soiled with failure, having accomplished nothing, having broken down on the only occasion on which he had dared to show himself on his legs, not having opened a single useful book during the two years in which he had sat in Parliament, burdened with Laurence Fitzgibbon's debt, and not quite free from debt of his own, how could he start himself in any way by which he might even hope to win success? He must, he told himself, give up all thought of practising in London and betake himself to Dublin. He could not dare to face his friends in London as a young <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister.</b>|$|E

50|$|Camden's {{place was}} then given to Lord Cornwallis, {{who came to}} Ireland {{for the express purpose}} of {{carrying}} a Legislative Union. Foster refused to support him and joined the opposition. Fitzgibbon, however, aided Cornwallis, and so did Castlereagh, who for some time had discharged the duties of chief secretary in the absence of Mr. Pelham, and who was now formally appointed to the office. And then began one of the most shameful chapters in Irish history. Even the corrupt Irish Parliament was reluctant to vote away its existence, and in 1799 the opposition was too strong for Castlereagh. But Pitt directed him to persevere, and the great struggle went on. On one side were eloquence and debating power, patriotism, and public virtue, Grattan, Plunket, and Bushe, Foster, Fitzgerald, Ponsonby, and Moore, a truly formidable combination. On the other side were the baser elements of in Parliament, the needy, the spendthrift, the meanly ambitious, operated upon by Castlereagh, with the whole resources of the British Empire at his command. The pensioners and placemen who voted against him at once lost their places and pensions, the military officer was refused promotion, the magistrate was turned off the bench. And while anti-Unionists were unsparingly punished, the Unionists got lavish rewards. The impecunious got well-paid sinecures; the <b>briefless</b> <b>barrister</b> was made a judge or a commissioner; the rich man, ambitious of social distinction, got a peerage, and places and pensions for his friends; and the owners of rotten boroughs to large sums for their interests. The Catholics were promised emancipation in a united Parliament, and in consequence many bishops, some clergy, and a few of the laity supported the Union, not grudging to end an assembly so bigoted and corrupt as the Irish Parliament. By these means Castlereagh triumphed, and in 1801 the United Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland opened its doors.|$|E
