Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> commercials, that he was selling out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E

25|$|In the 1984 county season, Hadlee {{completed}} a feat {{rare in the}} modern age <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> county 'double' – scoring 1000 runs and taking 100 wickets in the same season. Hadlee, and his immediate successor at Nottinghamshire Franklyn Stephenson, {{are the only two}} players to achieve this feat in English county cricket since the number of county games per season was reduced in 1969. The runs component of the double included Hadlee's highest first class score, 210* in a victory over Middlesex at Lord's. In 1987, his swan song, he narrowly missed the double as Nottinghamshire won the County Championship as they had in 1981. Hadlee's contribution with ball and bat to both and their other triumphs was immense. They next won the championship in 2005 with fellow Kiwi Stephen Fleming in charge.|$|E
25|$|The Niño de las Suertes has {{a strong}} {{following}} due to its association with Santa Muerte. While the image {{was created in the}} 19th century, its popular veneration is a recent phenomenon. The image was found by two evangelists in the rubble of the Hacienda of San Juan de Dios in Tlalpan. It was handed over to Archbishop Francisco Lizana y Beaumont. As a number of monasteries wanted to claim it, the archbishop decided to make the decision by lottery. It is said that this image favored the Convent of San Bernardo due to the vow of poverty by its nuns. This was confirmed <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> drawing three times. In the 19th century, due to tensions between the Mexican government and the Church, the image was moved to Tacubaya when the convent was secularized. This image has a skull by the infant's head. This originally symbolized the future Passion, but recently it has made this image associated with Santa Muerte, whose devotees visit.|$|E

In response, Warren's brothers issued a joint statement stating that they [...] "grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives talk about our family's Cherokee and Delaware heritage". Brian Leiter of the Chicago Law School dismissed the allegations against Warren, noting that law schools have [...] "no pressure to hire Native Americans for affirmative action reasons", and that Warren's record of scholarship was [...] "clearly sufficient to get her appointed at Harvard".

Kindler once saw I Am Legend, and practically wanted to [...] "rip it off" [...] with a Sanctuary-esque story behind it. It was written to be more about Magnus and Zimmerman than the [...] "zombies;" [...] <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> opposite—the episode being more about the zombies and Magnus spending most of the episode finding a cure—it would not be as interesting. Kindler ran out of time to allow the episode to move at the correct pace, and asked James Thorpe to co-write it with him; out of the five acts, Thorpe wrote the first two acts, while Kindler wrote the remaining three. Kindler liked Thorpe's contribution towards the episode for including much of the imagination and ideas towards it.|$|E

This proved to be somewhat more difficult.

Reid felt that <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> documentary, at least he could go to his [...] "grave 'saying I tried'".

He joined forces with production company Code Entertainment and engaged with a [...] "reliable" [...] director; Jonathan Hensleigh. They then signed actors Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken to the project. This was followed by the signing of actors Vincent D’Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket), Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas), and Irish actor Ray Stevenson, respectively. Stevenson was filming The Book of Eli when he got a telephone call from Hensleigh, so they arranged to meet in Los Angeles. According to Stevenson, he was drawn to the script and immediately made a deal.|$|E
500|$|The first English monarch to be {{recorded}} as distributing alms at a Maundy service was John, who on 15 April 1210 donated garments, forks, food, and other gifts to the poor of Knaresborough, Yorkshire. John is also the first English monarch to {{be recorded}} as giving gifts of small silver coins to the poor when in 1213 he gave 13pence to each of 13poor men at a ceremony in Rochester—the number being symbolic of the Twelve Apostles together with either Jesus or an angel. [...] Few details of the 13th century Maundy survive; they {{are known to have}} existed from records which show the spending necessary for the gifts to the poor. [...] The monarch was not alone in performing the rituals of the Maundy service; Henry III's children assisted him as part of their political and religious training. [...] Henry's son, Edward I, was the first monarch to keep the Maundy only on or about Maundy Thursday; before Edward, additional Maundys might be kept during the year. [...] According to Virginia Cole in her study of royal children's role in the 13th century Maundy, the service had a political purpose as well, as needing to humble himself <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> pedilavium proclaimed the monarch's greatness. [...] Attendance at a Maundy service became an obligation for all major European ruling houses.|$|E
