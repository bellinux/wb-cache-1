40|$|To fully exploit {{multicore}} processors, {{applications are}} expected to provide a large degree of thread-level parallelism. While adequate for low core counts and their typical workloads, the current load balancing support in operating systems {{may not be able}} to achieve efficient hardware utilization for parallel workloads. <b>Balancing</b> <b>run</b> queue length globally ignores the needs of parallel applications where threads are required to make equal progress. In this paper we present a load balancing technique designed specifically for parallel applications running on multicore systems. Instead of <b>balancing</b> <b>run</b> queue length, our algorithm balances the time a thread has executed on “faster ” and “slower ” cores. We provide a user level implementation of speed balancing on UMA and NUMA multisocket architectures running Linux and discuss behavior across a variety of workloads, usage scenarios and programming models. Our results indicate that speed balancing when compared to the native Linux load balancing improves performance and provides good performance isolation in all cases considered. Speed balancing is also able to provide comparable or better performance than DWRR, a fair multi-processor scheduling implementation inside the Linux kernel. Furthermore, parallel application performance is often determined by the implementation of synchronization operations and speed balancing alleviates the need for tuning the implementations of such primitives...|$|E

The platform offers advanced features such as transparent task management, load <b>balancing,</b> <b>run</b> time compilation of agent code and task migration and is therefore denoted by the adjective "Intelligent". The architecture of the platform will be outlined from a computational point of view and each component will be described in detail.

In this paper, we study the characteristics of PN codes in navigation and communication integration system, including correlation, <b>balance,</b> <b>run</b> length and linear complexity. Furthermore, it puts forward and constructs a novel imLogCheby sequence successfully. The imLogCheby sequence’s uncertainty and randomness has been improved comparatively while maintaining the main advantages of the chaotic sequence with a large number and good confidentiality.

50|$|The card {{could not}} be used to enter a gate when the <b>balance</b> <b>ran</b> below the minimum price of a ticket, yet cash {{could not be}} added to a card. To use up the {{remaining}} fare on those cards, tickets could be bought with cards and cash in combination, or a new card could be bought with the old card's balance rolled over onto the balance of the new card.

When buying cards from the subway system, the maximum balance on an old card to do this procedure was 310 yen and for cards bought from Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu), it was a 690 yen balance when buying cards costing 2,000 yen or 3,000 yen, and a 1,500 yen balance when buying cards costing 5,000 yen.|$|R

40|$|Platinum {{filament}} pyrolyzers achieve {{very high}} temperature and heating rate and can provide useful parameters for practical applications in combustion, pyrolysis and gasification processes. The critical {{use of an}} experimental instrument is necessary to provide reliable data. In this work, a commercial pyrolyzer (CDS Pyroprobe 2000) is characterized to obtain a correspondence between the nominal and the effective operating conditions. This {{is the basis for}} the modeling estimation of the effective thermal history of the sample during each experimental run. The experimental results obtained performing the devolatilization of coals, biomass and waste fuels using the pyrolyzer are compared with those obtained in a conventional thermogravimetric balance, to evaluate the effects of extremely different operating conditions. The amount of volatile released programming the most severe thermal conditions using the pyrolyzer (thus in conditions more similar to large-scale plants) differs significantly from that of thermogravimetric runs. Global kinetics are obtained fitting the experimental results and using the thermal history of the sample from the model results. They depend strongly on the conditions used for the devolatilization. Global kinetics obtained in the thermogravimetric <b>balance</b> <b>runs</b> (low heating rate) overestimate the rate of devolatilization in the pyrolyzer (high heating rate). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These input errors include: mis-specification of the input parameters (bottom friction, eddy viscosity, etc.); errors in input fields and errors in the specification of boundary information (lateral boundary conditions, etc.). Errors in input parameters can be addressed with fairly straightforward parameter estimation techniques, while errors in input fields can be somewhat ameliorated by physical linkage between the scales of the bathymetric information and the associated model response.

50|$|The {{railways}} {{based on}} the Ewing System are basically monorails using a balancing wheel for balancing the train.

In addition the cost of laying tracks also goes down considerably since only one rail is used. Another benefit of using Ewing System was that the <b>balancing</b> wheel could <b>run</b> on existing tarred roads as well as the macadam roads thus further reducing cost to lay down tracks.|$|R

40|$|PaperPg. 113 - 129. Rotor {{unbalance}} {{remains one}} of the leading causes of deterioration and vibration of rotating machinery; but, if physical weight corrections can be made, many machines can be successfully balanced in-place with considerable savings in downtime and labor costs. In-place balancing can, however, pose some unique problems, and a prime concern is the time, expense, and wear and tear to simply start and stop the machine for trial data. Therefore, this paper is presented to provide guidelines for recognizing and overcoming some of the more common in-place balancing problems so that the number of <b>balance</b> <b>runs</b> can be kept to a minimum. Vibration analysis techniques are presented as the first step to verify that the problem is truly unbalance and not looseness, weakness, distortion, resonance, misalignment, eccentricity, or other problems which could be mistaken for unbalance. Problems such as repeatability, rotor sag, stratification, thermal distortion, load effects, rotor speed and other variables which can influence rotor balance are discussed. Measurement techniques and common sources of measurement error are also presented. The importance of identifying the type of rotor unbalance (static, couple, quasi-static, or dynamic) is presented along with a review of common single- and two-plane balancing procedures with emphasis on their suitability for in-place balancing. Methods are presented for determining suitable trial weights - both amount and position - to achieve the desired results. Finally, guidelines are presented for establishing realistic balance and vibration tolerances for rotors balanced in-place...|$|R

This <b>balance</b> <b>runs</b> somewhat in parallel to my music, which maintains some semblance of tonal structure, while also venturing into more contemporary techniques. A product of the Jazz Age, I believe that some of Millay's artistic perspective has a home in my music, which relies on jazz harmony and shows great appreciation of early twentieth-century popular and art music. The roots of this particular piece come from a desire to create a large orchestral work which has an underpinning of jazz harmony, but without most of the rhythmic or cultural associations that are attached to composing "jazz". I employ ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths, so typical of jazz, but not in terms of chord progressions moving by fifths or resolving with a conventional sense of voice leading. Much of the harmony is voiced without regard for the traditional hierarchy of tonal music, {{despite the fact that the}} chords and progressions themselves contain almost exclusively "tonal sounding" chords. The purpose of composing this way is to create textures which are both unpredictable and contemporary, yet approachable by a listener who has little exposure to present-day art music. This is how I interpret the work of Millay - a modern artistic endeavor which still has roots in tradition...|$|R
