5|$|In September 1945, Hồ {{declared}} independence {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) following {{the withdrawal of}} Imperial Japan, which had seized {{control of the country}} from France during the Second World War. At the time, there was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned to be the leader of the local unit, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|In either 1483 or 1484, Josquin {{is known}} to have been {{in the service of the}} Sforza family in Milan. While in their employ, he made one or more trips to Rome, and {{possibly}} also to Paris; while in Milan he made the acquaintance of Franchinus Gaffurius, who was maestro di cappella of the cathedral there. He was in Milan again in 1489, after a possible period of travel; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> that year.|$|E
5000|$|In the end, Steel is freed, <b>but</b> <b>he's</b> <b>left</b> overtly {{suspicious}} over Wonder Woman's motives, questioning she {{may still}} serve the Amazons cause, to him perceived as harmful and dangerous. He correctly guesses the love story buddying between Nemesis and Wonder Woman, and so decides to keep Diana and Tresser in constant surveillance.|$|R

5|$|Lord {{signed up}} as bassist his friend Simper, whose fame {{at the time}} came from his {{membership}} in {{the rock and roll}} group Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and for having survived the car crash in 1966 that killed Kidd. The line-up of Roundabout was completed by drummer Bobby Woodman, recruited by Blackmore. Dave Curtiss, an acquaintance of Woodman, was at first considered as singer, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> to fulfill previous commitments. According to Simper, Ian Gillan, the singer of the band Episode Six, was also contacted for an audition, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Mowbray left Hibs in October 2006 {{to manage}} West Bromwich Albion, and was {{replaced}} by former player John Collins. The team won the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final under his management, but the club sold Kevin Thomson, Scott Brown and Steven Whittaker for fees totalling more than £8million. Collins resigned later that year, frustrated by the lack of funds provided to sign new players. Former Hibs player Mixu Paatelainen was hired to replace Collins, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> after the end of his first full season.|$|E
5|$|Paul played {{high school}} hockey for Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis, Missouri during his {{freshman}} and sophomore years in high school, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> {{the high school}} team {{to play for the}} Tier III Junior B St. Louis Jr. Blues.

5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese {{with a warm}} reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.|$|E
5|$|Haynes and {{his wife}} toured the American West after his retirement, indulging {{themselves}} while searching for a permanent residence. Some of the general's friends suggested Wichita Falls, the city of his last military post, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> to assess the possibility of living in Taos, New Mexico, {{where he and his}} airman son hiked and explored ancient human settlements. Deciding against Taos, Haynes {{and his wife}} continued in their tour, soon finding Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to their liking. There, he bought two adjoining lots on North Carmelo Street with one existing house. Rather than accepting any of the offers he received promising an executive career in the aeronautics industry, he relaxed by hunting and fishing.|$|E
5|$|In January 1956 Hope {{recorded}} with another rising star, Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist's Lights Out! In April {{of the same}} year Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.|$|E
25|$|He {{was accused}} of having {{accumulated}} an enormous personal fortune while in office, <b>but</b> when <b>he</b> <b>left,</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> a large surplus in the treasury, and a wealth of stores and provisions.|$|R

5|$|In the 3000 m team race on {{the next}} day, Nurmi and Ritola again {{finished}} first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth. Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him. After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years. He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Monti {{was born}} in Abington, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1975, to Paul, a school teacher, and Janet Monti. He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, he disappeared from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt {{on the other side}} of the fence. On another occasion, a migraine headache kept him home from school, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the house and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School at the age of 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{capitulation}} {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to leaving the country, and in early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at Sieniawa, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, he stopped in Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E

5|$|The script {{called for}} the {{creation}} of the Enterprise-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert– who had designed the Enterprise-D– was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's Enterprise to The Next Generations much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the Enterprise-B was an Excelsior-class vessel and reasoned that the C would share design elements with its Excelsior-class predecessor and its Galaxy-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise-C, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> {{at the end of the}} season and his absence meant that no one knew what the drawing was intended to be.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Docherty was {{appointed}} manager in 1971 {{and had a}} brief, but successful, time in charge. Docherty lost only three of his 12 matches as manager, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the job in late 1972 to become manager of Manchester United. Despite losing 5–0 to England in his first match in charge, Scotland qualified for the 1974 World Cup under the management of Willie Ormond. Scotland performed creditably at the finals, winning against Zaire and drawing against Brazil and Yugoslavia, but were eliminated on goal difference. Ormond suffered from player indiscipline during his tenure, which included an infamous incident where Jimmy Johnstone, after a night out drinking, sat in a rowing boat that was drifting out to sea. Two teammates attempted to rescue Johnstone, but eventually {{he had to be}} retrieved by local fishermen. Ormond left the Scotland job in 1977 to become manager of Hearts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of conference play, the Bearcats were 4–1, and their only loss was against top-five {{opponent}} Oklahoma. With Pike still injured, Cincinnati beat Rutgers, 13–10, in the Bearcats' first Big East game of the season. The Bearcats suffered their second defeat {{of the season in}} the following week, however, losing to the UConn Huskies, 40–16. Pike returned from the injury and had the Bearcats leading at halftime, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the game at the half when numbness in his non-throwing hand prevented him from being able to take the snap. In the two weeks that followed the loss to the Huskies, Cincinnati recovered to beat two top-25 opponents: No. 23 South Florida and No. 20 West Virginia. The two victories pushed the Bearcats to a 3–1 conference record and the No. 22 position in the AP Poll before Cincinnati's annual rivalry game against Louisville. That game, also known as the Battle for The Keg of Nails, ended in a Cincinnati victory {{for the first time since}} 2002.|$|E
