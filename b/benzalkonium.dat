25|$|Independent {{studies have}} shown some {{commercial}} preparations to contain the compound <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, which is a synthetic antimicrobial commonly used in disinfectants and cleaning products, the related compound benzethonium chloride, the antibiotic triclosan, or the preservative methylparaben. Some samples were shown to contain up to 22% <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride by weight, despite the known allergenicity and toxicity of the compound at higher doses. These chemicals were not present in grapefruit seed extracts prepared in the laboratory, and GSE preparations without the contaminants were found to possess no detectable antimicrobial effect. Although citrus seed extract is sold in health food markets, {{there is no good}} evidence for any natural antimicrobial activity.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol-free hand {{sanitizer}} efficacy is {{heavily dependent on}} the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs. More recently, formulations that use <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride {{have been shown to}} have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.|$|E
25|$|Contact lens {{solutions}} often contain preservatives such as <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride and benzyl alcohol. Preservative-free products {{usually have}} shorter shelf lives, but are {{better suited for}} individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, thiomersal {{was used as a}} preservative. In 1989, thiomersal was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses. As a result, most products no longer contain thiomersal.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, several {{compounds}} (antifungals, fungicides, and biocides) where {{shown to}} effectively inhibit {{the growth of}} P.destructans including <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, chloroacetoxyquinoline, chloroxine, ciclopirox olamine, econazole, phenylmercuric acetate, pyrithione zinc and sulconazole. The same study showed that P.destructans was sensitive to Amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole, while the fungus had some resistance to anidulafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine and micafungin. A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia.|$|E
25|$|Grapefruit seed extract {{has been}} {{advocated}} to {{be a powerful}} antimicrobial with proven activity against bacteria and fungi. However, independent studies have shown the efficacy of grapefruit seed extract as an antimicrobial is not demonstrated. Although citrus seed extract is claimed to be a highly effective plant-based preservative by some natural personal care manufacturers, studies asserted that the universal antimicrobial benefits associated with GSE are merely from the presence of synthetic preservatives. Natural GSE has no antimicrobial properties. Newer studies found many commercial grapefruit seed extracts contaminated with synthetic preservatives. In a 2007 study the main synthetic antimicrobial agent identified in commercial GSE samples was benzethonium chloride. In a 2008 study synthetic disinfectants such as benzethonium or <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride were identified in most of the commercial GSE products. In a 2008 study suspected counterfeit products were determined to contain benzethonium chloride in grapefruit seed extract samples.|$|E

2500|$|B. pseudomallei is {{susceptible}} to numerous disinfectants, including <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, iodine, mercuric chloride, potassium permanganate, 1% sodium hypochlorite, 70% ethanol, 2% glutaraldehyde, {{and to a lesser}} extent, phenolic preparations. [...] B. pseudomallei is effectively killed by the commercial disinfectants, Perasafe and Virkon. [...] The microorganism can also be destroyed by heating to above 74Â°C for 10 min or by ultraviolet irradiation. [...] B.pseudomallei is not reliably disinfected by chlorine.|$|E
50|$|Poisoning by <b>benzalkonium</b> {{chloride}} is {{recognised in the}} literature. A 2014 {{case study}} detailing the fatal ingestion of up to 240ml of 10% <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride in a 78-year-old male also includes {{a summary of the}} currently published case reports of <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride ingestion. While the majority of cases were caused by confusion about the contents of containers, one case cites incorrect pharmacy dilution of <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride as the cause of poisoning of two infants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzalkonium</b> {{chloride}} {{has been}} in common use as a pharmaceutical preservative and antimicrobial since the 1940s. While early studies confirmed the corrosive and irritant properties of <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, investigations into the adverse effects of, and disease states linked to, <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride have only surfaced during the past 30 years.|$|E
5000|$|The spermicides <b>benzalkonium</b> {{chloride}} {{and sodium}} cholate {{are used in}} some contraceptive sponges. [...] <b>Benzalkonium</b> chloride might also be available in Canada as a suppository.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzalkonium</b> {{chloride}} poisoning {{of domestic}} pets has been recognised {{as a result}} of direct contact with surfaces cleaned with disinfectants utilising <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride as an active ingredient.|$|E
50|$|Many mass-marketed inhaler and {{nasal spray}} {{formulations}} contain <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride as a preservative, despite substantial {{evidence that it}} can adversely affect ciliary motion, mucociliary transport, nasal mucosal histology, human neutrophil function, and leukocyte response to local inflammation. Although some studies have found no correlation between use of <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride in concentrations at or below 0.1% in nasal sprays and drug-induced rhinitis, others have recommended that <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride in nasal sprays is avoided. In the United States, nasal steroid preparations that are free of <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride include budesonide, triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone, and Beconase and Vancenase aerosol inhalers.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} found that <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, a common {{additive}} to oxymetazoline nasal sprays, may damage nasal epithelia and exacerbate rhinitis medicamentosa. However, the majority of studies find <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride to be a safe preservative.|$|E
50|$|The Today sponge {{contains}} 1,000 milligrams (mg) of nonoxynol-9. Protectaid contains 5,000 mg of the F-5 gel, {{with three}} active ingredients (6.25 mg of nonoxynol-9, 6.25 mg of <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, and 25 mg of sodium cholate). Pharmatex contains 60 mg of <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride.|$|E
50|$|Although {{historically}} <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride {{has been}} ubiquitous as a preservative in ophthalmic preparations, its ocular toxicity and irritant properties, {{in conjunction with}} consumer demand, have led pharmaceutical companies to increase production of preservative-free preparations, or to replace <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride with preservatives which are less harmful.|$|E

50|$|Newer {{formulations}} using <b>benzalkonium</b> {{blended with}} various quaternary ammonium derivatives {{can be used}} to extend the biocidal spectrum and enhance the efficacy of <b>benzalkonium</b> based disinfection products. Formulation techniques have been used to great effect in enhancing the virucidal activity of quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants such as Virucide 100 to typical healthcare infection hazards such as hepatitis and HIV. The use of appropriate excipients can also greatly enhance the spectrum, performance and detergency, and prevent deactivation under use conditions. Formulation can also help minimise deactivation of <b>benzalkonium</b> solutions in the presence of organic and inorganic contamination.|$|E
50|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride {{has been linked}} to the development of asthma. In 2011, a large clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of hand sanitizers based on different active ingredients in preventing virus transmission amongst schoolchildren was re-designed to exclude sanitizers based on <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride due to safety concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} shown {{lingering}} <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride {{may be associated with}} antibiotic resistance in MRSA while no mechanism for resistance to alcohol has ever been described in bacteria.
