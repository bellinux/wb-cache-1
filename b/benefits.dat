In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied <b>benefits.</b> On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill <b>benefits</b> by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding <b>benefits</b> and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of <b>benefits</b> should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.|$|E

5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the <b>benefits</b> conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential <b>benefits</b> and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child.

5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission <b>benefits</b> from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission <b>benefits.</b> The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission <b>benefits</b> in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality <b>benefits</b> by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such as Los Angeles, MÃ©xico City, Santiago, Chile, SÃ£o Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air <b>benefits</b> by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, {{the location of the}} plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.|$|E
