It {{was found that the}} predicted value (4.96 IU/ml) obtained by RSM is in close accordance with observed activity 5.14 IU/ml. Endoglucanases are mainly induced by CMC while Wheat bran (natural substrate) exoglucanase is more active when induced by avicel and cellulose. Addition of substrate beyond a level caused inhibition of cellulase production. The molecular weight of protein as determined by SDS-PAGE is very similar to molecular weight of cellulase of Trichoderma viride (T. viride) cellulase and Trichoderma reesei (T. reesei) endoglucanase. T. reesei β-glucosidase has high enzymatic activity on CMC substrate when compared with T. viride β-glucosidase. Secondary structure analysed by using Circular Dichroism confirmed that composition of celluase system is very similar to other analysed species. The cellulase was found to be active in pH range of 4.8 - 5.5; while temperature range varied from 50 °C to 70 °C. Although the enzymatic activity produced by mutants were lesser than the parent, but in one case mutants of Trichoderma reesei’s BGL has shown higher activity on cellulose.|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} high sulfur content of coke produced during the upgrading of Athabasca bitumen makes it environmentally unsuitable as a fuel. Using heavy oil or bitumen as a binder we {{have attempted to}} coagglomerate these cokes with limestone, {{in an attempt to}} reduce emissions during combustion. By providing an environment where there is intimate contact between fuel and sorbent it was hoped that greater utilization of the sorbent could be achieved, compared to the systems where the sorbent is added separately to the combustion bed. Cokes from both Suncor and Syncrude operations were used in this investigation. The combustion tests on coke-sorbent agglomerates were carried out in a <b>bench</b> <b>scaled</b> fluidized bed apparatus at 850 degrees Celsius.

40|$|Enantioselective Liquid-Liquid Extraction (ELLE) is a {{technology}} for chiral separation that has {{great potential for}} application on all scales, from analytical to industrial production scale. Although many chiral selectors are available for techniques such as chromatography, they are usually not applicable to ELLE. By discussing recent technological advances, it is demonstrated that the technology is moving towards maturity for commercial application. Multistage countercurrent extraction models were used for predicting extraction performances for two different systems. For the enantioseparation of phenylglycinol with an azophenolic crown ether the enantioselectivity {{was found to be}} 10, and it was predicted that for 98 percent e. e. 4 stages were sufficient. For the separation of 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoyl-leucine using a cinchona alkaloid derivative the selectivity was 3. 43 and 12 stages are required for 99 percent e. e. Using bench-scaled centrifugal contactor separator equipment the model predictions were experimentally validated and very stable operation for over 10 hr. was proven. Extrapolation of the results shows that separation of 50 mol racemate per week with only about 0. 1 mol extractant is possible in the <b>bench</b> <b>scaled</b> equipment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} was to assess if Finnish coal flyash (CFA) waste {{could be used to}} synthesize zeolites. The world produces 750 million tonnes of CFA annually which is also the largest quantity waste produced. This figure will only increase as India, China, South America and Africa charges ahead with industrialization. The global recycle rate is 15 % annually. Finland produces about 750, 000 tonnes of CFA per year. It is also estimated that millions of tonnes of CFA is backfilled globally. Hence there is great potential to use it for high value applications as the raw material security exists. There are also disposal and environmental issues related to CFA which makes it our obligation to find a great solution. The recent trend towards circular economy, waste to value, sustainability, EU and National environmental legislations also provides a great platform to find a solution. Other reasons have been analysed from engineering, policy making, markets, scientific & innovation, national and regional impact, international trade, geographic location and future study perspectives. The literature section provides insights into CFA, structure, transformation, mechanism, combustion process, applications, environmental issues etc. The Zeolite section gives a deep understanding of origin, history, classification, trends in development, structure, morphology, applications, properties, circular economy context of zeolites, synthesis methods, raw material variations etc. There are 174 zeolite framework types in zeolite families and we put special emphasis on NaX (Faujasite framework) with tailored descriptions. The literature highlights CFA Zeolites, its differences with pure chemical ones, synthesis methods, previous works and global pilot projects. Conversion of Finnish CFA to Zeolite was a grand success. The overall process involved sieving, batch preparation, ageing, hydrothermal treatment, washing/filtration, drying and grinding. We sieved CFA to collect unburnt carbon (0. 2 % weight basis) and obtain consistent particle range. Creation of appropriate chemical composition, ageing for 24 hours (650 rpm at 21 ℃), hydrothermal treatment for 24 hours at 60 ℃- 85 ℃. Washing is followed by drying the product for 16 h and grinding it with mortar and pestle. CFA Zeolites have been made {{for the first time in}} Finland and Northern Europe. Both the CFA and CFA Zeolites were analysed using XRD, EDX, SEM and BET. CFA consisted of amorphous SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 along with crystalline quartz (SiO 2) and mullite (SiO 2. Al 2 O 3). The LOI was 4. 57 % (weight basis). The BET value for CFA was 366. 73 m 2 /g. The CFA Zeolite was pure phase NaX and crystalline without competing GIS, SOD, LTA phases. The BET surface area of CFA Zeolite was approx. 1800 - 2000 m 2 /g. This is the first time such high values have been reported in the world.

The quality of Sodium Chloride has always been an important issue because of its daily consumption and also its application in food industries. There is variety of methods to increase the quality of sodium chloride. Crystallization {{is one of the}} most common industrial methods to prepare food grade sodium chloride. In this method, different operational factors such as heat load transferred to the crystallizer, residence time of magma in crystallizer, mixer speed and feed concentration affect the purity and size of the produced salt.

Test results show that heating load has the highest effect on crystal sizing of the final product while feed concentration and residence time have lower effects. The effect of mixer speed is negligible. Finally, the best operating conditions for production of crystalline salt has been determined to be feed concentration of 37 % salt, mixer speed of 900 rpm, residence time of 60 minutes and heating load of 500 Watt...|$|R

5000|$|The {{differences}} between <b>bench</b> <b>scale,</b> pilot scale and demonstration scale are {{strongly influenced by}} industry and application. Some industries use pilot plant and demonstration plant interchangeably. Some pilot plants are built as portable modules that can easily transported as a contained unit. [...] For batch processes, in the pharmaceutical industry for example, <b>bench</b> <b>scale</b> is typically conducted on samples 1-20 kg or less, whereas pilot scale testing is performed with samples of 20-100 kg. Demonstration scale is essentially operating the equipment at full commercial feed rates over extended time periods to prove operational stability. For continuous processes, in the petroleum industry for example, <b>bench</b> <b>scale</b> systems are typically microreactor or CSTR systems with less than 1000 mL of catalyst, studying reactions and/or separations on a once-through basis. Pilot plants will typically have reactors with catalyst volume between 1 and 100 litres, and will often incorporate product separation and gas/liquid recycle {{with the goal of}} closing the mass balance. Demonstration plants, also referred to as semi-works plants, will study the viability of the process on a pre-commercial scale, with typical catalyst volumes in the 100 - 1000 litre range. The design of a demonstration scale plant for a continuous process will closely resemble that of the anticipated future commercial plant, albeit at a much lower throughput, and its goal is to study catalyst performance and operating lifetime over an extended period, while generating significant quantities of product for market testing. In the development of new processes, the design and operation of the pilot and demonstration plant will often run in parallel with the design of the future commercial plant, and the results from pilot testing programs are key to optimizing the commercial plant flowsheet. It is common in cases where process technology has been successfully implemented that the savings at the commercial scale resulting from pilot testing will significantly outweigh the cost of the pilot plant itself.|$|E
