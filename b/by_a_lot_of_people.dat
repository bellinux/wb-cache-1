On {{securing}} the signing of Bridges for the season, manager Gary Setchell stated [...] "I’m probably very, very fortunate I’ve stumbled across Bridgo when he’s got a lot going on outside of football, business wise". Whilst out injured, and having already obtained his UEFA 'B' coaching badge, Bridges was made first-team coach at the club in February 2015. He combined the role alongside continuing to play in the first-team. King's Lynn were moved into the Southern Premier League for the 201516 campaign and Bridges continued to feature regularly in the Linnets midfield during the campaign, making 39 appearances in all competitions. Bridges retired from playing in May 2016 to [...] "concentrate on his successful business ventures and spend time with his family". On his retirement, manager Setchell said “David will be missed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> at the football club but I totally understand his decision to call it a day on his fantastic playing career and pursue his business interests and spend more time with his young family.” ...|$|E
500|$|On September 22, 2011, an 18-year-old Melanie Amaro {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on {{the second}} day of the opening week of first season of The X Factor in the US. As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this. People like you inspire me. You made a believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A. Reid declared: [...] "Melanie, you are truly amazing. You have the gift, you have the soul, you have the spirit, you have the swagger ... you have the X Factor" [...] while Simon Cowell said: [...] "When I was asked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> why I was bringing this show to America, it was because I hoped that we were going to find someone like you." ...|$|E
500|$|The British Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson {{expressed}} outrage, accusing Beadle and {{the other}} judges of breaching [...] "the fundamental laws of the land", while Gibbs stated that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution he could only reject the ruling. An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle's argument but recognised his belief that [...] "because {{of the effect of}} the effluxion of time, he was entitled to take a different view", and concluded that the Chief Justice's argument was [...] "sufficiently plausible to make it difficult to say that that position is manifestly improper or that, in adopting it, Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct." [...] Beadle explained in a 1972 interview: [...] "We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when the thing was in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in, we wouldn't budge. But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the principle of law, which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it. Yet because we accepted the inevitable we're blamed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> for being responsible for the revolution, which is a very different thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality {{and it was quite}} hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to {{have been a part of}} a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E

2500|$|Phil's {{behaviour}} {{earned him}} a number of sworn enemies in Albert Square and by 2001 the character {{had become one of}} the soap's nastiest villains. In an interview with The Guardian McFadden commented on his alter ego's descent into villainy [...] "Phil's been had over <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> so now he feels like he can do it back. It's his history". However the character finally received his comeuppance in one of EastEnders most highly anticipated storylines, dubbed [...] "Who Shot Phil?". Phil was gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a [...] "Dallas-style" [...] whodunnit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which of them was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin – even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented [...] "The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret." [...] Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK – bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible.|$|E
