50|$|A hammer {{is a type}} of bullish {{reversal}} candlestick pattern, made up of {{just one}} candle, found in price charts of financial assets. The candle looks like a hammer, as it has a long lower wick and a short body {{at the top of the}} candlestick with little or no upper wick.

50|$|It is {{associated}} with FBN2.It {{is caused by a}} mutation in FBN2 gene on chromosome 5q23. Contractures of varying degrees at birth, mainly involving the large joints, are present in all affected children. Elbows, knees and fingers are most commonly involved. The contractures may be mild and tend to reduce in severity, but residual camptodactyly always remains present. The arm span exceeds body height but the discrepancy may be underestimated due to contractures of elbows and fingers. The same holds for the lower <b>body</b> <b>portion</b> with knee contractures. The most serious complication in CCA is scoliosis and sometimes kyphoscoliosis mandating surgery.|$|E

50|$|P. balaenopterae {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species of copepods within the family Pennellidae, {{reaching}} up to 30 cm in length. The adult females are characterised by a loss of external segmentation and absorption of swimming legs. Pennella species are recognised by the branched outgrowths on the posterior part of their abdomens. The mandibles form a sucking tube for the mouth through which the species feed and adults also have a pair of segmented sensory antennae. Five pairs of thoracic legs are found in the species, which are more modified in females than males. After attaching to the host the parasite undergoes diphasic growth. The first phase of this type of growth occurs in the copepod's anterior <b>body</b> <b>portion.</b> During the second phase of growth, the posterior portion which is where the reproductive organs are, begins to grow extremely rapidly, and is soon larger than the anterior portion.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{characteristics}} of early Shang zun's {{consisted of a}} flaring mouth, high neck and a large body. The zun's also had wide shoulders and a foot ring.

[...] Flanges appear begin to appear on the vessels body and neck while the same decoration is used. The shoulders consist of small animal heads. Late Shang to Early Zhou Zuns are slim.

[...] Early Western Zhou zun are shorter, rounder and smoother. The relief of the vessel emphasizes the form removing the flanges.

50|$|The {{demonstration}} of this {{effect can be}} seen in the comparison of two paintings done during the Renaissance era. The first is the work of Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337), the Last Judgment found in the Arena Chapel in Padua, and the other is the work of Nardo di Cione (1350-1357). Giotto gives Satan a very dominant role in Hell and portrays him to be most violent and gruesome. His depiction of Satan is representative of the popular conception before Dante and is in great contrast with the other two images of Satan. In both Cione's work, Satan is given three heads, each of which is consuming a body, just as Dante wrote in the Inferno. The other characteristics that the artist draws from Dante's Satan is that Satan’s lower <b>body</b> <b>portion</b> is strictly confined and he is given less power than he is in Giotto’s Last Judgment. A clear depiction of Dante's nine circles of Hell is also found in Cione's work, represented in the Cappella Strozzi of the Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Through this artwork and others of the Renaissance period, one can discover how much of an influence Dante had in the understanding of Satan and Christian Mythology.|$|E

40|$|Common {{scientific}} wisdom {{assumes that}} spider sexual dimorphism (SD) mostly results from sexual selection operating on males. However, testing predictions from this hypothesis, particularly male size hyperallometry, has been restricted by methodological constraints. Here, using geometric morphometrics (GMM) we studied {{for the first}} time sex-differential shape allometry in a spider (Donacosa merlini, Araneae: Lycosidae) known to exhibit the reverse pattern (i. e., male-biased) of spider sexual size dimorphism. GMM reveals previously undetected sex-differential shape allometry and sex-related shape differences that are size independent (i. e., associated to the y-intercept, and not to size scaling). Sexual shape dimorphism affects both the relative carapace-to-opisthosoma size and the carapace geometry, arguably resulting from sex differences in both reproductive roles (female egg load and male competition) and life styles (wandering males and burrowing females). Our results demonstrate that <b>body</b> <b>portions</b> may vary modularly in response to different selection pressures, giving rise to sex differences in shape, which reconciles previously considered mutually exclusive interpretations about the origins of spider SD...|$|R
40|$|The exact {{determination}} of the death age of embryos could be important in determining causes of embryonic mortality. For this reason, a study on partridge chick embryo development was useful. To monitor red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa rufa) embryo development, we incubated 80 eggs, chosen randomly, all laid in the same day of the 9 th laying week. Every day during the incubation period 2 eggs were opened, embryos were photographed, described in a macroscopic manner and several measurement were carried out. In order to estimate embryo age, we can divide the whole development process into two main periods. The first period is mainly characterised by formation of new organs (embryonic or extra embryonic or <b>body</b> <b>portions),</b> going from the first to 17 th incubation day. The second period is characterised by growth of body organs and limbs from the 18 th day to the 24 th.
