5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E

A Coruña also manufactures automobiles, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> {{on the scale}} of the French automobile manufacturing in Vigo. The Centro de Vigo de PSA Peugeot Citroën, founded in 1958, makes about 450,000 vehicles annually (455,430 in 2006); a Citroën C4 Picasso made in 2007 was their nine-millionth vehicle.|$|E

25|$|In England, {{some of the}} Cambridge Platonists {{approached}} hylozoism as well. Both Henry More and Ralph Cudworth (the Younger, 1617–1688), {{through their}} reconciliation of Platonic idealism with Christian doctrines of deific generation, {{came to see the}} divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism. i.e. materialism and hylozoism.|$|E
25|$|With Jochen Rindt signing for Lotus for 1969, Oliver was out, {{switching}} to BRM. He was to suffer disappointing {{two years at}} the Bourne team, which would effectively kill off his Grand Prix career. In two years, he would muster just four finishes, with his only points scores being 6th place in the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix, and 5th in the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. However, in 1970 he led much of the Race of Champions holding off Stewart and was a strong third {{for most of the}} Dutch and British GP. The poor result in the Austrian GP which Team boss, Lou Stanley thought he should have won, saw the best car go to Rodriquez from then on, but Oliver still led some laps at the slipstream Italian race. Stanley described Oliver, as 'good, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as good as he thought'. The majority of his other races saw the BRM break down. Most pundits and sponsor, Yardley, were surprised and disappointed after Oliver was sacked by BRM. Jackie Stewart, judged Oliver a very good GP and Can Am driver.|$|E
25|$|The Oilers {{became the}} first-ever league champions by {{defeating}} the Chargers, 24–16, in the AFL Championship on January 1, 1961. Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable {{for a new}} league, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> that of the NFL. In 1960, the NFL averaged attendance of more than 40,000 fans per game and more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game, while CFL attendances averaged approximately 20,000 per game. By comparison, AFL attendance averaged about 16,500 per game and generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game. Professional football was still primarily a gate-driven business in 1960, so low attendance meant financial losses. The Raiders, with a league-worst average attendance of just 9,612, lost $500,000 {{in their first year}} and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner Ralph Wilson. In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation. In fact, the only major change was the relocation of the Chargers from Los Angeles to nearby San Diego.|$|E

The New York City Department of Buildings said {{that the decision to}} demolish was the congregation's, but congregational vice president Joshua Shainberg said the Department of Buildings had left them no choice: [...] "The Department of Buildings told us, 'You are to demolish it or we are to demolish it.' There were figures of up to $1.5 million for demolition." [...] At the time of {{the building}}'s collapse, the Spiegel brothers vowed that it would be re-built, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as large: [...] "perhaps 20 feet high by 60 feet deep by 75 feet wide, which would cost about $2 million to $3 million".|$|E
500|$|The Okeechobee hurricane, {{also known}} as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane, was one of the deadliest hurricanes in the {{recorded}} history of the North Atlantic basin. The fourth tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and only major hurricane of the 1928 season, this system developed just offshore the west coast of Africa on September6. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. About 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought [...] "great destruction" [...] and 1,200deaths. The islands of Martinique, Montserrat, and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as severe as in Guadeloupe.|$|E

Brian wins her heart and the final rose, but when the cameras are turned off, Brooke tells Brian that it was nice [...] "working with him", and it is {{apparent}} that the show really is scripted, as Brian thought. Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never gets back to him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone at him when he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment. Brian is upset that he became the very thing he was mocking in the beginning.|$|E
40|$|Dictionaries are {{indispensable}} {{tools for}} a language learner. They will {{tell him what}} words mean {{and how they are}} distinguished semantically. What the dictionaries do not always do is specify how words are used idiomatically by native speakers, and in omitting to do so they can sometimes be misleading in that the information they offer may be necessary without being sufficient.

M.desmarestii is about as large as [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] and M.luciae is slightly smaller. In {{sharp contrast to the}} relatively narrow interorbital in [...] "Ekbletomys", these two taxa show a very broad interorbital. Also, [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] shows a relatively large zygomatic breadth of the skull, whereas the relative value is {{at the lower end of}} the variation among oryzomyines in Megalomys.

500|$|The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World {{were both}} neutral in their {{review of the}} film, giving neither {{specific}} praise nor criticism of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was positive: [...] "This idea has been used quite recently in an Independent film, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> so effectively as {{in the hands of}} the capable Thanhouser players. They give the farcical events an air of reality that goes far to strengthen the comical results. ... She insists on her lover rigging himself up in knightly costume and carrying her off on a horse to be married. The absurdity of this business in modern times is not made as much of as might have been, but it brings plenty of laughter. The actress who played the part of the girl marred her work by turning too often to face the camera. She is very pretty and attractive but she should not permit it to appear that she is so well aware of her beauty." [...] Some advertisements by theaters heavily promoted the comedy aspect of the film with generic quips.|$|E
500|$|At La Balize (now {{known as}} Pilottown), ominous weather {{conditions}} {{on the night of}} August 9 preceded the onset of gathering clouds and [...] "a violent storm", characterized by building seas and torrents of rain and wind such that water was driven under roof shingles, [...] "leaving not a dry spot to lay our heads". Sea water swamped the town overnight on August 10, and it was not until around noon when the storm let up and waters receded with a shift in winds. Property damage was widespread and many trees were blown down. The hurricane beached several watercraft, destroyed wharves, and inflicted losses that [...] "can hardly by estimated", but were initially judged at up to $10,000. No lives were lost in Balize. Further down the storm's track, Biloxi, Mississippi, experienced a gale beginning on the morning of August 11 and lasting until early the next morning. Tides ran [...] above average at Biloxi, and in Mobile, Alabama, residents also found wind-driven rain seeping [...] "through cracks and crevices not known before to exist" [...] in dwellings [...] "always waterproof to ordinary showers". Waters rose enough to cause minor inundations, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> at the same severity as those that occurred in other areas.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning {{felt that}} the episode [...] "didn't have the same comedic appeal" [...] as [...] "Klaus and Greta", but did say there were [...] "some funny moments to be sure", but overall the episode lacked. He commented that the main plot had its faults, but that the weak link in the story was Cheyenne Jackson's Danny. He wrote that the Sue character had been great in the past, but that her [...] "expanded role" [...] in this episode was less successful. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "dead in spots. I mean, I laughed out loud a number of times, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as much". He noted he liked Liz and Jack battling over Danny, but [...] "something about it never landed {{in the way it}} should have", and opined that the show {{did not know what to}} do with Jackson. Overall, he gave the episode a B rating. Sean Gandert for Paste {{felt that the}} Liz, Jack, and Danny plot was less interesting [...] "and in general pretty meh." [...] He noted that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "a big let-down" [...] after the airing of [...] "Klaus and Greta". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club called the episode uneven.|$|E
500|$|A 1985 {{review in}} the book The Motion Picture Guide said, [...] "The film tries to balance horror against {{morality}} but ends up shaky at best". The review described the special effects as [...] "all right, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as gruesome as the film pretends they are". In a review written shortly after the film was released, Variety wrote that the film [...] "more often than not succeeds in telling a story and sustaining audience interest," [...] and that the script included not only horrors, but also a human story with a moral message about society. However, the review also called the dialogue [...] "trite," [...] described some scenes as [...] "technically incorrect," [...] and said the film disappointed by lingering on the ordinary characters {{rather than on the}} monster. Gene Wright, who wrote a book about science fiction films, said the film [...] "attempts to blend pathos with awesome horror, but can't resist going for the gut with a surfeit of gore". Blockbuster Inc.'s Guide to Movies and Videos gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and described the it as [...] "unexciting and contrived, though Rick Baker's gross-out makeup is undeniably effective". In The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies, Phil Hardy described it as a better-than-average but [...] "spotty" [...] film, and said director William Sachs injected a sense of [...] "grisly humor" [...] into it. However, Hardy said the central concept inspired more laughter than terror, and called the special effects [...] "only routine".|$|E
500|$|Stewart said, due to Max's {{past events}} with his family, what Abi might say when Max objects to her {{relationship}} with Jay, [...] "It won't be her setting a gerbil on him", calling her a [...] "goody-two-shoes". A writer from the Western Mail said that the Branning/Mitchell Feud makes Abi and Jay feel like [...] "Walford's answer to Romeo and Juliet". Two writers from the Daily Mirror mocked the storyline where Abi turns down the trip to Costa Rica. One said, [...] "An extreme case of soap agoraphobia as brilliant Abi sensibly turns down the chance to spend eight weeks in the tropical paradise of Costa Rica. But in the tiny micro-world of EastEnders, even the three-mile odyssey from Walford to the West End is considered an epic journey. So Central America is simply out of the question" [...] with another saying, [...] "Abi {{was a little girl}} arranging tearful funerals for her pets. But now she's a young teenager, secretly engaged to boyfriend Jay and planning to run away together. He then gives Abi an ultimatum: him or her trip to Costa Rica. Best pass her the suncream, then". However, Abi, along with the younger members of the cast were thought to be the blame of declining ratings for the show; [...] "In the last two months, viewers have seen lots of Lauren, Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), Ben Jay, Abi and Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) - <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> so much of the classic characters".

Critic Roger Ebert noted, {{in a positive}} review, the irrelevance of the plot and [...] "moments of silliness", such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels. Twenty-five years after its release, James Berardinelli criticised {{the concept of a}} laser-shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John [...] "one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful, but shrill and helpless". Steve Rhodes said, [...] "looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, they (Putter Smith and Bruce Glover) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie." [...] But he also extolled the car chase as [...] "classic". According to Danny Peary, Diamonds are Forever is [...] "one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series" [...] and that [...] "until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on The Avengers, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape." [...] IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively). The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of the Guardian, who said it was [...] "oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world." ...|$|E
