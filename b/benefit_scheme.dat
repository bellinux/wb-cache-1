25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find {{significant}} effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think {{that this can be}} because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme.</b> This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E

There is also a supplement for single parents. Benefit is paid through national Finnish Social Insurance institution (KELA). The Åland Islands have a different scheme.|$|E

50|$|The first {{unemployment}} <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme</b> {{was introduced}} in the United Kingdom with the National Insurance Act 1911 under the Liberal Party government of H. H. Asquith. The popular measures were to combat the increasing influence of the Labour Party among the country's working-class population. The Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. It only applied to wage earners, however, and their families and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support, if any. Key figures in the implementation of the Act included Robert Laurie Morant, and William Braithwaite.|$|E
5000|$|Besides the [...] "Statutory Health Insurance" [...] (...) {{covering}} {{the vast majority}} of residents, the better off with a yearly income above almost €50,000 (...) , students and civil servants for complementary coverage can opt for private health insurance (about 11% of the population). Most civil servants benefit from a tax-funded government employee <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme</b> covering a percentage of the costs, and cover the rest of the costs with a private insurance contract. Recently, private insurers provide various types of supplementary coverage as an add upon of the SHI benefit package (e.g. for glasses, coverage abroad and additional dental care or more sophisticated dentures).|$|E

50|$|They {{increased}} in importance {{over the last}} {{decades of the twentieth}} century due to changes to council housing brought in by the Thatcher government, when rules were introduced that prevented councils subsidising their housing from local taxes, channelled grants for construction of new social housing to housing associations and allowed council tenants to buy their homes at a large discount. This, combined with cost-cutting initiatives in local government and a housing <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme</b> that was more generous to housing associations than local authorities, led to many councils transferring their housing stock to housing associations. These organisations are often referred to as large-scale voluntary transfer organisations or local housing companies.|$|E
50|$|Australia {{has a large}} {{child care}} industry, however in many {{locations}} (especially in inner-city suburbs of large cities and in rural areas) the availability is limited and the waiting periods can be up to several years. The Australian government's Child Care <b>Benefit</b> <b>scheme</b> provides generous assistance with child care costs, but this still leaves many families with a large out of pocket expense. Most families are eligible for Child Care Rebate, which provides a rebate of 50% of fees, up to a yearly cap of AUD$7500 per child. The median weekly cost of centre-based long day care in 2013 was approximately A$364 which puts {{it out of the}} reach of lower income earners.|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfillment for {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Master of Commerce (MCOM) at Strathmore UniversityThe main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate determinants on the financial performance of retirement <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes</b> in Kenya.

This study used quantitative design to determine the financial performance relationship with determinants of performance. The population for this study were the 1262 retirement <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes</b> registered with the Retirement Benefit Authority, RBA by close of 2013. Simple random sampling was used and Fishers formula was used to come up with sample size of 48 private pension funds. The study used primary and secondary data. The secondary data is quantitative in nature and was collected from the annual financial statements of the pension funds. Primary data was both qualitative and quantitative in nature and was collected using questionnaires. The study findings revealed that age of contributors, leverage of fund, contributions received, fixed income investment, equity investment, offshore investment, fund liquidity does not have an influence on the financial performance of retirement schemes. The study recommended that future studies focus on corporate governance practices as determinants of the financial performance of retirement <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes</b> in Kenya...|$|R
