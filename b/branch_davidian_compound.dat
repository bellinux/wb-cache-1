Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> <b>compound</b> in Waco, Texas.|$|E

While the event had taken place before he became Director, a highly controversial investigation ensued, including allegations of a cover-up by the FBI, and tensions developed between Freeh and Janet Reno, then-Attorney General.

The FBI took command after the deaths of federal agents, and managed to facilitate the release of 19 children (without their parents) relatively early into the negotiations. The children were then interviewed by the FBI and the Texas Rangers. Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the raid.On April 19, 1993 the FBI moved for a final siege of the compound using large weaponry such as [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV) to combat the heavily armed <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians.</b> The FBI attempted to use tear gas to flush out the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> without bloodshed. Officially, FBI agents were only permitted to return any incoming fire, not to actively assault the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians.</b> When several <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> opened fire, the FBI's response was {{to increase the amount}} of gas being used. Around noon, three fires broke out simultaneously in different parts of the building, The government maintains the fires were deliberately started by <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians.</b> Some <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> survivors maintain that the fires were started either accidentally or deliberately by the assault. 76 <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> died on April 19 (with only nine surviving), killed by rubble, suffocating effects of the fire, or by gunshot wound from fellow <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians.</b>|$|R

Survivor accounts describe the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> working and relaxing in Waco, rather than hiding in their compound. A survey of local newspaper coverage reveals that the press in Waco had a positive view of Koresh and the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> in the late 1980 s.

5000|$|In the [...] "Final {{report to}} the Deputy Attorney General {{concerning}} the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas" [...] of November 8, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth concluded that the allegations were meritless. The report found, however, that certain government employees had failed to disclose during litigation against the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> the use of pyrotechnic devices at the complex, and had obstructed the Special Counsel's investigation. Disciplinary action was pursued against those individuals. Allegations that the government started the fire were based largely on an FBI agent's having fired three [...] "pyrotechnic" [...] tear gas rounds, which are delivered with a charge that burns. The Special Counsel concluded that the rounds did not start or contribute {{to the spread of}} the fire, based on the finding that the FBI fired the rounds nearly four hours before the fire started, at a concrete construction pit partially filled with water, 75 ft away and downwind from the main living quarters of the complex. The Special Counsel noted, by contrast, that recorded interceptions of <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> conversations included such statements as [...] "David said we have to get the fuel on" [...] and [...] "So we light it first when they come in with the tank right ... right as they're coming in." [...] <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> who survived the fire acknowledged that other <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> started the fire. FBI agents witnessed <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> pouring fuel and igniting a fire, and noted these observations contemporaneously. Lab analysis found accelerants on the clothing of <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians,</b> and investigators found deliberately punctured fuel cans and a homemade torch at the site. Based on this evidence and testimony, the Special Counsel concluded that the fire was started by the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians.</b>|$|R
