50|$|A postseason roster {{takes effect}} only if a team clinches a playoff berth. Players {{who are part}} of the team's final roster {{at the end of the}} regular season are {{eligible}} to participate in the postseason. Any player who has been traded from a different team spent time in the Minor Leagues, or signed later in the season with the team (no later than August 31) is eligible to participate in the postseason. A postseason roster is allowed up to 25 active players. Other players who are not on the 25-man active roster will be assigned to the postseason secondary squad. Players who are on the disabled list or any other non-active transaction by the end of the regular season will have their transactions passed on in the postseason. Rosters for a series are set at the beginning of the series and no changes to the 25-man active roster are allowed except when a player is moved to the disabled list or any other inactive transaction. If a player is moved to the disabled list or another inactive transaction during a series, he then becomes ineligible to be returned to the 25-man active roster for the remainder of the series as well as the next series <b>if</b> <b>applicable.</b> <b>If</b> <b>any</b> player goes on any inactive transaction, any player from the 40-man roster can be promoted to the 25-man active roster for the remainder of the series <b>if</b> <b>applicable.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{third round}} was known {{variously}} as the Mixed-Up Maze, the [...] "Twisting, Turning, Tricky Trail" [...] {{and various other}} terms. Each dog had 45 seconds (60 in the final season) {{to get from the}} starting gate to their master at the finish line (who, true to the theme of the show, would be waiting in a doghouse structure during the final season). Along the way, the dog might be distracted by a sand trap filled with dog food, a toy car, a water bowl, and other things. A dog making it through would earn 20 points, with the faster dog getting 10 <b>bonus</b> points (only <b>applicable</b> <b>if</b> both dogs completed the run). If a dog left the maze at any point other than the regular exit by jumping over the outer wall, that dog would be disqualified for the event and score no points for the run (and in the final season episodes, a 'Runaway Dog!' graphic would pop up on the screen and sirens would go off). However, jumping within the maze structure was acceptable.|$|R

500|$|The winner now {{controls}} {{three separate}} hands, each staked with one card. A new deck of 52 cards {{that has been}} shuffled and cut is used. Cards are drawn for the contestant, {{one at a time}} and the contestant then chooses a hand in which to place each card. The contestant can use a power chip to dispose of an unwanted card. [...] The contestant can end the round at <b>any</b> time <b>if</b> they fear the next card will cause them to bust on any of the three hands. However, using a power chip forces the contestant to place the next card in a hand or use another chip if one is available; the contestant can only end the round after scoring a 21 in a hand. Getting 21 in one hand wins $1,000; in two hands wins $5,000; and if 21 is scored on all three hands, the contestant wins the grand prize of $25,000. If the contestant busts on any hand, they will lose all money earned in the bonus round, but retain the $1,000 (and <b>bonus</b> prize, <b>if</b> <b>applicable)</b> from the main game won earlier. On some episodes in season two, the top prize was increased to $50,000 with the other payouts remaining the same.|$|R
5000|$|DR is a skills-based {{role-playing}} game {{system based}} on the twelve-sided die (d12). The game mechanic {{is the same for}} almost all actions: players roll d12 trying to roll {{less than or equal to}} the applicable skill stat, as modified by any <b>applicable</b> <b>bonuses</b> or penalties. For example, a character seeking to strike an opponent with his weapon begins with his Strike stat, adds to it the Strike <b>bonus</b> <b>applicable</b> to his weapon, and subtracts from that any defensive penalties imposed by his opponent's defensive manoeuvres and armour. A roll of 12 always fails. In many cases, a roll of 12 has particularly negative results.|$|R

The vendor behind that product can then choose to ignore any forthcoming standards and not co-operate in any standardisation process at all, using its near-monopoly to insist that its product sets the de facto standard by its very market dominance. This is not a problem if the product's implementation is open and minimally encumbered, but it may as well be both closed and heavily encumbered (e.g. by patent claims). Because of the network effect, achieving interoperability with such a product is both critical for <b>any</b> other vendor <b>if</b> it wishes to remain relevant in the market, and difficult to accomplish because of lack of co-operation on equal terms with the original vendor, who may well see the new vendor as a potential competitor and threat. The newer implementations often rely on clean-room reverse engineering in the absence of technical data to achieve interoperability. The original vendors can provide such technical data to others, often in the name of 'encouraging competition,' but such data is invariably encumbered, and may be of limited use. Availability of such data is not equivalent to an open standard, because: ...|$|R
