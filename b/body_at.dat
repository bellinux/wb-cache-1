25|$|The {{arrival of}} <b>bodies</b> <b>at</b> {{multiple}} times at Key West {{has led to}} confusion over how many bodies from the Maine are buried there. The New York Times did not report the number of dead at Key West, but said only two had been identified. In 1912, the Army Quartermaster Corps reported that there were just 19 <b>bodies</b> <b>at</b> Key West. But other published sources vary quite widely. The National Geographic Society reported 22 bodies in 2012. A number of sources cite 24 bodies. In May 1898, the Washington Post reported 24 <b>bodies</b> buried <b>at</b> Key West. It said two were identified, an African American and a Japanese mess attendant. In 1997, the Associated Press also that 24 <b>bodies</b> were buried <b>at</b> Key West, of whom seven were identified. In 2009, the Key News newspaper also reported 24 <b>bodies</b> <b>at</b> Key West, including that of Coal Passer John Ziegler. A wide range of other sources have also cited 24 <b>bodies</b> <b>at</b> Key West. Some sources say 25 bodies are buried there, others 26, and several others 27.|$|R

5|$|Examination of the underdrawing {{shows that}} the artist {{intended}} a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting. He heavily reworked {{the positions of the}} three main figures even towards the end of completion. The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's <b>body</b> <b>at</b> first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The mother and child were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller, the river itself narrower.|$|E
5|$|For {{the winter}} of 356/7, he chose Senones (Sens) near Paris as his own {{wintering}} base, but quartered most of his troops in other towns, including the main <b>body</b> <b>at</b> Reims under Marcellus, to spread the burden. A large band of Alamanni heard of his reduced escort, however, and besieged him at Sens. Julian's forces were able to hold out until, after a month, the Germans withdrew. He was so outnumbered by the enemy, however, that {{he was unable to}} sally forth and give chase. During the siege, Marcellus had failed to come to his assistance. For this omission, denounced as cowardice by Ammianus, Marcellus was dismissed as magister equitum by Constantius and replaced by Severus, a distinguished officer who was more compatible with Julian.|$|E

5|$|Like many bipedal dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex was {{historically}} {{depicted as}} a 'living tripod', with the <b>body</b> <b>at</b> 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. This concept dates from Joseph Leidy's 1865 reconstruction of Hadrosaurus, the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture. In 1915, convinced that the creature stood upright, Henry Fairfield Osborn, {{former president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton arranged this way. It stood in an upright pose for 77 years, until it was dismantled in 1992.|$|E
