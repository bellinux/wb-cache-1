5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed. Due {{to the nature of}} the game, the longer the player plays, the larger the save file becomes. These same issues plagued , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas seems unlikely. Sawyer said that it is a core-engine issue that can not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> patched.|$|E

25|$|While {{most experts}} agreed that a torpedo had exploded, they {{differed}} on {{what caused the}} explosion. Many Russians {{did not believe that}} Kursk could <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure air tanks used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like Der Spiegel, Berliner Zeitung, and the Sunday Times claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by Pyotr Velikiy. This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that Kursk was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of , for which the Western navies have no defence. Another theory was that USS Memphis had fired a torpedo at Kursk.|$|E

25|$|After the {{campaign}} in Amenhotep's ninth year, Egyptian and Mitannian armies never fought again, and the two kingdoms seem to have reached some sort of peace. Amenhotep records that the kings of Babylon, the Hittites, and Mitanni came to make peace and pay tribute to him after his ninth year, although this may be outlandish boasting. However, a second passage appears {{on the walls of}} Karnak, saying that the princes of Mitanni came to seek peace with Amenhotep, and this cannot <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> explained away. The rising power of the Hittites eventually persuaded Mitanni to seek an ally, and there was definitely a treaty of some sort between Egypt and Mitanni by the time of Amenhotep's successor, but it may be that it was enacted after Amenhotep's campaigns, to try to prevent any more campaigns of mass deportations. Whenever formal peace was enacted, an informal peace was maintained between Amenhotep and the king of Mitanni. Thereafter, Amenhotep concentrated on domestic matters, with one possible exception. A shrine of Amenhotep's Nubian viceroy shows Amenhotep receiving tribute after a Nubian campaign, but {{it is not possible to}} date when this happened.|$|E

Clifton takes exception to Hutton's position, writing that it amounts to an accusation of [...] "serious literary fraud" [...] made by an [...] "argument from absence"; one of Hutton's main objections is that Aradia is unlike anything found in medieval literature.|$|E

Nelson refused, and also turned down Hardy's suggestion to let Eliab Harvey's [...] come ahead of Victory and lead the line into battle.|$|E

Kasavin summarized it as [...] "a short, uninspired game that's yet another would-be imitator of Capcom's own Devil May Cry." [...] Matt Casamassina of IGN wrote that players will [...] "want to like" [...] the game, but that its [...] "design flaws and sloppy execution" [...] are impossible to overlook. He found it to be shallow and repetitive, and he wrote that its fast pace and [...] "unresponsive control setup" [...] combine to place the game [...] "at war with itself." [...] However, he believed that P.N.03 is [...] "not a disaster—merely a disappointment", and that it sits [...] "solidly in average country." [...] In a 2012 retrospective from Eurogamer, Chris Schilling called the game the outcast of Shinji Mikami's work, criticizing its plot and calling its control scheme its [...] "biggest obstacle". He later added [...] "if at times its appeal can be hard to pin down, that doesn't mean it should <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> forgotten", mentioning the satisfaction of beating the bosses in the game.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of their grandson, Les and Pam confess their {{blackmail}} secret to their friend, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who warns Babe to end the blackmail. However, despite Claudette's warnings, Babe continues to blackmail the Cokers. This sparks tension between Babe and Claudette, who tells Babe that she will be moving back to the square to keep a [...] "closer eye" [...] on her. Badland explained Babe's rivalry with Claudette: [...] "Claudette's sticking up for Les and Pam. She's a fair match for Babe and it's interesting when they go head-to-head." [...] Badland hoped that the feud would last a long time, opining that it was [...] "fabulous", and that [...] "neither [...] will back down easily", and adding that she thought Babe would triumph over Claudette, though admitted she was biased and probably [...] "the only person on Babe's side". An Inside Soap reporter said Babe and Claudette's feud was [...] "exciting" [...] because Claudette is [...] "fearsome" [...] and Babe is [...] "equally terrifying", and suspected that [...] "Cunning Babe [...] <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> intimidated". A reporter for All About Soap questioned if Babe had [...] "finally met her match" [...] in Claudette, and compared the two women. In terms of cunning, they said that Babe has it [...] "by the bucketload", while Claudette may be [...] "getting soft in her old age" [...] and may not be [...] "sharp enough to take on Babe". They also opined that Claudette had more [...] "fighting strenth" [...] as she continues to come back after a [...] "knock down" [...] and would not go down without a fight, while Babe's craftiness [...] "means she'd easily {{come up with a new}} way to destroy an enemy". They said that Claudette has a [...] "nasty and murderous" [...] history while Babe's past is [...] "chequered" [...] but she had never killed someone, concluding that Claudette would be the winner of the feud, but still saying that they [...] "wouldn't mess with Babe!".|$|E

2500|$|But {{under the}} sensus communis we must include the Idea of a {{communal}} sense , i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account (a priori) of {{the mode of}} representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement. Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: [...] "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, {{they will have the}} same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".|$|E
2500|$|Goodale & Milner's {{innovation}} was {{to shift}} the perspective from an emphasis on input distinctions, such as object location versus properties, to {{an emphasis on the}} functional relevance of vision to behaviour, for perception or for action. Contemporary perspectives however, informed by empirical work over the past two decades, offer a more complex account than a simple separation of function into two-streams. Recent experimental work for instance has challenged these findings, and has suggested that the apparent dissociation between the effects of illusions on perception and action is due to differences in attention, task demands, and other confounds. [...] There are other empirical findings, however, that cannot <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> dismissed which provide strong support for the idea that skilled actions such as grasping are not affected by pictorial illusions.|$|E
2500|$|In Latin America, the {{perceived}} {{failures of the}} liberal reforms of the 1990s intensified ideological antagonism towards the United States, leading to a resurgence in support for many of Guevara’s political beliefs: including Pan-Americanism, support for popular movements in the region, the nationalization of key industries and centralization of government. In nearly every upsurge of revolutionary movements in Latin America over the last forty years, from Argentina to Chile, from Nicaragua to El Salvador, from Guatemala to Mexico and Chiapas, there are traces of [...] "Guevarismo" [...] – sometimes clear, sometimes faint.

2500|$|Leo Steinberg in his 1988 text [...] "The Philosophical Brothel" [...] {{quotes from}} an uncited source which may provide insight {{regarding}} Picasso's intent {{in the creation}} and context of Les Demoiselles D’Avignon. Quoting from an anonymous but well-informed New Yorker, Steinberg suggests that [...] "in 1907 Picasso had contracted VD, and painted the Demoiselles to vent his rage against women". This assumption may be reinforced in the artist's referral to the work as [...] "My first exorcism-painting". In 1965 the British critic John Berger suggested that Picasso, during his first years in Paris, [...] "probably was suffering from venereal disease and was obsessed by it". Then, in her Picasso: Art as Autobiography, Mary Gedo substantiated Berger's suspicion (having had it confirmed by Françoise Gilot). Accordingly, she interpreted much of the evolution and final character of the Demoiselles {{in the light of}} the artist's medical history and consequent ambivalence toward women. While critics such as Alfred H. Barr Jr. would prefer that the work be discussed in purely formalistic qualities, Edwin Mullins states that the effect of STIs cannot <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>easily</b> be disregarded and that though these are [...] "not today’s experiences of art, they are among the experiences out which, and for which, art has been made - and without which a great deal of art would not have been made at all".
