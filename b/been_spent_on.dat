5|$|Captain William Gladstone Agnew assumed command on 15 October 1945. The end of {{hostilities}} following Japan's surrender reduced {{the need for}} new warships, and consequently the ship was not commissioned until 12 May 1946. By this time, a total of £11,530,503, including £3,186,868 for the modernisation of the main armament, had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> producing Vanguard.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{felt the}} contractors could not complete {{the program and}} instructed them to repay most of the $2 billion that had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> A-12 development. McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics disputed this in Federal Claims court. The reasons and causes for the cancellation have been debated and remain an issue of controversy, with suggestions of political expediency and scheming to be behind the action.|$|E

5000|$|Lobbying {{has always}} been a focus of the Roundtable. From 1998 to 2000, less than a million dollars <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> lobbying. But, by 2001 after the {{creation}} of the Roundtable, more than $1.1 million <b>was</b> <b>spent.</b> For the next five years, the amount of money <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> lobbying increased. In 2006, less than $6.2 million <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> lobbying. The next two years, more money <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> lobbying than in 2006: $6,380,000 <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> in 2007, and $7,760,000 <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> in 2008. The next year, the Roundtable spent about $6.9 million on lobbying in Washington, DC with more than $900,000 going to outside lobbying firms. The Center of Responsive Politics showed a continuation of this trend. From 2008 to 2011, an average of about $7.5 million <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> lobbying each year.|$|R
5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At {{the same time}} work {{continued}} on the castle. Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the construction of Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town walls.

5|$|Fresh {{fears of}} {{invasion}} after 1544 prompted further work {{being carried out}} on the blockhouse by Sir Richard Lee, a prominent military engineer, although peace was declared the following year. It is uncertain exactly what shape the fort took; archaeological investigations suggest that it was probably D-shaped, two storeys tall, with a circular bastion facing the river; {{there would have been}} battery positions {{on either side of the}} main defences, and a more modern, angular bastion was added later on the landwards side. By 1546 the King's accountants estimated that £1,072 had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> building and developing the fortification.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{assessed}} the F-22's cost to be $361million per aircraft, with $28billion invested in development and testing; the Unit Procurement Cost {{was estimated at}} $178million in 2006, based on a production run of 181 aircraft. It was estimated {{by the end of}} production, $34billion will have <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> procurement, resulting in a total program cost of $62billion, around $339million per aircraft. The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at about $138million in 2009. The GAO stated the estimated cost was $412 million per aircraft in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Planning of {{the airport}} ran {{parallel}} with five other regional airports: Fagernes Airport, Leirin; Førde Airport, Bringeland; Mosjøen Airport, Kjærstad; Rørvik Airport, Ryum and Røst Airport. Construction {{was approved by the}} Parliament of Norway on 10 April 1984 and construction began in 1985. The municipality was granted concession to operate the airport on 22 August 1985. Værøy and Røst Airports were opened on 1 June 1986, after NOK15 million had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> constructing Værøy Airport.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,392 exotic {{plant species}} {{actively}} reproducing in the region, outnumbering the 1,301 species considered native to South Florida. The melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely in the Everglades than {{in their native}} Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans. They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2million has <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> keeping them out of Everglades National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Old Blockhouse {{appears to}} have been completed, but the Crown's {{resources}} had become badly stretched and the decision was taken at the end of 1552 to curtail further expenditure on the Scilly Isles. Between 1548 and 1552, a total of £3,123 had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> improving the fortifications on the islands; a 1579 survey suggested that, with the cost of the garrisons, the project had come to a total of £6,000. Edward's successor, Queen Mary I, intended to establish a garrison of 150 soldiers on the islands, but it is uncertain if these numbers were ever achieved.|$|E

5|$|The V-22's {{development}} {{process has been}} long and controversial, partly due to its large cost increases, {{some of which are}} caused by the requirement to fold wing and rotors to fit aboard ships. The development budget was first planned for $2.5 billion in 1986, which increased to a projected $30 billion in 1988. By 2008, $27 billion had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the program and another $27.2 billion was required to complete planned production numbers. Between 2008 and 2011, the estimated lifetime cost for maintaining the V-22 grew by 61 percent, mostly allocated to maintenance and support.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} was fiercely contested, {{and both sides}} incurred great expenses during the campaign. There was not another contested election in Taunton for almost twenty years, {{and during that time}} the Taunton Market House Society was set up with the aim of preventing the bad blood of a contested election, and to spend money that would have otherwise <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> campaigning on improving the town. Maxwell remained as one of Taunton's members of parliament until 1768.|$|E
5|$|The federal government's {{strategy}} {{in both the}} West Triangle and Western China in general is to provide large amounts of monetary investment {{in order to provide}} an industrial and infrastructure base, which would then attract foreign investment. Areas which the government has invested heavily in include infrastructure, enticement of foreign investment, ecological protection, education, and retention of talent flowing to richer provinces or foreign nations. Over RMB 1 trillion has <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the West as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike {{had been going on}} for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> a cause that seemed to be never ending.

5|$|Antonov {{subsequently}} {{converted the}} static-test prototype into a flying prototype {{equipped with a}} modified flight-control system. The second airframe was rolled out in December 1996 in Kiev, before making its first flight on 24 April 1997 from Svyatoshino Airfield, during which the aircraft was airborne for 31 minutes; according to Jane's, however, the aircraft had taken off from Gostomel for a 26-minute flight. By this time, more than US$2.5 billion had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the programme, with a further $200 million to be spent to prepare the aircraft for production, which was expected to have started in 1999 with 20–25 aircraft produced annually. The Russian and Ukrainian Air Forces reportedly had long-term plans to procure 500 and 100 aircraft, respectively. The second airframe was severely damaged during cold weather testing on 27 January 2001 in a crash landing after take-off.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E
50|$|The {{budget for}} 2006 was $428,612.51. Town taxes {{accounted}} for over 65% of this money. The budget was all fulfilled by the state.

5|$|Continuing a {{theme of}} his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion of}} the enormous budget of Formula One has <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{teething}} {{problems with the}} Ju 87, the RLM ordered 216 Ju 87 A-1s into production and wanted to receive delivery of all machines between January 1936 and 1938. The Junkers production capacity was fully occupied and licensing to other production facilities became necessary. The first 35 Ju 87 A-1s were therefore produced by the Weser Flugzeugbau (WFG). By 1 September 1939, 360 Ju 87 As and Bs had been built by the Junkers factories at Dessau and Weserflug factory in Lemwerder near Bremen. By 30 September 1939, Junkers had received 2,365,196 Reichsmark (RM) for Ju 87 construction orders. The RLM paid another 243,646 RM for development orders. According to audit records in Berlin, {{by the end of}} the financial year on 30 September 1941, 3,059,000 RM had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> Ju 87 airframes. By 30 June 1940, 697 Ju 87 B-1s and 129 B-2s alone had been produced. Another 105 R-1s and seven R-2s had been built.|$|E
5|$|Edward IV died in 1483, {{leaving the}} kingdom to his young son, Edward V, but his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{had his own}} ambitions for the throne. Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the {{deposition}} of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, ahead of his own coronation. Kirby Muxloe and Lord Hastings' other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine. After a short pause, Katherine continued some work on the site until the summer of 1484, focusing on making the corner tower and partially finished gatehouse habitable, before the project was finally halted. By this point around £1,000 had <b>been</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the works, including the laying of 1.3 million bricks.|$|E
