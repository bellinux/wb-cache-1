5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} {{to take the lead}} in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second <b>base</b> <b>to</b> home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third <b>base</b> <b>to</b> make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second <b>base</b> <b>to</b> get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper studies Schauder frames in Banach spaces, {{a concept}} {{which is a}} natural {{generalization}} of frames in Hilbert spaces and Schauder bases in Banach spaces. The associated minimal and maximal spaces are introduced, as are shrinking and boundedly complete Schauder frames. Our main results extend the classical duality theorems on <b>bases</b> <b>to</b> the situation of Schauder frames. In particular, we will generalize James' results on shrinking and boundedly complete <b>bases</b> <b>to</b> frames. Secondly we will extend his characterization of the reflexivity of spaces with unconditional <b>bases</b> <b>to</b> spaces with unconditional frames...|$|R

5|$|A fighter <b>base</b> <b>to</b> provide {{repair and}} {{overhaul}} facilities for carrier aircraft was {{constructed by the}} 78th Naval Construction Battalion on Ponam Island. As half of the work area was swamp, coral was blasted and dredged from the ocean bed and used as landfill. Another facility for carrier aircraft was built on Pityilu by the 71st Naval Construction Battalion in May and June 1944, along with accommodation for 2,500 men. The eastern end of Pityilu was cleared and a fleet recreation centre was built that could accommodate up to 10,000 at a time.|$|E

As the marchers reached Trafalgar Square, they were 1,000 strong, facing 400 police officers, 15 of them on horseback.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry, however, the {{political}} situation in England became less stable, with both Stephen of England and the Empress Matilda laying claim to the throne. Brien had originally been considered a supporter of Stephen, but in 1139 Matilda travelled to England and Brien announced his allegiance to her, joining forces with Miles of Gloucester and other supporters in the south-west. Wallingford Castle was now the most easterly stronghold of the Empress's faction – it was either the closest <b>base</b> <b>to</b> London, or the first in line to be attacked by Stephen's forces, depending on one's perspective.|$|E

40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} is a new paradigm for image compression. We describe a new multi-layered representation technique for images. An image is encoded as the superposition of one main approximation, and a sequence of residuals. The strength of the multi-layered method {{comes from the fact}} that we use different <b>bases</b> <b>to</b> encode the main approximation and the residuals. For instance, we can use: – a wavelet basis to encode a coarse main approximation of the image, – wavelet packet <b>bases</b> <b>to</b> encode textured patterns, – brushlet <b>bases</b> <b>to</b> encode localized oriented textured features, etc...|$|R

On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E

5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} <b>base</b> <b>to</b> talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.|$|E
