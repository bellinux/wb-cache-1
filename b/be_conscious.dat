25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can <b>be</b> <b>conscious,</b> but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to <b>be</b> <b>conscious.</b> It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E

25|$|Sentience: {{the ability}} to be aware (feel, perceive, or <b>be</b> <b>conscious)</b> of one's {{surroundings}} or to have subjective experiences. Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness, which is otherwise commonly used to collectively describe sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.|$|E
30|$|In {{patients}} of the tubular group (15 males + 3 females), the total mortality was 4 patients and 14 patients experienced {{different degrees of}} improvement: 3 patients <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> with no deficits and good recovery, 9 patients <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> with mild disability, and 2 patients <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> with severe disability. The final results in patients (11 males +[*] 7 females) managed by stereotactic resection and thrombolysis of the hematoma after the follow-up period were as follows: 5 patients died, 1 patient <b>was</b> <b>conscious</b> with severe disability, 10 patients <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> with mild disability, and 2 patients <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> with complete recovery.|$|R

In order to avoid this, her female figures typically possess European features. Lewis had to balance her own personal identity with her artistic, social, and national identity, a tiring activity that affected her art.|$|E

25|$|Awareness: {{the state}} or ability to perceive, to feel, or to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> of events, objects, or sensory patterns. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be {{confirmed}} by an observer without necessarily implying understanding. More broadly, it is {{the state or}} quality of being aware of something. In biological psychology, awareness {{is defined as a}} human's or an animal's perception and cognitive reaction to a condition or event.|$|E
40|$|Publisher横浜The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare student {{evaluation}} of five-days outdoor recreation intensive course in Keio university conducted in 1996 and 1998, and investigate effects which students <b>were</b> <b>conscious.</b> The subjects <b>were</b> a total of 43 male and female students. To measure student evaluation, the questionnaire including 34 items was administered. To measure effect which students <b>were</b> <b>conscious,</b> the composition describing their impression of the outdoor recreation intensive course was administered. The following results are obtained: 1) 69. 0 % of students evaluated outdoor recreation intensive course "very good". 2) Optional program, night program and recommendable lesson were evaluated negatively between outdoor recreation intensive course conducted in 1996 and 1998. But the means of each item were 4. 0, students evaluated outdoor recreation intensive course conducted in 1998 positively. 3) 44. 0 % of students <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> of natural recognition, 37. 2 % of students <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> of the cooperation, and 34. 9 % of students <b>were</b> <b>conscious</b> the encounter...|$|R

Also, the accident resulted in temporary retroactive and progressive amnesia.

Such questions become a lifelong endeavor for Boring to try to answer.|$|E
25|$|Reviewers {{appreciated}} Kurzweil's {{track record}} with predictions, {{his ability to}} extrapolate technology trends, and his clear explanations. However, there was disagreement on whether computers will one day <b>be</b> <b>conscious.</b> Philosophers John Searle and Colin McGinn insist that computation alone cannot possibly create a conscious machine. Searle deploys a variant of his well-known Chinese room argument, this time tailored to computers playing chess, a topic Kurzweil covers. Searle writes that computers can only manipulate symbols which are meaningless to them, an assertion which if true subverts much of {{the vision of the}} book.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} {{in people}} with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that are not there, and may reflect Lewy bodies or AD pathology in the temporal lobe. Delusions may include reduplicative paramnesia and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations. These hallucinations are not necessarily disturbing, and in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be amused by them, or <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> they are not real. People with DLB also may have problems with vision, including double vision, and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{voluntary}} decision prediction tasks {{have been}} criticised {{based on the}} possibility the neuronal signatures for pre-conscious decisions could actually correspond to lower conscious processing rather than unconscious processing. People may be aware of their decisions before making their report yet need to wait several seconds to be certain. Such a model does not however explain what is left unconscious if everything can <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> at some level (and the purpose of defining separate systems). Yet limitations remain in free will prediction research to date. In particular, the prediction of considered judgements from brain activity involving thought processes beginning minutes rather than seconds before a conscious will to act, including the rejection of a conflicting desire. Such are generally seen to be the product of sequences of evidence accumulating judgements.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{during the}} campaigns of World War I, Lecca was a Captain of the Ammunition Department in the 22nd Division, which withdrew {{with the rest}} of the army into Western Moldavia. Also during that interval, a revue of his, Dandanaua ("The Mishap") was being staged by Maximilian in German-occupied Bucharest—it was {{cancelled}} after reports that it was mocking the occupiers. While recovering at Podu Iloaiei in winter 1916, Lecca showed signs of a debilitating illness (sometimes described as a war injury), confessing to Ludovic Dauș that he was slowly dying, but still hoping to find a miracle cure. Decommissioned in summer 1917, he was living in Iași, with Natalia Lecca as his nurse. Among his last works was another volume of poetry, Simpla ("The Simple One"). Almost completely paralyzed in 1918, he continued to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> and responsive although, as Iorgulescu recalls, he was socially dead.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} is a {{cause of}} cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from {{the apex of the}} heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body - because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing, which to the layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but it is in fact a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem.|$|E

Either Descartes is remarkably inconsistent, or his claim that all thought <b>is</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>is</b> more nuanced than it appears. In this paper I argue that while Descartes was indeed unwavering in his commitment to the conscious mark, he had the resources to distinguish different types and degrees of consciousness that make for a richer cognitive psychology than he is typically credited with...|$|R
25|$|A {{positive}} correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in health. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone obesity, {{which can lead to}} diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E
25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E

500|$|Western philosophers, {{since the}} time of Descartes and Locke, have {{struggled}} to comprehend the nature of consciousness and identify its essential properties. [...] Issues of concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent; whether consciousness can ever be explained mechanistically; whether non-human consciousness exists and if so how can it be recognized; how consciousness relates to language; whether consciousness can be understood {{in a way that does}} not require a dualistic distinction between mental and physical states or properties; and whether it may ever be possible for computing machines like computers or robots to <b>be</b> <b>conscious,</b> a topic studied in the field of artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Since Whitehead's metaphysics {{described}} a universe {{in which all}} entities experience, he needed {{a new way of}} describing perception that was not limited to living, self-conscious beings. [...] The term he coined was [...] "prehension", which comes from the Latin prehensio, meaning [...] "to seize." [...] The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> or unconscious, applying to people as well as electrons. [...] It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. [...] For Whitehead, the term [...] "prehension" [...] indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. [...] In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them. [...] Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, causal efficacy (or [...] "physical prehension") and presentational immediacy (or [...] "conceptual prehension").|$|E
500|$|Khmer {{employs a}} system of {{registers}} in which the speaker must always <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> of the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for [...] "to eat" [...] used between intimates or in reference to animals is [...] Used in polite reference to commoners, it is [...] When used of those of higher social status, it is [...] or [...] For monks the word is [...] and for royals, [...] Another {{result is that the}} pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.|$|E
