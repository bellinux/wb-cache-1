5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its religious school. Wax initiated {{some changes in the}} congregation's religious practices. One was to have a real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not <b>become</b> <b>common</b> until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.|$|E
5|$|Divorcing {{a spouse}} was {{permissible}} {{if there was}} mutual consent, while remarriage {{after the death of}} a spouse was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not <b>become</b> <b>common</b> again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E
5|$|Early medieval Sogdian costumes can {{be divided}} in two periods: Hephtalitic (5th and 6th centuries) and Turkic (7th and early 8th centuries).

5|$|Homophony first {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the predominant textures in Western classical music during the Baroque period in the early 17th century, when composers began to commonly compose with vertical harmony in mind, the homophonic basso continuo becoming a definitive feature of the style. The choral arrangement of four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has since <b>become</b> <b>common</b> in Western classical music. Homophony began by appearing in sacred music, replacing polyphony and monophony as the dominant form, but spread to secular music, for which {{it is one of the}} standard forms today.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, gout {{is twice}} as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent.

Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably Aquila chrysaetos) soared over the mountain and bred on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, but even in Wordsworth's day they had gone, having been persecuted to extinction.|$|E

5|$|One form of art {{particularly}} apt for Baroque purposes was the theater. Various theatrical {{shows were}} most often staged {{in conjunction with}} religious occasions and moralizing, and commonly utilized folk stylization. School theaters had <b>become</b> <b>common</b> among both the Protestant and Catholic secondary schools. A permanent court theater with an orchestra was established by Władysław IV at the Royal Castle in Warsaw in 1637; the actor troupe, dominated by Italians, performed primarily Italian opera and ballet repertoire.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{invasion}} of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8thcentury introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on tapial, pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 8000 Normans {{and other}} continentals settled in England {{as a result}} of the conquest, although exact figures cannot be established. Some of these new residents intermarried with the native English, but the extent of this practice in the years immediately after Hastings is unclear. Several marriages are attested between Norman men and English women during the years before 1100, but such marriages were uncommon. Most Normans continued to contract marriages with other Normans or other continental families rather than with the English. Within a century of the invasion, intermarriage between the native English and the Norman immigrants had <b>become</b> <b>common.</b> By the early 1160s, Ailred of Rievaulx was writing that intermarriage was common in all levels of society.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since <b>become</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day had <b>become</b> <b>common</b> in American industry. One {{exception}} was in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E
