It was concluded that this method is useful for fast and easy screening of Bt gene in the food products and GM Bt crops. The methods of plant genetic transformation are applied for the insertion of genes of interest into specific crop plants for their improvement (Estruch et al. 1997). These transformed plants are commonly known as genetically modified plants or GM plants. A number of GM plants have already been developed for commercial use {{in different parts of the}} world (James 2006). Before commercialization, the expression of the introduced trait(s) is needed to be assayed. This detection of the expression of genetically modified trait is essential not only to determine the existence of transgenes in crop plants before commercial exploitation but also to satisfy the required biosafety protocols for the safeguard of human and animal health as well as in protecting the environment.

50|$|Post-emergent {{pesticide}} application {{requires the}} use of specific chemicals chosen minimize harm to the desirable target organism. An example is 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which will injure broadleaf weeds (dicots) but leave behind grasses (monocots). Such a chemical has been used extensively on wheat crops, for example. A number of companies have also created genetically modified organisms that are resistant to various pesticides. Examples include glyphosate-resistant soybeans and <b>Bt</b> <b>maize,</b> which change the types of formulations involved in addressing post-emergent pesticide pressure. It is important to also note that even given appropriate chemical choices, high ambient temperatures or other environmental influences, can allow the non-targeted desirable organism to be damaged during application. As plants have already germinated, post-emergent pesticide application necessitates limited field contact in order to minimize losses due to crop and soil damage. Typical industrial application equipment will utilize very tall and narrow tires and combine this with a sprayer body which can be raised and lowered depending on crop height. These sprayers usually carry the label ‘high-clearance’ as they can rise over growing crops, although usually not much more than 1 or 2 meters high. In addition, these sprayers often have very wide booms in order to minimize the number of passes required over a field, again designed to limit crop damage and maximize efficiency. In industrial agriculture, spray booms 120 feet (40 meters) wide are not uncommon, especially in prairie agriculture with large, flat fields. Related to this, aerial pesticide application is a method of top dressing a pesticide to an emerged crop which eliminates physical contact with soil and crops.|$|E

Crop varieties can be genetically modified to resist specific pests and diseases. For example, a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a natural insecticide toxin.

In total, 20 peer-reviewed publications were identified, of which 16 papers contributed laboratory-based data and seven field-based data. An adverse effect on caterpillars was recorded in 52 % of all laboratory-based and in 21 % of all field-based observations. The variables most often studied and having the highest occurrence of effects were larval survival, body mass, and developmental time. Parameters of the adult stage were under-represented in the studies. Overall, 11 lepidopteran species were tested. The majority of the studies originated from the USA, with the Monarch butterfly being the most studied, whereas other species {{and other parts of}} the world were widely neglected.

Although the papers we reviewed indicated a potential hazard for Lepidopterathat are exposed to and feed on lepidopteran-specific Bt-maize pollen, a general conclusion on thelevel of risk for butterflies and moths cannot as yet be drawn. A comprehensive risk characterizationwould require thorough hazard identification, exposure assessment, and impact assessment. However,our review showed that even the basic level of hazard characterization is as yet incomplete.

Here, the EFSA GMO Panel refines its model predictions, accounting for new ly reported information on maize pollen deposition over long distances. For its calculations, the EFSA GMO Panel considered three exposure scenarios at a range of isolation distances, at two protection levels and {{for a range of}} lepidopteran species, including hypothetical ones, with a wide spectrum of sensitivities to Bt toxins. An analysis of various sources of uncertainties affecting the exposure of NT Lepidoptera to <b>Bt</b> - <b>maize</b> pollen was conducted, in order to provide quantitative estimates of realistic exposure levels.

The EFSA GMO Panel concludes that its previous recommendation for a 20 m isolation distance around protected habitats, within which maize MON 810 /Bt 11 should not be cultivated, remains valid. New calculations show that the previously recommended isolation distance of 30 m from the nearest maize 1507 field would still protect NT Lepidoptera with known levels of sensitivity, including the ‘highly - sensitive’ Plutella xylostella.
