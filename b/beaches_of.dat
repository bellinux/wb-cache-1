5|$|A second branch, the Q21B, {{ran from}} New Lots Avenue {{non-stop}} to Beach 98th Street at the Rockaways' Playland amusement park.

5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure water hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E

5|$|Juno or Juno Beach {{was one of}} five <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the Allied {{invasion}} of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 during the Second World War. The beach spanned from Courseulles, a village {{just east of the}} British beach Gold, to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, just west of the British beach Sword. Taking Juno was the responsibility of the Canadian Army, with sea transport, mine sweeping, and a naval bombardment force provided by the Royal Canadian Navy and the British Royal Navy as well as elements from the Free French, Norwegian, and other Allied navies. The objectives of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division on D-Day were to cut the Caen-Bayeux road, seize the Carpiquet airport west of Caen, and form a link between the two British <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Gold and Sword on either side of Juno Beach.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} neared land, a ridge over Mexico {{prevented}} Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast. As Kiko traveled {{parallel to the}} coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas {{off the coast of}} Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-fivepassengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched the <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> San Francisco Ixhuatán and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship. Only twopeople survived; fifteenbodies were recovered, and ninepassengers were never found.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the nine}} {{companies}} {{landing in the}} first wave, only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended. E/116, aiming for Easy Green, ended up scattered across the two <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the 16th RCT area. G/116, aiming for Dog White, opened up a 1,000-yard (900m) gap between themselves and A/116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead. I/16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half.|$|E
5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} wooden poles used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe wooden logs set into the <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean to disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these wooden defenses too weak to stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E

5|$|The {{final two}} storms {{of the season}} {{impacted}} several areas, with the final storm affecting areas from Cuba to Rhode Island. The third storm caused little or no damage along the Texas coastline with gale-force winds being recorded only along the coast. The last storm caused severe damage along the <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the Florida Peninsula, with damages estimated in the millions along with four fatalities near Tampa. At least $600,000 was lost in damages dealt to the citrus industry and several maritime incidents resulted in over 55 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy. Failure to capture the bridges intact, or to prevent their demolition by the Germans, would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut {{off from the rest of}} the Allied armies with their backs to the two waterways. If the Germans retained control over the bridges, they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Normandy.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player has to allocate a number of American troops in order to establish a beachhead on one of the six <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault. Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location. At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet. Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} shoot them down. In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way. There is no save function in the game.|$|E

On 16 June 1944, II./JG 1 moved its {{complement}} of 25 Fw 190s to Essay and was tasked with defending {{the skies over}} the <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Normandy. During the transfer, 8./JG 1, was probably attacked by the P-51s of the 354th Fighter Wing, near Alençon. JG 1 lost three pilots and one mechanic riding passenger, and also lost were two other aircraft without human loss with a claiming of two P-51s downed credited to Lt. Friedrich Krakowitzer (24th kill) and Oberfeldwebel Günther Heckmann (13th kill). The base at Essay was bombed the same day by B-24 Liberators, making the airfield unsuitable for missions.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1943, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers. Hoping to occupy {{as much of the}} country as possible before the German Army could react, the U.S. Fifth Army prepared to attack Salerno. On 10 September, elements of the division conducted its second landing at Agropoli and Paestum with the 36th Infantry Division, on the southernmost <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the attack. Opposing them were elements of the German 29th Panzergrenadier Division and XVI Panzer Corps. Against stiff resistance, the 45th pushed to the Calore River after a week of heavy fighting. The Fifth Army was battered and pushed back by German forces until 20 September, when Allied forces were finally able to break out and establish a more secure beachhead.|$|E
5|$|Os Delfins is a {{professional}} lifeguard service and school which patrols the <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde, it currently has activities elsewhere in Northern Portugal. This Póvoa-based association uses the dolphin as mascot and in naming. The lifeguards can be identified in the beaches by their yellow t-shirts with red captions. Póvoa {{is one of the}} twelve national sea borders controlled by the Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF) and it as an ISN Lifeboat recue station. The Póvoa de Varzim Maritime Police patrols Póvoa de Varzim seafront, including the seaport, beaches and maritime waters under the national sovereignty and jurisdiction. It often acts against illegal fisheries, unruly harvest of shellfish, and smuggling. The Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde Maritime Police Picket are headquartered in Largo Dr. Vasques Calafate, sharing resources with the Captaincy of the Port of Póvoa de Varzim.|$|E
5|$|Putting {{in at the}} Atlantic Basin Iron Works {{again in}} June, the ship was renamed USAHS Shamrock in August 1943. With the {{conversion}} complete, the new hospital ship left New York in September for Gibraltar and the Mediterranean where she operated locally, calling often at Oran, Palermo, the southern <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> France, Bizerte, and Naples. By mid-February 1944, Shamrock had transported 11,989 patients before departing Gibraltar for Charleston (via Bermuda), where she arrived in early March. After undergoing some repairs and alterations at Charleston, Shamrock sailed again for Gibraltar for another {{tour of duty in}} the Mediterranean area from May to September. After transporting over 6,000 patients during this mission, she returned via Horta, Azores, to Charleston in late September.|$|E
