5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, it could also <b>be</b> <b>private</b> and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult {{is one example of}} stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1894, a {{committee}} {{was established to}} plan a branch from the Jæren Line to Ålgård. The following year, the committee recommended that a line be built branching from Orstad in Klepp, which would cost 348,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Gjesdal Municipality offered NOK60,000 of the capital, {{on the condition that}} NSB would build and operate it. The state, on the other hand, wanted the line to <b>be</b> <b>private.</b> Private railways were often largely or entirely owned by municipalities, counties and the state, but would operate independent of NSB and the municipalities would carry the risk for operating deficits.|$|E
5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might <b>be</b> <b>private</b> or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E

25|$|Python's {{property}} descriptors are similar, {{but come}} with a tradeoff in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class {{may need to be}} adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby’s design forces all instance variables to <b>be</b> <b>private,</b> but also provides a simple way to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{suffered}} from a general mistrust both from the German and Allied authorities. The Germans generally did not trust any shipowners, since these had their fleet organized in Nortraship and used in Allied convoys. The Norwegian authorities in exile were also distrustful of DNL, because the airline had taken initiative to operate a route, essentially helping the German forces. There was also an uncertainty {{as to whether the}} national airline of Norway should continue to <b>be</b> <b>private,</b> or if a state-owned airline should be established. To look at the issue, the Norwegian authorities-in-exile established the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board to look at all matters regarding civil aviation. It was this board which was permitted to negotiate traffic rights with other countries, make purchase rights of aircraft and participated in the foundation of the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Swedish intercontinental airline, Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik managed to purchase ten Douglas DC-4 {{at the end of the}} war; they had initially planned on selling some to DDL and DNL, but were not permitted to negotiate any agreements with DNL.|$|E
