For 23 of them, the 3 ′-NTR sequence was determined. Together with previously published data, this allowed {{an analysis of}} the 3 ′-NTR of the viruses in the genus Alphavirus. The length of the 3 ′-NTRs varied from 77 nt for Pixuna virus to 609 nt for <b>Bebaru</b> <b>virus.</b> The 19 -nt conserved sequence element directly adjacent to the poly(A) tract was found in all viruses, supporting the hypothesis that this region is acis-acting sequence element during viral replication and essential for virus growthin vitro. Within the 3 ′-NTR of all alphaviruses, repeated sequence elements of various numbers and lengths were found. Their composition was very consistent in both the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) and the Sindbis-like viruses, although their number was constant only within the latter group. For the VEE viruses, our data suggested that insertion events rather than deletions from an ancestor with a long 3 ′-NTR created the various number of repeated sequence elements. Among the remaining viruses, both the number and the composition of repeated sequence elements varied remarkedly...|$|E
