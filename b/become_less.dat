5|$|By 0900 UTC October 2, the eye {{started to}} <b>become</b> <b>less</b> defined. Based on this, {{the storm was}} {{downgraded}} into a category 3 hurricane. Although an eye was no longer visible on satellite imagery, the storms had displayed very deep convection, thus the NHC initially maintained the intensity at 120mph (195km/h). Virgil's eye continued to <b>become</b> <b>less</b> defined, and was downgraded to Category 2 intensity {{at the time of}} landfall on October 4. It rapidly weakened over land, and was a dissipating tropical depression by the time it moved offshore.|$|E
5|$|DST {{inherits}} and can magnify {{the disadvantages}} of standard time. For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for {{it along with}} time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon <b>become</b> <b>less</b> accurate when DST is in effect.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Sasha {{spoke to}} Resident Advisor about his {{decision}} to change from using Live and the Maven controller {{to a combination of}} Native Instruments' Traktor and CDs in his DJ sets. He felt that whilst Ableton Live had developed significantly as production software, it had <b>become</b> <b>less</b> successful as a DJing tool.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} on, the term 'dreadnought' <b>became</b> <b>less</b> widely used. Most pre-dreadnought battleships were {{scrapped}} or hulked after World War I, so the term 'dreadnought' <b>became</b> <b>less</b> necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} stair <b>became</b> <b>less</b> {{common in}} the 20th century. As houses <b>became</b> <b>less</b> formal and household staff <b>became</b> <b>less</b> common, the need for both front and back stairs declined. Many houses were designed with a single stair for common use. However, since the 1980s, house sizes have increased significantly and designs have become more elaborate and more complex. Multiple stairs are becoming more common once again. Combination stairs are occasionally seen in new house designs.|$|R
5000|$|Gradually the {{association}} <b>became</b> <b>less</b> radical. Having originally {{been one of}} the manifestations of Victorian private philanthropy recognising the limitations of the free market it <b>became</b> <b>less</b> important as local government began to provide more public services, and evangelical Nonconformism declined in importance.|$|R
5|$|Rita Wilson as Terri Bratley, a {{successful}} interior designer and Charlie's mother. She grows increasingly frustrated and demanding as her wedding to Michael approaches, {{and by the}} end of the film her design efforts have <b>become</b> <b>less</b> fruitful.|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size <b>become</b> <b>less</b> common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged {{for the last}} few billion years, and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked approximately ten billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} gas welding process is oxyfuel welding, {{also known as}} {{oxyacetylene}} welding. It {{is one of the}} oldest and most versatile welding processes, but in recent years it has <b>become</b> <b>less</b> popular in industrial applications. It is still widely used for welding pipes and tubes, as well as repair work.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, 1970s, and {{continuing}} up to today, the musical film <b>became</b> <b>less</b> of a bankable genre {{that could be}} relied upon for sure-fire hits. Audiences for them lessened and fewer musical films were produced as the genre <b>became</b> <b>less</b> mainstream and more specialized.|$|R

5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is more common than any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has <b>become</b> <b>less</b> common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Fixed {{gender roles}} began to <b>become</b> <b>less</b> {{prominent}} in the Western world starting in the late 20th century, allowing men {{to make their own}} choice of career without regard to traditional gender-based roles. Some men who choose this role may do so because they enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career. For example, of the 187 participants at Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Espanyol {{started a}} counter-petition against autonomy, which {{at that time}} had become a {{pertinent}} issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has <b>become</b> <b>less</b> political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would <b>become</b> <b>less</b> controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was at this point that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In general, {{those in}} Europe who own {{large amounts of}} euros are served by high {{stability}} and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros including countries, which need to pay interest on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly weaker euro leading to more export because a lower euro would better see investors chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there would <b>become</b> <b>less</b> risky and push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2006, Klotzbach's team {{lowered its}} season {{estimate}} to15 named storms, with7 becoming hurricanes and 3becoming major hurricanes, noting that conditions had <b>become</b> <b>less</b> favorable for storms {{than they had}} been earlier in the year. The sea-level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal, while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{however, the}} {{movement}} started to decline, as many of the bands disintegrated and the music forums were closed. The left wing ideals <b>became</b> <b>less</b> dominating among young people, and the rock and folk music also <b>became</b> <b>less</b> popular than new genres such as hard rock and electronic music.|$|R

5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences <b>become</b> <b>less</b> coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|The chaotic {{nature of}} the atmosphere, the massive {{computational}} power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts <b>become</b> <b>less</b> accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} family {{structure in the}} United States is considered a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, nuclear family has <b>become</b> <b>less</b> prevalent, and alternative family forms have become more common. The family is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear family.|$|E

5|$|There {{have always}} been Arsenal {{supporters}} outside London, and {{since the advent of}} satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has <b>become</b> <b>less</b> dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club. A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million. The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.|$|E
5|$|These {{properties}} make it {{relatively easy}} to distinguish a light metal like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences <b>become</b> <b>less</b> clear at the boundaries. Light structural metals like beryllium, scandium, and titanium {{have some of the}} characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead have some of the characteristics of light metals, such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|E
5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had <b>become</b> <b>less</b> scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
