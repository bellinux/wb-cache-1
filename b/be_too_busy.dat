5|$|In 1894, Lemoine co-founded another {{mathematical}} journal entitled, L'intermédiaire des mathématiciens {{along with}} Charles Laisant, a friend {{whom he met}} at the École Polytechnique. Lemoine had been planning such a journal since early 1893, but thought that he would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to create it. At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested {{the idea of the}} journal. Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. The year after the journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject. Lemoine died on 21 February 1912 in his home city of Paris.|$|E

[...] Leslie holds a subcommittee meeting with Tom, interested citizen Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) and city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider). [...] Mark warns her it might be too early for a meeting with the public, who could opt to vote the proposal down if they are unhappy with it. [...] Leslie remains confident about the meeting and says the group will be doing neighborhood canvassing to try to win support.|$|E

500|$|Ann Frewen died in May 1880. The inquest {{into her}} death {{was held at}} the nearby Bull and Butcher public house, presided over by the county coroner, Frederick Charsley. Part of the inquest's remit was to {{consider}} the matter of Ellen's subsequent care. Thomas Frewen was reported as being [...] "quite evasive" [...] when the coroner asked him how Ellen was fed, and although Hayman testified to reaffirm his stance that Ellen's illness was genuine, Reverend Studholme was less certain. However, he could not offer any evidence to this effect, even though he had made several unannounced visits to Ellen's home. Charsley concluded that Thomas could not look after Ellen, as his job left him absent from their home all day, and that {{the other members of the}} household would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with its upkeep. Therefore, he turned Ellen's care over to her married sisters, Elizabeth Stacey and Grace Blackall, both of whom lived in Turville. The cause of Ann's death was found to be oedema of the heart, from which she had been suffering for many years.|$|E

2500|$|On the Criterion Collection Blu-ray, {{producer}} James B. Harris {{states that}} the original script contained an alternative [...] "happy ending".

Harris got this past distributors by sending the entire script, instead of merely sending the new ending, knowing that they would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to read the entire script again.

2500|$|GameSpot's Brett Todd scored it 5 out of 10, writing, [...] "Busywork puzzles and stone-age visuals {{drain the}} creeps {{out of this}} {{supposedly}} scary saga, which unfolds more like an uninspired detective story than an ominous encounter with a legendary monster." [...] He was also critical of the graphics and sound; [...] "Most scenes are grainy, and character models are afflicted with slow-motion movement tics that makes it seem like everybody you meet is underwater." [...] He also disliked many of the puzzles, and concluded [...] "Dracula 3 is dry, traditional, and stilted [...] Adventure gamers {{with a taste for}} methodical puzzle-solving could appreciate it, whereas everybody else will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> stifling yawns to feel any chills running down their spines. This is a vampire-inspired adventure by the numbers that holds few surprises in its dry puzzles and dated presentation values." ...|$|E

Figaro enters and explains his plan to distract the Count with anonymous letters warning him of adulterers. He has already sent one to the Count (via Basilio) that indicates that the Countess has a rendezvous of her own that evening.

2500|$|Fund {{governance}} {{became a}} major fund servicing industry following the 2008 financial crisis “spurred (by) several media reports arguing that professional directors must <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to provide the appropriate level of monitoring for their clients.” Consequently, many fund governance firms proliferated in response to perceived demand for independent directors for hedge funds and the low barriers to entry evident in the industry. A ‘gold rush’ mentality developed worldwide after articles by the Financial Times and the New York Times sensationalized fund directors in the Cayman Islands as having ‘hundreds’ of directorships. Serving as a fund director was portrayed as a sinecure [...] because anyone, anywhere in the world, {{could serve as a}} director on a Cayman Islands mutual fund (the FT articles were later critiqued by the Columbia Journalism Review). In response to this critical media scrutiny, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority implemented a number of reforms under the Director Registration and Licensing Law, 2014 which required all directors of Cayman Islands regulated mutual funds to become regulated. [...] As of 31 May 2015, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority reported that there were 8,879 directors on Cayman Islands funds of which only 422 were based in the Cayman Islands.|$|E
2500|$|Broadway {{producers}} are usually eager to cast big-named performers in their musicals, but Katzenberg, famous {{at the time}} for avoiding working with actors of such caliber, decided against this practice for Beauty and the Beast. Eisner concluded {{that most of the}} film's original voice actors would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to reprise their roles onstage. In her Broadway debut, then-22-year-old actress Susan Egan was cast as the musical's original Belle. Egan, who had not yet seen the film, had been auditioning for several other Broadway projects at the time – namely My Fair Lady, Carousel and Grease – in which she was much more interested. Despite longing to originate a Broadway role, the actress was initially reluctant to audition for Beauty and the Beast because she thought that [...] "it was a terrible idea for Disney to put a cartoon on Broadway." [...] Additionally, Egan felt she was not attractive enough to play a character touted [...] "the most beautiful girl in the village", but her agent managed to convince her otherwise. Without any film to reference, Egan determined that Belle {{is supposed to be a}} [...] "quirky" [...] character and approached her funnier than how she is depicted in the film, in turn garnering laughs from the producers – who were amused by her unique interpretation – and eventually earning several callbacks. Meanwhile, her competition of 500 actresses, many of whom were simply offering imitations of voice actress Paige O'Hara's original performance, continued to be eliminated.|$|E
