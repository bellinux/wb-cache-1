40|$|Over time, {{the name}} “balsamic vinegar” has {{acquired}} an important trade value {{and is now}} being usedto generally designate sweet and sour condiments with high viscosity and dark/brown color. Balsamiccondiments could be grouped in four different categories: generic <b>balsamic</b> <b>vinegars,</b> <b>balsamic</b> vinegarwith appellation of origin (PDO and Protected Geographical Indication or PGI), balsamic sauces, anddressing (Giudici et al. 2009).

Main isolation sources of the UMCC AAB strains are wine <b>vinegars,</b> <b>balsamic</b> <b>vinegars,</b> cereal vinegars, fermented juices and kombucha tea. During the years, methods to recover representative isolates and preserve phenotypic stability were improved within UMCC, in order to investigate the key traits useful for their industrial exploitation. Acetic acid bacteria have attractive features useful in performing conventional and innovative processes/products. They incompletely oxidize sugars, alcohols and polyols to the corresponding oxidation products and they are exploited by pharmaceutical, medical, chemical and food-grade industries {{for the production of}} acetic acid, dihydroxyacetone, gluconic acid, 2 -keto-L-gulonic acid and cellulose. Phenotypic changes, mainly regarding ethanol oxidation, acetic acid resistance and cellulose production, have been detected, consequently, suitable preservation methods and check procedures are performed in UMCC. The AAB strains are identified and characterized by a polyphasic approach and molecular typing are performed by fingerprinting techniques (ERIC/PCR and GTG 5).

40|$|Product {{differentiation}} {{is pervasive}} in markets. It {{is at the}} heart of structural empiricism and it smoothes jagged behavior that causes paradoxical outcomes in several theoretical models. Firms differentiate their products to avoid ruinous price competition. Representative consumer, discrete choice, and location models are not necessarily inconsistent, but performance depends crucially on the degree of localization of competition. With (symmetric) global competition, rents are typically small and market variety near optimal. With local competition, profits may be protected because entrants must find profitable niches. These rents lead firms to competitively dissipative them, and performance may be poor. 1. Overview Consumer goods are available in a variety of styles and brands. Product differentiation refers to such variations within a product class that (some) consumers view as imperfect substitutes.

40|$|International audienceFifty-eight {{brands of}} <b>balsamic</b> <b>vinegars</b> were {{analyzed}} for lead concentrations and isotopic compositions ((204) Pb, (206) Pb, (207) Pb, and (208) Pb) {{to test the}} findings of a previous study indicating relatively high levels of lead contamination in some of those vinegars more than two thirds (70 %) of them exceeded California's State Maximum Level (34 mu g/L) based on consumption rates >= 0. 5 mu g Pb per day. The Lead isotopic fingerprints of all those vinegars with high lead concentrations were then found to be primarily anthropogenic. This isotopic analysis unquestionably reveals multiple contamination sources including atmospheric pollutant Pb and an unidentified contamination source, likely occurring after grape harvest. Organically grown grape vinegars display the same Pb content and isotopic signatures as other vinegars. This implies that pesticides might not be a significant source of pollutant Pb in vinegars. A significant post-harvest contamination would be inherited from chemicals added during production and/or material used during transport, processing or storage of these vinegars. This is consistent with the highest Pb levels being found in aged vinegars (112 +/- 112 mu g/L) in contrast to other vinegars (41. 6 +/- 28. 9 mu g/L) suggesting contamination during storage. It is, therefore, projected that lead levels in most <b>vinegars,</b> especially aged <b>balsamic</b> and wine <b>vinegars,</b> will decrease with improvements in their manufacture and storage processes consequential to recent concerns of elevated levels of lead in some vinegars.
