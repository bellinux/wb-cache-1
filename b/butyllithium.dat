25|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>butyllithium</b> in commercially available solutions tends to decrease {{over time as}} the BuLi reacts with air. Subsequently, <b>butyllithium</b> is often titrated prior to use to ascertain its true concentration. The BuLi is added to a known amount of a weakly acidic compound, such as an alcohol. Because <b>butyllithium</b> is a strong base, it quickly and quantitatively reacts with weak acids to give the corresponding lithium salts and butane. An indicator, such as 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,2'-bipyridine, is commonly used to signal the endpoint of the titration. Both compounds form colored complexes with <b>butyllithium</b> once the titrant is consumed.|$|E
25|$|Schlosser's base is a superbase {{produced}} by treating <b>butyllithium</b> with potassium tert-butoxide. It is kinetically more reactive than <b>butyllithium</b> {{and is often}} used to accomplish difficult metalations. The butoxide anion complexes the lithium and effectively produces butylpotassium, which is more reactive than the corresponding lithium reagent.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>butyllithium</b> is colorless, n-butyllithium {{is usually}} {{encountered}} as a pale yellow solution in alkanes. Such solutions are stable indefinitely if properly stored, but in practice, they degrade upon aging. Fine white precipitate (lithium hydroxide) is deposited {{and the color}} changes to orange.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{laboratory}} use of hexanes {{to extract}} {{oil and grease}} contaminants from water and soil for analysis. Since hexane cannot be easily deprotonated, it {{is used in the}} laboratory for reactions that involve very strong bases, such as the preparation of organolithiums. For example, <b>butyllithiums</b> are typically supplied as a hexane solution.|$|R
50|$|Common metalation {{reagents}} are the <b>butyllithiums.</b> tert-Butyllithium and sec-butyllithium {{are generally}} more reactive and have better selectivity than n-butyllithium, however, they are also more expensive and difficult to handle. Metalation is a common way of preparing versatile organolithium reagents. The position of metalation is mostly controlled by the acidity of the C-H bond. Lithiation often occurs at a position α to electron withdrawing groups, since they are good at stabilizing the electron-density of the anion. Directing groups on aromatic compounds and heterocycles provide regioselective sites of metalation, and directed ortho metelation is an important class of metalation reactions. Metalated sulfones, acyl groups and α-metalated amides are important intermediates in chemistry synthesis. Metalation of allyl ether with alkyllithium or LDA forms an anion α to the oxygen, and can proceed to 2,3-Wittig rearrangement. Addition of donor ligands such as TMEDA and HMPA can increase metalation rate and broaden substrate scope. Chiral organolithium reagents can be accessed through asymmetric metalation.|$|R
5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, <b>butyllithiums</b> are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|R
25|$|Ferrocene reacts readily with <b>butyllithium</b> to give 1,1′-dilithioferrocene, {{which in}} turn is a {{versatile}} nucleophile. But reaction of ferrocene with t-BuLi produces monolithioferrocene only. These approaches are especially useful methods to introduce main group functionality, e.g. using S8, chlorophosphines or chlorosilanes. The strained compounds undergo ring-opening polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{with some}} other catalysts, {{ethylene}} oxide may be reduced by hydrogen to ethylene with the yield up to 70%. The reduction catalysts include mixtures of zinc dust and acetic acid, of lithium aluminium hydride with titanium trichloride (the reducing agent is actually titanium dichloride, formed by the reaction between LiAlH4 and TiCl3) and of iron(III) chloride with <b>butyllithium</b> in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
