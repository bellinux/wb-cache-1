500|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 50th anniversary of his 1930 graduation from Harvard College, Phelps said of all [...] his administrative duties at Harvard he [...] "found Extension the most rewarding. [...] Partly, this was, no doubt, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run a rising program with practically no interference; partly it was the feeling that a second chance in education for people passed by in the normal run of school and college is one of the finest aspects of American education; and partly it was the chance to establish and maintain friendly relations thorough our programs with black people in Boston, who would otherwise have not have had any contact with Harvard." ...|$|E

500|$|During the rehearsals that day, Harrison and McCartney had {{a heated}} {{disagreement}} over the lead guitar {{part for the}} song. Harrison's idea was to play a guitar phrase {{as a response to}} each line of the vocal, which did not fit with McCartney's conception of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed it. In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, [...] "looking back on it, I think, Okay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have bowed to the pressure." [...] Ron Richards, a record producer who worked for Martin at both Parlophone and AIR Studios, said McCartney was [...] "oblivious to anyone else's feelings in the studio", and that he was driven to making the best possible record, at almost any cost.|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker.

I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of Star Trek, Roddenberry felt typecast as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in Westerns and police stories. He later described the period, saying, [...] "My dreams were going downhill <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not get work after the original series was cancelled." [...] He {{felt that he was}} [...] "perceived as the guy who made the show that was an expensive flop." [...] Roddenberry had sold his interest in Star Trek to Paramount Studios in return for a third of the ongoing profits. However, this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982. He wrote and produced Pretty Maids All in a Row (1971), a sexploitation film directed by Roger Vadim, for MGM. The cast included Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, and Roddy McDowall alongside Star Trek regular James Doohan, and William J. Campbell, who had appeared as a guest in two Star Trek episodes, [...] "The Squire Of Gothos" [...] and [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles". Variety was unimpressed: [...] "Whatever substance was in the original [...] or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results." [...] Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.|$|E

2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Cameron {{was labeled}} selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, {{who had been}} hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss. Card said the {{experience}} was [...] "hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people." [...] He later alluded to Cameron in his review of Me and Orson Welles, where he described witnessing a famous director chew out an assistant for his own error.|$|E

2500|$|Criticisms of the CoT {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of the CoT based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to {{know who it was}} who said this car would reduce the aero push <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have told you from when I first drove this car that it would be worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how the CoT was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{her talent}} {{led to a}} {{contract}} with Teaspoon Productions, headed by Chris Stokes and Earl Harris, who gave {{her work as a}} backing vocalist for their R boy band Immature, and arranged the production of a demo tape. In 1993, amid ongoing negotiations with East West Records, Norwood's parents organized a recording contract with the Atlantic Recording Corporation after auditioning for the company's director of A Darryl Williams. To manage her daughter, Norwood's mother soon resigned from her job, while Norwood herself dropped out of Hollywood High School later, and was tutored privately from tenth grade on. During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the ABC sitcom Thea, portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian Thea Vidale. Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series' viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. She stated, [...] "I felt bad for everybody else but me. It was a good thing, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do what I had to do, because I wanted to sing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{study was}} poorly {{received}} by {{a portion of}} the Romanian cultural environment, who objected to the revelations about the direct connections between various interwar intellectuals and fascist groups such as the Iron Guard. Rejecting accusations that he was diverting focus from the negative impact of communism, Ornea stated that he had simply carried on with research that would have been censored under Ceaușescu: [...] "I continued my exegesis on the currents of though of the interwar. In 1980 I published a book on the twenties, named Tradiționalism și modernitate în deceniul al treilea. I could not, at the time, advance in this field <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not write with probity about totalitarianism under totalitarian currents of thought. [...] In autumn 1990 I returned to the interwar period [...] There was not a single malevolent intent in doing so. I purely and simply carried on with an exegesis I had begun earlier". His preface for one edition of the book further explained this rationale: [...] " [...] could not be published because it was impossible to properly comment on the ideas of totalitarianism and the single party [...] of parliamentary democracy [...] And it should not have been published then because it unveiled the political credo of those who, back in the thirties, were the prominent personalities among the new generation (Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Constantin Noica and others). It was untimely because it would have provided arguments for not publishing their work (which, in any case, was always subject to the uncertain status of accidental tolerance). And I figured, like so many other intellectuals, that the work of these personalities should have, by all means, been published. I therefore postponed the writing of this book for settled times placed under a more fastidious sign".|$|E
