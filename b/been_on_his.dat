5|$|In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, {{his first}} cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, Sandip, {{who is now}} a film {{director}}. In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali, which had long <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which {{had a profound impact on}} him. Ray later said that he came out of the theatre determined to become a film-maker.|$|E

25|$|Hanam Sunim {{was in the}} Diamond Mountains, at Jangan Temple by 1922, {{and later}} just outside Seoul at Bongeun Temple in 1926. He left then and, perhaps {{intending}} {{to return to the}} Diamond Mountains, wound up staying in the Odae Mountains, at Sangwon Temple. (This would have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> path to the Diamond Mountains.) As he was a very well known teacher, {{it seems likely that the}} monks at the nearby large temple, Woljeong Temple, had asked him to stay and teach.|$|E

25|$|In Sydney Mason {{worked for}} the Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis. He had a success in winning first and second prizes for a new Mechanics' Institute, {{submitting}} Gothic and Classical designs, {{a sign of the}} rising competition between these styles. He built wheat silos on Cockatoo Island, a task requiring engineering ingenuity. It seems that here he acquired his acquaintance with verandas. A new Government House was then under construction which had been designed by Edward Blore while Mason had still <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> staff in 1835. He may have worked on the drawings.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only one}} window in McEwen's car was open, {{and none of}} them had been shattered, Seedman knew the shot had to have been fired from Sheepshead Bay or the nearby area, and that due to the {{distance}} and the car's speed, it was probably not intentional. He ordered detectives and uniformed officers to search the dunes and marshes for a possible shell casing. After 2,400 people were interviewed and several other leads came to nothing, he pointed at a spot on the map and told his detectives to look for people who owned boats. That led to the shooter—a local gas station owner who had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boat that morning taking target practice at a floating beer can. One of his bullets had ricocheted off the water's surface and killed McEwen. A grand jury ruled it an accident, and no homicide charges were brought, although the shooter was fined $100 for violating firearms laws with the rifle.|$|E
25|$|After Agadir the MO1 section under Harper {{became a}} key branch in {{preparing}} for war. Churchill, newly appointed to the Admiralty, was more receptive to Army-Navy cooperation. Intelligence suggested (8 January) that Germany was getting ready for war in April 1912. In February 1912 Wilson inspected the docks at Rouen, had meetings in Paris with Joffre, de Castelnau and Millerand (War Minister), visited Foch, now commanding a division at Chaumont, and inspected southern Belgium and the Maastricht appendix with Major Sackville-West (“Tit Willow”) who had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> directing staff at Camberley and now worked at MO2. Sir John French, the new CIGS (March 1912), was receptive to Wilson’s wishes to prepare for war and to cooperate with Belgium, although {{in the end the}} Belgian Government refused to cooperate and remained strictly neutral until the outbreak of war, with the Belgians even deploying a division in 1914 to guard against British violation of Belgian neutrality. In April Wilson played golf at Ostend for two days with Tom Bridges, briefing him for talks with the Belgians, whom Wilson wanted to strengthen Liege and Namur.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} the state's efforts to design the {{electric}} chair became intermixed with what has become {{to be known as}} the War of Currents, a competition between Thomas Edison's direct current power system and George Westinghouse's alternating current based system. The two companies had been competing commercially since 1886 and a series of events had turned it into an all-out media war in 1888. The committee head, neurologist Frederick Peterson, enlisted the services of Harold P. Brown as a consultant. Brown had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own crusade against alternating current after the shoddy installation of pole-mounted AC arc lighting lines in New York City had caused several deaths in the spring of 1888. Peterson had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College, an attempt by Brown to prove AC was more deadly than DC. Technical assistance in these demonstrations was provided by Thomas Edison's West Orange laboratory and there grew to be some form of collusion between Edison Electric and Brown. Back at West Orange on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society including Elbridge Gerry who was also chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1000-1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities. Westinghouse criticized these test as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current and accused Brown of being in the employ of Edison.|$|E

Some therefore claim him as the only gay or bisexual person nominated to the Court thus far.

500|$|Several {{months after}} losing the United States Championship, Konnan became a villain and joined The Dungeon of Doom. However, the gimmick was already on its way out. According to Kevin Sullivan (the {{originator}} of the stable), speaking in a retrospective interview in July 2016, Konnan [...] "didn’t fit in The Dungeon of Doom. He was forced into it." [...] Sullivan also praised Konnan highly: [...] a fabulous performer and has a great mind for the wrestling business. He should have <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own. Putting him with us, he just lost all the steam he had. He brought the luchadors into WCW, so he had a real effect on professional wrestling." ...|$|E

500|$|Ian Fleming had {{originally}} intended the novel, published in 1955, {{to be made}} into a film even before he began writing it and was based on an original manuscript of a screenplay which had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mind for years. In 1955, American actor [...] John Payne offered $1,000 for a nine-month option to Moonraker, plus $10,000 if production eventually took off. The negotiations broke up the following year due to disagreements regarding Payne's ownership of the other Bond novels. Fleming eventually settled with Rank Organisation, a British company who owned Pinewood Studios. Rank wound up not developing the film, even after Fleming contributed his own script trying to push production forward, and Fleming purchased the rights back in 1959. Moonraker ended up being the last James Bond novel to receive a screen adaptation.|$|E
