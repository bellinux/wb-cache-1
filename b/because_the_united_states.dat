5|$|In February 2009, FATA's provincial {{government}} officially declared Islamic law in Swat {{to achieve a}} ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{represented}} Virginia's 8th congressional district, {{an area in}} Northern Virginia that is {{just across}} the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.; the district includes Arlington county, and the cities of Alexandria, Falls Church and parts of Fairfax. The redistricting that followed the 2000 census also gave Moran a portion of Reston, Virginia. His district {{is located in the}} Dulles Technology Corridor and is the home of many federal defense contractors as well as a significant number of those who work in the information technology industry. Many federal employees also reside within the district, mostly due to its proximity to Washington and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Department of Defense and various other agencies are headquartered there.|$|E

5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell and his Indian allies prepared a major offensive. In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition {{came to a halt}} after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Most of the Indians dispersed after learning that the reports of imminent invasion were false, but Caldwell led 300 Indians into Kentucky and delivered a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. After his victory at Blue Licks, Caldwell was ordered to cease operations <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Great Britain were about to make peace. Although General Irvine had finally gotten permission to lead his own expedition into the Ohio Country, rumors of the peace treaty killed enthusiasm for the undertaking, which never took place. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the final blow in the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} trial {{for war crimes}} committed at Treblinka was held in Düsseldorf between 12 October 1964 and 24 August 1965, preceded by the 1951 trial of SS-Scharführer Josef Hirtreiter, which was triggered by charges of war crimes unrelated to his service at the camp. The trial was delayed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and the Soviet Union had lost interest in prosecuting German war crimes {{with the onset of}} the Cold War. Many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1964 and 1965 eleven former SS camp personnel were brought to trial by West Germany, including commandant Kurt Franz. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Artur Matthes (Totenlager) and Willi Mentz and August Miete (both from Lazaret). Gustav Münzberger (gas chambers) received 12 years, Franz Suchomel (gold and money) 7 years, Otto Stadie (operation) 6 years, Erwin Lambert (gas chambers) 4 years, and Albert Rum (Totenlager) 3 years. Otto Horn (corpse detail) was acquitted.|$|E
50|$|A third burst, Charlie, {{planned for}} 1947, was {{canceled}} primarily <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Navy's inability to decontaminate the target ships after the Baker test. Charlie was rescheduled as Operation Wigwam, a deep water shot conducted in 1955 off the California coast.|$|R
50|$|The {{agreement}} is a treaty under international law, but not under <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution <b>because</b> in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> laws require majority approval in both houses, while treaties require two-thirds approval in the Senate only. Under U.S. law, CAFTA-DR is a congressional-executive agreement.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, McChrystal {{endorsed}} Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democratic congressional hopeful, {{attempting to}} unseat Representative John F. Tierney in the Democratic primary. Having never before made an endorsement, McChrystal said he endorsed Moulton, a Marine veteran, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Congress {{could benefit from}} {{a man of his}} character.|$|E
25|$|A {{potential}} {{route for}} the Royal Navy {{to get the}} SPS-6C was the Mutual Defense Assistance Pact (MDAP), but by 1954-5 the MDAP programme was running down. In addition, {{it was thought that}} getting spares for the SPS-6C radar could be a problem, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Navy considered it obsolescent.|$|E
50|$|Association {{football}} {{was perceived as}} an especially bad fit {{for this type of}} stadium <b>because,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>the</b> sport does not draw as many fans to games as American football or baseball (with the partial exception of Seattle), resulting in the stadium being filled to only a fraction of its capacity. This led to the soccer-specific stadium movement.|$|R
50|$|As of 2006 {{over half}} of the Thais in the Chicago area work in the medical sector. Thai doctors and nurses came <b>because</b> in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{there was a lack of}} health professionals. There are around 12 Thai {{groceries}} in the Chicago area as of 2006. At first produce was transported by aircraft from Bangkok since some Thais had difficulty in eating American food. By 2006 many kinds of Thai produce were now produced in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> Alaska makes <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> an Arctic nation, {{the state}} is {{directly}} involved in much Arctic research, security, and policy. 90% of the state-funded portion of the budget comes from oil tax revenue—the fisheries industry is also very significant.|$|R
25|$|The victorious {{great powers}} also gained an {{acknowledgement}} of their status through permanent {{seats at the}} League of Nations Council, where they acted {{as a type of}} executive body directing the Assembly of the League. However, the Council began with only four permanent members – the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Japan – <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> meant to be the fifth permanent member, did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles, thus preventing American participation in the League. Germany later joined, and left along with Japan, and the Soviet Union joined.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> has not {{ratified}} the Basel Convention or its Ban Amendment, and has few domestic federal laws forbidding {{the export of}} toxic waste, the Basel Action Network estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China. This figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the EPA, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and the World Reuse, Repair and Recycling Association.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s, Japan's {{increasingly}} expansionist policies {{brought it}} into renewed conflict with its neighbors, Russia and China (Japan had fought the First Sino-Japanese War with China in 1894–95 and the Russo-Japanese War with Russia in 1904–05; Japan's imperialist ambitions {{had a hand}} in precipitating both conflicts). In March 1933, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in response to international condemnation of its conquest of Manchuria and subsequent establishment of the Manchukuo puppet government. On January 15, 1936, Japan withdrew from the Second London Naval Disarmament Conference <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Great Britain refused to grant the Japanese Navy parity with theirs. A second war between Japan and China began with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937.|$|E
50|$|In 1903 the Serrallés family, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Juan Serrallés, installed the first continuous still in Puerto Rico. Juan Serrallés died in 1921 just as the production of rum was being halted <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Prohibition Act of the 1920s. Juan's family continued to run the sugar side of the business but for the destillery side started to produce medical alcohol instead of the outlawed rum. It was called Alcoholado Superior 70.|$|R

500|$|Turkish fears {{intensified}} after Iraqi Kurdistan gained autonomy {{after the}} 1991 Gulf War.

[...] In 1998, Turkey {{was able to use}} military threats to force neighboring Syria to expel PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan. [...] However, <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> it was never able to move decisively against the Kurds in northern Iraq.|$|R
25|$|The French {{victory over}} the Arab Kingdom of Syria and the Balfour Declaration led to the {{emergence}} of Palestinian Nationalism and Arab rioting in 1920 and 1921. In response, the British authorities imposed immigration quotas for Jews. Exceptions were made for Jews with over 1,000 pounds in cash (roughly 100,000 pounds at year 2000 rates) or Jewish professionals with over 500 pounds. The Jewish Agency issued the British entry permits and distributed funds donated by Jews abroad. Between 1924 and 1929, 82,000 more Jews arrived (Fourth Aliyah), fleeing antisemitism in Poland and Hungary, and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Immigration Act of 1924 now kept Jews out. The new arrivals included many middle-class families who moved into towns and established small businesses and workshops—although lack of economic opportunities meant that approximately a quarter later left. The first electricity generator was built in Tel Aviv in 1923 under the guidance of Pinhas Rutenberg, a former Commissar of St Petersburg in Russia's pre-Bolshevik Kerensky Government. In 1925 the Jewish Agency established the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Technion (technological university) in Haifa.|$|E
25|$|Global {{economic}} change. Global {{economic change}} is one cause for illegal immigration because information and transportation technologies now foster internationalized production, distribution and consumption, and labor. This has encouraged many countries {{to open their}} economies to outside investment, then {{increasing the number of}} low-skilled workers participating in global labor markets and making low-skilled labor markets all more competitive. This and the fact that developed countries have shifted from manufacturing to knowledge-based economies, have realigned economic activity around the world. Labor has become more international as individuals immigrate seeking work, despite governmental attempts to control this migration. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> education system creates relatively few people who either lack a high school diploma or who hold PhDs, {{there is a shortage of}} workers needed to fulfill seasonal low-skilled jobs as well as certain high-skilled jobs. To fill these gaps, the United States immigration system attempts to compensate for these shortages by providing for temporary immigration by farm workers and seasonal low-skilled workers, and for permanent immigration by high-skilled workers.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the United States {{abandoned}} the KMT and expected that Taiwan would {{fall to the}} Communists. However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown war, and {{in the context of}} the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened again and dispatched the US Navy's 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China. In the Treaty of San Francisco and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952 and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942. Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China. Continuing conflict of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, Harrington created Dark Laughter, {{a regular}} single panel cartoon, for that publication. The strip was later retitled Bootsie, after its most famous character, an {{ordinary}} African American dealing with {{racism in the}} U.S. Harrington described him as [...] "a jolly, rather well-fed but soulful character." [...] During this period, Harrington enrolled in Fine Arts at Yale University to complete his degree, but could not finish <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> entry into World War II.|$|R

500|$|Article One {{provides}} that Congress shall {{have the power}} [...] "o provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States." [...] Currie argues that section 14's somewhat broad reading of the word [...] "Securities" [...] is fair enough.

500|$|The Lincoln cent (or {{sometimes}} called Lincoln penny) is a one-cent coin {{that has been}} struck by the United States Mint since 1909. The obverse or heads side was designed by Victor David Brenner, as was the original reverse. [...] The coin has seen several reverse, or tails, designs and now bears one by Lyndall Bass depicting a Union shield. All coins struck by the United States government with a value of 1/100 of a dollar are called cents <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> has always minted coins using decimals.
