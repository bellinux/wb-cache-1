40|$|Recently, {{both the}} {{invasive}} ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and the arctic Mertensia ovum {{were discovered in}} the Baltic Sea but their range expansion remains unclear due to misidentification of their larval stages. Supported by molecular species verification we describe seasonal abundance and distribution of larvae and eggs of these two species. We show that their occurrence is significantly but inversely related to salinity. Mertensia ovum was present year round throughout the brackish Baltic Sea but also occurred in high-saline areas during cold seasons. Larvae of M. leidyi occurred throughout all seasons in high-saline areas but never extended further into the central Baltic. Highest ctenophore egg abundances were observed in high-saline areas during summer along with the first appearance of M. leidyi adults. The M. leidyi population peaked 2 months after the first occurrence of adults in high-saline areas, suggesting these areas {{as a source for}} lower saline regions. Low larvae abundances and a reduced transitional-to-adult ratio in the southern Baltic point to reduced or no active recruitment, suggesting that drift of animals from high-saline into lower saline regions sustains the M. leidyi population in the southern Baltic such as the Arkona and <b>Bornholm</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R

40|$|Prudent {{management}} of marine fish resources relies on separation and {{management of}} biologically meaningful groups of conspecifics, termed fishery stocks, often depicted as self-sustaining, spatiotemporally separated and demographically independent entities. Such stock discrimination has however proven challenging. Although most marine fish species form local spawning populations (in relation to hydrological and topographical features that promote local juvenile retention), the level of genetic and demographic connectivity among them is difficult to quantify, given that marine fish often display low genetic differentiation, implying gene flow among local populations mediated by dispersal and migrations in a “barrier free” environment. In this thesis I assess regional genetic structure and phenotypic divergence in a “high gene flow” fish species, the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and re-evaluate the current stock division into an Eastern Baltic (EB) and Western Baltic (WB) cod stock. I also assess genetic consequences of population size reductions in a regional population assemblage of brown trout (Salmo trutta), used as a model system to draw conclusions relevant to overexploited fishery stocks. I examine genetic structure in a regional assemblage of local cod populations, making up a transitional admixture zone that separates the non-admixed North Sea stocks from non-admixed Baltic Sea stocks. In spite of a gradient in genetic admixture, which coincides with a gradient in salinity, local cod populations form two differentiated genetic clusters (stock complexes); a North Sea stock complex (Kattegat & Öresund), and a Baltic Sea proper stock complex (Arkona & <b>Bornholm</b> <b>basins).</b> This division is supported by recent genetic work, but is not congruent with the current EB and WB stock division. I also assess stock mixing in the Öresund management subdivision, an interface between inferred stock complexes, seeing increasing stock mixing (proportion Baltic genotypes) with decreasing distance from the Baltic Sea proper, and non-negligible but stable stock mixing throughout a single season. The combination of non-negligible migrant influx and maintained genetic differentiation might imply regionally prevailing spatiotemporal spawning separation and homing. I assess phenotypic and behavioural divergence in a local cod population, manifested through biased catches with regard to body condition, growth and body morphology. Evidence suggest that the observed divergence constitute within-stock behavioural components (not genetically divergent populations) most likely induced by increased intraspecific competition within the Baltic Sea proper. The inconsistent spatial genetic structures historically inferred for Baltic cod raises questions regarding the spatiotemporal stability of an admixture zone. To examine how population size reductions (and ensuing density dependent migrations and interactions) influence the genetic integrity of populations and the regional genetic admixture, I assess genetic variability within an assemblage of trout populations that suffered recent region-wide population decimations and recoveries. Recovered populations were characterized by lower genetic differentiation and higher genetic admixture, implying that population size reductions could endanger the genetic integrity of local populations. Such density-dependent genetic integrity is of relevance also to cod, given the drastic declines in Baltic cod stocks from overexploitation in the 1980 s and 1990 s. In summary, my work suggests that stock discrimination and stock division must be more dynamic, especially for population assemblages experiencing genetic admixture, exploitation, and stock size reductions. Given that stock size reductions can increase genetic admixture from density-dependent gene flow, and that gene flow can counteract local adaptation, overexploitation can have unforeseen detrimental effects on local populations...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{samples and}} nine cores {{from the western}} Baltic Sea and {{marginal}} water bodies were investigated for clay mineral composition. The clay mineral assemblages of recent sediments are rather homogeneous. Variations result mainly from the erosion of different glacial source deposits. High percentages of illite and low kaolinite/chlorite and quartz/feldspar ratios are characteristic for this glacial source. Advection of kaolinite-rich suspensions from the North Sea is believed to account for higher kaolinite/chlorite ratios in the Mecklenburg Bight. A contribution of the rivers Trave and Oder to the western Baltic Sea is indicated by increased smectite values in marginal water bodies. They correspond to increased kaolinite/chlorite and quartz/feldspar ratios. In the main basins the river signal is diluted beyond recognition. Cores from the Arkona, <b>Bornholm</b> and Gotland <b>Basins</b> penetrate through post-Littorina muds and sediments of the Ancylus Lake/Yoldia Sea into Late Glacial sediments of the Baltic Ice Lake. Clay mineral assemblages are characterized {{by an increase in}} kaolinite/chlorite ratios from Late Glacial to Holocene sediments, with a distinct shift at each facies change. This allows the distinction and core to core correlation of main lithological units with kaolinite/chlorite ratios. Kaolinite enrichment of Holocene muds corresponds to a brackish-marine facies and may reflect influx of kaolinite-rich suspensions from the North Sea. Cores from the lagoon of the Oderhaff show fluctuations in the contributions of the two main sediment sources: river suspension and glacial deposits during the Late Glacial and Postglacial sequence. Lacustrine sediments, which were deposited prior to 5500 years B. P. are characterized by smectite, kaolinite and quartz from the drainage area of the Oder river.

40|$|A {{complete}} updated {{and revised}} lithostratigraphic scheme for the Jurassic succession of the onshore and offshore Danish areas is presented {{together with an}} overview of the geological evolution. The lithostratigraphies of <b>Bornholm,</b> the Danish <b>Basin</b> and the Danish Central Graben are described in ascending order, and a number of new units are defined. On Bornholm, the Lower-Middle Jurassic coal-bearing clays and sands that overlie the Lower Pliensbachian Hasle Formation are referred to the new Sorthat Formation (Lower Jurassic) and the revised Bagå Formation (Middle Jurassic). In the southern Danish Central Graben, the Middle Jurassic succession formerly referred to the Lower Graben Sand Formation is now included in the revised Bryne Formation. The Lulu Formation is erected to include the uppermost part of the Middle Jurassic succession, previously referred to the Bryne Formation in the northern Danish Central Graben. The Upper Jurassic Heno Formation is subdivided into two new members, the Gert Member (lower) and the Ravn Member (upper). The organic-rich part of the upper Farsund Formation, the former informal `hot unit', is established formally as the Bo Member. Dominantly shallow marine and paralic deposition in the Late Triassic was succeeded by widespread deposition of offshore marine clays in the Early Jurassic. On Bornholm, coastal and paralic sedimentation prevailed. During maximum transgression in the Early Toarcian, sedimentation of organic-rich offshore clays took place in the Danish area. This depositional phase was terminated by a regional erosional event in early Middle Jurassic time, caused by uplift of the central North Sea area, including the Ringkøbing-Fyn High. In the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone to the east, where slow subsidence continued, marine sandy sediments were deposited in response to the uplift. Uplift of the central North Sea area was followed by fault-controlled subsidence accompanied by fluvial and floodplain deposition during Middle Jurassic time. On Bornholm, deposition of lacustrine muds, fluvial sands and peats dominated. The late Middle Jurassic saw a gradual shift to shallow marine deposition in the Danish Central Graben, the Danish Basin and Skåne, southern Sweden. During the Late Jurassic, open marine shelf conditions prevailed with deposition of clay-dominated sediments while shallow marine sands were deposited on platform areas. The Central Graben received sand by means of sediment gravity flows. The clay sediments in the Central Graben became increasingly rich in organic matter at the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition, whilst shallow marine coarse-grained deposits prograded basinwards in the Sorgenfrei- Tornquist Zone...|$|R

Abstract: In this study the drift of eastern Baltic cod larvae and juveniles spawned within the historical eastern Baltic cod spawning grounds was investigated by detailed drift model simulations for the years 1971 – 2010, to examine the spatio-temporal dynamics of environmental suitability in the nursery areas of juvenile cod settlement. The results of the long-term model scenario runs, where juvenile cod were treated as simulated passively drifting particles, enabled us to find strong indications for long-term variations of settlement and potentially the reproduction success of the historically important eastern Baltic cod nursery grounds. Only low proportions of juveniles hatched in the Arkona Basin and in the Gotland Basin were able to settle in their respective spawning ground. Ocean currents were either unfavorable for the juveniles to reach suitable habitats or transported the juveniles to nursery grounds of neighboring subdivisions. Juveniles which hatched in the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin</b> were most widely dispersed and showed the highest settlement probability, while the second highest settlement probability and horizontal dispersal was observed for juveniles originating from the Gdansk Deep.

After 12 years of stagnation, this inflow brought highly saline (about 20) waters into the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin.</b> As in the previous inflow in January 2003, saltwater moved in the near-bottom layer with a current speed of approx. 25 cms− 1. This paper presents data collected in January and February 2015 and compares them to earlier records from 2000 to 2014...|$|E
40|$|BANSAI - The BAltic and North Sea marine {{environmental}} modelling Assessment Initiative Two numerical ecosystem models {{are used to}} analyse the ecosystem health of the Baltic Sea in the year 2005 {{in relation to the}} target and reference levels in the planned Baltic Sea Action Plan of HELCOM. The results of models run at Finnish Institute of Marine Research (FIMR) and Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) show that in all Baltic Sea regions there are locations which can be considered as eutrophication problem areas based on HELCOM (2006) classification. The same conclusion can be drawn also according to a comparison with Alg@line results from sea areas as Arkona Basin, <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin,</b> Eastern Gotland Basin, Northern Gotland Basin and Gulf of Finland. The winter concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) were high in all Baltic Sea regions except Bothnian Bay (and Bothnian Sea according to the SMHI model). In the Arkona Basin and the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin</b> the DIP concentrations were exceptionally high according to Alg@line measurements. According to the models, the algae blooming was remarkable approximately on 30 % of summer days in the Arkona Basin, eastern regions of Eastern Gotland Basin (including Lithuanian open waters and Gdansk Deep), Gulf of Finland and northern Bothnian Bay. The chlorophyll a concentration of 2 mg m- 3 (exceeding the HELCOM acceptable deviation levels) the concentration of 3 mg m-(indicating remarkable algal bloom) was exceeded for more than 60 % and 30 % of summer days, respectively, in the Arkona Basin, eastern regions of Eastern Gotland Basin (including Lithuanian open waters and Gdansk Deep), Gulf of Finland and northern Bothnian Bay according to both models. Alg@line 2005 chlorophyll a concentrations were lower than the Alg@line-references in the Arkona and <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin,</b> but higher than on Alg@line-references in other regions. The oxygen concentration in the bottom layers was under the critical limit (of 2 mg/l) for living organisms most of the year in northern parts of the Eastern and Western Gotland Basins and in the Northern Gotland basin...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic drift {{modeling}} {{was used}} to investigate the potential dispersion of Mnemiopsis leidyi from the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin</b> in the Baltic Sea {{where it has been}} observed since 2007 further to the east and north. In the brackish surface layer dispersion is mainly driven by wind, while within the halocline dispersion is mainly controlled by the baroclinic flow field and bottom topography. Model runs showed that the natural spreading via deep water currents from the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin</b> towards north and east is limited by topographic features and low advection velocities. Based on the information on ranges of salinity and temperature, which limit survival and reproduction of this ctenophore within the Baltic Sea, areas have been identified where the American comb jelly, M. leidyi could potentially survive and reproduce. While, we could show that M. leidyi might survive in vast areas of the northern Baltic Sea its reproduction is prevented by low salinity (< 10 psu) and temperature (< 12 °C). Thus, due to the combined effect of low salinity and temperature, it is not probable that M. leidyi could establish permanent populations in the central or northern Baltic Sea. However, it seems that in the southern parts of the Baltic Sea environmental conditions are suitable for a successful reproduction of M. leidyi...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, and Al 203, water content, {{the amounts}} of organic carbon, the ratio of 13 C/ 12 C and the 14 C-activity of the organic {{fraction}} were determined with sediment depth from a 34 cm long box-core from the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin</b> (Baltic Sea). The average sedimentation rate was 2. 4 mm/yr. The upper portion of the core contained increasing amounts of 14 C-inactive organic carbon, and above 3 cm depth, man-made 14 C from atomic bomb tests. The concentrations of the heavy metals Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu increase strongly towards the surface, while other metals, as Fe, Ni and Co remain almost unchanged. This phenomenon is attributed to anthropogenic influences. A comparison of the Kieler Bucht, the Bornholm and the Gotland Basins shows that today the anthropogenic addition of Zn is about 100 mg/m** 2 yr in all three basins. The beginning of this excess of Zn, however, is delayed by about 20 years in, the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Basin</b> and by about 40 years in the Gotland Basin. It is suggested that SW-NE transport of these anthropogenically mobilized metals {{may be related to}} periodic bottom water renewal in the Baltic Sea sedimentary basins...|$|E
