5|$|Specific {{business}} models for street newspapers vary widely, ranging from vendor-managed papers that place the highest value upon homeless empowerment and involvement to highly professionalized and commercialized weeklies. Some papers (especially in Europe) operate as autonomous businesses, while others operate {{as parts of}} existing organizations or projects. There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 millionUSD in profits, but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.|$|E

He has also taken part in a celebrity cricket match for charity to help fund a new children's rehabilitation unit at a hospital in Manchester.

Cost of living is a much <b>bigger</b> <b>issue</b> for Tasmanians. 	Access to healthcare is also a <b>bigger</b> <b>issue</b> in Tasmania as well as SA/NT. 	Employment/jobs are more important in Tasmania, Victor ia & SA/NT where unemployment has also been higher.

25|$|Street {{newspapers}} are {{a tool for}} allowing homeless individuals to work. In New York City, in 1989, a street newspaper was created called Street News which put some homeless to work, some writing, producing, and mostly selling the paper on streets and trains. Street News is written pro bono {{by a combination of}} homeless, celebrities, and established writers. In 1991, in England, a street newspaper, following the New York model was established, called The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> and is published weekly. Its circulation has grown to 300,000.|$|E

25|$|Side-to-side {{movement}} of the stick controlled the large rudder. This produced a rolling motion because the wings both had substantial dihedral, through yaw-roll coupling.

The Flying Flea, being a two axis aircraft, could not be landed or taken off in substantial crosswinds.

25|$|Fur {{commerce}} made {{a permanent}} {{residence in the}} country worthwhile. Good relations with the aboriginal providers were necessary. For some fishermen however, a seasonal presence was sufficient. Commercial companies were founded that tried to further {{the interest of the}} Crown in colonizing the territory. They demanded that France grant a monopoly to one single company. In return, this company would also take over the colonization of the French American territory. Thus, it would not cost the king much money to build the colony. On the other hand, other merchants wanted commerce to stay unregulated. This controversy was a <b>big</b> <b>issue</b> {{at the turn of the}} 17th century.|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> the world's {{most widely}} circulated street newspaper, {{is a good}} example of these two schools of thought. [...] The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. [...] In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> or that The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. [...] Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to [...] "fill the void" [...] in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.|$|E
