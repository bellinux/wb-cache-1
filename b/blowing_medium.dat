30|$|There are no {{permanent}} solutions for fouling, {{but there are}} certain technologies which can help in minimizing the deposition problems in boilers. Some of these processes are pulse detonation wave technology, intelligent soot blower, chemical treatment technology, anti-fouling coatings, etc [35]. These technologies can help in reducing the fouling problem to some extent in boiler tubes depending upon their efficiency. Finishing remarks and recommendations can be drawn according to the results shown. Soot blowers can be used to clean the heated plane of boilers during operations, with <b>blowing</b> <b>medium</b> as water and steam. Water or steam is directed at the deposit through a nozzle which causes the deposit to fracture and corrode away. There are some ash actions prediction tools such as AshProSM used to review the slagging and fouling situation in coal-fired boilers. Integrated boiler with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations with ash actions models is used to determine ash development, transport, deposition, deposit growth and strength development [36]. Some of the other methods, which are used for prevention from fouling in boilers, are wet pretreatment of brown coal-fired power utility boiler, using mineral additives in coal-fired utility boiler, monitoring of fouling tendencies, chemical treatment technology: targeted in furnace injection (TIFI) technology, etc. [44].|$|E
40|$|The {{major theme}} {{of this paper is}} to {{emphasize}} the need and identify the measures necessary to maintain boiler or heater tube surfaces in a reasonably clean condition in order to attain the maximum possible overall system efficiency. Many factors, including some commonly overlooked, must be considered in arriving at an effective and adequate cleaning system. Also to be covered is a review of the wide variety of available soot blowers. These vary according to the type of surface arrangement that is to be cleaned and the energy level that is necessary to effectively remove the deposits involved. Attention is also given to the various control systems required and available for the soot blower according to sequence versatility and blowing interval variability. Finally, the "payback" from soot blowing is a matter of comparing the costs connected with soot blowing and the gain in boiler efficiency. The costs normally associated with soot blowers are capital investment, maintenance, and <b>blowing</b> <b>medium</b> consumed. But savings can be realized without a decrease in blowing effectiveness, for example, by increasing blower travel speeds, reducing blowing cycle time, and updating older equipment. Payback can also be measured in terms of reduced boiler exit gas temperature and the resultant gain in boiler efficiency...|$|E

40|$|In {{the work}} there are shown {{the results of}} {{experimental}} studies on methane rich gasification of pinewood pellets in Bio-CONOx technology. The experiment was carried out on a laboratory scale gasifier (5 kW), which design features allow producing a high quality gas with a high methane content. In the results there was identified {{the impact of the}} quantity of Bio-CONOx on the amount of flammable gas compounds (methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide) in the synthesis gas and the gas calorific value. The additive was added in 10, 20, 30 and 50 % concentrations to the gasifier chamber. It has been shown that increasing the amount of the additive has a positive effect on the calorific value of the synthesis gas (Fig. 1, 2). Gas with a high content of methane (and high calorific value) was obtained from gasification of biomass with a 50 % addition of Bio-CONOx. There was also examined the proportion of <b>blowing</b> air (gasifying <b>medium)</b> for which the properties of obtained syngas were the best...|$|R
5000|$|Loose medium walls {{tend to be}} [...] "soil-on-a-shelf" [...] or [...] "soil-in-a-bag" [...] type systems. Loose medium {{systems have}} their soil packed into a shelf or bag and are then {{installed}} onto the wall. These systems require their media to be replaced {{at least once a}} year on exteriors and approximately every two years on interiors. Loose soil systems are not well suited for areas with any seismic activity. Most importantly, because these systems can easily have their <b>medium</b> <b>blown</b> away by wind-driven rain or heavy winds, these should not be used in applications over 8 feet high. There are some systems in Asia that have solved the loose media erosion problem by use of shielding systems to hold the media within the green wall system even when soil liquefaction occurs under seismic load. In these systems, the plants can still up-root themselves in the liquified soil under seismic load, and therefore it is required that the plants be secured to the system to prevent them from falling from the wall. Loose-soil systems without physical media erosion systems are best suited for the home gardener where occasional replanting is desired from season to season or year to year. Loose-soil systems with physical media erosion systems are well suited for all green wall applications.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an evaporator system with spring steam and a direct-contacttype condenser system for energy conversion of hot springs {{are described in}} this report. The newly devised evaporator system is composed by a spring steam separator, a hot water tank, a heat exchanger remaked of the shell-and-tube V-type, and a lubricant separator tube. The spring steam, which is separated from spring hot water by the spring steam separator, is blown up {{in the form of}} bubbles in the hot water through the bubble-making plate placed under the Uvtype tubes. These steam bubbles enhance turbulent flows around the If-type tubes, incresing the heat transfer rate. Therefore, the pump of hot water could be omitted in the present system. The working medium heated in the U'-type tubes is first led into the lubricant separator, where it is separated from the lubricant, and then goes into the flusher. In the flusher, the necessary amount of working medium for electric power generation is evaporated, and its gas is fed into the screw expander. The rest liquid of the working medium is returned to the Ll-type tubes by the pump and is reheated with the hot water. The lubricant separated by the lubricant separator, and then moves to the screw expander because of its own high pressure, therefore the pump of the lubricant could be omitted in this system. In the present test, evaporator system is composed of bare copper tubes (25. 44 > x 2 t x effective length 60 m) and the overall heat transfer coefficients with the from R 11 are about 1. 0 kW/m 2 K. Secondly, the newly devised condenser system is similary built by modifying the usual mass-produced shelland- tube U-type heat exchanger. The working medium liquid filling the tube chamber is chilled by the cooling water which flows in the tubes. The working medium gas from the screw expander is blown up into the working medium liquid through the perforated metal plate with (408 x 4 Φ bubble holes) which is placed under the working <b>medium</b> liquid. The <b>blown</b> working <b>medium</b> gas bubbles are condensed efficiently through the direct-contact heat exchange. From the experiments of the new condenser system with R 11, we obtained the value of 2. 5 kW/m 2 K for the overall heat transfer coefficients of this condensor system with bare copper tubes (25. 4 Φ x 2 t x effective length 85 m) ...|$|R
60|$|Practically I violate {{thus the}} {{instinct}} of monopoly, since it's a shame {{not to publish}} that Rome in May is indeed exquisitely worth your patience. I have just been so gratified at finding myself in undisturbed possession {{for a couple of}} hours of the Museum of the Lateran that I can afford to be magnanimous. It's almost as if the old all-papal paradise had come back. The weather for a month has been perfect, the sky an extravagance of blue, the air lively enough, the nights cool, nippingly cool. and the whole ancient greyness lighted with an irresistible smile. Rome, which in some moods, especially to new-comers, seems a place of almost sinister gloom, has an occasional art, as one knows her better, of brushing away care by the grand gesture with which some splendid impatient mourning matron--just the Niobe of Nations, surviving, emerging and looking about her again--might pull off and cast aside an oppression of muffling crape. This admirable power still temperamentally to react and take notice lurks in all her darkness and dirt and decay--a something more careless and hopeless than our thrifty northern cheer, and yet more genial and urbane than the Parisian spirit of blague. The collective Roman nature is a healthy and hearty one, and you feel it abroad in the streets even when the sirocco <b>blows</b> and the <b>medium</b> of life seems to proceed more or less from the mouth of a furnace. But who shall analyse even the simplest Roman impression? It is compounded of so many things, it says so much, it involves so much, it so quickens the intelligence and so flatters the heart, that before we fairly grasp the case the imagination has marked it for her own and exposed us to a perilous likelihood of talking nonsense about it.|$|R
40|$|Abridge. We have {{conducted}} a spectrophotometric study of dwarf early-type galaxies (dEs) in the Virgo cluster and in regions of lower density. We {{have found that}} these galaxies show many properties in common with late-type galaxies but not with more massive early-types (E/S 0). The properties of the dEs in Virgo show gradients within the cluster. dEs in the outer parts of the Virgo cluster are kinematically supported by rotation, while those in the center are supported by the random motions of their stars (i. e. pressure supported). The rotationally supported dEs have disky isophotes and faint underlying spiral/irregular substructures, they also show younger ages than those pressure supported, which have boxy isophotes and are smooth and regular, without any substructure. We compare the position of these dEs with massive early-type galaxies in the Faber-Jackson and Fundamental Plane relations, and we find that, {{although there is no}} difference between the position of rotationally and pressure supported dEs, both deviate from the relations of massive early-type galaxies in the direction of dwarf spheroidal systems (dSphs). We have used their offset with respect to the Fundamental Plane of E/S 0 galaxies to estimate their dark matter fraction. All the properties studied in this work agree with a ram pressure stripping scenario, where late-type galaxies infall into the cluster, their interaction with the intergalactic <b>medium</b> <b>blows</b> away their gas and, as a result, they are quenched in a small amount of time. However, those dEs {{in the center of the}} cluster seem to have been fully transformed leaving no trace of their possible spiral origin, thus, if that is the case, they must have experienced a more violent mechanism in combination with ram pressure stripping.
