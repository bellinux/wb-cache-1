6000|$|... "Moths, this morning? What a very learned {{person you}} will become." [...] Her {{voice was a}} little flat, yet tender; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in the sulks, and made no answer.|$|E
60|$|Naturally {{the poor}} chap's face dropped, for {{this seemed to}} dish the whole thing. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> under the {{influence}} of the girl's melting gaze, and I saw that this was where I started in as a knight-errant.|$|E
60|$|BURGE [with {{challenging}} audacity] Try. Lubin can go if he likes; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> {{open to new}} ideas, if only I {{can find}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{hands are}} empty because your young men {{thought we were}} tired, and they have {{lightened}} us of our load. They <b>were</b> mistaken; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> old, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so you see, sir," [...] said <b>I,</b> [...] "there <b>is</b> {{something}} to be said upon my side; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> waiting your opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I haven't," [...] said Olive. [...] "But I suppose I {{might as}} well. I {{did try to}} make him have a good time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a little {{provoked}} and felt that I would like {{him to go back}} to my uncle and tell him that he had enjoyed himself. But now I suppose I must consider all the eligibles." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{far from}} satisfied. [...] "In the example which you read to me," [...] said I, [...] "the reasoner drew his {{conclusions}} from {{the actions of}} the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{tonight it}} jarred on {{me more than}} usual, because I was feeling pretty dashed fed with Jeeves. Over that matter of the mess jacket, I mean. True, I had forced him to climb down, quelling him, as described, with the quiet {{strength}} of my personality, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a trifle shirty at his having brought the thing up at all. It {{seemed to me that}} what Jeeves wanted was the iron hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} that I need mind leaving behind. <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> as you see, more {{comfortable}} here than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at Brussels; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> forced {{to keep my}} concealment. In five minutes we shall be ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They set me free," [...] he muttered, [...] "because one {{of their}} {{witnesses}} failed. They had no case; they wouldn't bring me up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> under surveillance. The sergeant as good as told me that they'd have me before long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Percy said; [...] "I <b>am</b> fairly well, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> shaky. <b>I</b> {{have not}} quite got over that swim; and the surgeon said, without my {{applying}} for it, that I must have prolonged rest so, {{at the end}} of the month, he extended it for two months longer.|$|R
60|$|It was a rainy Sunday, in {{the gloomy}} month of November. I had been detained, {{in the course}} of a journey, by a slight indisposition, from which I was recovering; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> feverish, and was obliged to keep within doors all day, in an inn of the small town of Derby. A wet Sunday in a country inn!--whoever has had the luck to {{experience}} one can alone judge of my situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{surprised}}, I repeat, then, at the remark. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{more surprised}} when, looking round me in bewilderment, my hat and umbrella in hand, I saw the lean lady with the woollen shawl leaning upright {{against the door}} out of which I {{was just about to}} make my exit. She was still knitting, and I supposed that this erect posture against the door was only an eccentricity of spinsterhood and an oblivion of my intended departure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must explain first," [...] said McFarlane, [...] "that I {{knew nothing}} of Mr. Jonas Oldacre. His name was {{familiar}} to me, for many years ago my parents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart. I was very much surprised therefore, when yesterday, about {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon, he walked into my office in the city. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> more astonished when he told me the object of his visit. He had in his hand several sheets of a notebook, covered with scribbled writing--here they are--and he laid them on my table.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{apologies to}} master Silvio on this occasion; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> puzzled {{to know why}} he is so keen against that mummy. Is he the same toward the other mummies in the house? There <b>are,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, a lot of them. I saw three in the hall as I came in." ...|$|R
60|$|APOLLODORUS (at {{his post}} behind Cleopatra's seat). Caesar, {{what you say}} has an Olympian ring in it: it must be right; for it <b>is</b> fine art. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> {{on the side of}} Cleopatra. If we must die, she shall not want the devotion of a man's heart nor the {{strength}} of a man's arm.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{retired from}} all my {{official}} roles, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> very active. <b>I</b> have close relationships at the UN. I don't have any {{role at the}} UN, but I'm still quite cooperative {{with a number of}} UN activities, in particular to China and that region. I don't have any government responsibilities or formal role. <b>I</b> continue to <b>be</b> active, though.|$|R
60|$|After his {{departure}} I {{had the feeling}} that a great loss, a great calamity, had befallen me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> smarting at his too candid criticism, all the more because in my heart I acknowledged its truth. And that night, lying awake, I repented of the cruel retort I had made, and resolved to ask his forgiveness and leave it to him to determine the question of our future relations. But he was beforehand with me, and with the morning came a letter begging my forgiveness and asking me to go that evening to dine with him.|$|E
60|$|As I {{was looking}} out of window that same evening, it {{surprised}} me, and made me rather uneasy, to see Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep walk past, arm in arm: Uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him, and Mr. Micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to Uriah. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> more surprised, when I went to the little hotel next day at the appointed dinner-hour, which was four o'clock, to find, from what Mr. Micawber said, that he had gone home with Uriah, and had drunk brandy-and-water at Mrs. Heep's.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seemed like}} a great tomb, with its {{thousands}} of wilting roses," [...] she said. [...] "Until joined by others, I {{was filled with a}} horrible depression. I felt as if something miserable was about to happen. The flowers really looked no worse than I had expected, for the gorgeous band was still effective; but its first, perfect freshness was gone, its roses were dying, and I was alone at their death. Of course," [...] she continued, [...] "I felt better when we covered the withered places with fresh roses, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> restless and foolishly apprehensive." ...|$|E
60|$|August 18.--Again I fell a half page behind, being summoned out {{too early}} for my task, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> two leaves before on the whole week. It is natural to see as much {{of these young people}} as I can. Walter talks of the Ionian Islands. It is an awful distance. A long walk in very warm weather. Music in the evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isabel, {{a thought}} of benefit to Delly has just entered me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> {{uncertain}} how best {{it may be}} acted on. Resolved <b>I</b> <b>am</b> though to succor her. Do thou still hold her here yet awhile, by thy sweet petitionings, till my further plans are more matured. Now run on with thy story, and so divert me from the pacing;--her every step steps in my soul." ...|$|R
40|$|I’ve made {{plenty of}} {{mistakes}} {{in two decades}} of broadcast journalism <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> surprised {{at a couple of}} blunders made at the BBC recently. First, they broadcast library pictures of the 2004 Asian tsunami in a report about the 2008 Burmese cylcone. Then they used pictures of Hitler dolls in a piece to illustrate the rise of neo-nazism in Ukraine. Unfortunately the film was actually of dolls made in Taiwan...|$|R
60|$|The {{rain had}} {{somewhat}} washed the upper parts of me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> bogged {{as high as}} to the knees; I streamed water; I was so weary I could hardly limp, and my face was like a ghost's. I stood certainly more {{in need of a}} change of raiment and a bed to lie on than of all the benefits in Christianity. For all which (being persuaded the chief point for me was to make myself immediately public) I set the door open, entered that church with the dirty Duncan at my tails, and, finding a vacant place hard by, sat down.|$|E
60|$|There was {{so little}} cover that a rat could hardly cross without being seen. Of course, {{it would be}} easy enough to slip through at night, as I had done with the English at Torres Vedras, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> far from the {{mountain}} and I could not in that case reach it in time to light the midnight beacon. I lay in my ditch and I made a thousand plans, each more dangerous than the last. And then suddenly I had that flash of light which comes to the brave man who refuses to despair.|$|E
60|$|I had {{intended}} paying a special visit to Miss Milly Hart {{on my own}} account; but either by accident or design--at the time I was not sure which--de Cartienne always seemed to frustrate my plans. Even to myself I would not acknowledge that I had any other motive save pure curiosity; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> determined by some means or other to see {{a photograph of the}} missing Mr. Hart. The strange disappearance of the one in the sitting-room at the inn--it had never been found--puzzled me, and whenever I caught myself thinking of the incident, it was always in connection with Leonard de Cartienne. It seemed very absurd, when I considered the matter calmly, but nevertheless I could not escape from it. It haunted me, as ideas sometimes will.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that you}} tell me," [...] he remarked coldly, [...] "might equally {{well have been}} said in London! I {{do not wish to}} seem inhospitable, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> waiting to know why you have taken an eight hours' journey to recite a few fairly obvious truths. Your {{relations}} with your husband, frankly, do not interest me. The deductions which society may have drawn concerning our friendship need scarcely trouble you, under the circumstances." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “I {{would like}} to do {{something}} more directly related with my proper job (...) <b>But</b> yes <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very happy, mostly because I can take care of my daughter which is very, very important for me. That’s my priority. That <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> living here in the UK. I can go back to Spain whenever I want. My job is waiting for me there (...) <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> here because my daughter needs a dad and a mum, so that's why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> living here.” (Interview # 25) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned away}} her head, {{and he went}} nearer her. [...] "There was always {{something}} of the mother in your love, Grizel; but for that you would never have borne with me so long. A mother, they say, can never quite forget her boy--oh, Grizel, <b>is</b> it true? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the prodigal come back. Grizel, beloved, I have sinned and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unworthy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> your boy, and I have come back. Am <b>I</b> to <b>be</b> sent away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Going to that man, {{after she}} had {{repelled}} his advances, in my presence! Going to the enemy against whom she had warned me, after I had first been persuaded to leave her! Angry thoughts these--and surely thoughts unworthy of me? If {{it had been the}} case of another man I should have said he was jealous. Jealous of the miller's daughter--in my position? Absurd! contemptible! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in such a vile temper that I determined to let Cristel know she had been discovered. Taking one of my visiting cards, I wrote on it: [...] "I came back for my stick, and saw you go to him." [...] After I had pinned this spiteful little message to the door, so that she might see it when she returned, I suffered a disappointment. I was not half so well satisfied with myself as I had anticipated.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{years and}} years I tended cattle in the great plains by the Euphrates. My master died, and his son grew old, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> as far from death as ever. At last I escaped upon a swift camel, and made {{my way back to}} Egypt. The Hyksos had settled in the land which they had conquered, and their own King ruled over the country Abaris had been torn down, the city had been burned, and of the great Temple there was nothing left save an {{unsightly}} mound. Everywhere the tombs had been rifled and the monuments destroyed. Of my Atma's grave no sign was left. It was buried in the sands of the desert, and the palm-trees which marked the spot had long disappeared. The papers of Parmes and the remains of the Temple of Thoth were either destroyed or scattered far and wide over the deserts of Syria. All search after them was vain.|$|E
60|$|Only {{one point}} became {{perfectly}} clear to me, namely, that Moses is {{not responsible for}} nine-tenths of the Pentateuch; certainly not for the legends which had been made the bugbears of science. In fact, the fence {{turned out to be}} a mere heap of dry sticks and brushwood, and one might walk through it with impunity: the which I did. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> young, when I thus ventured to assert my liberty; and young people are apt to be filled with a kind of sæva indignatio, when they discover the wide discrepancies between things as they seem and things as they are. It hurts their vanity to feel that they have prepared themselves for a mighty struggle to climb over, or break their way through, a rampart, which turns out, on close approach, to be a mere heap of ruins; venerable, indeed, and archæologically interesting, but of no other moment. And some fragment of the superfluous energy accumulated is apt to find vent in strong language.|$|E
40|$|Stuart Sherman, 70 Morningside Drive, New York, New York, USA, letter, 1924 October 29, to Hamlin Garland.

6000|$|... "Livelier, <b>I</b> grant you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> {{speaking}} of the form, and not of the spirit. The evening reception, which is gradually fading away, as a separate rite, with its supper and its dance, we now have as the English have it, {{for the people who}} have not been asked to dinner. The ball, which brings us round to breakfast again, is again the ball of our Anglo-Saxon kin beyond the seas.
