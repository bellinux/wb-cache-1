500|$|McCall {{was picked}} for England and Scotland under-21 sides {{on the same}} day in 1984, and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against Turkey. However he was only picked as a {{substitute}} and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on. He later told Scottish newspaper Glasgow Herald, [...] "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. I was put on the bench and they tried to bring me on with a minute to go. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> my time re-tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that." [...] Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England. McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against France in 1990.|$|E

He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and [...] "realized [...] had become a story {{that took place in}} an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened". He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, [...] "There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no idea what the summer of 2002 was going to be like. ... In the original post-9/11 draft, London felt more like London is feeling right now. Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> that out, because as it got closer to the time, it wasn't actually happening." ...|$|E

After one incident where the drummer had disappeared {{for two or three}} days, Corgan [...] "put the hammer down", according to Vig, and had Chamberlin perform the drum part for [...] "Cherub Rock" [...] until his hands bled. Due to Corgan's urging, Chamberlin checked into a rehab clinic. Corgan told Spin later that year, [...] "You know, I gave them {{a year and a half}} to prepare for this record... I'm surrounded by these people who I care about very much, yet they continue to keep failing me." [...] Corgan explained that he began to take the actions of others personally; he said, [...] "If you really think about it, of course, someone doesn't do the job because they're lazy, or they don't think it's important. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> it as, 'You're not worth going home and working on the song.'" ...|$|E

I {{have a moral}} position against the death penalty. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> an oath of office to uphold it. Following an oath of office is also a moral obligation." [...] During his time in office he commuted one death sentence in June 2008, that of Percy Levar Walton to life imprisonment without parole on grounds of mental incompetence, writing that [...] "one cannot reasonably conclude that Walton is {{fully aware of the}} punishment he is about to suffer and why he is to suffer it" [...] and thus executing him would be unconstitutional. Kaine vetoed a number of bills to expand the death sentence to more crimes, saying: [...] "I do not believe that further expansion of the death penalty is necessary to protect human life or provide for public safety needs."

[...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E
