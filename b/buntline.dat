25|$|In 1869, the twenty-three year-old Cody met Ned <b>Buntline,</b> {{who later}} {{published}} a story based on Cody's adventures (largely invented by the writer) in Street and Smith's New York Weekly and then published {{a highly successful}} novel, Buffalo Bill, King of the Bordermen, which was first serialized {{on the front page}} of the Chicago Tribune, beginning that December 15. Many other sequels followed by <b>Buntline,</b> Prentiss Ingraham and others from the 1870s through the early part of the twentieth century. Cody later became world-famous for Buffalo Bill's Wild West, a touring show which traveled around the United States, Great Britain and Europe. Audiences were enthusiastic about seeing a piece of the American West. Emilio Salgari, a noted Italian writer of adventure stories, met Buffalo Bill when he came to Italy and saw his show; Salgari later featured Cody as a hero in some of his novels.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{attributed}} {{the gun to}} Wyatt Earp, but modern researchers have not found any supporting evidence from secondary sources or in available primary documentation of the gun's existence prior to the publication of Lake's book. After its publication, various Colt revolvers with long (10-inch or 16-inch) barrels were called Colt Buntlines or <b>Buntline</b> Specials. Colt manufactured the pistol among its second-generation revolvers produced after 1956. A number of other manufacturers, such as Uberti, Navy Arms, and Cimarron Arms, have made their own versions of this long-barreled revolver.|$|E
50|$|Some sails, in {{addition}} to clewlines and <b>buntlines,</b> have leechlines to pull the edges into the centre when they are stowed (see picture). However, these can be treated exactly like <b>buntlines,</b> and it is generally not possible to identify a leechline from the deck.|$|R

500|$|In his book, Lake {{wrote about}} the Colt <b>Buntline</b> Special, a variant of long-barreled Colt Single Action Army revolver. According to Lake's biography, dime novelist Ned <b>Buntline</b> had five <b>Buntline</b> Specials commissioned. Lake {{described}} them as extra-long Colt Single Action Army revolvers with [...] barrels. <b>Buntline</b> {{was supposed to have}} presented them to lawmen in thanks for their help with contributing [...] "local color" [...] to his western yarns. According to Lake, the pistol was equipped with a detachable metal shoulder stock. Lake wrote that Earp and four other well-known western lawmen—Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett and Neal Brown—each received a <b>Buntline</b> Special. However, neither Tilghman nor Brown were lawmen then.|$|E

5000|$|Clewlines and <b>buntlines</b> are lines used {{to handle}} the sails of a square rigged ship.Although the common {{perception}} of a traditionally rigged ship is that the sails are handled from [...] "up in the rigging", {{the majority of the}} work is actually carried out from the deck. In particular, when sailors go aloft to stow the square sails by bundling them up and tying them to the yard (with gaskets) they don't have to pull the whole weight of the sail up towards them. That work has already been carried out from the deck using the clewlines and the <b>buntlines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Colt {{manufactured}} Third Generation <b>Buntlines</b> and New Frontiers {{through the}} Colt Custom Shop, {{as well as}} many engraved pistols. In 2010, Colt released a [...] "revival" [...] of the Frontier Six Shooter with a nickel finish.|$|R
60|$|I looked aloft. The skysails {{were already}} furled; men were furling the royals; and the topgallant-yards were running down while clewlines and <b>buntlines</b> bagged the canvas. Yet, if anything, our northerly breeze fanned even more gently.|$|R
2500|$|The Colt <b>Buntline</b> Special is a long-barreled {{variant of}} the Colt Single Action Army revolver, which Stuart N. Lake {{described}} in his best-selling but largely fictionalized 1931 biography, [...] According to Lake, the dime novelist Ned <b>Buntline</b> commissioned the production of five <b>Buntline</b> Specials. Lake described them as extra-long Colt Single Action Army revolvers, with a 12-inch (300mm)-long barrel, and stated that <b>Buntline</b> presented them to five lawmen in thanks for their help in contributing local color to his western yarns.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, Colt resumed {{manufacture}} of the Single Action Army {{and made a}} <b>Buntline</b> version, due to customer demand. [...] The barrels are marked {{on the left side}} [...] "COLT <b>BUNTLINE</b> SPECIAL [...]45". [...] A few third-generation Buntlines were manufactured in the late 1970s, as well. Colt manufactured 70 New Frontier <b>Buntline</b> Specials from 1962 to 1967 with 12-inch barrels and folding target sights, chambered in [...]45 Colt.|$|E
2500|$|Lake {{wrote that}} dime novelist Edward Zane Carroll Judson, Sr., writing under the {{pseudonym}} [...] of Ned <b>Buntline,</b> commissioned the guns in repayment for [...] "material {{for hundreds of}} frontier yarns." [...] Yet <b>Buntline,</b> in fact, only wrote four western yarns, all about Buffalo Bill and none that mentioned Earp. According to descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins, he owned a Colt [...]45-caliber and a Winchester lever-action shotgun.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buntlines,</b> spaced {{every few}} feet {{along the front}} of a sail, run from a point on the mast above the yard to the foot (bottom edge) of the sail and serve to raise the foot up for {{shortening}} sail or for furling.|$|R
50|$|In 1845, his Cincinnati venture, Western Literary Journal and Monthly Magazine, {{was facing}} bankruptcy, and he fled from Ohio.

5000|$|... #Caption: The leechlines {{are clearly}} visible running inwards and upwards from {{the edges of}} the sail. The <b>buntlines</b> up the front of the sail can be seen too, but their run to the blocks on the shrouds is {{obscured}} because the sail is set on a lifting yard.|$|R

2500|$|From 1961 to 1975, Colt {{offered an}} adjustable-sight model known as [...] "The New Frontier", capitalizing on President John F. Kennedy's {{campaign}} slogan. [...] Colt manufactured 4200 of these revolvers, including 70 {{built on the}} <b>Buntline</b> frame.|$|E
2500|$|Cimarron Firearms {{offers a}} version called the Wyatt Earp <b>Buntline</b> styled after {{the one used}} by Kurt Russell in the 1993 movie [...] "Tombstone" [...] with a 10-inch barrel and a silver badge inlaid on the right grip panel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buntlines</b> {{are small}} lines {{fastened}} {{to the bottom of}} the sails, in the middle part of the bolt rope, to the cringle; and so are passed through a small block, seized to the yard. Their use is to trice up the bunt of the sail, to better furl it up.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buntline's</b> novels {{may have}} had {{unintended}} consequences. Some avid readers became thrilled with the exploits of western outlaws and to them, the novels glamorized crime. The female bandits Little Britches and Cattle Annie, for instance, read dime novels which allegedly aroused their interest in the Doolin gang and may have propelled them into a youthful life of crime.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} in that fore-course, Mr. Talcott," [...] I said, [...] "or we shall lose something. I see the ship ahead is under bare-poles, and it were better we were as snug. If I did not dislike losing such a wind, it would be wiser to heave-to the ship; man the <b>buntlines</b> and clew-garnets, at once, and wait for a {{favourable}} moment." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lake {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a revolver that would be more precise and could be easily modified to work similarly to a rifle. According to Lake, the Colt <b>Buntline</b> was a single-action revolver chambered for [...]45 Long Colt cartridge. However, it had a 12-inch-long (305mm) barrel, in comparison to the Colt Peacemaker's 7.5-inch (190mm) barrel. A 16-inch (406mm) barrel was available, as well. According to Lake, it had a removable stock that could be easily affixed through a combination of screws and lead-ins. This accessory gave the revolver better precision and range, Lake claimed, and allowed the user to fire it like a rifle. The Colt <b>Buntline</b> was further popularized by The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp television series.|$|E
2500|$|The 1873 <b>Buntline</b> Target is an Italian 6-shot single-action {{revolver}} chambered for the [...]357 Magnum or the [...]45 Colt cartridges, {{manufactured by}} A. Uberti, Srl. The revolver has an 18-inch barrel with no muzzle brake or ports. It {{comes with a}} walnut grip and a dark blue finish.|$|E
2500|$|The Navy Arms Frontier <b>Buntline</b> Model is a 6-shot single-action {{revolver}} chambered for the [...]357 Magnum or the [...]45 Colt cartridges, manufactured for Navy Arms. The revolver has a 16.5-inch barrel with no {{muzzle brake}} or ports. It {{comes with a}} walnut grip and a detachable shoulder stock.|$|E
5000|$|The yard {{exists to}} allow square sails {{to be set}} to drive the ship. The top edge of the sail is 'bent on' (attached) to the yard semi-permanently. Clewlines and <b>buntlines</b> are led along the yard {{and from there to}} the mast and down to the deck. These allow the bottom of the sail to be hoisted up to the yard, so the sail is {{effectively}} folded in two. In this state the sail is said to be [...] "in its gear", that is ready for setting or stowing. To set the sail the clewlines and <b>buntlines</b> are let go, and the sheets (attached to the bottom corners - clews - of the sail) are adjusted to shape the sail to best catch the wind. A device called a [...] "tye", a [...] "tye chain", or a [...] "tye rope" [...] is used for lifting a given yard to the top of its travel to set the sail.|$|R
60|$|There is a stout rail on deck, at {{the base}} of each mast, where a number of braces, lifts, and <b>buntlines</b> are belayed to the pins. It is the sole duty of the mast-man to see that these ropes are always kept clear, to {{preserve}} his premises in a state of the greatest attainable neatness, and every Sunday morning to dispose his ropes in neat Flemish coils.|$|R
50|$|Supporting - Halyards {{raise and}} lower the yards. Brails run from the leech to the spar to {{facilitate}} furling. <b>Buntlines</b> serve to raise the foot up for shortening sail or for furling. Lifts adjust the tilt of a yard, to raise or lower the ends off the horizontal. Leechlines run to the leech (outer vertical edges) of a sail and serve to pull the leech both in and up when furling.|$|R
2500|$|The {{revolver}} {{could have}} been specially ordered from the Colt factory in Hartford, Connecticut, as extra-long barrels were available from Colt at a dollar an inch over [...] Several such revolvers with 16-inch barrels and detachable stocks were displayed at the 1876 Centennial Exposition, but these were marketed as [...] "Buggy rifles". There are no company records for the <b>Buntline</b> Special, nor a record of any orders from or sent to Ned <b>Buntline.</b> This does not absolutely preclude the historicity of the revolvers, however. Massad Ayoob writing for Guns Magazine cited notes by Josie Earp in which she mentioned an extra-long revolver as a favorite of Wyatt Earp. He cited an order by Tombstone, Arizona, bartender Buckskin Frank Leslie for a revolver of near-identical description. This order predated the O.K. Corral fight by several months.|$|E
2500|$|These Second Generation Colt Single Action Army revolvers were {{produced}} from 1956 to 1974 and carried serial {{numbers in the}} range of 0001SA to 73,205SA. [...] Due to the popularity of the television show, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Colt introduced the aforementioned <b>Buntline</b> Special as a Second generation offering from 1957 to 1974.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1872, Cody {{traveled}} to Chicago {{to make his}} stage debut with his friend Texas Jack Omohundro in The Scouts of the Prairie, {{one of the original}} Wild West shows produced by Ned <b>Buntline.</b> The effort was panned by critics - one critic compared Cody's acting to a [...] "diffident schoolboy" [...] - but the handsome performer was a hit with the sold-out crowds.|$|E
50|$|Cattle Annie and Little Britches is a 1981 American Western drama film {{starring}} Burt Lancaster, Rod Steiger, Diane Lane, and Amanda Plummer, {{based on}} the lives of two adolescent girls in the late 19th century Oklahoma Territory who became infatuated with the Western outlaws that they had read about in Ned <b>Buntline's</b> stories and left their homes to join the criminals. It was scripted by David Eyre and Robert Ward from Robert Ward's book and directed by Lamont Johnson.|$|R
50|$|Because the clewlines, and {{especially}} the <b>buntlines,</b> do not pass through the axis on which the yard pivots, their effective length will change as the yard is rotated round the mast from one tack to the other. When the sail is set, the lines can be left with plenty of slack to allow for this; if the sail is currently in its gear (see yardarm) then it might be necessary to tend the lines as the yards are braced round.|$|R
50|$|Cody {{at first}} was a {{reluctant}} actor but came to enjoy the spotlight. Scouts of the Prairie opened in Chicago in December 1872 and starred Cody. It was panned by critics but was a success nonetheless. It was performed to packed theaters across the country for years. Cody served as a scout for the Army in the summer; when campaigning stopped for the winter, he would head to the stage. <b>Buntline's</b> play served as training for Cody's later Wild West show.|$|R
