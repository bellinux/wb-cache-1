Cold-hard-ening includes the elevation of the supercooling point, the temperature at which body water spontaneously freezes, and the accumulation of the low-molecular-mass cryoprotectants, glycerol, sorbitol and trehalose. Although it is generally believed that freezing survival is only possible if the ice lattice is restricted to the extracellular space, the larval fat <b>body</b> <b>cells</b> survive intracellular ice formation.

2500|$|The pollen grains are {{dispersed}} by {{the wind}} to the female, [...] ovulate cone that {{is made up of}} many overlapping scales (sporophylls, and thus megasporophylls), each protecting two ovules, each of which consists of a megasporangium [...] (the nucellus) wrapped in [...] two layers of tissue, the integument and the cupule, that were derived from highly modified branches of ancestral gymnosperms. [...] When a pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through the micropyle ( [...] a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) [...] often by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop. The pollen enters a [...] pollen chamber close to the nucellus, and there [...] it may wait for a year before it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the wall of the megasporangium (=nucellus) where fertilisation takes place. During this time, the megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid cells, three of which degenerate. The surviving one develops as a megaspore and divides repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. [...] Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the <b>body</b> <b>cell</b> of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte inside. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of the sperm cells enters the egg cell in the megagametophyte’s archegonium.|$|E
