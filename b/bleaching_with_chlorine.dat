40|$|Chlorine {{bleaching}} {{is still}} practiced {{by most of}} nonwood pulp and paper mills, resulting in {{a considerable amount of}} polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) formation and emission. In this study, the effects of primary chlorination conditions on the formation of PCDD/Fs from nonwood pulp <b>bleaching</b> <b>with</b> elemental <b>chlorine</b> were investigated. It was found that low-chlorinated PCDD/Fs were usually formed and then underwent further chlorination to form highly chlorinated PCDD/Fs with increasing chlorination time. Higher available chlorine dosages and lower system pH values greatly accelerated dioxin formation, and pH 3 was the threshold for the formation of tetra- to octa-CDD/Fs. Higher temperatures promoted the formation of lower-chlorinated PCDD/Fs, while caused significant reduction of tetra- to hepta-CDDs and penta- to octa-OCDFs. PCDFs were formed much faster than PCDDs. A first-order kinetic model showed a good fit to the data for tetra- to oct-CDFs formation under different chlorination conditions, indicating that chlorine substitution was the rate determining step for their formation. Finally, the optimum chlorination conditions for minimizing and eliminating the formation of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD/TCDF in nonwood pulp <b>bleaching</b> <b>with</b> elemental <b>chlorine</b> were established...|$|R

Summary Elemental Chlorine-Free (ECF) pulp, <b>bleached</b> <b>with</b> <b>chlorine</b> dioxide, continues {{to dominate the}} world bleached chemical pulp market. In 2000, {{the first year of}} the new millennium, ECF production will be 53. 1 million tonnes, totaling more than two-thirds of the world market share. The transition to ECF is nearing completion. Market data show an ever-widening gap between ECF and TCF (Totally Chlorine-Free) production. ECF continues to grow at an annual rate of 10 % per year, with an additional 5 million tonnes entering the market in 2000. TCF remained steady at 6 - 7 % of world bleached chemical pulp production, with small net increase of 0. 1 million tonnes of production in 2000. Government organizations increasingly recognize and document ECF's proven pollution prevention record and acknowledge ECF as a component of Best Available Technology (BAT). Producers and users alike continue to desire ECF's superior product quality. With such strong government support and ECF's overall environmental integrity, its growth will continue...|$|R

30|$|Chloroform formation, balance, and {{discharge}} {{were estimated}} in a kraft pulp mill that used an elemental chlorine-free (ECF) <b>bleaching</b> line <b>with</b> <b>chlorine</b> dioxide {{as well as}} an effluent treatment process. This was achieved by collecting and analyzing discharge water and air samples that contained measurable levels of chloroform. Chloroform formation in ECF bleaching of hardwood oxygen-delignified kraft pulp (LOKP) was estimated to be 2.07 – 5.34 [*]g/pulp air-dried ton (adt), and approximately 30 % of the chloroform produced was discharged to bleaching effluents. Chloroform in the effluents was not decomposed by activated sludge, and more than 97 % was emitted to the air by volatilization. It is suggested that chloroform formation in Japanese LOKP bleaching mills can be decreased to 16 – 42 [*]t/year with a production of 8 million adt pulp by introducing ECF bleaching into all mills. This is a considerable fall from the chloroform discharge from ECF and chlorine bleaching mills in Japan that was estimated to be approximately 1000 [*]t for the 1999 fiscal year.|$|R

We investigate the distribution of PCDD/Fs in different papermaking processes and dioxin emissions at six typical Chinese non wood pulp and paper mills. Raw materials for papermaking included reed, wheat straw, bamboo, and sugar cane bagasse. The formation and emission of PCDD/Fs varied strikingly according to bleaching processes and raw materials. Elemental chlorine bleaching promoted the formation of tetra- to octa-CDDs and 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF, while hypochlorite bleaching only {{gave rise to a}} significant increase of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF. <b>Bleaching</b> <b>with</b> elemental <b>chlorine</b> and hypochlorite increased 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF 0. 9 - 42. 5 and 0. 3 - 4. 1 times, respectively.

40|$|Eucalyptus globulus {{wood chips}} were decayed by the lignin-degrading fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora as a {{pretreatment}} step before kraft pulping. Weight and component losses of wood after the biotreatment were the following: weight (5 %), glucans (1. 5 %), xylans (4. 3 %), lignin (5. 7 %) and extractives (57. 5 %). The residual amount of lignin (expressed by the kappa number) in pulps from biotreated wood chips {{was lower than}} that of pulps from the undecayed control. Depending on the delignification degree, kraft biopulps presented similar or up to 4 % increase in pulp yield and 20 % less hexenuronic acids (HexA) than control pulps. The extended delignification with O 2 decreases approximately 50 % of the kappa number of the pulps and increases brightness, but had no effect in HexA reduction. The <b>bleaching</b> steps <b>with</b> <b>chlorine</b> dioxide (D 0 ED 1 sequence) decreased the kappa number up to 97 %, increased pulp brightness up to 84 % ISO and decreased HexA amount up to 91 %. The use of C. subvermispora in biopulping of E. globulus generated important benefits during the production of kraft pulps that are reflected in a high pulp yield, low residual lignin content, low HexA amount, high brightness and viscosity of the biopulps as compared with pulps produced from untreated wood chips. </p...|$|R
40|$|Consumption of {{chemicals}} during ECF bleaching of kraft pulp correlates reasonably well with kappa number, which measures with KMnO 4 {{the total amount}} of oxidizable material in the pulp. However, the method does not distinguish between the oxidizable material in residual lignin and other structures susceptible to oxidation, such as hexenuronic acids (HexAs), extractives and carbonyl groups in the pulp. In this study an attempt is made to separate the main contributors to the kappa number in oxygen - delignified eucalyptus Kraft pulps and evaluate how these fractions behave during ECF bleaching using chlorine dioxide as the sole oxidant (DEDD sequence). Residual lignin and HexAs proved to be the main fractions contributing to the kappa number and chlorine dioxide consumption in ECF <b>bleaching.</b> Pulp bleachability <b>with</b> <b>chlorine</b> dioxide increases <b>with</b> increasing HexAs content of the pulp but chlorine dioxide per se does not react with HexAs. Reduction of pulp with sodium borohydride under conditions for removing carbonyl groups has no impact on bleachability. No correlation was found between the pulp of the extractive content and pulp bleachability. The removal of HexAs prior to ECF bleaching significantly decreases the formation of chlorinated organics in the pulp (OX) and filtrates (AOX) as well as of oxalic acids in the filtrates...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of great}} {{environmental}} pressures, the cellulose industry {{has studied the}} potential of use of new bleaching agents among which peroxymonosulfuric acid and peracetic acid stand out. This survey summarizes the results of various laboratory investigations using peracids to delignify eucalyptus kraft pulps. The effect of a step using peroxymonosulfuric acid followed by a D-Eo-D sequence [free of elemental chlorine] was studied and compared {{with the use of}} peracetic acid and mixtures of these two acids. It was shown that a mixture of peroxymonosulfuric acid and peracetic acid reduced more lignin (measured as kappa index) than the individual peracids, and reduced more hexenuronic acid than peracetic acid with less degradation of the cellulose than with peroxymonosulfuric acid. This was explained {{on the basis of the}} electrophilic and nucleophilic properties of these acids that improved the delignification of eucalyptus kraft pulp. The effluents generated in these steps involving the peracids had greater color, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total phenols correlating with the amount of lignin removed and the analyses of bioassays did not show acute toxicity from effluents coming from a peroxymonosulfuric acid step.

40|$|The modern pulp {{industry}} has endeavoured to maximize its efficiency and minimize its environmental impact for decades. The bleaching process {{has a major}} impact on the heat, power and chemical consumption of the pulp mill, and hence bleaching constitutes an at-tractive process to be optimized in order to increase the performance of the mill further. Catalytic bleaching is a novel discovery which could decrease the duration of the bleaching processes. So far the catalytic bleaching has been demonstrated to work successfully only in the HcatZP sequence. For this reason, the goal of this thesis was to clarify if new kraft pulp <b>bleaching</b> sequences <b>with</b> initial <b>chlorine</b> dioxide (D) stage and an intermediate Hcat stage could provide fully bleached pulps. In order to design the new catalytic sequences, a literature review was elaborated on diffrerences between softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, the basics of pulp bleaching, the reactions of lignin and carbohydrates during bleaching processes and the ideal operational parameters in these processes. The eucalyptus pulp bleaching sequences studied included D 0 EHcatP which achieved a final brightness of 88. 0 % ISO and HcatZ/DP which attained a brightness of 89. 2 % ISO. Addi-tionally, a reference trial AEOPDP was performed to check the bleachability of the pulp. This sequence achieved a brightness of 88. 0 % ISO, which suggested that the pulp used was quite hard to bleach.
