5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and responsiveness to the environment, and this might <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> alert, clouded, drowsy, or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient {{where he or she}} is (for example what building, town and state) and what time it is (time, day, date).|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|Cacti whose stems {{are even}} smaller may <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> {{globular}} (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti. Globular cacti may be solitary, such as Ferocactus latispinus, or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds. All or some stems in a cluster may {{share a common}} root.|$|E

5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a set that is closed under subtraction.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|Nethicite, {{another type}} of magicite, works by {{absorbing}} Mist, thus nullifying the effects of magic and storing vast amounts of power. Nethicite can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or man-made). During {{the course of the}} game, it is discovered that deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, and that the ultimate source of known pieces of deifacted nethicite is the Sun-Cryst they created. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice.|$|E
50|$|Lepiota cristata has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> {{having a}} strong, {{distinctive}} and unpleasant odour—it has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> rubbery, fishy, pungent, foul, fungusy, fruity, mealy and sweet. Despite this, L. cristata has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having a mild and pleasant taste.|$|R

5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> an {{incomplete}} gut; the gastrovascular cavity {{functions as a}} stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E
5|$|The American economy, however, {{does not}} require a labor force {{consisting}} solely of professionals. Instead it requires a greatly diverse and specialized labor force. Thus the majority of Americans complete assigned tasks with considerably less autonomy and creative freedom than professionals, leading to theory that they may better <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> being members of the working class.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes {{less and less}} accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E

5|$|The {{house today}} appears an {{assemblage}} of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air could <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed in a heavy neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise naked power can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism {{on the part of some}} crowd eventually produces conquest by means of naked power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms naked power into traditional power. Finally, once a traditional power has taken hold, it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of naked power.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

5|$|We incline to {{the view}} that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a Royal Highness. In other words, no {{reasonable}} objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
