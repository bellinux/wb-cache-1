For Shuttle landing {{criteria and}} site selection determination, the Shuttle’s in-flight weather support, including landing forecasts, {{was provided by}} the National Weather Service’s Spaceflight Meteorology Group (SMG) at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Texas, in joint with the 45th Weather Squadron. The 45th’s area of operation encompasses over [...] of air, land, and sea that make up NASA's and the USAF's east coast flight range. The 45 WS provided data and decision criteria when a Shuttle was ferried back to KSC from Edwards Air Force Base, California. This is where the Orbiter was mated on top of a modified Boeing 747, known as the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, for the return flight to KSC.

50|$|A {{junctional}} escape beat is {{a delayed}} heartbeat originating {{not from the}} atrium but from an ectopic focus somewhere in the AV junction.

50|$|Data {{centers are}} also used for off <b>site</b> <b>backups.</b> Companies may {{subscribe}} to backup services provided by a data center.

However, tapes stored on site pose a security threat and are also susceptible to fire and flooding. Larger companies may also send their <b>backups</b> off <b>site</b> for added security. This can be done by backing up to a data center. Encrypted backups can be sent over the Internet to another data center where they can be stored securely.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} antenna {{was built}} primarily for Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia, Inc.) as a <b>backup</b> transmitter <b>site</b> for its four FM stations. It was replaced between 2002 and 2003 with a 300 ft mast to broadcast {{television and radio}} signals as a <b>backup</b> transmission <b>site.</b> This was done so that work could be completed to transfer those that were displaced by {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center to the Empire State Building, without disruption to the existing FM tenants at the Empire State Building. The mast has three tiers: one for VHF, one for UHF, and one for FM. Currently, eight FM stations use the <b>site</b> as a <b>backup,</b> and three—WBGO, WKCR-FM, WNYE, plus the booster, WFMU-1—use it as a primary site. Three TV stations are using the mast for auxiliary use, and one for primary. The antenna systems and mast were constructed by Dielectric Communications of Raymond, Maine, Shively Labs of Bridgton, Maine, and Electronics Research Inc., of Chandler, Indiana.|$|R
