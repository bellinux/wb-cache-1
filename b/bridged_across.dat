25|$|Despite being {{cleared to}} race, Scarponi {{did not start}} his season {{until the very end}} of February, {{finishing}} ninth at the Gran Premio Città di Camaiore. He had two placings inside the top ten at Paris–Nice, before moving on to the Volta a Catalunya. Scarponi had been fifth going into the final stage in Barcelona, but he <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> a 20-second gap to reach three race leaders. There, he remained and ultimately finished the stage in fourth position; a 21-second gap to the peloton enabled him to move up two places into third overall, passing Nairo Quintana and Bradley Wiggins. After contesting the Giro del Trentino, Scarponi continued his warmup to the Giro d'Italia with his fourth top-ten finish at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, finishing in fifth place after missing in a sprint with Alejandro Valverde and Carlos Betancur.|$|E
500|$|Marcus Burghardt (...) led the peloton on {{the first}} part of the climb, until he was {{attacked}} by Geraint Thomas (...) , who was followed by Zdeněk Štybar (...) [...] After a brief period, Peter Sagan (...) <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> to Thomas and Štybar; the three riders then caught and dropped Devenyns. The gap between the leading three and the peloton quickly reached 25 seconds, then was reduced to 15 seconds by BMC.|$|E
500|$|Following Puccio's crash, Rowe, Thomas and Swift had a gap {{ahead of}} the peloton. Rowe {{continued}} to drive the three-man group of [...] riders and they caught {{the remainder of the}} original breakaway, with Bono the last to be caught. Several riders <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> to the Sky group, including Štybar and Greg Van Avermaet (...) , while [...] kept up a fast pace in the peloton. As the riders reached the foot of the Cipressa climb, the groups came back together. At this point, Arnaud Démare (...) crashed. On the climb, 's Lars Petter Nordhaug and 's Julian Arredondo set the pace and caused difficulty for several of the sprinters, including Alexander Kristoff (...) , Mark Cavendish (...) and Nacer Bouhanni (...) [...] Cavendish had a mechanical problem during the climb– the same slipped-chain problem that he had suffered in stage 2 of the Tirreno–Adriatico. He had to put in significant effort to stay with the group on the Cipressa, which meant that he was unable to contest the later stages of the race.|$|E

50|$|Historically, Anhui's {{transport}} network was {{hampered by the}} lack of <b>bridges</b> <b>across</b> the Yangtze River, which divides the province into northern and southern regions. The first <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Yangtze in Anhui, the Tongling Yangtze River Bridge was completed in 1995. As of October 2014, Anhui had four <b>bridges</b> <b>across</b> the Yangtze, at Ma'anshan, Wuhu, Tongling, and Anqing.|$|R
500|$|In 2014, Samuel Sánchez (then BMC) had {{attacked}} {{at the foot}} of the Cauberg on behalf of his teammate Philippe Gilbert, whose subsequent attack allowed him to take the race victory. BMC attempted to replicate this strategy with an attack from Ben Hermans in the same place as Sánchez's. Gilbert's attack, however, was less successful than his 2014 effort: although most riders were dropped, Michael Matthews was able to hold his wheel. Michał Kwiatkowski was chasing alone at this point. Valverde <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> to Gilbert and Matthews, with another 15 riders joining the group shortly afterwards. Kwiatkowski was a long way behind with [...] remaining, but was able to stay in the slipstream of the other riders and recover from the climb. He then began a long sprint and was able to keep the rest of the group behind him. Valverde finished second, with Matthews third. Kwiatkowski's win was his first win in the rainbow jersey of the world champion.|$|E
500|$|On {{the climb}} to the finish, Cyril Gautier (...) {{was the first to}} attack, but was soon caught by Nairo Quintana (Movistar), who was in a group with Nicolas Roche (Sky) and Tom Dumoulin (...) [...] After work from his team, Esteban Chaves (...) {{attacked}} and <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> to the leading three riders. Chaves soon dropped Quintana from the group and, despite an attack from Roche in the final , took the stage victory. This was his first ever Grand Tour stage victory and gave him the leader's jersey. Dumoulin was second on the stage with Roche third. Dan Martin (...) was fourth, 14" [...] back, with Joaquim Rodríguez (...) and Quintana a further 12" [...] behind. Chris Froome (Sky) and Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) came in together 30" [...] behind Chaves, with Aru and all the other contenders further behind. As well as taking the overall lead of the race, Chaves also took the lead in the other three classifications (the points classification, the mountains classification and the combination classification).|$|E
500|$|After {{the turn}} in Bastogne, the {{breakaway}} continued. It was, however, reduced in numbers, as Quaade, Chevrier and Vergaerde all fell {{back before the}} peloton reached the Côte de Wanne, four hours into the race. Katusha led the peloton as it approached the climb. On the climb itself, Astana came {{to the front of}} the peloton and led the chase, with the breakaway's lead reduced to under a minute. On the Côte de Stockeu, Andriy Hrivko (Astana), Gorka Izagirre (Movistar) and Simon Yates (...) attacked and joined the lead group; more riders then <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> to form a 21-man group. This included five Astana riders, though not Nibali. On the Côte de la Haute-Levée, several riders attacked again to form a smaller breakaway; these were Tanel Kangert and Michele Scarponi (both Astana), Manuele Boaro (...) , Esteban Chaves (Orica-GreenEDGE) and Julián Arredondo (...) [...] They had a 25-second lead at the summit and, although Boaro and Arredondo were dropped on the Col du Rosier, this increased to more than a minute for a short while. It was reduced to 45 seconds on the Col du Maquisard, however, as Movistar worked hard in the peloton to bring them back.|$|E

500|$|With [...] {{to the end}} of the stage, Tiago Machado (Katusha) {{attacked}} the breakaway. Markel Irizar (Trek Factory Racing) attempted to follow him but suffered a puncture. Although Machado had a lead of 30 seconds at one point, there was a chase from the group behind and his lead fell. Two riders then <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> to Machado. These were Alexis Gougeard (AG2R-La Mondiale) and Leonardo Duque (Colombia). The three-man group built a lead that increased to 50 seconds. Duque was dropped from the group and was caught by Maxime Monfort (Lotto-Soudal) and Natnael Berhane (MTN-Qhubeka), who had also {{attacked the}} breakaway group. On the final categorised climb, with [...] remaining in the stage and an 18-minute lead over the peloton, Machado was dropped by Gougeard, while Berhane was also dropped by the group behind. Monfort caught Machado; they were then joined by Amaël Moinard (BMC) and Andrey Amador (Movistar) to form a four-man group chasing Gougeard. Although they were at times within sight of Gougeard, he was able to stay away and took a solo stage win. On the cobbled section, Nelson Oliveira (Lampre-Merida) caught and passed the chasing group to take second place on the stage, 40" [...] behind Gougeard, with Monfort taking third.|$|E
2500|$|The race {{took place}} in cold, snowy conditions, with low {{visibility}} {{in the early part}} of the race. By the time the breakaway formed, an hour into the day's racing, 's Julien Loubet had already abandoned; he was one of 46 riders not to finish the race. The breakaway was initially composed of seven riders: Paolo Tiralongo (...) , Alessandro De Marchi (BMC), Pavel Brutt (Tinkoff), Nicolas Edet (Cofidis), Jérémy Roy (...) , Thomas De Gendt (Lotto–Soudal) and Cesare Benedetti (...) [...] With [...] completed, 's Vegard Stake Laengen <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> from the peloton to the breakaway; the eight-man group built a lead that reached nine minutes. The peloton was controlled first by Etixx–Quick-Step and then by Movistar and the gap was reduced to four minutes by the Côte de Wanne, with [...] remaining.|$|E
2500|$|After 's Tom Boonen led {{over the}} fourth-category {{precursor}} to the Hasliberg, the lead group thinned yet further, ultimately leaving four riders {{at the head of}} proceedings– [...] rider Wilco Kelderman, Matti Breschel (...) , Martin Elmiger of , and 's Michael Albasini– but the remnants of the peloton were inside a minute of the group. 's pace on the front with Tejay van Garderen and Mathias Frank had reduced the group to around fifteen riders, with yellow jersey wearer Cameron Meyer (...) among those dropped. The groups merged towards the top, where Breschel's team-mate Roman Kreuziger attacked clear, with 's Peter Sagan, Frank and Rui Costa of the [...] <b>bridged</b> <b>across.</b> The four riders remained off the front until the finish, where Sagan out-sprinted the rest for his seventh career victory at the Tour de Suisse. Fourth place for Frank was good enough for him to claim the race leader's yellow jersey; his first race lead at his home Tour.|$|E

50|$|One of {{important}} tasks of the Institute in start was {{the development of}} project of all-welded <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Dnepr river in Kiev - the Paton bridge, executed in cooperation with E.O. Paton Electric Welding Institute. Many pedestrian <b>bridges</b> <b>across</b> rivers were constructed according to the Institute projects: across river Dnieper - in city Kiev, across river Teterev - in city Zhytomir, across river Uzh - in city Korosten, and also suspension piping <b>bridges</b> <b>across</b> rivers Angara and Ural. Project of curvilinear <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Dnepr with lightweight steel roadway was developed during reconstruction of passage on Dnieper hydroelectric station dam.|$|R
50|$|From Olbernhau to Abzweig Neuschönberg {{the tracks}} of the Pockau-Lengefeld-Neuhausen railway were used. From there, the line {{continued}} over a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the river Flöha into Czechoslovakian territory, which it left on a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> Schweinitz river. From there it led uphill on the orographically {{right side of the}} Schweinitz valley until Deutschneudorf. The end of the line, reached after another <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> the Schweinitz, was again situated on Czechoslovakian territory.|$|R
2500|$|Sørensen {{was dropped}} by his three companions not long after, while [...] rider Nairo Quintana tried to {{attack from the}} peloton, but was brought back due to his close nature to both Martin and Rodríguez in the general classification. The lead group swelled to five riders several {{kilometres}} later, as Michele Scarponi of the [...] team– fifth in the general classification overnight– and 's Robert Kišerlovski <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> a 20-second gap to reach the leaders. Martin's team-mates took station {{on the front of}} the peloton, in order to negate any potential gains that Scarponi could have got off the front. Ultimately, Scarponi failed to achieve enough seconds to take the overall victory, but the group of four riders (minus Wellens, who had been dropped) remained clear to the end, where De Gendt beat out López for the stage victory, taking both his– and his team's– first win of 2013. The bunch came across the line 21 seconds later, with Martin positioned in the group to become the first Irish winner of the race in 27 years. Scarponi's advantage enabled him to move up two places into third overall, passing Quintana and 's Bradley Wiggins.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the narrow}} ridge of Mickledore the {{northern}} face of Scafell rises precipitously, an unusually complete barrier to progress along a Lakeland ridge, which frustrates many ridge walkers who {{find that this}} is a cliff for rock climbers only. At the top of the rise from Mickledore is Symonds Knott (3,146ft), the northern top. [...] The wall of crags [...] Scafell Crag to the west and the East Buttress above the Eskdale side of Mickledore [...] has two main weaknesses. Running laterally across Scafell Crag is Lord's Rake, a scree-filled chute with several intermediate cols. [...] It has two upper entrances onto the saddle separating Symonds Knott from the main summit. Formerly passable as a scramble, Lord's Rake suffered from a serious rock fall in 2002 — with subsequent further falls — and recent guidebooks do not consider it a viable route, although it is gradually becoming more stable. The block that was <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> the head of Lord's Rake collapsed into the gully in July 2016, leaving several small unstable blocks behind, which can be avoided with care. [...] The access to West Wall Traverse is clear of debris. The second breach in the crags is Broad Stand, a series of sloping steps which drop down from Symonds Knott almost to Mickledore; however, these steepen immediately above Mickledore and cannot be negotiated safely except by rock-climbers. The main summit stands a little to the south of the saddle, all around being a sea of stones. An easy ridge then steps down southward over Long Green to Slight Side. [...] On the east are Cam Spout Crag and the fine high waterfall after which it is named.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, we had {{now come}} to the bayou, which was in that place very narrow and <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> by a fallen trunk; but on either hand we could see it broaden out, under a cavern of great arms of trees and hanging creepers: sluggish, putrid, of a horrible and sickly stench, floated on by the flat heads of alligators, and its banks alive with scarlet crabs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hup, cut-up ice, mush, hurroo!" [...] {{said that}} fat individual. Fortunately he {{followed}} his advice with a practical illustration of its meaning. Seizing an axe {{he ran to}} the nearest hummock, and, chopping it down, rolled the heaviest pieces he could move into the chasm. The others followed his example, and, in the course of an hour, the place was <b>bridged</b> <b>across,</b> and the sledge passed over. But the dogs required a good deal of coaxing to get them to trust to this rude bridge, which their sagacity taught them was not to be depended on like the works of nature.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the levels}} {{have been driven}} a {{considerable}} distance from the shaft, the air naturally becomes bad from want of circulation. To remedy this evil, holes, or short shafts, called [...] "winzes," [...] are sunk at intervals from the upper to the lower levels. These winzes are dangerous traps for the unwary or careless, extending frequently {{to a depth of}} ten or fifteen fathoms, and being <b>bridged</b> <b>across</b> by one or two loose planks. Ladders are fixed in many of them to facilitate progress through the mine. When a miner drives the end of his level so far that the air will not circulate, a new winze is usually sunk down to him from the level above. The circulation is thus extended, and the levels progress further and further right and left until they occupy miles of ground. The levels and shafts of Botallack, if put together, would extend to not less than forty miles, and the superficial space of ground, on and beneath which the mine lies, is above 260 acres.|$|E
