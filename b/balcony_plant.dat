50|$|Pohjois-Karjalan Lasipalvelu limited {{partnership}} {{was established in}} 1978 at Outokumpu, Finland. In 1981 the company {{changed its name to}} Ikkunanikkarit Inc. and moved operations to Kouvola. During 1989 the company became a Public Limited Company and the innovation of inward-opening balcony glass panes without vertical frames was invented. During that particular year Parvekenikkarit Inc. was founded to conduct sales and installation in western and northern Finland, in addition to the Helsinki area. In the beginning of the nineties production was separated from sales and installation operations. As a result, Lumon Oy was established in 1991. In the course of 1996 the company launched new 21st century balcony glazing system and commenced the production of aluminum balustrades, glass terraces and additional panes for existing windows. At that time Lumon Inc. also inaugurated a new <b>balcony</b> glazing <b>plant.</b> The new plant enabled the company to start its own glass processing line: cutting, grinding, drilling, tempering. Since 2001, the company started to manufacture glass facades and aluminum doors and windows. To clarify corporation's organizational structure the group restructured in January 2005: Parvekenikkarit Oy was divided into Lumon Etelä-Suomi (Southern Finland) and Lumon Länsi-Suomi (Western Finland). Lumon products are manufactured by Lumon Oy. In Finland, the products are sold and installed by Lumon Etelä-Suomi (Southern Finland), Länsi-Suomi (Western Finland) and Itä-Suomi (Eastern Finland). However, {{in the beginning of the}} year 2010 the domestic sales organization was once more clarified and at the moment the sales are conducted by Lumon Suomi Oy (whole Finland).|$|R

A young Japanese man appears {{directly in front of the}} camera. He is accompanied by two small Japanese boys attired in tight knee britches and rather loose sleeved blouses. The three of them exhibit their gymnastic powers by performing back handsprings, back flips, unusual handstands, etc. There are two spectators in Occidental clothing. Nothing shown in the film indicates Japanese surroundings. From a contemporary Edison film company catalog: THE JAPANESE VILLAGE. Unguinoso. [code for telegraphic orders]. One of the most fascinating exhibits on the Midway at the Pan-American Exposition is the Japanese Village. This space occupies about one and one-half acres of ground. It is dotted with pretty miniature lakes, the famous Japanese circle bridges, groves, tea houses, etc. We secured an excellent picture of this village while a troupe of Japanese acrobats were performing. The acrobats themselves are in the foreground of the picture and form the principle feature. The entire length of the film is replete with difficult acrobatic tricks, performed by one of the most skilled troupes in the world. Class B 150 ft. $ 18. 00 Copyright: Thomas A.

40|$|The horticultural crops {{considered}} {{in this chapter}} are characterised {{by the fact that}} the plants are grown in a restricted volume, like pots, containers, plastic trays or compressed peat blocks. In the market these crops are recognized as potted plants, bedding plants and container grown nursery stock, mostly for ornamental purposes. Another group is the raising of young vegetable and cut flower plants, due to production holdings. Although extremely diverse, all these plants are grown as single units and this makes the water supply of the plants complicated. Trickle irrigation is generally unsuitable because it is laborious, due to rapid changing crops and plant densities and besides expensive because of the large number of units per area. Exceptions are the plants grown in large containers, like <b>balcony</b> and patio <b>plants,</b> some nursery stock and subtropical trees with a long growing period and a low plant density. Overhead sprinklers induce excessive losses of irrigation water and nutrients, since a considerable amount of the irrigated water falls alongside the pots or drips from the leaf canopy mostly also alongside the pots. Moreover, the water supplied is absorbed per individual plant or plant batch, which strongly enhances the variation in the water and nutrient status of such units. To avoid these problems, potted plants already have been grown for many years on concrete floors or on container benches with sub-irrigation. Nowadays, in all modern greenhouses this is the common growing system. In contrast with vegetable and cut flower nurseries, potted plant nurseries are not always specialised in one crop, but in different plant species. Even if they are specialised in one plant type, different plant stages are present at the same time, like with Kalanchoë and Chrysanthemum...|$|R

Namen raziskave je bil določiti vsebnosti nekaterih esencialnih mikrohranil in neesencialnih kovin v rastnih substratih. Za kislinski razklop vzorcev v mikrovalovni pečici smo uporabili mešanico HNO 3, HCl in HF. Koncentracije Fe, Zn in Mn smo izmerili s plamensko atomsko absorpcijsko spektrometrijo (FAAS) in koncentracije Cu, Cr, Cd ter Pb z elektrotermično atomsko absorpcijsko spektrometrijo (ETAAS). Vsebnosti Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr, Cd in Pb so bile 0, 10 - 2, 51 % na suho snov (SS), 14, 1 - 213 mg/kg SS, 11, 5 - 715 mg/kg SS, 3, 99 - 61, 4 mg/kg SS, 2, 87 - 341 mg/kg SS, 0, 100 - 1, 142 mg/kg SS in 4, 73 - 46, 2 mg/kg SS.

Under the influence of a remark of Prosper Profond, she had begun to exchange her Empire for Expressionistic furniture. There were the most amusing arrangements, with violet, green, and orange blobs and scriggles, to be had at Mealard's. Another month and the change would have been complete. Just now, the very [...] "intriguing" [...] recruits she had enlisted did not march too well with the old guard. It was as if her regiment were half in khaki, half in scarlet and bearskins. But her strong and comfortable character made the best of it in a drawing-room which typified, perhaps, more perfectly than she imagined, the semi-bolshevised imperialism of her country. After all, this was a day of merger, and you couldn't have too much of it! Her eyes travelled indulgently among her guests. Soames had gripped the back of a buhl chair; young Mont was behind that [...] "awfully amusing" [...] screen, which no one as yet had been able to explain to her. The ninth baronet had shied violently at a round scarlet table, inlaid tinder glass with blue Australian butterflies' wings, and was clinging to her Louis-Quinze cabinet; Francie Forsyte had seized the new mantel-board, finely carved with little purple grotesques on an ebony ground; George, over by the old spinet, was holding a little sky-blue book as if about to enter bets; Prosper Profond was twiddling the knob of the open door, black with peacock-blue panels; and Annette's hands, close by, were grasping her own waist; two Muskhams clung to the <b>balcony</b> among the <b>plants,</b> as if feeling ill; Lady Mont, thin and brave-looking, had taken up her long-handled glasses and was gazing at the central light shade, of ivory and orange dashed with deep magenta, as if the heavens had opened. Everybody, in fact, seemed holding on to something. Only Fleur, still in her bridal dress, was detached from all support, flinging her words and glances to left and right.|$|R
