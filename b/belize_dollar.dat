2500|$|The name {{chosen for}} the new capital, Belmopan, {{is derived from the}} union of two words: [...] "Belize", the name of the longest river in the country, and [...] "Mopan", one of the rivers in this area, which empties into the Belize River. The initial {{estimated}} cost for building this new city was 40 million <b>Belize</b> <b>dollars</b> (US$20 million).

50|$|Eventually, the {{war ended}} and the workers {{returned}} to Belize to unemployment and poverty. On December 31, 1949, there was a devaluation of the <b>Belize</b> <b>dollar</b> which caused {{the situation of the}} workers to worsen. During these economic times, the working class suffered from unemployment, low wages, bad housing, severe malnutrition, and poor health care.|$|E

5000|$|British Honduras, renamed Belize in 1973, was {{the first}} British colony in the Caribbean area to replace {{sterling}} currency with a US dollar-based currency. That occurred in 1885 {{as a result of}} the fact that the dollar of neighbouring Guatemala had driven the sterling coinage out of circulation. The authorities wanted to return to the gold standard, and the choice of the US dollar was influenced by growing trade links with New Orleans in the USA. (See the main article entitled the <b>Belize</b> <b>dollar.)</b> ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, work began; {{the first}} phase of the new city was {{completed}} in 1970 at a cost of 24 million <b>Belize</b> <b>dollars</b> (US$12 million). From 1970 to 2000 the administration of Belmopan was managed by the Reconstruction and Development Corporation, known as [...] "Recondev." [...] Recondev was vested with the power and authority to provide, or cause to be provided, the municipal functions necessary for the smooth running of the city's business and infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|On this date, a Saturday, the Governor devalued the <b>Belize</b> <b>dollar</b> after {{previously}} insisting {{he would}} not do so. An ad hoc committee, the People's Committee (PC), was formed in January 1950 and began {{to speak out against}} this unwelcome act in particular and colonialism in general. Such members as Price and Smith in street corner meetings and Goldson and Richardson behind the printing press of the sympathetic daily the Belize Billboard, pressed the issue and sought the support of the Belizean people. A wave of anti-British and anti-colonial sentiment struck British Honduras (or Belize as the PC called it for the first time) that had never before been seen, not even in the 1930s at the height of Belize's Labour Movement. The PC found that almost overnight it had become the salvation of the people.|$|E
