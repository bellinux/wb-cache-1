5|$|Before {{radioactive}} sources can {{be delivered}} to the tumour site, the applicators have to <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> and correctly positioned {{in line with the}} initial planning.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{dates back}} to 1901 (shortly after the {{discovery}} of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896) when Pierre Curie suggested to Henri-Alexandre Danlos that a radioactive source could <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> into a tumour.|$|E
30|$|Implants that <b>were</b> <b>inserted</b> {{immediately}} and a matched control group of implants that <b>were</b> <b>inserted</b> after a healing period {{of at least}} 3  months after tooth extraction (non-immediate implants).|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{the first}} <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> into the medial {{side of the}} second toe; the other three <b>are</b> <b>inserted</b> into the lateral sides of the second, third, and fourth toes.|$|R
30|$|Having {{established}} a pneumoperitoneum with a Veress cannula inserted through the umbilicus, a four-port laparoscopy is performed. A 5 – 12 -mm port <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> through the umbilicus and a 5 -mm port <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> suprapubically. Two lateral 5 – 12  mm ports <b>are</b> <b>inserted</b> midway {{between the first}} two ports and lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels visualised laparoscopically.|$|R
5|$|They should <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> using sterile {{technique}} in hospital however non-{{sterile technique}} {{may be appropriate}} in those who self catheterize. The urinary catheter set up should also be kept sealed. Evidence does not support {{a significant decrease in}} risk when silver-alloy catheters are used.|$|E
5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire designed to <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> into the endotracheal tube {{to make the}} tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{effectiveness and}} safety in adolescents {{and those who}} have and have not previously had children. IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> immediately after delivery. They may also be used immediately after an abortion. Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.|$|E
30|$|If LON {{is being}} used, only the lower locking screws of the IM nail <b>are</b> <b>inserted,</b> {{but if a}} {{motorized}} IM nail is being used, upper and lower locking screws <b>are</b> <b>inserted.</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 83 {{implants}} <b>were</b> <b>inserted,</b> of which 30 implants <b>were</b> <b>inserted</b> in a one-stage procedure and 53 in a two-stage procedure. No implant {{had to be}} removed during the observation period.|$|R
50|$|Slimbucker pickups - Ritter Slimbuckers are humbucking {{single coil}} pickups. Like Masterbars, the Bridge Pickup <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> {{at an angle}} of 3° and the Neck Pickup <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> at an angle of 7°.|$|R
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with urgent needle decompression. This {{may be required}} before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can <b>be</b> <b>inserted.</b> If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
30|$|To observe flow, we {{classified}} 40 {{upper limb}} flows (20 patients) in three groups, limbs in which LRC <b>were</b> <b>inserted</b> (FlowLRC), limbs in which short radial catheters (SRC) <b>were</b> <b>inserted</b> (FlowSRC), and limbs without any catheter inserted (FlowNOCATH).|$|R
50|$|To {{load the}} gun, the vent-piece was raised, the shell <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> through the hollow screw and rammed home into the bore, and the powder {{cartridge}} <b>was</b> likewise <b>inserted</b> through the screw into the chamber. The vent-piece was lowered, the screw was tightened, a tube <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> {{in the top}} of the vent-piece, and the gun was fired.|$|R
30|$|Within this equation, all {{parameters}} which {{increase the}} release agent transfer with an enlarged value (time and pressure) <b>are</b> <b>inserted</b> in the numerator, while the parameters which decrease the release agent transfer with higher value <b>are</b> <b>inserted</b> in the denominator.|$|R
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 2017 Yoshiki's {{management}} {{announced that}} the drummer would undergo urgent surgery on May 16, where an artificial disc would <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> between his vertebrae. Due to his health conditions, {{it was reported that}} concerts would need to be either rescheduled or cancelled. On June 9, X Japan announced at a press conference that the concerts would not be postponed but instead performed in an acoustic set, with Yoshiki at the piano, as it is uncertain whether {{he would be able to}} play the drums in the future.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E

50|$|In 2017, Fonoflo Records {{released}} a liquid filled record, for Tennessee Jet's Reata, featuring double-concentric liquids, {{being the first}} of its kind. In an outer chamber on the record, Old Crow whiskey <b>was</b> <b>inserted,</b> while Coca-Cola <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> to an inner ring.|$|R
5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> into the cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected {{in the next}} cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution {{features}} two hidden modes; 'Drift Contest', where {{points are}} earned {{according to how}} well spins are performed on certain corners, and 'Pretty Racer' (also known as 'Buggy mode'), in which the cars size appears with deformed body sizes, similar to Choro-Q cars, {{which led to the}} arcade game Pocket Racer. Mirrored tracks that function identically to the original game are accessible. Like the first game, a music CD can <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> and listened to instead of the soundtrack. Unlike the first game, only the last course played is loaded into the PlayStation's memory; to switch, the game disc needs to be reinserted before loading.|$|E
5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} should be looking in any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E
30|$|In our institution, the laparoscopic distal {{gastrectomy}} {{was performed}} using five trocars. The first 12 -mm trocar <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> transumbilically, 12 - and 5 -mm trocars <b>were</b> <b>inserted</b> above {{and to the}} right side of the umbilicus, and the other two 12 -mm trocars <b>were</b> <b>inserted</b> above and to the left side of the umbilicus. Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum was maintained at 10  mmHg, and lymph node dissection was carried out using an ultrasonically activated device through the four operative trocars.|$|R
50|$|A 200 mg pessary <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> {{into the}} vagina at bedtime for 3 nights or a 600 mg pessary <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> once only at bedtime. Fenticonazole nitrate is also applied topically as a 2% cream or {{solution}} {{for the treatment of}} fungal skin infections.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of solid objects have been {{reported}} to have <b>been</b> <b>inserted</b> into the urethra, including batteries, safety pins, straws, and telephone wires. Liquefied objects have also <b>been</b> <b>inserted</b> into the urethra, such as an injection of cocaine (which, arguably, had harmful results).|$|R
5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although he could not see any Viet Cong positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due to the impact of the Viet Cong's firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire because they knew the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can <b>be</b> <b>inserted</b> by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may <b>be</b> <b>inserted.</b> The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

40|$|An i vivo {{test for}} the {{estimation}} of blood compatibility of pliable sutures coated with the test polymer was developed. An 18 gauge needle <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> into the peripheral vein of a dog under general anesthesia and a polymer-coated suture <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> through the needle into the lumen of the vessel. After a given period of time the vein in which the suture had <b>been</b> <b>inserted</b> <b>was</b> opened and observations were carried out by light microscopy, and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. This method has several advantages; {{it is a simple}} procedure, there is minimal surgical intervention, and vessel injury is negligible...|$|R
30|$|WT mice (n = 3) were anesthetized with {{isoflurane}} (1.5 %) and cannulated with a polyethylene catheter (60 cm, PE 10), {{filled with}} heparinised saline (0.9 %).
