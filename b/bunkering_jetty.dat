In 2004 changes led to Portland Harbour Authority Ltd becoming the Statutory and Competent Harbour Authority and Portland Port Ltd the Port Operator.

The wharf and its 600 m-long {{approach}} jetty has been in operation since 1977 and its cast-insitu reinforced concrete beams were spalling due to rebar corrosion. A design/build operate contract to repair the concrete and install a remotely monitored cathodic protection (CP) system was let in 1999, and protection of the wharf head concrete was completed in 2000. The contract was extended and cathodic protection of the approach jetty beams was completed in February 2003. This paper discusses what is the largest concrete CP system installed in New Zealand to date, with over 3000 square metres of chloride contaminated concrete now protected from further corrosion damage...|$|E
