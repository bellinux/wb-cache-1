5|$|It has a {{low rate}} of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers {{developing}} into follicles, {{and more than half}} of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates are similarly low. More than half of a plant's seed crop may <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by granivorous birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.|$|E
5|$|Pat Seerey {{was born}} in Wilburton, Oklahoma in 1923 to James and Marie Seerey. His family moved to Little Rock, Arkansas {{when he was a}} child, and he played {{baseball}} for the Little Rock Boys' Club at Lamar Porter Field. He attended Little Rock Catholic High School, where he played baseball and American football, serving as the team's starting fullback. After graduating from high school in 1941, he was signed by the Cleveland Indians. Shortly afterwards, he was classified as 4-F, meaning he would not <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the military during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium {{is far more}} common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains {{a special relationship}} with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E

5|$|Following William Beebe's {{death in}} 1962, his {{research}} station at Simla remained in operation under Jocelyn Crane's management, {{under the new}} name of the William Beebe Tropical Research Station. However, because Jocelyn's research required her to travel north for extended periods, by 1965 she had little time to keep the station running. By 1971, the station had fallen into disuse and was declared closed. Meanwhile, as Asa Wright's health began to fail in her old age, her friends began to fear that after her death her neighboring estate of Spring Hill might <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> developers, and established a trust to buy the estate and convert it into the Asa Wright nature center. In 1974, Beebe's property was donated to the newly established Asa Wright Nature Center.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1945, U-2336 left Larvik {{and headed}} out into the North Sea. On 7 May 1945, U-2336 sank the last Allied {{merchant}} ships to <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> a German submarine in the war, when she torpedoed and sank the freighters Avondale Park and Sneland I (in order) off the Isle of May inside the Firth of Forth. The first of the two ships to be sunk was the Sneland I, which exploded {{as soon as it}} was hit killing seven of her crew members, including the captain. Avondale Park was hit next, alarming the 28 man crew who believed that they had struck a mine. Avondale Park sank two minutes after being hit. Two crew members had been killed while the rest managed to enter a lifeboat or jump into the sea. U-2336 later returned to Kiel on 14 May 1945 and then transferred to Wilhelmshaven, Germany, where she was surrendered to the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{was opposed}} to the {{traditional}} practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts, preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who, as Taft put it, would recognize an American when they saw one. High on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France, Henry White, whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe. White's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> politics. Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London, Whitelaw Reid, but Reid, owner of the New-York Tribune, had backed Taft during the campaign, and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports. Reid remained in place until his 1912 death.|$|E

5|$|The 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion and the 1st SS Panzer Division were {{committed}} to its defence. The 4th Armoured Brigade reached the summit, but in the evening were counter-attacked by remnants of the 1st and 12th SS Panzer Divisions. The British offensive resumed the following day {{with the support of}} antitank regiments from the Second Army; these had heavy losses in a counter-attack by the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Hill 112 was briefly taken by a battalion of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, only to <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> further German counter-attacks in the late afternoon. By the evening of 11 July, with both sides exhausted and having suffered heavily the offensive had reached a stalemate. The 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division and its supporting armour had sustained two thousand casualties in the two days of fighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{process was}} {{repeated}} for Cunard's North Atlantic shipping interests. They applied and were {{accepted into the}} Atlantic Container Line in December 1966, joining with the founding companies Wallenius Lines, Swedish American Line, Swedish Transatlantic Line and Holland America Line. Cunard joined {{at the same time}} as Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (French Line). Cunard inherited planning work and ship designs when they joined with Atlantic Container Line group, and as part of their application to join, Cunard would build two ships for the ACL fleet, the SS Atlantic Causeway and the SS Atlantic Conveyor. The SS Atlantic Conveyor would, in 1982, become the first British merchant ship to <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> enemy action since World War II, after being requisitioned for use in the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, {{it is likely that}} there were other {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's {{that he was able to}} ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him when he took the throne.|$|E

5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The next day, England resumed {{hoping for}} more of what {{happened}} on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number of balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E

25|$|When a {{radio wave}} reaches the ionosphere, the {{electric}} {{field in the}} wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the radio-frequency energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> recombination or will re-radiate the original wave energy. Total refraction can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere {{is less than the}} radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.|$|E
25|$|According {{to the law}} of {{conservation}} of energy, no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> <b>to</b> the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.|$|E
