50|$|A further {{enhancement}} to {{the rail}} profile produced the 113A section, which was the universal standard until about 1998; detail improvements to the sleepers and <b>ballast</b> <b>profile</b> completed the picture and the general form of the track had stabilised. This format is now in place over 99% of the first-class main lines in Britain, although the CEN60 (60 kg/m) rail section {{was introduced in the}} UK during the 1990s. This has a wider rail foot and is taller than the 113A section so is incompatible with standard sleepers.|$|E
30|$|The {{case study}} {{is based on the}} Trafikverket {{database}} Optram (optimised track management system). These data collected with a measurement vehicle, operated by a contractor, were used to observe more than 30 parameters of the track condition. The parameters are measured up to six times per year. The measurement depends {{on the nature of the}} section, such as curves or stations, and its relation to GPS positioning and kilometre markers on the track. The resulting data on track quality are divided into five classes, depending on the load and the speed [11, 12]. Optram data consist of track geometry measurements, overhead wire measurements, real profile measurements, corrugation measurements, <b>ballast</b> <b>profile</b> measurements, ground penetrating radar, and stiffness measurements. These data are used in planning the maintenance strategy. The data have been chosen for the lines section BDL 111 and BDL 119 between 2007 and 2014.|$|E
40|$|By nature, ballast {{interacts with}} railway {{concrete}} sleepers {{in order to}} provide bearing support to track system. Most train-track dynamic models do not consider the degradation of ballast over time. In fact, the ballast degradation causes differential settlement and impact forces acting on partial and unsupported tracks. Furthermore, localised ballast breakages underneath railseat increase the likelihood of centrebound cracks in concrete sleepers due to the unbalanced support under sleepers. This paper presents a dynamic finite element model of a standard-gauge concrete sleeper in a track system, taking into account the tensionless nature of ballast support. The finite element model was calibrated using static and dynamic responses in the past. In this paper, the effects of centre-bound ballast support on the impact behaviours of sleepers are highlighted. In addition, it is the first to demonstrate the dynamic effects of sleeper length on the dynamic design deficiency in concrete sleepers. The outcome of this study will benefit the rail maintenance criteria of track resurfacing in order to restore <b>ballast</b> <b>profile</b> and appropriate sleeper/ballast interaction...|$|E
5000|$|A {{spreader}} {{is a type}} {{of maintenance}} equipment designed to spread or shape <b>ballast</b> <b>profiles.</b> The spreader spreads gravel along the railroad ties. The various ploughs, wings and blades of specific spreaders allow them to remove snow, build banks, clean and dig ditches, evenly distribute gravel, as well as trim embankments of brush {{along the side of the}} track. [...] The operation of the wings was once performed by compressed air, and later hydraulics. [...] Besides the MoW-operation spreaders are also used in open cast mines to clean the tracks from overburden tipped from dump cars.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{procedure is}} {{developed in the}} present paper, allowing the prediction of the <b>ballasted</b> track <b>profile</b> degradation under railway traffic loading. In this procedure, an integration of the short-term and long-term mechanical processes of track deterioration is taken into account, using a track degradation model. This degradation model is incorporated into a finite element code where two modes of calculation are implemented: the ‘‘implicit mode’’ concerns the short-term track deterioration, in which the hypoplastic model {{is used for the}} ballast layer and the dynamic response to an instantaneous train axle passage is obtained to serve as input data for the ‘‘explicit mode’’, which concerns the simulation of long-term track deterioration, using the accumulation model for ballast layer. The whole procedure is illustrated on the prediction of the <b>ballasted</b> track <b>profile</b> degradation of a track section of 100 m. The results show a significant influence of the type of track geometry defects and the vehicle velocity on the evolution of track deterioration and the capability of the proposed procedure in reproducing the track profile degradation...|$|R
40|$|The main work {{presented}} {{within this}} thesis is a numerical {{investigation of the}} effects of crosswind yaw angles upon the aerodynamic characteristics of a high-speed passenger train. The applicability of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approaches to the simulation of external flow around a passenger train were investigated. Results showed the Delayed DES (DDES) approach produced the highest correlation to experimental results. Ballast heights of 0 m, 0. 3 m and 0. 75 m were simulated and compared to existing experimental results. Comparisons between cases found that a vortex from the train’s underbody follows the <b>ballast</b> <b>profile.</b> Crosswind simulations were conducted at yaw angles of 0 o, 5 o, 10 o and 15 o. The results obtained showed the formation of a large vortex upon the leeward side at yaw angles of 10 o and above, this caused a region of low pressure which increased the overturning forces acting upon the train. Generally, crosswinds increased pressures upon the windward side of the train and decreased them upon the leeward side. Slipstream velocities on the windward side were seen to decrease whilst leeward side velocities increased. Results were compared to regulations currently in place for the operation and testing of trains. This enabled comments and suggestions to be made upon existing regulations...|$|E
