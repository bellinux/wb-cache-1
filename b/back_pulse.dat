To meet the environmental particulate emission requirements and improve thermal efficiency, ceramic filters are utilized to cleanup the hot gas particulate to protect downstream heat exchanger and gas turbine components from fouling and corrosion.

40|$|Hot gas {{particulate}} filtration is a {{basic component}} in advanced power generation systems such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC). These systems require effective particulate removal to protect the downstream gas turbine and also to meet environmental emission requirements. The ceramic barrier filter {{is one of the}} options for hot gas filtration. Hot gases flow through ceramic candle filters leaving ash deposited on the outer surface of the filter. A process known as surface regeneration removes the deposited ash periodically by using a high pressure <b>back</b> <b>pulse</b> cleaning jet. After this cleaning process has been done there may be some residual ash on the filter surface. This residual ash may grow and this may lead to mechanical failure of the filter. A High Temperature Test Facility (HTTF) was built to investigate the ash characteristics during surface regeneration at high temperatures. The system is capable of conducting surface regeneration tests of a single candle filter at temperatures up to 1500 F. Details of the HTTF apparatus as well as some preliminary test results are presented in this paper. In order to obtain sequential digital images of ash particle distribution during the surface regeneration process, a high resolution, high speed image acquisition system was integrated into the HTTF system. The regeneration pressure and the transient pressure difference between the inside of the candle filter and the chamber during regeneration were measured using a high speed PC data acquisition system.

However, many of these technologies require a barrier filtration system capable of removing particulate material from the coal-derived fuel- or flue-gas to protect the gas turbine from damage. Ceramic candle filters are generally accepted as the most suitable technology. Continued satisfactory operation of ceramic candle filter units is dependent on satisfactory removal, through periodic <b>back</b> <b>pulsing,</b> of the filter cake that builds up during operation.

40|$|Ceramic barrier {{filtration}} is {{a leading}} technology employed in hot gas filtration. Hot gases loaded with ash particle flow through the ceramic candle filters and deposit ash on their outer surface.

The cleaning done by this technique still leaves some residual ash on the filter surface, which {{over a period of}} time sinters, forms a solid cake and leads to mechanical failure of the candle filter. A room temperature testing facility (RTTF) was built to gain more insight into the surface regeneration process before testing commenced at high temperature. RTTF was instrumented to obtain pressure histories during the surface regeneration process and a high-resolution high-speed imaging system was integrated in order to obtain pictures of the surface regeneration process. The objective of this research has been to utilize the RTTF to study the surface regeneration process at the convenience of room temperature conditions.

The pressure histories in the chamber and filter system during build-up and regeneration were then analyzed.

40|$|The panel {{bed filter}} (PBF) is a {{granular}} filter patented by A. M. Squires {{in the late}} sixties. PBFs consist of louvers with stationary, granular beds. Dust is deposited in the top layers and on the bed surface when gas flows through. PBFs are resistant to high temperatures, variations in the gas flow and hot particles. The filter is cleaned by releasing a pressure pulse {{in the opposite direction}} of the bulk flow (a puff <b>back</b> <b>pulse).</b> A new louver geometry patented by A. M. Squires is the filter tray louvers. The new design is believed to reduce the pressure drop and the number of louvers, and to make the filter more compact. We have designed and built a laboratory scale PBF with filter tray louvers based on the patent. Experiments with the prototype show that the new louver can be cleaned with a puff <b>back</b> <b>pulse.</b> A PBF system for a hypothetical biomass combustion plant has been designed. The heat from the flue gas will be used for district heating. The proposed PBF system design consists of double-sided modules with 46 filter tray louvers on top of each other. Five modules are mounted together in module columns, sharing the same clean gas duct and puff back pipe. The granular medium chosen is Sintered Bauxite 20 / 40 (SB). The module columns are placed in an enveloping house. SB and dust fall into bins {{in the bottom of the}} enveloping house during puff back cleaning. A vacuum pneumatic conveying system brings the dust and SB to the top of the filter. Dust and SB are separated in a sieve. Dust is deposited, and SB is transported back to the modules. NTNU is currently involved in the BioSOFC project. The objective of this project is to increase efficiency in energy production from biomass by using producer gas from a biomass gasification plant in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell. Field tests will be performed at a plant in Güssing, Austria. A PBF will be used for gas filtration. The operating temperature will be 500 °C to avoid tar condensation.

40|$|Separation of {{suspensions}} can {{be carried}} out by microfiltration and microfluidic techniques, although both rely on different principles. Conventional microfiltration involves retention of particles by a porous membrane, but is limited by (irreversible) particle accumulation and concentration polarization that can only be (partially) controlled by <b>back</b> <b>pulsing</b> that transfers particles back into the bulk. Microfluidic separation devices employ a combination of inertial forces and sometimes geometric constraints to control particle migration behaviour, which allows splitting of suspensions into concentrated and diluted streams. Considering their effectiveness, inertia-based microfluidic separation is regarded an interesting alternative to microfiltration; therefore, this paper focusses on the use of inertial forces in suspension separation. This resulted in the selection of three concepts, which were: (1) fluid skimming, which is a combination of microfiltration and controlled particle migration behaviour, (2) spiral inertial microchannel separation, in which particles migrate fast towards an equilibrium position, and (3) sparse deterministic ratchets, which use geometric interactions to induce particle migration. In a concluding section, the application of controlled migration behaviour in relation to scalability of inertia-based microfluidic separation techniques and the effect of suspension properties on separation are discussed in detail...|$|R

A parametric study was performed to characterize the controlling parameters dominating the absorption process of hydrogen sulfide by waste iron oxide as a sorbent alternative within a stringent environment with the use of simulated KRW reducing gas.

Few metal oxides were evaluated {{to be the}} sorbent candidate for hot gas desulfurization process. The use of waste iron oxide as a disposable metal oxide sorbent will alleviate the constraints imposed on iron oxides including the degradation of sulfur capacity and its physical attrition required for a regenerable sorbent. The very low cost of waste iron oxides {{and the elimination of}} the investment associated with sorbent regeneration make it attractive to replace currently developed sorbent candidates. However, the use of waste iron oxides indicates a significant increase of dust loading for particulate filtration. The slower the reaction rate the iron oxide and coal ash mixture is, the longer residence time and higher iron oxide to coal ratio are required.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} amount of effort has been devoted to develop damage-tolerant hot gas filter elements, which can withstand chemical, high pressure and extreme thermal cyclic loading in the coal-based environment (Alvin 1999, Spain and Starrett 1999). Ceramic candle filters have proven to be an effective filter for the ash laden gas streams, protecting the gas turbine components from exposure to particulate matter (Lippert et al. 1994). Ceramic candle filters need to sustain extreme thermal environment and vibration-induced stresses over a great period of time. Destructive tests have been used to describe physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the filters and to relate these properties and behaviors to in-service performance, and ultimately to predict the useful life of the filter materials (Pontius and Starrett 1994, Alvin et al. 1994). Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques have been developed to determine the deterioration or the presence of damage and to estimate the remaining stiffness of ceramic candle filters (Chen and Kiriakidis 2001). This paper presents a study of parameters involved in the prediction of remaining life of ceramic candle filters under service conditions. About one hundred ceramic candle filters from previous studies (Chen and Kiriakidis 2000) and forty-six filters received during this project have been nondestructively evaluated. They are divided in Pall Vitropore, Schumacher and Coors filters. Forty-six of these filters were used having various in-service exposure times at the PSDF and the rest were unused filters. Dynamic characterization tests were employed to investigate the material properties of ceramic candle filters. The vibration frequency changes due to exposure hours, dust cake accumulation, candle's axisymmetry, boundary conditions and elevated temperatures are studied. Investigations on fatigue stresses of the filters due to vibration of the plenum and <b>back</b> <b>pulse</b> shaking are also studied. Finite element models (FEM) are built to calculate the filter's dynamic response with different boundary conditions at various temperatures.

The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate characteristics of the history and physicalexamination of patients diagnosed with aortic dissection in the emergency department (ED) and to highlight differences from signs and symptoms defined as `classical`. Materials and Methods: Computer records were quried for patients admitted to the ED and eventually diagnosed with AD in a fifty-four month period. Demographic variables, chief complaints, pain characteristics, risk factors for AD, vital signs, findings on examination, laboratory results including ECG, cardiac markers, chest X-ray, and computed tomography (CT) were obtained retrospectively from ED charts and recorded on data sheets. Stanford classification of the AD and how the diagnosis was established were also noted. Results: Forty seven cases (32 males (68, 1 %); 15 females (31. 9 %) mean age 66; range 25 to 87 years) were identified. Pain was described by 38 patients (80. 9 %). The most common presenting complaints were back pain (40, 7 %, n= 19), chest pain (36, 2 %, n= 17), abdominal pain (25, 5 %, n= 12), syncope (19, 1 %, n= 9), and shortness of breath (17 %, n= 8). Pulse deficit was recorded in 12 (25, 5 %), discrepancy in blood pressure readings between left and right arms in eight (17 %, n= 8), cardiac murmur in 40, 4 % (n= 19), altered mental status in 14, 9 % (n= 7) and neurologic deficit in 12, 8 % (n= 6) patients. Tearing chest pain was recorded in only 8 patients (21, 1 %). Contrast-enhanced CT was the diagnostic modality in 42 (89, 4 %) cases and 31 patients (65 %) had a widened mediastinnum recorded in ED the interpretation of the chest X-ray. Thirty-two (68, 1 %) patients were diagnosed to have AD with Stanford A classification, while the remaining 15 (31, 9 %) had Stanford B AD.
