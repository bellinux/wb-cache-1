5|$|According to Jain texts, {{the fruits}} of himsā (violence) depends upon the {{severity}} of passions {{at the time of}} commencement of such an act. One may <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sinful act of himsā without actually causing injury; the other, while having caused injury, may not <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> act. Also, when two persons commit the act of himsā jointly, its consequences on fruition (of karma), may be grave for one person and mild for the other.|$|E

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years.

5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E

5|$|The active atmospheres and {{closeness}} of these stars {{means that they}} are among the brightest x-ray sources in the sky.

5|$|Venom in {{snakes and}} some lizards {{is a form}} of saliva that has been {{modified}} into venom over its evolutionary history.

5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E

5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is the most prevalent and along with β-amanitin is likely to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, {{as it is the}} first organ encountered after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible to the toxins.|$|E
5|$|Aroma {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate from the blue Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 28 June, a battle group of the 1st SS Panzer Division, Kampfgruppe Frey, arrived at the front and was placed under the command of the 12th SS Panzer Division. At 0810, General Friedrich Dollmann, the 7th Army commander, ordered SS-Obergruppenführer Paul Hausser to divert the II SS Panzer Corps, to {{counter-attack}} south of Cheux. Hausser replied that no counter-attack could be launched until the following day, as so many of his units had yet to reach the front. The German command was thrown into disarray by Dollmann's sudden death, when Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt (OB West) were en route to a conference with Hitler and {{out of touch with the}} situation. It was not until 1500 that Hausser was appointed commander of the 7th Army, with Willi Bittrich replacing him as commander of II SS Panzer Corps. (Hausser was advised to retain control of the Corps until the following morning.) Pending the return of Rommel to Normandy, Hausser was also to be supreme commander in the invasion area. At 1700 the command structure was changed again; the 7th Army under Hausser would <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> invasion front facing the American army, while the Panzer Group West (General Geyr von Schweppenburg) was to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> invasion front facing the Anglo-Canadian forces.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origins}} to {{approximately}} {{the area of}} Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which {{is referred to as}} the St. Johns River offset, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.|$|E
