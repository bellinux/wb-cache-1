500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his <b>back</b> <b>shoulder</b> in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

2500|$|Coconuts {{falling from}} their {{respective}} trees that strike individuals can cause serious injuries to the <b>back,</b> <b>shoulder</b> and more fatally, the head. [...] Following a 1984 study on [...] "Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts", exaggerated claims spread concerning {{the number of}} deaths by falling coconuts. Falling coconuts, according to urban legend, kill a few people a year. This legend gained momentum after the 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks was characterized as saying that falling coconuts kill 150 people worldwide each year. The claim has often been compared with the number of shark-caused deaths per year, which is approximately five.|$|E
2500|$|Conformation {{also plays}} a role. Horses with a longer back at the lumbosacral joint or [...] "coupling" [...] will {{find it easier to}} perform a lateral ambling gait, though they may also have to work harder to have proper collection. [...] An average length back still allows a horse to perform ambling gaits, though a very short-coupled horse usually can only perform the trot. A well-laid <b>back</b> <b>shoulder</b> and {{somewhat}} horizontal hip angle favor a longer length of stride and is helpful in horses that fox trot, while a steeper shoulder angle combined with more sloping croup produce a stride more desirable in some lateral gaits such as the running walk.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the mechanical load on the low <b>back</b> and <b>shoulders</b> during pushing and pulling in combination with three task constraints: the use of one or two hands, three cart weights, and two handle heights. The second objective was to explore the relation between the initial and sustained exerted forces and the mechanical load on the low <b>back</b> and <b>shoulders.</b> Detailed biomechanical models of the low <b>back</b> and <b>shoulder</b> joint were used to estimate mechanical loading. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE) the effects were quantified for exerted push/pull forces, net moments at the low <b>back</b> and <b>shoulders,</b> compressive and shear forces at the low back, and compressive forces at the glenohumeral joint. The results of this study appeared to be useful to estimate ergonomics consequences of interventions in the working constraints during pushing and pulling. Cart weight as well as handle height had a considerable effect on the mechanical load and it is recommended to maintain low cart weights and to push or pull at shoulder height. Initial and sustained exerted forces were not highly correlated with the mechanical load at the low <b>back</b> and <b>shoulders</b> within the studied range of the exerted force...|$|R
