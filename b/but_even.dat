5|$|Airborne {{volcanic}} ash can reflect the Sun's rays back into space and thereby contribute to cooling the planet. Dips in earth temperatures {{have been observed}} after large volcano eruptions such as Mount Agung in Bali that erupted in 1963, El Chichon (Mexico) 1983, Ruiz (Colombia) 1985, and Pinatubo (Philippines) 1991. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> for major eruptions, the ash clouds remain only for relatively short periods.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{criteria}} include histopathologic {{evidence of}} endometritis, thickened filled Fallopian tubes, or laparoscopic findings. Gram stain/smear becomes definitive {{in the identification}} of rare, atypical and possibly more serious organisms. Two thirds of patients with laparoscopic evidence of previous PID were not aware they had PID, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> asymptomatic PID can cause serious harm.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually <b>but</b> <b>even</b> with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 1941, Roosevelt {{announced}} Minton's {{nomination to}} the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Minton was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on May 12. Minton resigned from his post in the administration, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> after he began working on the court, Minton remained active in Democratic politics behind the scenes and was in regular correspondence with Roosevelt to make patronage suggestions.|$|E
5|$|Tannakin's {{deformity}} {{was soon}} discovered, and many locals came {{to hear her}} pig-like speech or to watch her feed from the trough. The old woman was located, tried and convicted for witchcraft, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> at the stake refused or was unable to reverse the enchantment.|$|E
5|$|The {{conference at}} Calais was {{something}} of a political triumph, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> though the French government gave implicit support for Henry's remarriage and Francis I himself held private conference with Anne, the French King maintained alliances with the Pope which he could not explicitly defy.|$|E

5|$|Turunen's {{voice is}} {{described}} by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional.

5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his master's degree, Giridhar enrolled for the doctoral Vidyavaridhi (PhD) {{degree at the}} same institute, under Pandit Ramprasad Tripathi. He received a research fellowship from the University Grants Commission (UGC), <b>but</b> <b>even</b> so, he faced financial hardship during the next five years. He completed his Vidyavaridhi degree in Sanskrit grammar on 14 October 1981. His dissertation was titled Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe'pāṇinīyaprayogānāṃ Vimarśaḥ, or Deliberation on the non-Paninian usages in the Adhyatma Ramayana. The thesis was authored in only thirteen days in 1981. On completion of his doctorate, the UGC offered him the position of head of the Vyakarana department of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. However, Giridhar did not accept; he decided to devote his life {{to the service of}} religion, society, and the disabled.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E
5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> the revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily {{caused by an}} unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles Holden had {{gradually}} reduced his workload, he {{was still}} continuing {{to go into the}} office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> then he visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.|$|E

5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri forest in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> there, B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E
