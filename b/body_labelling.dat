40|$|We have {{examined}} the relationship of externally accessible proteins associated with the internal cytoskeleton of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei. Two approaches were taken. First, externally disposed glycoproteins were identified with lectins and examined for their persistence and location in isolated cytoskeletons. Second, proteins containing tyrosine residues available for chemical modification on the outer surface were identified in isolated cytoskeletons and probed for glycosylation. The procyclic form of T. brucei that was employed does not express the variable surface glycoprotein. The lectin concanavalin A (ConA) bound to the outer surface of T. brucei in two discrete locations; one a narrow line close to the flagellum attachment zone on the cell body, the other at the distal tip of the flagellum itself. Of these, only the cell <b>body</b> <b>labelling</b> was detected when isolated cytoskeletons were probed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled ConA. When cytoskeletons were prepared from cells labelled with gold-conjugated ConA, a narrow line of label was detected parallel to the flagellum attachment zone but was distinct from it. Only one cytoskeletal protein, of Mr 88, 000, could be labelled at the cell surface by the 125 I/iodogen procedure. This protein could be precipitated from SDS-solubilized cytoskeletons with ConA-agarose. These data indicate {{the existence of a}} previously undetected cytoskeletal structure, situated in the cell body, close to the point of flagellum attachment, which has a transmembrane association with an external Mr 88, 000 glycoprotein...|$|E

Three experiments were performed. First, an injection of PRV {{was made in the}} anterior chamber of the eye, followed 24 hr later by an injection of WGA-HRP. PRV infected neurons in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) always contained WGA-HRP. This dual labeling of SCG neurons suggests that the PRV cell <b>body</b> <b>labeling</b> does not nonspecifically infect nearby neurons.

40|$|Cytohistochemical {{staining}} and RNase-gold labelling {{have been}} applied to root-tip meristematic cells of Vicia faba to study the origin and biological significance of 2 types of inclusions: one seen in the nucleoplasm {{and the other in}} the cytoplasm of early telophase cells. They have been termed "dense bodies" and "cytoplasmic nucleolus-like bodies" (NLB), respectively. Both types of inclusions respond positively to silver staining and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) staining in a similar fashion to nucleolus. Interestingly, the dense <b>bodies</b> <b>label</b> heavily with the RNase-gold complex, as does the nucleolus, while the cytoplasmic NLB have no affinity with the label. In most cases, the dense <b>bodies</b> <b>label</b> more heavily than the nucleolus. Light microscope surveys reveal that the dense bodies sometimes appear to be released {{from the surface of the}} nucleolus. On the other hand, prenucleolar material showing the same silver staining and RNP preferential staining characteristics as the dense bodies begin to accumulate on the surface of chromosomes in mid-anaphase. This material does not label with RNase-gold. These data are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that the dense bodies are derived from the nucleolus by direct budding or fragmentation, and the cytoplasmic NLB are composed of prenucleolar material that failed to attach to chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Human pose {{recognition}} {{has become}} an active research topic lately {{in the field of}} human computer interface (HCI). However it presents technical challenges due to the complexity of human motion. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for human upper body pose recognition using labeled (i. e., recognized) human body parts in depth silhouettes. Our proposed method performs human upper <b>body</b> parts <b>labeling</b> using trained random forests (RFs) and utilizes support vector machines (SVMs) to recognize various upper body poses. To train RFs, we create a database of synthetic depth silhouettes of the upper body and their corresponding upper <b>body</b> parts <b>labeled</b> maps using a commercial computer graphics package. Once the <b>body</b> parts get <b>labeled</b> with the trained RFs, a skeletal upper body model is generated from the <b>labeled</b> <b>body</b> parts. Then, SVMs are trained with a set of joint angle features to recognize seven upper body poses. The experimental results show the mean recognition rate of 97. 62 %. Our proposed method should be useful as a near field HCI technique to be used in applications such as smart computer interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Recently, the {{emergence}} of Kinect systems has demon-strated the benefits of predicting an intermediate <b>body</b> part <b>labeling</b> for 3 D human pose estimation, in conjunction with RGB-D imagery. The availability of depth information plays a critical role, so an important question is whether a similar representation can be developed with sufficient robustness in order to estimate 3 D pose from RGB im-ages. This paper provides evidence for a positive answer, by leveraging (a) 2 D human <b>body</b> part <b>labeling</b> in images, (b) second-order label-sensitive pooling over dynamically computed regions resulting from a hierarchical decomposi-tion of the body, and (c) iterative structured-output mod-eling to contextualize the process based on 3 D pose es-timates. For robustness and generalization, we take ad-vantage of a recent large-scale 3 D human motion capture dataset, Human 3. 6 M[18] that also has human <b>body</b> part <b>labeling</b> annotations available with images. We provide ex-tensive experimental studies where alternative intermediate representations are compared and report a substantial 33 % error reduction over competitive discriminative baselines that regress 3 D human pose against global HOG features. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cooperative <b>body</b> part <b>labeling</b> and tracking algorithm for locating body parts {{in a video}} image sequence. The <b>body</b> part <b>labeling</b> procedure is used to initialize the tracking procedure and to prevent tracking from getting lost; and the tracking procedure is used to analyze frames that cannot be handled reliably by the labeling procedure. This results in an automatic and robust body part tracking system. Unlike previous work that always start tracking from the first frame which {{may be difficult to}} analyze, our tracking procedure starts with some key frames in which body parts can be located reliably. Key frames are selected based on a labeling confidence measure which evaluates the similarity between the human model and the image features. The <b>labeled</b> <b>body</b> parts are tracked in-between frames based on such cues as shape, color, and location interpolated between key frames iteratively. The proposed algorithm has been applied to analyze NASA videotapes in which crew members present challenging postures of bending, twisting, and rotating in a space station.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} Foreignization and Domestication of Ecological Word in <b>Body</b> Cares’ <b>Labels</b> of Mustika Ratu. It has two objectives: it is aimed {{to know the}} ecological word in Mustika Ratu <b>body</b> care’ <b>labels</b> and it is aimed {{to find out the}} types of domestication and foreignization used by the translator for those ecological words in Mustika Ratu <b>body</b> care’ <b>labels.</b> In analyzing the data, the researcher uses Newmark (1998 : 95 - 103) for ecology classification and Davies’s theory in Judickait? (2009 : 15 - 19) as the framework of the domestication and foreignization. The researcher got 41 ecological words for the analysis: flora, fauna and plain. The ecological word flora becomes the highest number because the products are mostly used natural native Indonesian flora. The second finding is the domestication and foreignization as the translation strategy. there are 28 words translated using foreignization strategy and 13 words using domestication strategy. Furthermore, in domestication, translation by more concrete/specific word becomes the most domination with 13 words. It becomes the most dominant because the translator tends to use the biological name of the main ingredient to make the customer understand about the material. The second domination is equivalent with 11 words. The third domination is naturalization with 3 words. The last domination is omission with 1 word. Next, in foreignization, {{it can be seen that}} preservation becomes the most domination with 11 words. It becomes the most dominant because it is not translated into the TL form. In addition, the translator keeps the term in SL. The last domination is globalization and addition with 1 word each...|$|R
