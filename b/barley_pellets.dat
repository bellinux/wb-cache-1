40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the sustainable development concept suggested by the UN conference "Environment and the Development " (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), is gradual replacement of mineral fuel resources, which at modern rate of production can be exhausted in nearest 50 - 60 years. [1] The burning of mineral fuel results in CO 2 dispersion in the atmosphere, which causes such global ecological problems as greenhouse effect, global change of the climate, loss of the biological diversity. Besides pollutents from burning mineral fuels cause such regional ecological problems as: deterioration of human health, pollution of reservoirs and reduction of soil fertility. [2] The modern tendency of refusal from ecologically more risky atomic energy stimulates search of alternative kinds of power resources. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} pay attention to reception of energy on the basis of renewable kinds of raw materials. The commercial production of fuels from lignocellulosics still requires significant efforts on both technical and economic levels. Utilization of cellulose containing wastes allows to reduce the cost of substrate, which mainly accounts for the expenditure of bioethanol production. Among the technical problems needed to be resolved pretreatment is considered as having crucial value. [3] In this context the pretreatment of waste (of rice and <b>barley</b> <b>pellets)</b> has been performed by three methods and enzymatic hydrolysis carried out to compare its reaction ability...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to delineate the cause or causes of winter deaths in deer and to provide information from which emergency feed could be formulated. Deer were shot at monthly intervals through the winter in Wallowa County, Oregon. Samples from the rumen, liver, mandible, blood and feces were taken to study mineral consumption, tissue levels, storage and excretion. Deer collected the next winter from another area of the county were also sampled for comparative purposes. Deer from two other areas in the state were also sampled and along with the Wallowa County samples, were used to establish standards for deer tissue levels of various minerals. The minerals studied were P, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Cu, Mn, S, K, and Co. Mineral supplies, except Mg, were felt to be adequate. The diets of the Wallowa County deer appeared to be marginal in Mg, especially since winter requirements for Mg are apparently higher than for other seasons. Marginal levels of dietary Mg would be expected to gradually deplete body stores and cause a lowering of blood Mg. A cold environment will lower levels of Mg and so will starvation. If all three of these occurred at once, it was theorized that a "winter tetany" could occur and result in large scale deaths. Emergency feeding of deer in the past has not been successful and areas of supplemental feeding usually have higher mortality rates than non-supplemented areas. Another trial was conducted to study the effect of prolonged weight loss, followed by starvation, on the acceptance and reactions of animals offered emergency feeds ad lib. Twelve goats were fed chopped orchard grass hay for 43 days, during which time they lost weight. At the end of this time period, they were starved for five days. After starvation they were offered the following feeds ad lib. : <b>barley</b> <b>pellets,</b> alfalfa pellets, 45 : 55 concentrate to hay ratio pellets, and chopped alfalfa hay or chopped orchard grass hay. The goats seemed able to adapt to the rations without problems as measured by feed intake, rumen pH, rumen lactic acid levels, body temperature and fecal dry matter. They ate only sparingly at first and then gradually increased intake up to full feed over a five day period. Blood Mg levels in the goats showed a decline with starvation. The body seemed unable to compensate for this decline by increasing absorption from the intestinal tract or controlling excretion as fecal levels remained similar throughout starvation. The blood levels did not return to normal when the goats were first realimented. It appeared that the goats went into a negative water balance when they were starved, because urine volume increased and water intake decreased. When an estimate of metabolic water was derived, however, the water balance seemed even...|$|E

Eight Holstein cows (655 ± 69 kg; 83 ± 16 DIM) were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square with 28 -d periods. Cows in one square were fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulae. Cows fed dry-rolled barley consumed 1. 8 to 3. 5 kg/d more (P = 0. 02) DM than those fed pelleted barley; however, source of supplemental dietary fat had no effect on DM intake. Ruminal pH was lower (P = 0. 045) in cows fed <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> compared to those fed dry-rolled barley. Ruminal concentration of acetate was greater (P = 0. 001), whereas ruminal concentration of propionate tended to be lower (P = 0. 11), in cows fed dry-rolled barley compared to those fed pelleted barley; consequently, the acetate:propionate ratio was higher (P = 0. 01) in cows fed dry-rolled barley compared to those fed <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley.</b> Ruminal concentration of total VFA was unaffected (P > 0. 05) by diet. Source of dietary fat had no effect on ruminal digestion of OM, NDF, ADF or starch; however, ruminal starch digestion was slightly higher in cows fed <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> compared to those fed dry-rolled barley (90. 8 vs. 89. 5 %). Total dietary fatty acid intake was higher (P 0. 05) by diet; however, milk fat content was higher (P = 0. 004) in cows fed dry-rolled barley compared to those fed <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley.</b> Milk fat content of C 18 : 3 was higher (P = 0. 005) in cows fed canola compared to those fed flax.

40|$|The {{effect of}} barley grain {{processing}} and source of supplemental fat on performance of lactating dairy cows were studied in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21 -d periods and a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Eight Holstein cows with mean body weight (BW) of 572 ± 71 kg and 45 ± 10 days in milk were allocated to 4 dietary treatments including 1) ground barley with cottonseed 2) <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> with cottonseed 3) ground barley with canola seed 4) <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> with canola seed. The nitrogen intake and fecal N were higher in cows fed ground barley {{in comparison with}} those fed <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley.</b> Source of supplemental fat or barley processing {{had no effect on}} milk fat and milk protein contents. Milk SNF yield was higher in cows fed canola as supplemental fat source and ground barley (P < 0. 05). Milk yield was affected by method of barley grain processing and was 0. 64 to 1. 9 kg/d higher in cows fed ground barley compared with those fed <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> (P = 0. 04).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processed}} cereal grain supplementation on volatile fatty acid (VFA) production rates of grazing, lactating Holstein-Friesian cows were measured in a 5 x 5 Latin square experiment. The experimental treatments were as follows: control (only grazing, no supplement addition, NS), <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> (PB), <b>pelleted</b> maize (PM), toasted and subsequently <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> (TPB), and toasted and subsequently pelleted maize (TPM) as supplements. An isotope dilution technique using stable isotope of carbon (13 C) as an internal marker was employed for {{the estimation of}} VFA production. At {{the beginning of a}} 3 -hour long allowed grazing time, 100 mg of 99 % enriched 13 C 2 Na-acetate were introduced in the rumen and repeated after grazing with 50 mg isotope, after which the cows were starved for 6 hours until evening milking. During grazing disappearance rate (kdis) and production rate (kprod) of acetate, propionate and butyrate were significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) in supplemented than in NS cows. Moreover the effec t of <b>barley</b> grain and <b>pelleting</b> treatment was higher than the effect of maize grain and toasting. During starvation significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) kdis and kprod of VFAs were observed in PM and TPM treatments. Total VFA production for the experimental period (grazing + starvation) were 49. 5, 78. 7, 69. 9, 88. 5, 80. 8 mol/day for NS, PB, TPB, PM and TPM, respectively.

40|$|The {{fermentation}} {{properties of}} the following feeds: <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> (PB), toasted and <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> (TPB), <b>pelleted</b> maize (PM) and toasted and pelleted maize (TPM) were studied using an in vitro gas production (GP) technique. Each feed sample (0. 5 g) was incubated (3 replications), with rumen fluid collected from 3 grazing lactating dairy cows. The kinetics of GP were automatically recorded for 72 h. The amounts of DM disappeared (DMd) and the volatile fatty acid yields (VFA) were measured. On barley, compared to simple pelleting, toasting significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced DMd (87. 5 vs. 86. 2 %), the asymptotic GP (A, 388 vs. 367 ml/g DMd) and slightly increased the time of maximum GP rate (TRmax, 2. 89 vs. 3. 15 h). On maize toasting did not affect DMd and A, but significantly reduced T 1 / 2 (9. 71 vs. 8. 57; P< 0. 05) and TRmax (5. 04 vs. 4. 49, P< 0. 05).

Thirty-one bulls with an initial live weight (LW) of 289 kg were selected for a 2 � 2 factorial design experiment consisting of two primary growth GCSs harvested at different maturities (in vitro digestible organic matter (OM) in dry matter (DM), D value: Early-cut, E, 750 g kg- 1 DM; Late-cut, L, 699 g kg- 1 DM) and two concentrate crude protein concentrations (Medium, M, 170 g kg- 1 DM; High, H, 210 g kg- 1 DM). The concentrate comprised milled <b>barley</b> and <b>pelleted</b> commercial protein compound and was offered daily on average 3. 2 kg DM, including 0. 45 and 1. 13 kg of rapeseed cake in M and H, respectively. Grass-red clover silage was offered ad libitum. The target cold carcass weight was 330 kg. The proportion of concentrate of the total daily DM intake averaged 0. 337 during the entire experiment. Treatments had no effect on the daily intake of GCS, total intake of DM, DM intake kg- 1 LW 0. 75 and metabolizable energy averaging 6. 0 and 9. 4 kg DM, 97. 4 g and 109. 4 MJ, respectively. The digestibility of dietary OM and neutral detergent fibre was lower (p < 0. 05, 0. 733 vs. 0. 769 and 0. 625 vs. 0. 665) on diet L than on diet E. The animals on diet E tended to consume daily on average 1. 29 kg less (p < 0. 10) DM kg- 1 net weight gain than those on diet L. The time to achieve the target carcass weight was on average 18 days longer (p < 0. 01) on diet L than on diet E. During the entire experiment the LW gain averaged 1795 and 1609 g d- 1 (p < 0. 01) on diets E and L, respectively. The concentrate protein concentration did not affect animal performance. Treatments had no significant effect on the kill-out proportion, EUROP carcass conformation and carcass fat classification which averaged 537 g kg- 1, 6. 5 and 3. 6, respectively. The eating quality of the tested loins was good. Treatments had only a minor effect on the yield of valuable cuts. It is concluded that the digestibility of silage is important since the early-cut silage improved the growth rate and shortened the finishing period of bulls significantly compared with those fed late-cut silage. The lower yield and, thus, higher unit cost of early. cut silage may, however, invalidate its superiority compared with the late. cut silage.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted to investigate how dietary and ruminal factors regulate urea-N recycling in ruminants. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3, urea-N kinetics were measured using 4 -d intra-jugular infusions of [15 N 15 N]-urea. In Experiment 1, the objective was to determine how interactions between dietary ruminally-degradable protein (RDP) level and ruminally-fermentable carbohydrate (RFC) may alter urea-N transfer to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the utilization of this recycled urea-N in rapidly-growing lambs fed high N diets. The dietary factors were: 1) dry-rolled <b>barley</b> (DRB) vs. <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> (PB) as the principal source of RFC; and 2) dietary levels of RDP of 60 vs. 70 % (% of CP). Nitrogen intake, fecal and urinary N excretion increased as dietary RDP level increased; however, method of barley processing {{had no effect on}} N use. Dietary treatment had no effect on urea-N kinetics; however, endogenous production of urea-N (UER) exceeded N intake. For all diets, 0. 669 to 0. 742 of UER was recycled to the GIT; however, 0. 636 to 0. 756 of the GER was returned to the ornithine cycle. In Experiment 2, the objective was to delineate the effects of partial defaunation of the rumen on urea-N kinetics in lambs fed low or high N diets. Treatments were: 1) partial defaunation (PDFAUN) vs. faunation (FAUN); and 2) low (10 %, LOW) vs. high (15 %, HIGH) dietary CP. Linoleic acid-rich sunflower oil was fed as a partially-defaunating agent. Partial defaunation decreased ruminal NH 3 -N concentrations. The UER and urinary urea-N excretion (UUE) were lower, and the GER tended to be lower in PDFAUN as compared to FAUN lambs; however, as a proportion of UER, GER was higher and the proportion of recycled urea-N that was utilized for anabolism (i. e., UUA) tended to be higher in PDFAUN lambs. The UER, GER and UUE were higher in lambs fed diet HIGH; however, as a proportion of UER, GER and its anabolic use were higher in lambs fed diet LOW. In Experiment 3, the objective was to delineate how, at similar N intakes, interactions between ruminal partial defaunation and altering dietary RFC may alter urea-N kinetics and N metabolism in lambs. Treatments were: 1) PDFAUN vs. FAUN; and 2) DRB vs. PB. Urinary N excretion was lower and retained N was higher in PDFAUN compared to FAUN lambs. The UER was similar across treatments; however, the GER, expressed as absolute amounts or as a proportion of UER, UUA, and microbial N supply were higher in PDFAUN compared to FAUN lambs. As a proportion of UER, GER was higher, whereas UUE was lower in lambs fed PB compared to those fed DRB. In Experiment 4, the objective was {{to determine the effects of}} feeding oscillating dietary CP compared to static dietary CP concentration on N retention and in vitro urea flux across ruminal epithelia. Dietary treatments consisted of a medium CP diet (MEDIUM; 12. 8 % CP) or diets with oscillating CP content (OSC) fed in two different sequences i. e., 2 d of low CP (9. 7 % CP) followed by 2 d of high CP (16. 1 % CP; OSC-HIGH) or vice-versa (OSC-LOW). Ruminal epithelial tissues were collected and mounted in Ussing chambers under short-circuit conditions and the serosal-to-mucosal urea flux (Jsm-urea) was measured using 14 C-urea. Although N intake was similar, retained N and microbial N supply were greater in lambs fed the OSC diets compared to those fed the MEDIUM diet. The total Jsm-urea was higher in lambs fed the OSC-LOW compared to those fed the OSC-HIGH diet. Across diets, the addition of phloretin (a known specific inhibitor of facilitative urea transporter-B; UT-B) reduced Jsm-urea; however, phloretin-insensitive Jsm-urea was the predominant route for transepithelial urea transfer. In summary, data presented in this thesis provide new insights that the improved N retention typically observed in defaunated ruminants and in ruminants fed oscillating dietary CP concentrations is partly mediated via increased urea-N recycling to the GIT and utilization of recycled urea-N for anabolic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Methods {{to improve}} the {{efficacy}} of swine barley rations were evaluated. A literature review pertaining to the subject, three feeding trials involving 104 swine, and a laboratory investigation {{were used in the}} study. The effects of pelleting with a new modified pellet die that produces a dense pellet; supplementation with 5 percent stabilized beef tallow or with a cellulase preparation¹; adding water to the ration at the time of feeding; soaking the ration 9 to 15 hours prior to feeding; the use of temperature control with mash rations, and several interactions of these methods have been evaluated. <b>Pelleting</b> <b>barley</b> rations significantly (P . 10) effect on daily feed consumption or average daily gains. Meal rations were 7 percent bulkier than pellets, and it is suggested that the increased density of pellets is responsible for the improvement in feed conversion due to pelleting. Fat supplementation was additive with pelleting when the modified pellet die was used; together the two significantly (P . 05) changes in average daily gains, feed consumption, or feed conversion. However, fat supplementation tended {{to improve the}} utilization of barley rations more than pelleting or cellulase supplementation. Fat additions apparently lowered cellulase activity as determined in vitro, but fat apparently was not detrimental to cellulase activity in vivo except in pelleted rations. Cellulase 4000 did not bring about any significant (P >. 10) changes in average daily gains, feed consumption or feed efficiency although there was a slight but consistently favorable trend to do so. Carcass shrinkage was significantly (P <. 05) lower following cellulase feeding, whether the ration was soaked or dry. Backfat was significantly (P <. 05) thicker on soaked rations, but not on dry rations, when Cellulase 4000 was supplemented. The use of this enzyme apparently increases the average daily gains but not the feed efficiency of soaked rations, at least in the absence of temperature control. Soaking the ration 9 to 15 hours prior to feeding or simply wetting the ration at the time of feeding tended to increase the average daily gains and feed consumption, but lowered the efficiency of feed utilization. When temperature control was applied to the mash rations, average daily gains were significantly (P <. 05) improved over the controls, shrinkage losses apparently increased (P <. 05 with the "soaked" group), but the feed efficiency tended to decrease as did the backfat thickness and the iodine numbers of the backfat (P <. 05 with the "soaked" group). The laboratory study provided some evidence that Cellulase 4000 brought about reduction in cellulose, but that the pH of barley rations was not optimum for cellulase activity. Reducing sugars and crude fiber were found to increase with the ration soaking time. ¹ Cellulase 4000, supplied gratis by Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, Indiana...|$|R
40|$|Ruminal {{acidosis}} and low {{feed intake}} are two nutritional challenges present on beef and dairy operations {{that result in}} reduced health and performance. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the regional susceptibility of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to ruminal acidosis (RA) or low feed intake (LFI). Twenty-one Holstein steers, aged 6 to 8 mo, were blocked by body weight (BW) and within block randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) control (CON), 2) RA, and 3) LFI. All steers were fed a diet containing a 50 : 50 forage to concentrate ratio (F:C) and were exposed to a 5 -d measurement period. The CON steers were provided the basal diet for ad libitum intake, the LFI steers were fed at 25 % of ad libitum intake for 5 d before humane killing while the RA steers were restricted to 25 % intake for 1 d and then were fed 30 % of dry matter intake (DMI) in <b>pelleted</b> <b>barley</b> followed by their regular total mixed ration (TMR) allocation. The RA steers were killed 1 d after the RA challenge. After killing, tissues from the rumen, omasum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, proximal, and distal colon were collected. Digesta from those regions were assessed and tissues were mounted in Ussing chambers in order to assess permeability using the mucosal-to-serosal flux of inulin (JMS-inulin) and mannitol (JMS-mannitol) and tissue conductance (Gt). Digesta pH were less for RA than CON in the rumen, cecum, and proximal colon while LFI had greater pH in the rumen and proximal colon compared to CON. Ruminal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in the rumen were less for the LFI (P = 0. 010) and RA (P = 0. 007) compared to CON steers. In the proximal colon, there was a greater proportion of butyrate (P = 0. 025 and P = 0. 022) and isobutyrate (P = 0. 019 and P = 0. 019), and a lower proportion of acetate (P = 0. 028 and P = 0. 028) for LFI and RA, respectively, when compared to CON steers. The JMS-mannitol differed between the CON and LFI steers in the proximal colon (P = 0. 041) and in the distal colon (P = 0. 015) with the LFI steers having a lower flux rate in both regions. Increases in gene expression for genes related to barrier function (in the rumen, jejunum, and distal colon), mucosal immunology (rumen and jejunum), and adaptive immunity (jejunum) were observed indicating compensatory mechanisms may have been stimulated. It was concluded from this study that an acute RA challenge had no effect on tissue permeability throughout the GIT within 1 d of the challenge, while steers that were on LFI for 5 d had reduced tissue permeability in the proximal and distal colon while other regions of the GIT were unaffected. Further research is needed to analyze different management strategies proposed to mitigate the negative impact of LFI shown in production animal agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Biomass is an {{important}} energy carrier since it is a renewable source and the energy content in the fuel can be stored over time and also generate high temperatures. Bioenergy can be in liquid form, gas-phase or solid. The most common phase is as a solid. Before use, the biomass needs harvesting and refining. Pelletization {{is one of the}} most promising solid fuel qualities with a wide range of benefits which are needed before the product can enter the market and compete with more traditional sources of energy like heating oil and electricity. Despite its benefits, the pellet market still requires development. Several barriers need to be lifted such as understanding the market behavior, finding how bioenergy systems are adapted and what the level of technology is. Pellet feedstock is normally bi-products from sawmills, but increasing demand makes other feedstock alternatives interesting. Pulpwood from pine, straw and husk from agriculture and residue from the furniture industry are examples of new types of feedstock for pellet production. Different feedstocks can bring challenges due to the mechanical properties of the pellet fuel. Also chemical properties can be demanding if the inorganic content in the feedstock is high. The main objectives of the present work are divided into three selected areas; small scale pellets users in Norway, pretreatment of pure feedstock from pine and manufacturing of low-grade feedstock pellets with additives. The following research questions were settled for the work: 1) Which factors lead single household owners to choose wood pellet stoves compared to heat pump solutions and direct electrically heated systems? 2) How will existing users of wood pellets stoves choose if they should have any new system? 3) What is the practical experience of existing wood pellet stove users with aspects like the technical properties of fuel, stove or stakeholders? 4) How does extended storage of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 5) How does high and low temperature drying of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 6) How is the mechanical quality properties of pellets affected by the use of different selected additives? 7) Is the low-grade feedstock pellets made with additives combustible in ordinary grate furnaces/boilers? 8) How are the ash melting properties of difficult fuels affected by the use of selected additives? The research questions are aimed to solve by investigation of market penetration of wood pellet stoves through a survey. Further new pellet feedstocks like pulpwood, agricultural and furniture residues have been produced and tested. Also mixtures with different additives have been produced. The purpose of additives is mechanical fuel quality improvement and increasing the melting point of the ash in the fuel. Finally the new pellet fuel assortments were combusted and tested. All experiments and data collections performed this work is done in an industrial context. Chipping, grinding and pelletization were performed in ordinary industrial plants. Feedstock samples are collected from ordinary harvesting or side-product processes. Combustion is performed in ordinary furnaces/boilers. All processes mentioned above were set up with necessary measurement equipment. This way of experiment approaches have given good validity of the results from the experiments. The market investigation work was performed by a questionnaire among 188 random non-wood pellet users and 461 wood pellet users in Norway. The survey reached a response rate of 45 % from the existing wood pellet users. Factors that influence the decision of purchasing a heating system were identified like the age of the consumer, regional constraints in the availability of pellets and also that economic competitiveness is also weak compared to electrical heating. It was also found that pellet stoves need technical improvements to meet the end-user expectations. The ignition, control system, noise and imperfect combustion are examples of technical factors which need improvement. New pellet feedstocks need treatment prior to the pelletization process. Such process steps are chipping, grinding, storage, drying and possibly the use of additives. In this thesis, several feedstock assortments were manufactured. Pine pulp was stored outside for a year and dried at both high and low temperatures. The high temperature dried material and also stored material resulted in higher energy use for pelletization. There was lower energy consumption for fresh, low temperature dried material. Fresh material was found to have higher durability. Barley straw, barley husk and residue from furniture contain a larger amount of ash and a higher concentration of problematic ash-forming elements compared to conventional woody biomasses. This causes normally severe ash sintering and slagging which were observed in this study. Different raw feedstock were pelletized and combusted together with different additives. These additives might have multifunction such as: 1) improve the properties of fuel pellets from the mechanical point of view and 2) abate fuel ash slagging to achieve an efficient and smooth combustion process. In this work, each raw feedstock was pelletized with different additives in various additive-to-fuel ratios. The influence of additive addition on the pellet production process (i. e., power consumption) and pellet properties (i. e., bulk density, durability and particle density) were investigated. For furniture residue, both sewage sludge and marble sludge improved the durability of the pellets. But when there was a high content of marble, the durability was reduced and the levels of fines increased. Barley straw and barley husk durability were also improved with the lignosulfonate additive. With the marble sludge additive the barley husk durability was increased. Opposite barley straw durability was lowered with marble sludge additive. With combinations of both additives, the positive effect of marble sludge additive for both the barley straw and barley husk was to some extent eliminated. There are significant differences between the composition and ash chemistry of the formed slags. The slag from wood wastes was dominated by K, Na, Si and Ca, which were completely melted and fused into large blocks. The results from the chemical composition analyses of slag samples suggest intensive formation and fusion of low temperature melting alkali silicates. For the barley straw and barley husk that are rich in Si, K, P and Ca, most of the K reacts with both P and Si in ash residues and forms ash melts containing low temperature melting potassium silicates and phosphates. The ash melts were not transported from the grate area in the furnace and gives thereby initiated and enhanced ash slagging which reduces the operation stability of the furnace. Lignosulfonate, marble sludge and sewage sludge are proposed as additives to mitigate ash slagging during the combustion of the studied fuels. Marble sludge served as the most efficient additive to eliminate ash slagging during the combustion of pelletized barley straw, barley husk and wood wastes, respectively. The addition of marble sludge led to the formation of high temperature melting calcium-rich alkali silicates and/or phosphates. This process was accompanied by a significant reduction in ash melts and slag formation. A less pronounced anti-slagging effect was observed from the combustion of lignosulfonate added to barley straw and <b>barley</b> husk <b>pellets.</b> However, the addition of lignosulfonate altered the ash chemistry and promoted the formation of high temperature melting potassium calcium phosphates in ash residues. As result of this, the fraction of ingoing fuel ash that forms slag decreased, and the slags had smaller size and a lower degree of sintering. The addition of sewage sludge slightly reduced the slag formation during the combustion of wood waste pellets. This occurred because sewage sludge contributed to the formation of high temperature melting alkali aluminum silicates. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|R
