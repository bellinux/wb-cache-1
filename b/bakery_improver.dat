40|$|Background. Human {{nutrition}} is oftentimes deficient {{to important}} nutrients such as iodine {{not only in}} the developing countries but also in the developed countries. Bakery products are consumed every day by many people and offer spread potential for enrichment of final products by various type of nutrients. The study is focused on the monitoring effect of potassium iodate as <b>bakery</b> <b>improver</b> to the quality of wheat-spelt baked goods through methods of rheological, baking test and sensory analysis. The influence of potassium iodate on baked goods staling was also studied. |$|E
30|$|DCPD is of {{biological}} importance {{because it is}} often found in pathological calcifications (dental calculi, crystalluria, chondrocalcinosis and urinary stones) and some carious lesions (LeGeros 1991, 2001; O’Neill 2007). It was proposed as an intermediate in both bone mineralization and dissolution of enamel in acids (dental erosion) (LeGeros 1991, 2001; O’Neill 2007). In medicine, DCPD is used in self-setting CaPO 4 formulations (Dorozhkin 2013 b) and as an intermediate for tooth remineralization. DCPD is added to toothpaste both for caries protection (in this case, it is often coupled with F-containing compounds such as NaF and/or Na 2 PO 3 F) and as a gentle polishing agent (Dorozhkin 2013 c). Other applications include a flame retardant (Mostashari et al. 2006), a slow release fertilizer, using in glass production, as well as calcium supplement in food, feed and cereals. In food industry, {{it serves as a}} texturizer, <b>bakery</b> <b>improver</b> and water retention additive. In diary industry, DCPD is used as a mineral supplement. In addition, plate-like crystals of DCPD might be used as a non-toxic, anticorrosive and passivating pigment for some ground coat paints (Budavari et al. 1996).|$|E
30|$|Pure β-TCP never {{occurs in}} {{biological}} calcifications. Only a Mg-substituted form [β-TCMP—β-tricalcium magnesium phosphate, β-(Ca,Mg) 3 (PO 4) 2, {{which is often}} called whitlockite to honor Mr. Herbert Percy Whitlock (1868 – 1948), an American mineralogist, the curator of the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, New York, USA (Frondel 1941)] is found. Since β-TCMP is less soluble than β-TCP (Li et al. 2009 a), it is formed instead of β-TCP in dental calculi and urinary stones, dentineal caries, salivary stones, arthritic cartilage, {{as well as in}} some soft-tissue deposits (LeGeros 1991, 2001; O’Neill 2007; Kodaka et al. 1988; Reid and Andersen 1993; Scotchford and Ali 1995; P’ng et al. 2008). However, it has not been observed in enamel, dentine or bone. In medicine, β-TCP is used in the self-setting CaPO 4 formulations (Dorozhkin 2013 b) and other types of bone grafts (Hou et al. 2008; Horch et al. 2006; Ogose et al. 2006; Kamitakahara et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2008; Epstein 2009; Liu and Lun 2012). Dental applications of β-TCP are also known. For example, β-TCP is added to some brands of toothpaste as a gentle polishing agent (Dorozhkin 2013 c). Multivitamin complexes with CaPO 4 are widely available in the market and β-TCP is used as the calcium phosphate there. In addition, β-TCP serves as a texturizer, <b>bakery</b> <b>improver</b> and anti-clumping agent for dry powdered food (flour, milk powder, dried cream, cocoa powder). Besides, β-TCP is added as a dietary or mineral supplement to food and feed (Güngörmüş et al. 2010). Occasionally, β-TCP might be used as inert filler in pelleted drugs. Other applications comprise porcelains, pottery, enamel, using as a component for mordants and ackey, as well as a polymer stabilizer (Budavari et al. 1996). β-TCP of a technical grade (as either calcined natural phosphorites or bone dust) is used as a slow release fertilizer for acidic soils (Becker 1989).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to write down a review article about various aspects {{connected}} with staling of bakery products. Shelf life is directly associated with the staling process, which depends on the composition of bakery products and important are storage conditions as well. In the article are described particular components (starch, nonstarch polysacharides, water) and how they affect the staling process. Generally during staling of bakery products occur   processes related with starch retrogradation, moisture redistribution from the crumb to the crust and other interactions between components. Staling process could be delayed by using various <b>bakery</b> <b>improvers</b> like enzymes, hydrocolloids, emulgators and other compounds. Also useful is the application of suitable packaging techniques. doi: 10. 5219 / 124 </div...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{hydrothermal}} treatment {{of rice and}} corn flours on their potential as gluten free <b>bakery</b> <b>improvers</b> was tested. Hydrothermal treatment of flours {{was carried out by}} suspending flours in water on the basis of 5 / 1 (w/w) and heated until 65 °C. Corn or rice semolina supplemented by field bean semolina in ratio of 2 / 1 (w/w) were used for obtaining protein enriched gluten free breads, where improvers functionality was tested. Two central composite designs involving water hydration levels (X 1, X′ 1) and the level of hydrothermally treated rice or corn flours (X 2, X′ 2) were used. Instrumental analyses of breads (specific volume, moisture content, crumb texture and height/width ratio) were carried out {{to assess the impact of}} experimental factors. Results showed that hydrothermal treatment of rice or corn flours affected in different extent the bread properties, increasing the specific volume of breads and H/W ratio, and decreasing the hardness and chewiness of both types of breads. The optimum formulation for rice/field bean bread contained 7. 59 g/ 100 g treated rice flour and 96. 66 g/ 100 g water, and for corn/field bean bread the optimum included 4. 73 g/ 100 g treated corn and 78. 81 g/ 100 g water. Optimized breads were found acceptable according to color and texture structure.

The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{scientific}} grounding and development of polyalternative biotechnology of multivariate antiseptic preparations based on bacteriolysin and other antimicrobial products of the selected producer Streptomyces albus UN 44 with activity heightened in 4 ? 4, 5 times. The scheme of the supporting selection of producers, that includes step treatment with mutagens of different nature (nitrous acid, ultraviolet radiation, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- nitrosoguanidine) in set effective doses was proposed, and subsequent selection of overproducers. The complex taxonomic analysis of culture was first conducted, with the definition of the nucleotide sequence of 16 S rRNA gene and morphological, biochemical and biosynthetic features, that allowed to reidentify the culture as S. albus (initially S. recifensis var. lyticus). The possibility of replacing the hydrolyzed starch to molasses {{as a part of the}} nutrient medium for the biosynthesis of bacteriolysins by the selected strain was shown. Using the method of two-factor analysis of variance and central composite rotatable plan, the concentration of these components was optimized, which determined the price reduction of nutrient medium in 1, 5 - 2 times and the increase of the biosynthetic activity of the culture by 30 - 40 %. The increased stability and efficiency of the immobilized form of the bacteriolytic preparation from S. albus UN 44 were detected, which was prepared using adsorption on aerosil silica, and the main binding mechanisms in the enzymecarrier system were shown ? hydrogen bonds with silanol and OH-groups on the carrier surface, and the electrostatic interactions. The technological parameters of obtaining the immobilized drug were determined and became the basis of the Regulation (PR 20. 59 - 02070987 - 001 : 2015) and biotechnology of the bacteriolytic drug Cytorecifen-M, which has been implemented at SE "Enzyme". It was shown, that the antimicrobial action of the immobilized drug is not only useful on clinical strains of pathogens in a state of suspension, but leads to the inhibition (in 8 - 10 times) and the destruction of P. aeruginosa biomembrane. Stability of the bacteriolytic complex of S. albus UN 44 when stored in a liquid phase of culture fluid at a temperature to + 10 ?C and using of the sterilizing filtration has identified the possibility of developing a liquid form of antiseptics. Prospects for the use of this drug in veterinary medicine (and potentially medicine) are caused by the detected harmlessness of the producer, which is attributed to the group of the avirulent microorganisms (IV class of danger). The ability of the culture to synthesize complex antibiotics, which were identified using the matched system of two-stage extraction and fractionation, was detected for the first time. Using the methods of chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, the main antibiotic compounds of the culture were investigated and identified: bis (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (C 24 H 38 O 4) and 3 -O-metylcyclopolic acid (C 12 H 14 O 6) with molecular masses of 390, 3 and 254, 1 respectively. For obtaining the antibiotics of antifungal and antibacterial specificity, the extraction and fractionation system was chosen, using column chromatography and the eluents, accordingly, chloroform:isopropanol (97 : 3 ? 80 : 20) and chloroform or hexane:chloroform (1 : 1). The determined conditions of allocation of antibiotics were used to develop the technological foundations for obtaining another form of medication-antiseptic from S. albus UN 44. For the first time was defined the high antagonistic activity of S. albus UN 44 towards relatively common phytopathogenes of genera Bipolaris, Fusarium, Phytium, Rizoctonia, along with the shown growth-stimulating activity determines the feasibility of using one of the developed forms of antiseptics in crop. The culture fluid preparation with a concentration 108 ? 109 CFU/cm 3 can be produced in the form of a suspension or dried and granulated form. The immobilized form of the enzyme preparation is used in the development of patented synthetic detergent with antiseptic effect, which is recommended for everyday use and for washing in hospitals. The possibility of the Cytal drug usage was shown in the processes of the food industry for the preparation of <b>bakery</b> <b>improver,</b> that improves the product quality in organoleptic characteristics and the porosity (7 %). The mode of biomass degradation of selected lactic acid bacteria cultures using bacteriolysins for obtaining dietary supplements was developed and put into production. The composition of the mild medical form (ointment) was matched, using the Cytal preparation, which contains formative components in certain concentrations (polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, proxanol 268, glycerin), anesthetic (lidocaine), preservative (ofloxacin) and reveals the prolonged antimicrobial action. Based on the research, the technical design for essential equipment and biotechnology of various forms of antiseptic drugs were developed, the normative documentation for the production and recommendations for the use of drugs were approved. Some technologies and processes were tested and put into production, practice and teaching process. The practical significance of the results was confirmed by relevant implementing regulations, recommendations for use and patents. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????? ???? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????????????? ?????????? ???????????????
