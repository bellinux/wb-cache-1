5|$|Ethan Allen {{was born}} in Litchfield, Connecticut, the first-born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen, both of English and Puritan descent. The family moved {{to the town of}} Cornwall shortly after his birth. The move to Cornwall grew out of Allen's father's quest for freedom of {{religion}} during a time of turmoil: the Great Awakening, when Puritans were separating into churches with differing dogmas, in particular about the proper form of conversion: by works or <b>by</b> <b>grace.</b> His lifelong interest in philosophy and ideas emerged against the backdrop of his father's involvement in these Puritan debates and his father's refusal to convert to the covenant <b>by</b> <b>grace.</b> As a boy Allen already excelled at quoting the Bible and was known for disputing the meaning of passages.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Ramon Perellos became {{very active in}} {{correcting}} cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross <b>by</b> <b>grace).</b> This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime {{at the service of}} the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such prejudicial recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them.|$|E
5|$|The first match began under a {{cloud of}} Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance <b>by</b> <b>Grace,</b> though {{he would not have}} been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{mentioned}} in the literature in 1981, when Pierre Margot and Roy Watling described a specimen collected in 1969 <b>by</b> <b>Grace</b> Marie Taylor near the Franz Josef Glacier as an unnamed Psilocybe with affinities to the North American species Psilocybe caerulipes. It was officially described as new to science in 1995 by mycologists Peter R. Johnston and Peter K. Buchanan. In his 1996 book Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World, Paul Stamets noted that the two authors are known to work with law-enforcement officials to assist in prosecuting those who illegally collect psychoactive mushrooms.|$|E

5|$|Grace {{returned}} to London and played {{in his next}} match, starting on Monday, 13 May, for MCC against an England XI at Lord's. This was another first-class fixture, scheduled for three days but completed in two, the mostly professional England XI winning by 3 wickets. MCC won the toss, batted first and totalled 93, half of which were scored <b>by</b> <b>Grace</b> himself with 47. England reached 75–6 at the close and were all out for 115 on Tuesday morning, but MCC were then dismissed for only 58, Grace having been first out for 1. Nevertheless, England struggled to complete their victory and lost 7 wickets in scoring the necessary 37 runs. In cold, damp conditions it was therefore a bowlers' match. Grace was dismissed in both innings by Tom Emmett, who was well supported by Billy Midwinter and Alex Watson. The MCC attack was led by Alfred Shaw, who took 10 wickets. Grace bowled in the first innings only and returned figures of 3–43. Grace's 47 in the first innings was the top score in the game, the second highest being 30 by Arthur Shrewsbury for England. Grace sustained a thumb injury during the match which prevented him {{taking part in the}} England second innings.|$|E
5|$|Between January {{and the end}} of April 1684, the Republic of Venice {{accepted}} 4,200 {{families as}} settlers on the Venetian–Ottoman frontier, including 20,000 warriors. The Venetians provided them with food and 1,800 rifles, and their leaders were given monthly pay. The families were settled in the territory of Zadar and Šibenik, and around Klis. Pivljanin and his brother Dimitrije served in the cavalry bands in Zadar until Antonio Zeno, the extraordinary provveditore of Kotor, requested that they be sent for service in the Bay of Kotor. This was approved by Lorenzo Donà, the provveditore of Dalmatia, on 12April 1684. In September 1684 Pivljanin was documented as having been with his band in Herceg Novi, and in October in the area of Livno. The Venetian Senate thanked Pivljanin and Jovan Sikimić for their victory at Jezero, and approved Zeno's decision to reward them medals and sequins, on 12October 1684. Marino Mikiel, a Venetian commissary, writing {{of the state of the}} Venetian cavalry in Dalmatia on 26January 1685, highlighted that Stojan Janković and Pivljanin received the wages of cavalry soldiers due to their merit and <b>by</b> <b>grace</b> of the state, without having to effectively serve as soldiers. In March 1685 Pivljanin informed the Venetian extraordinary provveditore about his band's operations in the territory of the Republic of Ragusa; his band numbered 130 fighters and had three harambašas: Miho Kolumbara; Miloš Lepirić; and Božo Lučić. In February, they had captured a caravan with wheat in Zupci, stolen some cattle and burnt down the village of Glavska, attacked Cavtat and returned to Trebinje.|$|E
