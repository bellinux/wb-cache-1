5|$|Schnaufer {{was ordered}} to Carinhall, the {{residence}} of the Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, on 8 February 1945. Göring informed him about the intent to appoint him as Inspekteur der Nachtjäger (Inspector of the night fighter force), a role held by Oberst Werner Streib at the time. Schnaufer pushed back, not wanting to push out his friend and mentor from this position. He argued that he would <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> the German cause fighting the enemy. Göring was convinced and Schnaufer remained in his position as Geschwaderkommodore.|$|E
5|$|United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell {{determined}} that Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands would <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> as B-29 bases, {{but they were}} in Japanese hands. Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the islands were captured between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944. These bases were easily resupplied by cargo ships. The XXI Bomber Command began missions against Japan on November 18, 1944.|$|E
5|$|After {{construction}} of the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge was completed in late 1902, tolls were immediately charged along the one lane structure. However, unlike the other two bridges, the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge cost $0.22 (1902 USD). A person traveling on foot {{did not have to}} pay to cross the structure. This decision was different compared to the other bridges, which made it separate. Another decision was that ministers were not tolled so they could <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> their communities. However, when one minister began to abuse the special privilege, he was charged $0.05 for crossing. The tollhouse for collection was in Milanville and was run by the Dexter family.|$|E

5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians {{wanted to use the}} rapid transit. Since the Ring Line would increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E
5|$|San Giorgio {{spent several}} years in the Far East and Italian Somaliland {{after the war and}} became a {{training}} ship in 1931. After a brief deployment to Spain in 1936, she was reconstructed to <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> her role as a training ship. The ship's anti-aircraft armament was augmented when she was deployed to Tobruk, Libya to reinforce the port's defenses after Italy declared war on Britain in May 1940. San Giorgio was scuttled in early 1941 when Allied forces were poised to capture the port. Her wreck was salvaged in 1952, but sank while under tow. San Marco was converted into a target ship in the early 1930s and was found sunk {{at the end of the}} war. She was scrapped in 1949.|$|E
5|$|By spring 1944, the Me 262 was {{sufficiently}} ready for operational service. By this time, Galland faced rivalries amongst the Luftwaffe command over {{how best to}} employ the aircraft. Dietrich Peltz, commander of the IX. Fliegerkorps (9th Air Corps), {{wanted to use the}} aircraft as a weapon against a future Allied landing in France. Peltz saw the aircraft as an ideal fast bomber which could evade the overwhelming numbers of Allied piston-engine fighters and attack the landing grounds. Peltz also wished to use highly trained bomber pilots who he felt could <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> as home defence fighter pilots in place of the overextended and overworked Jagdwaffe. Their blind-weather experience and training, and background in multi-engine aircraft made them ideal for these operations in his view. In the first five months of 1944, Peltz' conventional bomber force had suffered a significant defeat over England in Operation Steinbock but it did not dull his appetite for offensive action or dent his reputation with Göring. Galland argued against his suggestion. Instead, Galland thought the bomber corps should be disbanded and its pilots converted onto fighters. Göring adopted Peltz' idea to impress Hitler and regain his waning influence.|$|E

5|$|However, Matsui {{had made}} it clear to his {{superiors}} even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped {{to play a role in}} forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that would <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> the interests of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, desperately wanted to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E
5|$|On Schröter's {{death in}} 1782, Horn {{decided to move}} to Paris to try a living as a musician. He left his home with little money and a {{suitcase}} of clothes. En route to Paris, he encountered a stranger in Hamburg by the name of Winkelman, who persuaded the impressionable Horn that London would <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> the aspirations of a young German musician than France. Winkelman accompanied him to London, but upon arriving, stole almost all of Horn's money and disappeared. Destitute and knowing no English, he wandered the streets of London before encountering a German-speaking Irishman, who sympathised with his plight. The man took Horn to the piano shop of Longman and Broderip at Cheapside, where Horn played the piano for its co-proprietor, Francis Fane Broderip. Impressed, Broderip introduced Horn to the Saxon ambassador John Maurice de Brühl. de Brühl recommended Horn to Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, who hired him as his daughters' music teacher.|$|E

5|$|She {{acted as}} a royal yacht for Crown Prince Umberto's 1924 tour of South America and then {{deployed}} to the Indian Ocean to support operations in Italian Somaliland in 1925–26. San Giorgio served as a training ship from 1930 to 1935 and was then rebuilt in 1937–38 to <b>better</b> <b>serve</b> in that role. As part of her reconstruction, she received a modern anti-aircraft suite that was augmented before she was transferred to bolster the defences of Tobruk shortly before Italy declared war on the Allies in mid-1940. San Giorgio was forced to scuttle herself in early 1941 as the Allies moved in to occupy the port. Her wreck {{was used as an}} immobile repair ship by the British from 1943 through 1945. Salvaged in 1952, she sank while under tow to Italy to be broken up.|$|E
