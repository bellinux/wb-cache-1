5|$|Balthier is Archadian {{by birth}} (as {{evidenced}} by his English accent, {{which is used}} by Archadian characters in the game), and eventually reveals he is , the son of Imperial magicite researcher Dr. Cid (Cidolfus Demen Bunansa). Balthier received many privileges as Cid's son, including being made an Imperial Judge, but eventually cut ties with his father when Cid became consumed by his experimentation with nethicite. He left {{the service of the}} empire, stole an Archadian airship, and took a new name. Balthier is now a renowned career criminal with a sizable bounty on his head, and must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> avoid the attention of both the law and the bounty hunters seeking the reward for his capture. He originally joins the resistance in the hope of reacquiring the Dusk Shard, but when he learns it is actually a piece of nethicite, he sees too much of his father's obsession in his own quest and decides to abandon the search. After the party defeats Dr. Cid at the Pharos, Balthier makes peace with his father and helps the group to destroy the Sky Fortress Bahamut as penance for Cid's deeds.|$|E

25|$|Because aortic {{dissection}} {{may present}} {{to the emergency room}} physician similar to a myocardial infarction, the physician must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> make the proper diagnosis prior to initiating treatment for myocardial infarction since the treatment regimen for myocardial infarction can be lethal to an individual presenting with aortic dissection.|$|E
25|$|Counselors serving ACOAs need to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> {{not assume}} that the client’s {{presenting}} problems are due solely to the parent’s alcoholism.

25|$|The Green Line is {{actually}} four different lines; it starts as one trunk line but then splits into four different branches, the B (Boston College), C (Cleveland Circle), D (Riverside) and E (Heath Street) trains. Because the split is only relevant on the outbound direction of travel, one may take any train inbound, but when going outbound one must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> board the correct train. The Red Line splits as well, with southbound trains going either to Braintree or Ashmont.|$|E

25|$|After {{the normal}} lords was the tánaise ríg, who was {{supposed}} to be heir to the throne. He had higher property qualifications than the aire forgill, but his prime claim to higher status was that he would one day be king. Kings held the highest status that the laws describe. The basic king had an honour price of seven cumals, and higher kings had yet a higher status. Having the highest status, the king especially was expected to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> keep his honour. Cowardice, as demonstrated in flight from battle, as well as taking up manual labour might cost him his honour-price.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April Rear-Admiral Herbert Sawyer, {{based at}} Bermuda, {{instructed}} Bingham to meet Captain Pechell in , who was cruising {{somewhere along the}} Atlantic seaboard between Charlestown and New York City. If {{he was unable to}} make contact with Pechell, Bingham was to cruise along the coast, protecting British ships and intercepting enemy vessels and eventually return to Halifax. Sawyer warned Bingham to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> avoid a clash with the Americans and to stay out of American ports except in the case of dire necessity. In the event, Bingham did not locate Guerriere, and continued to cruise along the coast.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone often {{increases}} serum potassium {{levels and}} can cause hyperkalemia, a very serious condition. Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} people using this drug avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Physicians must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> monitor potassium levels in both males and females who are taking spironolactone as a diuretic, especially during the first twelve months of use and whenever the dosage is increased. Doctors may also recommend that some patients may be advised to limit dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods. However, recent data suggests that both potassium monitoring and dietary restriction of potassium intake is unnecessary in healthy young women taking spironolactone for acne.|$|E

25|$|When {{measurable}} quantities involve cross products, the handedness of the coordinate systems used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, {{it should be}} possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system (including handedness). To avoid problems, one should <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must take into account that when the handedness of the coordinate system is not fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a pseudovector. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.|$|E
25|$|In some fonts, if the {{lowercase}} letters fi {{are placed}} adjacently, the dot-like {{upper end of}} the f would fall inconveniently close to the dot of the i, and therefore a ligature glyph is provided with the top of the f extended to serve as the dot of the i. A similar ligature for ffi is also possible. Since the unligatured forms are unattractive and the ligatures make the i dotless, such fonts are not appropriate for use in a Turkish setting. However, the fi ligatures of some fonts do not merge the letters and instead space them next to each other, with the dot on the i remaining. Such fonts are appropriate for Turkish, but the writer must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> be consistent in the use of ligatures.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{issues related to}} the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance. It has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high. Some studies even show that 80% of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 30–36 months. While reinfection may occur, it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes. There are also increasing concerns about the issue of drug resistance. Drug resistance has appeared in front-line anthelmintics used for livestock nematodes. Generally human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times, less frequent treatment, and more targeted treatment. Nonetheless, the global community must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> maintain the effectiveness of current anthelmintic as no new anthelmintic drugs are in the late-stage development.|$|E

25|$|At least sixteen pretenders during Catherine's reign {{claimed that}} they were the deposed tsar, Peter III. A less common {{position}} pretenders claimed during Catherine's reign was that of Ivan VI. Ivan VI was a potential threat to Catherine since he was exiled as an infant and could lay claim to the throne. Peter III was the more popular option for pretenders since there existed legends that he was not actually dead, allowing pretenders to convince discontented Russians they were Peter III. Peter III was also popular among Russians because of his benevolent rule. Pretenders claiming to be Peter III used his popularity among Russians to gain support. Pretenders had to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> establish themselves as the ruler they claimed to be without being recognised as a normal mortal and not of royal blood. One popular way to prevent recognition was to claim their right to royalty far from their home as both Emal'Ian Ivanovich Pugachev and the pretender Artem'ev did. Pretenders also had to account for where they had disappeared to for the time since their reported deaths. For example, Pugachev claimed that he spent the eleven years since Peter III's reported death wandering abroad as far as Egypt or Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|Surfing, {{like all}} water sports, carries the {{inherent}} danger of drowning. Anyone {{at any age}} can learn to surf, but {{should have at least}} intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.|$|E

[...] He followed that up at 10:49 by reporting that, [...] "We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning, north of the Somerset County Airport, which is in western Pennsylvania, not too terribly far from Pittsburgh, about 80 miles or so, a Boeing 767 jet.

500|$|Peggy's {{breast cancer}} storyline was devised at the {{suggestion}} of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea [...] "that had been knocking about for a long time." [...] In Lesley Henderson's book, Social Issues in Television Fiction, an EastEnders researcher explains that: [...] "A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with. The programme sought expert advice on [...] "storyline visuals" [...] {{from a variety of sources}} including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals. There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: [...] "EastEnders is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've got to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development." ...|$|E
