500|$|Curtis's {{remaining}} {{career was}} based at {{a series of}} shore stations, initially as commander-in-chief Cape of Good Hope Station at Cape Town between 1800 and 1803, which he reportedly hated. In 1804 {{he was promoted to}} full admiral, and subsequently employed in Britain from 1805 to 1807 as part of the [...] "Commission for revising the civil affairs of His Majesty's navy". [...] This latter role was an important position and Curtis performed well, introducing many beneficial reforms to the service. In 1802 Curtis's eldest son Roger, a post captain in the navy, died suddenly while on duty. In 1809, after 40 years of naval service, Curtis took his final command, that of Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. In 1810, he performed his last significant duty, when he presided over the highly controversial court martial examining the conduct of Lord Gambier at the Battle of Basque Roads. At the battle, Gambier had failed to support Captain Lord Cochrane and missed an opportunity to destroy the French Brest Fleet.

Gambier responded by demanding a court martial to pass judgement on his actions. Gambier and Curtis had fought together at the Glorious First of June and had <b>been</b> <b>friends</b> <b>for</b> many years, and Curtis could be counted on by those in authority to [...] "show strong partiality in favour of the accused." [...] Under instructions from the Admiralty, Curtis and the other officers judging the case found in Gambier's favour and the trial inevitably ended with the court pronouncing that Gambier's behaviour [...] "was marked by zeal, judgement, ability, and an anxious attention to the welfare of his majesty's service".|$|E

Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
