The group offers courses titled “Neurobiology of Consciousness” and “Cognitive Neurobiology.” Its website lists the papers generated from its lab work, focusing on the neural correlates of perceptual consequences and visual attention. The group’s current work is aimed at detailing a dynamic known as ‘multistable perception.’ The phenomenon, described in a sentence: “Certain visual displays are not perceived in a stable way but, {{from time to time}} and seemingly spontaneously, their appearance wavers and settles in a distinctly different form.” ...|$|E

25|$|The Chronobiology Laboratory {{studies the}} {{biological}} rhythms of insects. It {{was established in}} 1987, when researcher-in-charge Mirian David Marques finished her internship in chronobiology at the University of Minnesota. Research methods used in the laboratory include automated (or visual) records of insect behavior. When rhythms are detected the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of specimens are studied, searching for rhythm-generating centers using histology, histochemistry and molecular <b>biology.</b> <b>Groups</b> studied include springtails (Isotomidae), mosquitoes (Culicidae), crickets (Phalangopsinae), ants (Formicidae) and bees (Apidae).|$|R
