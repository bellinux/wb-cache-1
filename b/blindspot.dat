40|$|Leveraged loans {{have reached}} new {{peaks in the}} post-crisis period. This Article assesses U. S. {{leveraged}} loan regulation and highlights {{the ways in which}} the entity- or institution-based focus of regulation have been the source of critical <b>blindspots</b> that have limited the ability of regulators to monitor and address the risks of leveraged lending. First, the current regulatory strategy, which relies on institutions to set their own definitions of and standards for leveraged lending activities, magnifies regulatory conflicts that are inherent in a fragmented regulatory structure like the United States. Second, the institution-based regulatory boundaries in leveraged loan regulation create regulatory gaps and exclude a significant number of leveraged loans, particularly in the market 2 ̆ 7 s riskiest segments, from regulatory oversight. Third, the regulatory focus on protecting individual institutions from the risks of leveraged lending may inadequately protect or even undermine the safety and soundness of the financial system. To manage these <b>blindspots,</b> the Article suggests a shift from an institution-based toward a loan-based perspective in the regulation of leveraged loans, and describes how this regulatory shift could be achieved by relying on the regulatory infrastructure enabled by the passage of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{aim of the}} study was to {{understand}} the nature of <b>blindspots</b> in the vision of drivers of trucks caused by vehicle design variables such as cab design. The paper is the second of two submitted to ICED 17. This paper focuses upon the results for the quantification of <b>blindspots</b> and the first paper presents the methodology (Marshall & Summerskill, 2017). In order to establish the cause and nature of blind spots 19 top selling trucks were scanned and imported into the SAMMIE DHM system. A CAD based vision projection technique allowed multiple mirror and window aperture projections to be created. By determining where simulated VRUs could be positioned without being visible in the direct vision of a driver, the vehicles were compared. By comparing the drivers eye height and the obscuration distance of VRUs a correlation was identified. By exploring the design features of outliers in this correlation, it was determined that direct vision blind spots are affected by various design variables. This led to the definition of a requirement for a direct vision standard for trucks, with a standard now being defined by the authors in a project funded by Transport for London...|$|R

I argue that the “normative variance” exhibited by this norm is not a defect.

I finish by considering an alternative possible subjunctive form of norm that would also avoid problems with <b>blindspots</b> but suggest this has a non-intuitive consequence. A number of writers have claimed that beliefs must, in some interestingly normative sense, constitutively aim at truth 1.
