5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E

The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E

A strategic planning model is provided and students are instructed to apply {{the steps of the}} model to six – and up to a dozen cases – during a semester. This is sufficient to develop their ability to analyze a complex situation, generate a variety of possible strategies and to select the <b>best</b> <b>ones.</b> In effect, students learn a {{generally applicable}} approach to analyze cases studies and real situations. This approach does not make any extraordinary demands on the artistic and dramatic talents of the teacher. Consequently, most professors are capable of supervising application of this method.|$|E

He sent copies of those tapes to people he felt would be interested in the recordings, asking them to spread the word. Delerium originally intended to release all of that material in a double debut album, but Wilson decided to just pick the songs he considered the <b>best</b> <b>ones.</b> These songs were mastered to make Porcupine Tree's first studio album, On the Sunday of Life... (1991); all of the leftover tracks would be later released on a compilation album called Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994).|$|E

25|$|Node lookups {{can proceed}} asynchronously. The {{quantity}} of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes {{in its own}} k-buckets that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, they will look in their k-buckets and return the k closest nodes to the desired key that they know. The requester will update a results list with the results (node ID's) he receives, keeping the k <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> (the k nodes that are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these k best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Because every node has a better knowledge of his own surroundings than any other node has, the received results will be other nodes that are every time {{closer and closer to}} the searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer than the best previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are the ones in the whole network that are the closest to the desired key.|$|E

About.com writer Deb Aoki commented that after his fight with the Third Hokage, Orochimaru was in poor shape to the point being {{replaced}} by the Akatsuki organization as the new antagonists. In the book The Rough Guide to Manga, [...] Jason S. Yadao notes Orochimaru impact in Part I of the series due to his influence on one of the protagonists, Sasuke, to abandon his comrades and join him. Nevertheless, Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime described him as [...] "sinister" [...] and noted her proposal to revive Tsunade's loved ones in exchange to healing his arms made it appealing. Additionally, Kimlinger considered Kujira, Orochimaru's Japanese voice actress, as one of the <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> from the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{changes to}} the story were mostly superficial, and the {{adaptation}} generally mirrors the novella's tone. The television critic Matthew Baylis observed that the film creates unease and horror through distortions of reality, and that The Turn of the Screw is not a [...] "screaming-banshees-and-horrible-corpses style of ghost story". The film utilises subtle horror, including details such as a broken doll on a window ledge, {{and the fact that}} viewers never discover certain elements of the story (for example, it is never revealed why the character Miles has been suspended from his boarding school). This, for Baylis, ties to the title of the film: [...] "it's the writer who puts the screw in the hole and the <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> ask the audience to turn it themselves".|$|E

Additionally, GamesRadar used Liu Kang {{as an example of a}} stereotype of gaming heroes who reveal an evil alter ego that ruins the character's appealing traits, and considered him to be [...] "a little like the Shaolin version of Goku, in that he's saved his world countless times and come back from the dead even more frequently." [...] GamesRadar featured him the article about [...] "kickass Bruce Lee clones" [...] citing his similarities with Bruce Lee and with one of his shouts featured in famous quotes. Liu Kang's darker characterization starting with Deception and in the reboot were received with good critical response as Den of Geek listed him as the 22nd best Mortal Kombat character due to this aspect.|$|E

RPGFan editor Stephen Harris compared his voice to that of Ian Fleming's depiction of Bond. 1UP.com editor Andrew Pfister compared the duo of Balthier and Fran to that of Han Solo and Chewbacca, two characters from the Star Wars franchise, adding that they are far more interesting than any other character in the [...] "modern FF era". Gideon Emery's work as Balthier's English voice actor was acclaimed by Eurogamer writer Martin Robinson as one of the <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> from the entire game as [...] "it's fascinating to think how the game's wider perception might have changed if he was placed as the leading man".

500|$|In the English-language version, IGN {{said that}} the {{character}} [...] "has a tendency to speak a little too high and fast when he gets excited". Andrew Long of RPGamer criticized James Arnold Taylor's work, saying that Tidus is supposed to sound [...] "impulsive and energetic" [...] but his dialogue is [...] "stupid and childish". Eurogamer's Tom Brawell agreed, calling Tidus' voice [...] "whiny" [...] and [...] "detestable". Despite his dislike of the voice acting, Chris Carter of Destructoid enjoyed playing as Tidus in the crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy and looked forward to its reboot. On the other hand, PSXextreme liked Taylor's work in voicing Tidus. In the book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century, the writers recalled that Tidus' characterization differs in the original Japanese release of Final Fantasy X and its English dub; the localized version failed to emulate the original Tidus. In a Final Fantasy X scene, Yuna tells Tidus to laugh (to cheer him up) and Tidus forces a laugh. Although fans criticised the laughter as too forced, Taylor {{said that it was}} supposed to sound like that and they should [...] "get over it".

Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he [...] "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant." [...] On the other hand, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it [...] "is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and [...] "an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next." [...] Though there are several apocalyptic action shows, Carlo Santos noted that [...] "few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does".

[...] Gaming Age writer Jeff Keely praised Kyo's redesign in The King of Fighters '99 as he felt less overpowered than in previous games which helped to balance the cast. The ending of Kyo in The King of Fighters '97 has been considered by 1UP.com as one of the strangest parts of the story. However, they considered Kyo's winning pose as the best from the series. On the other hand, 4thletter enjoyed Kyo's ending with Chizuru Kagura and Iori, stating [...] "this [...] " [...] as it was closing the ending of the Orochi story arc from the series. Damien McFerran of Virtual Console Reviews considered Kyo one of the most excellent creations from The King of Fighters series, as well as the most original one. Lucke M.

Several items of Sasuke merchandise have been released, including plush toys with his Part I and Part II appearances, key chains, and numerous figurines. Theatergoers for the Boruto film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Sasuke and Sarada's images. NTT customers voted him their fifth favorite black haired male anime character in 2014. IGN also listed him as the seventh best Naruto character when the series ended in 2014. In a Japanese pollsters' Charapedia poll, Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry won first place. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted the 13th [...] "Best Guy". In developing the fighting game , CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama stated his favorite fight in making the series was the one between Sasuke and Itachi. In an interview of Mezamashi TV, Kishimoto was given questions by Nogizaka46's band member Rina Ikoma who was cosplaying as Sasuke; Kishimoto complimented Ikoma's cosplay. At New York's 2015 Comic-Con, stage moderator Christopher Butcher and editor Jo Otsuki discussed Sasuke's great popularity, noting that he became the series' most popular character. Otsuki admitted Sasuke was his own favorite character in the series. Butcher was surprised by this given Sasuke's pessimistic worldview and its contrast to Naruto's more positive outlook. Butcher wondered whether readers found Sasuke a more relatable character after the defeat of his worldview by Naruto's in the series finale. Otsuki thought that fans found Sasuke's character and abilities cooler than his rival, and given the similarities between these two characters and the series' happy ending, he thought Sasuke found a more positive worldview by the end. Animation director Chengxi Huang considered the battle between Sasuke and Killer Bee as one of <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> he saw in anime.|$|E
