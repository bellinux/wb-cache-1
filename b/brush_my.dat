2500|$|Aqua {{released}} {{their third}} single [...] "Barbie Girl" [...] in May 1997. The song, at first glance, {{appears to be}} about the popular children's doll Barbie. However, at second glance, the song contains several sexual overtones, such as [...] "You can <b>brush</b> <b>my</b> hair, undress me everywhere", [...] "You can touch, you can play", and [...] "Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky-panky". This caused some controversy upon its release in Denmark, but despite the controversy and perhaps partly due to it, it still sold well and easily made number one in the charts. The song was so popular that it was played regularly on radio stations which did not air dance music. Universal Music decided to ignore complaints about the double meanings in [...] "Barbie Girl", and successfully released the single around the world in September and October 1997. The release was highly successful, making number one in the United Kingdom for four weeks, in Australia for three weeks, and even managing to make the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, something rarely achieved at the time by European pop acts. The song and group became a household name overnight, but to most of the world were instantly written off as a one-hit wonder. The double meanings in [...] "Barbie Girl" [...] caused the expected controversy, with many complaints aimed at Universal for releasing the track.|$|E

5000|$|Commas {{are often}} used to {{separate}} clauses. In English, a comma is used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first: After I fed the cat, I <b>brushed</b> <b>my</b> clothes. (Compare this with I <b>brushed</b> <b>my</b> clothes after I fed the cat.) A relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive, as in I cut down all the trees, which were {{over six feet tall}}.

60|$|In strange towns I made {{immediate}} acquaintances in the saloons.

6000|$|That night, when {{my mother}} came to kiss me good-night, I turned my face {{to the wall and}} pretended to be asleep, for {{children}} as well as grown-ups have their foolish moods; but when I felt the soft curls <b>brush</b> <b>my</b> cheek, my pride gave way, and clasping my arms about her neck, and drawing her face still closer down to mine; I voiced the question that all the evening had been knocking at my heart: ...|$|E

6000|$|...
