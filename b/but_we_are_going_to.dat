500|$|On 29 September 2014, Osbourne told Metal Hammer that Black Sabbath {{would begin}} {{work on their}} twentieth studio album in early 2015 with {{producer}} Rick Rubin, followed by a final tour in 2016. In an April 2015 interview, however, Osbourne said that these plans [...] "could change", and added, [...] "We all live in different countries {{and some of them}} want to work and some of them don't want to, I believe. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do another tour together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Elizabeth's {{personality}} and views has been compiled from impressions and descriptions by those she has met. Canadian politician Michael Ignatieff remarked in 2010, after a private audience with the Queen, how he was struck by her [...] "wonderful sense of the absurd" [...] and noted her [...] "sense of humour, that sense of the absurd, that sense of comedy of life has survived 60 years of gruelling public life." [...] After a weekend at Balmoral Castle hosted by the Queen, Canadian Governor General Michaëlle Jean recounted witnessing a relaxed, informal home life: Elizabeth and her family preparing a meal together—including a salad dressing devised by the Queen—and doing the washing up afterwards. Lady Pamela Hicks, a cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, commented on Elizabeth's personality as [...] "individualistic". Hicks' mother remembers back to when George VI died. Elizabeth was in Kenya with her husband when she found out, [...] "I’m so sorry, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have to go back to}} England," [...] she recalled Elizabeth saying.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{never have}} had," [...] she answered. [...] "You know that, Everard, and alas! I know it. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on pretending, aren't we?" ...|$|R
60|$|Child. Oh! <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to---- <b>But</b> I won't tell you. [To {{the other}} children.] Come away here, and we'll not {{tell him what}} we'll do.|$|R
6000|$|... 'About an {{hour after}} daylight. Yes, nearly three hours from camp. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> faster now than we did then. We {{ought to do it}} in two hours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we'll {{have to go}}!" [...] {{had been}} Shep's answer. [...] "Of course we'll {{have to go to}} school, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a long {{vacation}} around the holidays--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{he said in}} a {{tone that}} warmed her heart, [...] "I know, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try, and make life easier for you now, and you must feel that this is home and we are friends." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay, we told her. It was a {{very good}} room; she could surely get a few things to put in it, and in the {{meantime}} we would go and forage for provisions to last us till Monday.|$|E
6000|$|... "The xebec and polacre {{are gaining}} on us, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> as fast {{through the water}} as the three master. When we get the wind a little more, we shall have the heels of them all.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Capadose {{appeared}} not {{to perceive}} {{it or not}} to heed it if she did. 'There was a person, not far from your door, whom Clement called my attention to. He told me something about her <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> the other way.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> {{to trust}} {{ourselves}} to any such harem-scarem contrivance as this. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> up {{in a regular}} balloon.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{explains}} the whole matter," [...] Francis said. [...] "We {{do not mean}} to fight the Genoese fleet, if we can help it; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to put them in a cage, and then we shall not be afraid of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Margery; [...] "we must go together, {{otherwise}} {{mother would}} {{know nothing about}} him, and I should be talking to no purpose. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do everything frankly and openly and go straight to her, and put our happiness in her hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{must always}} love it, my dear child; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> our home, Henrietta, to your father's home {{in life and}} death, {{and it must be}} good for us to be there. With your grandfather, who has wished for us. Knight Sutton is our true home, the one where it is right for us to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to speak}} of some further reward that her amiable behavior, in this instance, {{procured}} her. As her father opened a package which he had brought on his return, he silently placed in her hands a beautiful copy of a newly-published work, upon the fly-leaf of which she found written--"Maria Wilton--a reward for her kind and obliging manners towards her brothers and sisters." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yahşibey Evleri - Nevaz Sayın says, [...] "We put a rule to {{ourselves}} {{just at the}} beginning. <b>We</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make like its been made from years <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make it better. We decided the borders and we let the worker decide how to make it.we tried to find something new in the routine. It was {{an important factor in}} the similarizing demand that this house had no distance from the houses surrounding it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] replied Queen Aquareine. [...] "I cannot {{say that}} you will be exposed to any danger at all, so long as I'm with you. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> into the {{neighborhood}} of such fierce and even terrible beings which would attack you at once did they suspect you to be earth people. So in order to guard your safety, I intend to draw the Magic Circle around both of you before we start." ...|$|R
60|$|Now we {{have but}} {{to attach the}} car, get in, and cut loose. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be very careful on this trip, and so we will attach a {{parachute}} to the balloon. I hope we may not use it, but it may save us {{in case of an}} accident. This is {{the manner in which the}} parachute will hang from the bottom of the car.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is absurd!" [...] Laverick exclaimed protestingly. [...] "I {{have been}} feeling worried myself, but there's nothing so terrifying in losing one's money, after all. As {{a matter of}} fact, things are {{altogether}} better in the city to-day. You {{made a big mistake}} in taking us out of our depth, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pull through, after all. 'Unions' have been going up all day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, such an estimable purpose; {{and as we}} {{wished to}} do it {{thoroughly}} well, I asked Mr. Somerset to design us the costumes, and he has now sent me the sketches. It is quite a secret at present, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> play Shakespeare's romantic drama, 'Love's Labour's Lost,' {{and we hope to}} get Miss Power to take the leading part. You see, being such a handsome girl, and so wealthy, and rather an undiscovered novelty in the county as yet, she would draw a crowded room, and greatly benefit the funds.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I am delayed, my good André, then anyhow {{the game}} <b>is</b> up. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> to {{anticipate}} misfortune and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to believe in}} our lucky star." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> to Pharsalia," [...] protested Don Jose, with nervous haste, also in English. [...] "You {{should not}} jest like this, Martin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may <b>be,</b> Bertie; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> {{to begin}} by being lazy. There is always {{something}} to see in foreign lands by those who keep their eyes open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "WE {{are going}} to have a change of weather, I reckon," [...] Hiram said one {{afternoon}} as they were drifting down the stream during their second voyage. [...] "You have been lucky since we started, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a change at last; and I can tell you when it blows here it's a caution. They have been having a lot of rain up the country, for the river has been rising regular for the last ten days. We had best make fast for the night, and the sooner we does it the better, for the wind is getting up fast and the rain is just a-going to begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Faulkner sat {{silent for}} a few minutes. [...] "I am so glad you came to me," [...] she said presently. [...] "I have always known Miss Port as a scandal-monger and a mischief-maker, but I never thought {{of her as a}} wicked woman. This {{persecution}} of you is shameful, but when I think of your niece it is past belief! You are right, Captain Asher; it must be a woman who must take up your cause. In fact," [...] said she after a moment's thought, [...] "it must be women. Yes, sir." [...] And as she spoke her face flushed with enthusiasm. [...] "I am going to take up your cause, and my friends in there, the ladies of the Dorcas Society, will stand by me, I know. I don't know what we shall do, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand by you and your niece." ...|$|E
6000|$|But what I {{started to}} say, was, that I have just read Part II of Indian Summer, {{and to my}} mind there isn't a waste line in it, or one that could be improved. I read it yesterday, ending with that opinion; and read it again to-day, ending with the same opinion emphasized. I haven't read Part I yet, because that number must have reached Hartford after we left; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> send down town for a copy, {{and when it comes}} I am to read both parts aloud to the family. It is a {{beautiful}} story, and makes a body laugh all the time, and cry inside, and feel so old and so forlorn; and gives him gracious glimpses of his lost youth that fill him with a measureless regret, and build up in him a cloudy sense of his having been a prince, once, in some enchanted far-off land, and of being an exile now, and desolate--and Lord, no chance ever to get back there again! That is the thing that hurts. Well, you have done it with marvelous facility and you make all the motives and feelings perfectly clear without analyzing the guts out of them, the way George Eliot does. I can't stand George Eliot and Hawthorne and those people; I see what they are at a hundred years before they get to it and they just tire me to death. And as for [...] "The Bostonians," [...] I would rather be damned to John Bunyan's heaven than read that.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{recorded}} three albums with Glass Harp, Keaggy {{left the}} band in 1972. Keaggy says, [...] "We enjoyed playing {{together and we}} really got tight musically. <b>But</b> spiritually <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> different directions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to {{walk over}} the pass," [...] said Rollo. [...] "The road is too steep and rocky for horses. <b>But</b> then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have a horse to carry the trunk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all <b>going</b> to give something. I headed {{the paper with}} my five dollars; for if it is done at all, {{it must be done}} handsome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{meaning of}} the outrages on Orientals," [...] replied Fisher, [...] "is that the financiers have {{introduced}} Chinese labor into this country with the deliberate intention of reducing workmen and peasants to starvation. Our unhappy politicians have made concession after concession; {{and now they are}} asking concessions which amount to our ordering a massacre of our own poor. If we do not fight now we shall never fight again. They will have put England in an economic position of starving in a week. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight now; I shouldn't wonder if there were an ultimatum in a week and an invasion in a fortnight. All the past corruption and cowardice is hampering us, of course; the West country is pretty stormy and doubtful even in a military sense; and the Irish regiments there, that are supposed to support us by the new treaty, are pretty well in mutiny; for, of course, this infernal coolie capitalism is being pushed in Ireland, too. But it's to stop now; and if the government message of reassurance gets through to them in time, they may turn up after all by the time the enemy lands. For my poor old gang is going to stand to its guns at last. Of course it's only natural that when they have been whitewashed for half a century as paragons, their sins should come back on them at the very moment when they are behaving like men {{for the first time in}} their lives. Well, I tell you, March, I know them inside out; and I know they are behaving like heroes. Every man of them ought to have a statue, and on the pedestal words like those of the noblest ruffian of the Revolution: 'Que mon nom soit fletri; que la France soit libre.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Breuil {{was well}} known and {{respected}} in the industry. One industry member wrote of Breuil's short retirement in Moving Picture World, “Breuil has worked constantly {{for the last three}} years without cessation and is entitled to a little ‘loafing time’ before she again gets into the traces.... <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> miss Mrs. Breuil” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "In {{eighteen}} {{million years}} we didn't change; we must change it, {{and it is}} given in your hand to take the flag.

6000|$|... "I hope <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to cross}} this evening, if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to cross at all," [...] Pierre Leroux said. [...] "It is cold enough now, <b>but</b> if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to pass the}} night here, it will be bitter." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Lydon (1984): [...] "It was {{originally}} 'Bad Life', then {{it went to}} 'Mad Max'. There were two sets of lyrics, see, for the same song. Well, things got a bit haywire <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to put out the}} same song with different lyrics as a- and b-side the 'Bad Life' single. But that never came to pass." [...] "We gave Levene songwriting credit for that but we'd sacked him before the album was even started. You know, it was just on good faith. Many of the songs were written before he quit, but his participation in all honesty was zero." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Puteoli was a {{great place}} in old times," [...] said Rollo; [...] "and that's {{the reason why they}} had such an immense amphitheatre here. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see the ruins of it presently; <b>but</b> first, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see Solfatara." ...|$|R
