On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c).

He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording and <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ben Patashnik of Rock Sound {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} eight out of ten. He did note the [...] "varnished" [...] production, making it [...] "hard {{to fall in love}} with until {{repeated}} listens unleash its true charms."

[...] British rock magazine Kerrang! awarded an [...] "excellent" [...] four K! score and opined, [...] "Invented is a return to the creative peaks of yore.
