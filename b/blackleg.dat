5|$|<b>Blackleg</b> is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like <b>blackleg</b> and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and <b>blackleg</b> (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
25|$|The police mutiny {{broke out}} when the RIC were ordered to play a more {{participative}} role during their routine escort of traction engines driven by <b>blackleg</b> carters through the city. <b>Blackleg</b> carters had been recruited to drive the traction engines that {{had been sent to}} Belfast to deliver the goods which had been unable to leave the port due to the striking carters. The traction engines, equipped with makeshift armour, were almost always blocked en route by flying pickets. The RIC were enlisted to provide an escort for the <b>blackleg</b> carters, who constantly came under attack. In one incident in East Belfast, a crowd of shipyard workers threw a telegraph pole at a <b>blackleg</b> carter and his traction engine. The merchandise he had been transporting ended up in the nearby Connswater River.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) later mutinied when {{ordered to}} escort the <b>blackleg</b> drivers of {{traction}} engines used {{to replace the}} striking carters. Order was eventually restored when British Army troops were deployed. Although largely unsuccessful, the dock strike led {{to the establishment of}} the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.|$|E
25|$|Most of the dockers in Belfast were {{employees}} of magnate Thomas Gallaher who owned Gallaher's Tobacco Factory {{and served as}} chairman of Belfast Steamship Company. Gallaher and Kelly were forewarned about the strike, and had sent to Dublin for 50 <b>blackleg</b> dockers and coal heavers to fill the strikers' places. Feeling that a strike was premature at this point in time, Larkin sent the dockers and coal heavers back to work. Upon their return, however, the men discovered that they were locked out with the imported blacklegs working in their stead. The locked-out NUDL dockers and coal heavers proceeded to force the blacklegs away from the Belfast Steamship Company's sheds and the coal merchant's quay.|$|E
25|$|On 19 July, RIC Constable William Barrett {{refused to}} sit beside the <b>blackleg</b> driver of a {{traction}} engine {{who had been}} promised personal police protection by his employer. After flatly refusing to obey District Inspector Thomas Keaveney when the latter ordered him to accompany the driver, he was promptly suspended. In response, 300 angry policemen attended a meeting at Musgrave Street Barracks and declared {{their support for the}} strike. A brawl instantly broke out inside the barracks when Barrett resisted attempts by RIC officers to arrest him. This led to another 800 policemen (about 70 per cent of the police force) joining the mutiny. They refused to offer any protection to the blacklegs, made no further attempts to disperse the strikers' pickets and Larkin persuaded them to carry out their own strike for higher wages and better pensions. In 1907, policemen's pay in Belfast ranged from £66, 16 shillings to £78 per annum. This was a wage just marginally above that earned by the best-paid dockers and carters.|$|E

[...] The same chemicals were found to be useful in the routine disinfection and deodorization of latrines, sewers, markets, abattoirs, anatomical theatres, and morgues. They were successful in hospitals, lazarets, prisons, infirmaries (both on land and at sea), magnaneries, stables, cattle-sheds, etc.; and they were beneficial during exhumations, embalming, outbreaks of epidemic disease, fever, and <b>blackleg</b> in cattle.|$|E

2500|$|The tide {{suddenly}} {{turned in the}} dockers' favour when carters on the railway company quays refused to transport goods unloaded from the ships by the Dublin <b>blackleg</b> dockers. On 4 July after submitting a general pay claim, Larkin called the thousand remaining carters of Belfast, who were employed by the 60 firms of the Master Carriers Association, out on a sympathy strike. Gallaher and the other employers had no means of getting their merchandise out of the port. The Belfast Newsletter commented on the situation with the following words: [...] "It was remarkable to see the stagnation which existed from the Custom House to the Clarendon Dock. With the exception of an isolated van or lorry driven by the obvious amateur, there was scarcely a sign of life or movement". Soon afterwards engineers and boilermakers were striking; workplaces {{all over the city}} stopped production and shut down. The strike escalated into bitter violence when shipyard workers burnt company vans, hurled rocks at the police and attacked blacklegs with [...] "shipyard confetti" [...] which consisted of rivets, nuts and bolts. <b>Blackleg</b> workers had to be billeted aboard a ship in the Belfast Lough for their own safety.|$|E

He was sired by the Duke of Devonshire's Flying Childers, who was undefeated in six {{starts as}} a racecourse. Flying Childers {{was also a}} {{successful}} stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain twice. Amongst his other progeny were the sires Blaze and Snip, along with Second, Spanking Roger and Roundhead. Blacklegs' dam was an unnamed daughter of Basto. This Basto mare also foaled the champion sire Crab, {{as well as the}} previously mentions Snip and Second. After the 2nd Duke of Devonshire's death in 1729, <b>Blacklegs</b> was owned by his son and successor William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire.|$|R
2500|$|Although Kelly gave in and {{recognised}} his workers' {{rights to}} union membership, when Gallaher sacked seven women for attending a meeting held by Larkin, one thousand female employees of his tobacco factory {{walked out of}} their workplace in a display of solidarity on 16 May. They marched to a [...] strike meeting held that afternoon in Corporation Square. The women, however, were compelled {{to return to work}} the following day. Although Larkin had called on them to join a trade union, neither the NUDL nor any other trade union could admit such a high number of new members at one time. Additionally, no financial assistance was available to the women, many of whom had families to support. Thomas Gallaher refused to recognise the NUDL and had hundreds of <b>blackleg</b> dockers working on Donegall Quay under the [...] protection of the RIC and troops deployed by Belfast's Lord Mayor Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury. Larkin denounced Gallaher in speeches as an [...] "obscene scoundrel". Gallaher for his part lamented that [...] "the whole business is, I think, due to the uprising of socialism".|$|E

But he boasted daily, nay, hourly to himself, and frequently to those around him, that the leeches who were stuck round him could draw but little blood from him.
