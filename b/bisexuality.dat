5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and <b>bisexuality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several ancient sources mention Sophocles' {{homosexuality}} or <b>bisexuality.</b> Athenaios {{reported that}} Sophocles loved boys like Euripides loved women. The poet Ion of Chios relates an anecdote involving Sophocles seducing a serving boy at a symposium, and Athenaios {{one in which}} Sophocles is tricked by a hustler.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{the first}} openly non-heterosexual {{character}} {{in the history of}} televised Doctor Who. The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood. The character became a figure of the British public consciousness, rapidly gaining fame for portrayer John Barrowman. As an ongoing depiction of <b>bisexuality</b> in mainstream British television, the character became a role model for young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in various Doctor Who and Torchwood books and has action figures created in his likeness.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, <b>bisexuality</b> and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Crowley had {{his first}} {{significant}} mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed {{that this was the}} result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his <b>bisexuality.</b> At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes, from one of whom he caught syphilis—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite their illegality. In October 1897, Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt, president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.|$|E
5|$|Film producer-director Elia Kazan hires James for {{the leading}} role in East of Eden (1955), marking his Hollywood debut. He moves to Hollywood in April 1954 to begin filming for Eden and is {{introduced}} to Jack L. Warner, the stern president of Warner Bros. Studios who is determined to transform him into a movie star. Warner becomes suspicious of his personal life (such as his possible <b>bisexuality</b> and passions for auto racing and motorcycling). On the Warner Bros. backlot, he {{falls in love with}} actress Pier Angeli, who is working on the neighboring production of The Silver Chalice (1954).|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. <b>Bisexuality</b> became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latest}} {{incarnation}} of X-Factor, written by Peter David, depowered mutant Rictor and his longtime friend Shatterstar (with whom he'd had an ambiguous relationship) were shown in an on-panel kiss. After {{the issue was}} published, Peter David confirmed Rictor and Shatterstar's <b>bisexuality</b> in his blog and expressed his desire to develop the relationship between them further. Shortly after, one of Shatterstar's creators, Rob Liefeld, expressed his disapproval of Peter David's decision. Despite his complaints, however, both Peter David and Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada have defended the development, and the story will most likely go on as planned.|$|E
5|$|Lesbianism, or the {{suggestion}} of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey. In Morocco (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips, and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett (1936). Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested <b>bisexuality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Middlesex {{has several}} allusions to Greek {{classical}} myths; for example, the protagonist {{is named after}} Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the explorations of hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In Middlesex, Cal acts out the story of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of <b>bisexuality</b> and effeminacy, while eking out a living in San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors' thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figureTiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived sevenyears as a woman because of a curse.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered <b>bisexuality</b> inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between <b>bisexuality</b> (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E
5|$|Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop has 288 pages, {{including}} 32 {{pages of}} photographs of the musician. The author compares Lady Gaga to Madonna, writing that both are independent and work to assert control over their futures. The book discusses Lady Gaga's early life and background, including her upbringing in a New York City household with her father, a businessman. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, from age 11 she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart high school; the same high school as Paris Hilton. Germanotta was not popular with her fellow pupils because of her experimentation with exotic dance, drugs, and <b>bisexuality.</b> By age 13, she had written her first song and her mother took her to nightclubs to perform at open-mic events. Germanotta gained entry to the Tisch School of the Arts in New York at age 17, but left and started using drugs while performing as a go-go dancer. After a period of difficulty with her father, she ceased this behavior pattern.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and <b>bisexuality.</b> The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
5|$|By 1929 Coward {{was one of}} the world's highest-earning writers, with {{an annual}} income of £50,000, more than £2,000,000 in terms of 2007 values. Coward thrived during the Great Depression, writing a {{succession}} of popular hits. They ranged from large-scale spectaculars to intimate comedies. Examples of the former were the operetta Bitter Sweet (1929), about a woman who elopes with her music teacher, and the historical extravaganza Cavalcade (1931) at Drury Lane, about thirty years in the lives of two families, which required a huge cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage. Its 1933 film adaptation won the Academy Award for best picture. Coward's intimate-scale hits of the period included Private Lives (1930) and Design for Living (1932). In Private Lives, Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young Laurence Olivier. It was a highlight of both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no more than three months at any venue. Design for Living, written for Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, was so risqué, with its theme of <b>bisexuality</b> and a ménage à trois, that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.|$|E
5|$|Crowley soon progressed {{through the}} lower grades of the Golden Dawn, {{and was ready}} to enter the group's inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his <b>bisexuality</b> and libertine {{lifestyle}} had gained him a bad reputation, and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including W.B. Yeats. When the Golden Dawn's London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order, he visited Mathers in Paris, who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn, who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers' orders, Crowley – {{with the help of his}} mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson – attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts, a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in West Kensington, from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the space's rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group. Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority.|$|E
5|$|Torres forms a {{friendship}} with Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), the hospital's new chief of cardiothoracic surgery. The two embark on a relationship when Hahn jokingly kisses Torres in an elevator to tease Sloan. Neither has been with another woman before, and Torres struggles with her <b>bisexuality,</b> and cheats on her with Sloan. She is initially forgiven, but after an argument about work, Hahn resigns from Seattle Grace, ending their relationship. New pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) kisses her, and they begin dating. Their relationship is tested when Torres comes out to her father, Carlos, who disowns her, cutting her off both financially and emotionally. When she is not granted a position as an attending, she publicly berates the chief, Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and resigns from her post. She begins working at the neighboring Mercy West hospital, and when the two hospitals merge, she is promoted to an attending surgeon. Torres' father returns yet again, to condemn her, but ultimately accepts her sexuality. When Torres explains her desire to bear children, Robbins expresses disappointment, and their differing stances on the matter lead them to break up. Soon thereafter, a gunman commits mass murder at the hospital, and, relieved to have survived, Torres and Robbins reconcile, with Robbins agreeing {{that they should have}} children together.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{positions}} on <b>bisexuality</b> range greatly, from acceptance of <b>bisexuality</b> as a feminist issue to rejection of <b>bisexuality</b> as reactionary and anti-feminist backlash to lesbian feminism.|$|E
25|$|Human <b>bisexuality</b> has mainly {{been studied}} {{alongside}} homosexuality. Van Wyk and Geist {{argue that this}} is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, <b>bisexuality</b> does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy. Research indicates that <b>bisexuality</b> is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of <b>bisexuality.</b>|$|E
25|$|The critic Camille Paglia has {{promoted}} <b>bisexuality</b> as an ideal. Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber made an academic case for <b>bisexuality</b> with her 1995 book Vice Versa: <b>Bisexuality</b> and the Eroticism of Everyday Life, {{in which she}} argued {{that most people would}} be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{positions}} on <b>bisexuality</b> range greatly, from acceptance of <b>bisexuality</b> as a feminist issue to rejection of <b>bisexuality</b> as reactionary and anti-feminist backlash to lesbian feminism. A {{number of women}} who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since come out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not <b>bisexuality</b> was compatible with feminism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bisexuality</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in various human societies {{and elsewhere in the}} animal kingdom throughout recorded history. The term <b>bisexuality,</b> however, like the terms hetero- and homosexuality, was coined in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Bisexual erasure (also {{referred}} to as bisexual invisibility) is a phenomenon that tends to omit, falsify, or re-explain evidence of <b>bisexuality</b> in history, academia, the news media, and other primary sources, sometimes {{to the point of}} denying that <b>bisexuality</b> exists.|$|E
25|$|Bisexual erasure (or {{bisexual}} invisibility) is {{the tendency}} to ignore, remove, falsify, or reexplain evidence of <b>bisexuality</b> in culture, history, academia, news media and other primary sources. In its most extreme form, bisexual erasure includes denying that <b>bisexuality</b> exists. It is often a manifestation of biphobia, although {{it does not necessarily}} involve overt antagonism.|$|E
25|$|Some people {{accept the}} {{theoretical}} existence of <b>bisexuality</b> but define it narrowly, as being only the equal attraction towards {{both men and}} women. Thus the many bisexual individuals with unequal attractions are instead categorized as either homosexual or heterosexual. Others acknowledge the existence of <b>bisexuality</b> in women, but deny that men can be bisexual.|$|E

25|$|The Reform Judaism movement, {{the largest}} branch of Judaism in North America, has {{rejected}} the traditional view of Jewish Law on homosexuality and <b>bisexuality.</b> As such, {{they do not}} prohibit ordination of openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people as rabbis and cantors. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring Canaanite nations rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse, homosexuality, or <b>bisexuality.</b> Reform authorities consider that, {{in light of what}} is seen as current scientific evidence about the nature of homosexuality and <b>bisexuality</b> as inborn sexual orientations, a new interpretation of the law is required.|$|E
25|$|Biphobia is aversion toward <b>{{bisexual}}ity</b> {{and toward}} bisexual {{people as a}} social group or as individuals. It can {{take the form of}} denial that <b>bisexuality</b> is a genuine sexual orientation, or of negative stereotypes about people who are bisexual (such as the beliefs that they are promiscuous or dishonest). People of any sexual orientation can experience or perpetuate biphobia, and it is a source of social discrimination against bisexual people.|$|E

25|$|The {{prenatal}} hormonal {{theory of}} sexual orientation suggests {{that people who are}} exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or <b>bisexuality.</b> Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess testosterone and estrogens are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with <b>bisexuality</b> rather than homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|In a 1972 {{interview}} with Boze Hadleigh, Mineo discussed his <b>bisexuality.</b> At {{the time of}} his death, he was in a six-year relationship and was living with male actor Courtney Burr III.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bisexuality</b> is romantic attraction, sexual attraction, {{or sexual}} {{behavior}} toward {{both males and}} females, or romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity; this latter aspect is sometimes alternatively termed pansexuality.|$|E
25|$|Homosexuality and <b>bisexuality</b> are stigmatized, {{and this}} stigma {{can have a}} variety of {{negative}} consequences (e.g., Minority Stress) throughout the life span (D'Augelli & Patterson, 1995; DiPlacido, 1998; Herek & Garnets, 2007; Meyer, 1995, 2003).|$|E
25|$|Alan P. Bell, Martin S. Weinberg, and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith, {{writing in}} Sexual Preference (1981), {{reported}} that sexual preference {{was much less}} strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings among bisexuals than it was among heterosexuals and homosexuals. Based on this and other findings, they suggested that <b>bisexuality</b> is more influenced by social and sexual learning than is exclusive homosexuality. Letitia Anne Peplau et al. wrote that while Bell et al.′s view that biological factors may be more influential on homosexuality than on <b>bisexuality</b> might seem plausible, {{it has not been}} directly tested and appears to conflict with available evidence, such as that concerning prenatal hormone exposure.|$|E
25|$|From an anthropological perspective, {{there is}} large {{variation}} in the prevalence of <b>bisexuality</b> between different cultures. Among some tribes, {{it appears to be}} non-existent while in others a universal, including the Sambia of New Guinea and similar Melanesian cultures.|$|E
