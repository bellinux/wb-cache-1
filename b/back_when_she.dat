25|$|The {{breeding}} season for sloth bears {{varies according to}} location: in India, they mate in April, May, and June, and give birth in December and early January, while in Sri Lanka, it occurs all year. Sows gestate for 210 days, and typically give birth in caves or in shelters under boulders. Litters usually consist {{of one or two}} cubs, or rarely three. Cubs are born blind, and open their eyes after four weeks. Sloth bear cubs develop quickly compared to most other bear species: they start walking a month after birth, become independent at 24–36 months, and become sexually mature at the age of three years. Young cubs ride on their mother's <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> walks, runs, or climbs trees until they reach a third of her size. Individual riding positions are maintained by cubs through fighting. Intervals between litters can last two to three years.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Beautiful" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic complimented the song for not following the [...] "club and street-level R, which fit her poorly".
