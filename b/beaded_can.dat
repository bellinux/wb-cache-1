50|$|Raising a rounded, bead-shaped {{segment of}} the mortar away from the mortar surface {{produces}} this old-fashioned, formal design. Although <b>beaded</b> joints <b>can</b> create interesting shadows, they are not recommended for exterior use due to their exposed ledges.|$|R
5000|$|The beaded crinoid extends {{its arms}} and pinnules in slow flowing water. The longest tube {{feet on the}} pinnules trap planktonic {{particles}} and push them into the ambulacral groove. They are prevented from leaving this by the remaining tube feet and the lappets. Cilia lining the groove form particles into boluses and move these along to the mouth. The <b>beaded</b> crinoid <b>can</b> sometimes be seen [...] "walking" [...] across the seabed on its arms.|$|R

Something that’s {{going to make you}} feel like the celebrities that she dresses—that’s’ why people come to Monique,” noted Modern Luxury’s James Aguiar. “She’s a master at understanding technique and fabric… Those types of clothes and the fabrications, it doesn’t have to be glitz; it doesn’t have to be sequins; it doesn’t have to be <b>beaded.</b> It <b>can</b> be a little shine. It can be iridescence. It can be a simple black dress, but she has the strength and the DNA of red carpet dressing down!” ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the process and}} results of experimental archaeology carried out in Tallinn in 2008 / 2009 to learn about and revive the technologies of making beaded wire. Such technologies that were once commonly known have by now been forgotten at least in Europe. Several experiments led to the recognition that <b>beaded</b> wire <b>can</b> be made {{with the aid of}} two iron knives. Knowing the material properties of gold and silver implementing specific working methods guarantees the making of beaded wire with the aid of two knives the technology was easily understood, the result was effective and the quality constant. The use of beaded wire was closely connected with the filigree and granulation techniques and it may be possible that beaded wire was abandoned in favour of filigree wire that required less specific skills...|$|R
50|$|The gákti can be {{worn with}} a belt; these are {{sometimes}} band-woven belts, woven, or <b>beaded.</b> Leather belts <b>can</b> have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassles, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts <b>can</b> also have <b>beaded</b> leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved and/or scrimshawed antler handled knife. Some Eastern Sami also have a hooded jumper (малиц) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.|$|R

The woman at left has very short, dark hair and wears a <b>beaded</b> dress. Flowers <b>can</b> be seen on the dress near her left shoulder, while she also wears a pearl necklace. The young girl at right also has a short hairstyle, and wears a dress with capped sleeves. Both are grinning. Photoprint reads: " 82 : 14 Movan"...|$|R
50|$|Abrin is {{not known}} to have been weaponised. Abrin {{naturally}} occurs in the seeds of the rosary pea, a plant common to tropical regions that is occasionally employed as an herbal remedy for certain conditions. While the outer shell of the seed protects its contents from the stomachs of most mammals, the seed coats are occasionally punctured to make <b>beaded</b> jewelry. This <b>can</b> lead to poisoning if a seed is swallowed, or if such jewelry is worn against damaged skin. Abrin has been shown to act as an immunoadjuvant in the treatment of cancer in mice.|$|R
40|$|International Conference on Material Engineering and Application, ICMEA 2016, 19 - 21 August 2016 Nanofibers {{produced}} by electrospinning are attractive {{for a large}} variety of applications in material science. Formation of Taylor cone {{is an integral part}} of electrospinning process. To understand deeply its formation, a two-phase electro-hydrodynamic simulation under the volume-of-fluid (VOF) model is proposed. The electric force in such systems acts only at the interface and is zero elsewhere in the two fluids. Continuum surface force (CSF) model is adopted to compute the electric field force at the interface. For the study case, transient analyses showed the moving flow fronts and their interactions with the applied electric field. Two symmetric vortices, which occur in Taylor cone, will increase the solution velocity. A <b>beaded</b> nanofiber <b>can</b> be formed owing to the beads occur in cone jet. The numerical results were consistent with previous studies. According to the numerical results, the formation mechanism and nanofiber dynamics of the Taylor cone in a multiphase flow were well disclosed for deep explanation of the process.

40|$|Herein I {{will provide}} a brief {{overview}} of artificial receptors with emphasis on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and their applications. Alternative techniques to produce artificial receptors such as in silico designed and modelled polymers as well as different receptors designed using libraries of more or less natural composition will also be mentioned. Examples of these include aptamers and bio-nanocomposites. The physical presentation of the receptors is important and may depend on the application. Block polymerization of MIPs and grinding to particles of suitable size used to be the preferred technique, but today <b>beaded</b> materials <b>can</b> be produced in sizes down to nanobeads and also nanofibers can be used to increase available surface area and thereby capacity. For sensor applications it may be attractive to include the artificial receptors in surface coatings or in membrane structures. Different composite designs can be used to provide additional desirable properties. MIPs and other artificial receptors are gaining rapidly increasing attention in very shifting application areas and an attempt to provide a systematic account for current applications has been made with examples from separation, solid-phase extraction, analysis, carbohydrate specific experiments, and MIPs-directed synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Elastic fibers of beef {{ligamentum nuchae}} were {{observed}} by {{atomic force microscopy}} and data compared with those obtained by conventional and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Fresh isolated elastin fibers as well as thin sections of ligament fragments, which were fixed and embedded either in relaxed or in stretched, conditions, were analysed. The results confirm that, at least in beef ligamentum nuchae, elastic fibers consist of <b>beaded</b> filaments which <b>can</b> be oriented by stretching {{in the direction of}} the force applied. Moreover, atomic force microscopy revealed that these beaded filaments are laterally connected by periodical bridges which become more pronounced upon stretching. The data clearly show that elastin molecules are organized in a rather ordered array, at least at the super-molecular level, and a depiction of the elastin organization in beef ligament um nuchae is attempted...|$|R
40|$|Elastin fibres {{are present}} in all {{connective}} tissues of vertebrates, and are particularly abundant in those undergoing physiological mechanical stress. Elastin, {{the main component of}} the fibres, is secreted as soluble tropoelastin molecules, that are crosslinked into insoluble aggregates in the extracellular space. Tropoelastin is highly hydrophobic and is encoded by a single copy gene, localized on chromosome 7 in humans; the primary transcript undergoes alternate splicing giving rise to different tropoelastin molecules, whose distribution and physiological significance are still under investigation. Elastin shows a transient developmental expression, with barely detectable turnover during adult life. In thin sections, elastin fibres appear rather compact and consist of an amorphous material (true elastin) and of longitudinal strips, probably made of various components. By freeze-fracture and negative staining, the elastin fibre {{has been shown to be}} made of a loose irregular network of <b>beaded</b> filaments, which <b>can</b> be oriented by stretching. Cytochemical and immunocytochemical approaches have shown that elastin fibres contain proteoglycans as well as sites recognized by antibodies to lysyl oxidase and microfibrillar components. It has been suggested that microfibrils and proteoglycans might have a role in elastin fibrogenesis. Elastin fibres undergo irreversible alterations during aging and in pathological conditions. These alterations consist mainly of accumulation of ions and of abnormal matrix constituents, and/or swelling and disaggregation of the fibre itself...|$|R
