Ringed seals are hunted all year, while harp seals are only available during the summer. Because seals need {{to break through the}} ice to reach air, they form breathing holes with their teeth and claws. Through these, Inuit hunters are able to capture seals. When a hunter arrives at these holes, they set up a seal indicator that alerts the hunter when a seal is coming up for a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>air.</b> When the seal comes up, the hunter notices movement in the indicator and uses his harpoon to capture the seal in the water.|$|E
500|$|Kreia {{has been}} {{positively}} received. Alexander Gambotto-Burke, for Eurogamer, considered Kreia {{to be the}} greatest villain in video gaming, praising her dialogue, Kestelman's [...] "intelligent and subtle" [...] voice-acting, and the way she forced the player into making choices and considering their decisions. IGN's Hilary Goldstein offered similar praise to her dialogue. When looking at morality in games, Gamasutra's Katherine Cross noted how Kreia's comments affected her more than many of the dark-side/light-side choices in the game. Her [...] "practical" [...] philosophy was also complimented by Kotaku's Phil Owen, who noted its ties to reality over the traditional moral extremes of the Sith and the Jedi. Eurogamers Richard Cobbett considered her the most [...] "famous" [...] of The Sith Lords subversion of Star Wars and the first Knights of the Old Republic, commenting [...] "Whether you agree or think she's crazy, she's a fresh <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> for the series, and easily one of the best RPG characters ever." ...|$|E
