He {{completed}} in 1941 his M.S. in Theoretical Physics {{under the supervision}} of Hendrik Anthony Kramers at Leiden University. For the remainder of World War II he survived by tutoring students in physics and mathematics. He was awarded a University of Chicago Fellowship that supported him to complete a Ph.D. in Mathematical Biology in 1951 {{under the supervision of}} the founder of Mathematical Biophysics and Mathematical Biology, Nicolas Rashevsky. Karreman was then selected as a consultant to Albert Szent-Györgyi at the Institute for Muscle Research, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole. To follow his interest in mathematics applied to biology, physiology, and medicine he went to Philadelphia in 1957, to take up the position of Senior Medical Research Scientist at the Eastern Research Center. He was appointed associate professor of physiology at the School of Medicine in the University of Pennsylvania, where he also worked at the Bockus Research Institute at the Graduate Hospital. He was promoted to Full Professor of Physiology at the same university in 1972, where he held this position until 1983, when he became the first Professor Emeritus of Mathematical Biology. His main research interests were many, but all were in related fields that included: mathematical biology and mathematical biophysics, membrane biophysics, photosynthetic mechanisms, quantum biochemistry and quantum biophysics, <b>biological</b> <b>energy</b> transfer, quantum biology, physiological irritability, mathematical and systems analysis of cardiovascular and other biosystems, cooperativity, threshold phenomena in biomembranes, adsorption mechanisms at membrane surfaces and ion binding to biomembranes.|$|E

These were the concept of the Actualneurosis and a theory of anxiety based upon the idea of dammed-up libido. In Freud's original view, what really happened to a person (the [...] "actual") determined the resulting neurotic disposition. Freud applied that idea both to infants and to adults. In the former case, seductions were sought as the causes of later neuroses and in the latter incomplete sexual release. Unlike Freud, Reich retained the idea that actual experience, especially sexual experience, was of key significance. By the 1920s, Reich had [...] "taken Freud's original ideas about sexual release to the point of specifying the orgasm as the criteria of healthy function."

40|$|Habitability can be {{formulated}} as {{a balance}} between the <b>biological</b> demand for <b>energy</b> and the corresponding potential for meeting that demand by transduction of energy from the en-vironment into biological process. The <b>biological</b> demand for <b>energy</b> is manifest in two re-quirements, analogous to the voltage and power requirements of an electrical device, which must both be met if life is to be supported. These requirements exhibit discrete (non-zero) minima whose magnitude is set by the biochemistry in question, and they are increased in quantifiable fashion by (i) deviations from biochemically optimal physical and chemical con-ditions and (ii) energy-expending solutions to problems of resource limitation. The possible rate of energy transduction is constrained by (i) the availability of usable free energy sources in the environment, (ii) limitations on transport of those sources into the cell, (iii) upper lim-its on the rate at which energy can be stored, transported, and subsequently liberated by bio-chemical mechanisms (e. g., enzyme saturation effects), and (iv) upper limits imposed by an inability to use “power ” and “voltage ” at levels that cause material breakdown. A system is habitable when the realized rate of energy transduction equals or exceeds the <b>biological</b> de-mand for <b>energy.</b> For systems in which water availability is considered a key aspect of hab-itability (e. g., Mars), the energy balance construct imposes additional, quantitative constraints that may help to prioritize targets in search-for-life missions.
