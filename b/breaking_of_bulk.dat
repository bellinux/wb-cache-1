40|$|This work is an {{extension}} of our previous work, hep-th/ 0204160, which showed how to systematically calculate the high energy evolution of gauge couplings in compact AdS_ 5 backgrounds. We first directly compute the one-loop effects of massive charged fields on the low energy couplings of a gauge theory propagating in the AdS background. It is found that bulk mass scales (which generically are of order the Planck scale) enter only logarithmically in the corrections to the tree-level gauge couplings. As we pointed out previously, we show that the large logarithms that appear in the AdS one-loop calculation can be obtained within the confines of an effective field theory, by running the Planck brane correlator from a high UV matching scale down to the TeV scale. This result exactly reproduces our previous calculation, which was based on AdS/CFT duality. We also calculate the effects of fields satisfying non-trivial boundary conditions (relevant for orbifold <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>bulk</b> symmetries) on the running of gauge couplings...|$|E

50|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} with {{break bulk}} {{is that it}} requires more resources at the wharf {{at both ends of}} the transport—longshoremen, loading cranes, warehouses, transport vehicles—and often takes up more dock space due to multiple vessels carrying multiple loads <b>of</b> <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo. Indeed, the decline <b>of</b> <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> did not start with containerisation; rather, the advent <b>of</b> tankers and <b>bulk</b> carriers reduced the need for transporting liquids in barrels and grains in sacks. Such tankers and carriers use specialised ships and shore facilities to deliver larger amounts of cargo to the dock and effect faster turnarounds with fewer personnel once the ship arrives; however, they do require large initial investments in ships, machinery, and training, slowing their spread to areas where funds to overhaul port operations and/or training for dock personnel in the handling of cargo on the newer vessels may not be available. As modernization of ports and shipping fleets spreads across the world, the advantages of using containerization and specialized ships over break-bulk has sped the overall decline of break-bulk operations around the world. In all, the new systems have reduced costs as well as spillage and turnaround times; in the case of containerisation, damage and pilfering as well.|$|R

We consider a bulk custodial gauge symmetry group together with an Abelian $Z_ 4 $ group: the model turns out to yield a rather minimal extension of the SM as it only requires two brane Higgs fields to provide the desired Yukawa interactions and the required spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern.

The mechanism {{is characterized by a}} very specific pattern of spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking, and the presence of new light states referred to as `gears'. In this paper we begin by investigating the self-interactions of these gears in a scalar clockwork model and find a parity-like selection rule at all orders in the fields.

40|$|We {{discuss some}} {{properties}} of the conjectured M- 9 -brane. We investigate both the worldvolume action {{as well as the}} target space solution. The worldvolume action is given by a gauged sigma model which, via dimensional reduction and duality, is shown {{to be related to the}} worldvolume actions of the branes of ten- dimensional superstring theory. The effective tension of the M- 9 -brane scales as (R_ 11) ^ 3, where R_ 11 is the radius of an S^ 1 -isometry direction. This isometry enables us to add a cosmological constant to eleven-dimensional supergravity.

40|$|Orbifolds play a {{prominent}} role in theories with extra dimensions due to their property to create chirality in the massless sector, an indispensable property in any phenomenologically relevant theory. Another interesting feature of orbifolds is their ability to break symmetries, in particular gauge and supersymmetry. While local symmetries remain intact in the bulk by an appropriate choice of parities for the transformation parameters, they are in general broken to smaller subgroups on the boundaries (the fixed points of the orbifold symmetry). As in any quantum field theory, in the effective action we must allow for all operators consistent with the symmetries. Allowed operators not present at tree level will be generated by radiative corrections [1 – 3]. The orbifold <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bulk</b> gauge symmetry proceeds by projecting out some fields, i. e. only a subset of the 4 D gauge bosons Aµ and the 4 D scalars Ai (i = 5,·· ·,D) will be non-vanishing at the boundaries. While these Aµ generate the unbroken gauge group H, theAitransform in some representation of H. It is then necessary to determine how the symmetries restrict possible brane localized operators of those fields, especially possible mass terms for the scalars [3]. Would H be the only symmetry left on the brane, mass terms for Ai would be perfectly allowed leading to a quadratic sensitivity to the UV cut-off. In this talk we demonstrate that the remnant symmetry on the brane is larger than the H gauge symmetry left over from the bulk. This provides a further restriction on the possible brane terms. We find that brane mass terms for scalars can only occur in D ≥ 6 and only for U(1) factors in H that were not already present in the bulk gauge group G. These brane mass terms are radiatively generated by bulk fermions. We will consider a gauge theory (gauge group G) coupled to fermions in D> 4 dimensional space-time parametrized by coordinates xM = x µ,yi where µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 and i = 5,·· ·,D.
