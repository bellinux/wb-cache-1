40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} the <b>bifurcations</b> of relative equilibria in the gravitational potential of asteroids. A theorem concerning a conserved quantity, {{which is about}} the eigenvalues and number of relative equilibria, is presented and proved. The conserved quantity can restrict the number of non-degenerate equilibria in the gravitational potential of an asteroid. It is concluded that the number of non-degenerate equilibria in the gravitational field of an asteroid varies in pairs and is an odd number. In addition, the conserved quantity can also restrict the kinds of <b>bifurcations</b> of relative equilibria in the gravitational potential of an asteroid when the parameter varies. Furthermore, studies have shown that there exist transcritical <b>bifurcations,</b> quasi-transcritical <b>bifurcations,</b> saddle-node <b>bifurcations,</b> saddle-saddle <b>bifurcations,</b> binary saddle-node <b>bifurcations,</b> supercritical pitchfork <b>bifurcations,</b> and subcritical pitchfork <b>bifurcations</b> for the relative equilibria in the gravitational potential of asteroids.

40|$|Abstract. Using the {{singularity}} theory of scalar functions, we derive a classification of sliding <b>bifurcations</b> in piecewise-smooth flows. These are global <b>bifurcations</b> which occur when distinguished orbits become tangent to surfaces of discontinuity, called switching manifolds. The key {{idea of the}} paper is to attribute sliding <b>bifurcations</b> to singularities in the manifold’s projection along the flow, namely to points where the projection contains folds, cusps, and two-folds (saddles and bowls). From the possible local configurations of orbits we obtain sliding <b>bifurcations.</b> In this way we derive a complete classification of generic one-parameter sliding <b>bifurcations</b> at a smooth codimension one switching manifold in n-dimensions for n ≥ 3. We uncover previously unknown sliding <b>bifurcations,</b> {{all of which are}} catastrophic in nature. We also describe how the method can be extended to sliding <b>bifurcations</b> of codimension two or higher...|$|R

25|$|A local <b>bifurcation</b> {{occurs when}} a {{parameter}} change causes the stability of an equilibrium (or fixed point) to change. In continuous systems, this corresponds to the real part of an eigenvalue of an equilibrium passing through zero.

In both cases, the equilibrium is non-hyperbolic at the <b>bifurcation</b> point.|$|E
