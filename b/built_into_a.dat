Retro Gamer wrote that Radica's gun is based on the Sega Saturn light gun's design and not the Menacer's.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 10-metre, 32' pipe {{stayed in}} Switzerland and was <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new organ in the Münster Cathedral, which {{belongs to the}} Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance. This pipe, capable of reproducing a tone of 16.35Hz, the bass note C0 four octaves below middle C, was recreated in Moscow and added to the cathedral's organ in 2009.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{community}} building, a non-contributing structure {{within the}} historic boundary, is {{southwest of the}} church. The building is a venue for Sunday school classes and community gatherings. The front gable building, completed in 1961, is sheathed in brickwork. Similar to the church, the building is <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> gently sloping bank with its one-story elevation at grade facing west toward WV 259. Its two-story eastern elevation is {{at the foot of}} the hillside.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.|$|E

5|$|The Genesis was {{the first}} Sega console to receive {{third-party}} versions. Its first variants were released before any Master System variants, even though the Genesis was released {{three years after the}} Master System. Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega, a Mega Drive and Mega CD combination with high quality audio, in Japan on April 1, 1992. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. A Pioneer LaserActive add-on pack, developed by Sega, allows the system to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> boombox. Several companies added the Genesis to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the MSX models AX-330 and AX-990 distributed in Kuwait and Yemen, and the Amstrad Mega PC distributed in Europe and Australia. After the Genesis was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released the Genesis 3 in North America as a budget version of the console in 1998. Majesco also released a budget version of the Sega Pico in North America in August 1999.|$|E
5|$|Three {{additional}} system {{models were}} created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan, at an initial retail price of ¥82,800 (or US$620). The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high-quality audio, the Wondermega's high price kept {{it out of the}} hands of average consumers. Likewise was the case with the Pioneer LaserActive, which was also an add-on that required an attachment developed by Sega, known as the Mega-LD pack, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Though the LaserActive, developed by Pioneer Corporation, was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the combined system and Mega-LD pack retailed at nearly $1600, becoming a very expensive option for Sega CD players. Aiwa also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> boombox.|$|E

50|$|A colour {{look-up table}} (CLUT) is a {{mechanism}} used to transform {{a range of}} input colours into another range of colours. It can be <b>a</b> hardware device <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> imaging system or <b>a</b> software function <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> image processing application. The hardware colour look-up table will convert the logical colour (pseudo-colour) numbers stored in each pixel of video memory into physical colours, normally represented as RGB triplets, that can be displayed on a computer monitor. The colour palette is simply a block of fast RAM which is addressed by the logical colour and whose output is split into the red, green, and blue levels which drive the actual display (e.g., a CRT or cathode ray tube).|$|R
