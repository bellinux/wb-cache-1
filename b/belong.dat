40|$|Introduction: People with co-occurring {{mental health}} and {{substance}} misuse problems {{are among the most}} excluded in society. A need to feel connected to others has been articulated in the occupational science literature although the concept of <b>belonging</b> itself has not been extensively explored within this paradigm. This paper reports findings from research that explored the meaning and experience of <b>belonging</b> for four people living with dual diagnosis in the United Kingdom. Method: Researchers employed an interpretative phenomenological approach to the study. Four semi-structured interviews were carried out. The interviews were guided by questions around the meaning of <b>belonging,</b> barriers to <b>belonging</b> and how <b>belonging</b> and not <b>belonging</b> impacted on participants’ lives. Data analysis facilitated the identification of themes across individual accounts and enabled comparisons. Findings: Data analysis identified four themes – <b>belonging</b> in family, <b>belonging</b> in place, embodied understandings of <b>belonging</b> and barriers to <b>belonging.</b> Conclusion: The findings add further insights into the mutable nature of <b>belonging.</b> A link between sense of <b>belonging</b> and attachment theory has been proposed, along with a way to understand the changeable and dependent nature of <b>belonging</b> through ‘dimensions of belonging’...|$|R

5|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that there are no more than three or four {{subspecies}} of elk. All American forms seem to <b>belong</b> to one subspecies (Cervus canadensis canadensis). Even the Siberian elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may <b>belong</b> to this subspecies, too. However the Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms, but not distinguishable from the Alashan wapiti. The Chinese forms MacNeill's deer, Kansu red deer, and Tibetan red deer <b>belong</b> also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the Central Asian red deer (Cervus wallichi), which also includes the Kashmir stag.|$|E

They appear on planets sufficiently big to store life, and are represented by a variety of ships of different size and attack power. Spaceships are coloured green if they <b>belong</b> to the player's planet, or to a planet that belongs to the player's solar system; red if they <b>belong</b> to an enemy planet or solar system; and white if they don't <b>belong</b> to any planet or system. All the spaceships in the map are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI), and they will constantly engage in combat against enemy ships, asteroids or planets to destroy them.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the feeling of <b>belonging</b> that students {{may or may not have}} and the relationship of student sense of <b>belonging</b> to the overall academic achievement of a school. Students were surveyed on their sense of <b>belonging</b> in selected middle schools. The students scored themselves on the Psychological Sense of School Membership scale, which revealed an overall mean score of <b>belonging.</b> Students from high-performing schools were compared to students from low-performing schools in regard to their sense of <b>belonging.</b> Additionally, teachers were asked to rate their perception of the students? sense of <b>belonging.</b> The teachers? scores were compared to the students? scores in both high- and low-performing schools. Lastly, teachers were asked to provide qualitative information about the schools? role in creating a sense of <b>belonging.</b> An extensive review of the literature regarding sense of <b>belonging</b> reveals support of the importance of sense of <b>belonging</b> in student achievement. There is also extensive evidence regarding variation of sense of <b>belonging</b> among minority groups and the important role of teachers in creating a sense of <b>belonging</b> for students. This study found that there is no significant difference in students? reported sense of <b>belonging</b> between high-performing schools and low-performing schools on the Psychological Sense of School Membership scale. There is a significant difference between the teachers? perception of the students? sense of <b>belonging</b> and the students? reported sense of <b>belonging</b> on the Psychological Sense of School Membership scales. Teachers reported important roles in creating an environment of <b>belonging.</b> The qualitative data provided by teachers support evidence from the literature review indicative of schools with sense of <b>belonging.</b> High-performing schools do not report much information regarding discipline and routine as being important parts of creating <b>belonging.</b> However, low performing schools often report these as important to creating a sense of <b>belonging</b> for students. Implications of the research include: Teachers may not have an accurate understanding of students? sense of <b>belonging</b> and how to create a sense of <b>belonging</b> in schools. Further study should try to gain better understanding of the relationship between sense of <b>belonging</b> and minority status...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how a {{sense of}} <b>belonging</b> functions as protective mechanism against loneliness. Inspired {{by the work of}} Berry (1980) on acculturation strategies (i. e. integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization), we distinguish migrants who feel a relatively strong or weak sense of <b>belonging</b> to larger society and those who feel a strong or weak <b>belonging</b> to the “own group. ” We expect that more national <b>belonging</b> contributes to less loneliness. We add a transnational perspective by arguing that feelings of <b>belonging</b> to the own group can take place in the country of settlement, but can also be transnational, i. e. a feeling of <b>belonging</b> to the country of origin. Transnational <b>belonging</b> can protect against loneliness, as it acknowledges the importance of place attachment. Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam on older migrants aged 55 – 66, we employ latent class analysis and find five national <b>belonging</b> clusters, interpretable in terms of Berry’s acculturation strategies. Further analyses reveal mixed evidence: some aspects of transnational <b>belonging</b> vary with <b>belonging</b> to the own group, but other aspects point to a third dimension of <b>belonging.</b> Regression analysis shows that those marginalized are loneliest and that a transnational sense of <b>belonging</b> contributes to more loneliness. We conclude that Berry’s (1980) typology is useful for interpreting older migrants’ national <b>belonging</b> and that a transnational sense of <b>belonging</b> is apparent among older migrants, but needs to be explored further...|$|R
