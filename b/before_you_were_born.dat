2500|$|Jeremiah 1:5 states that, [...] "Before I formed {{you in the}} womb, I knew you, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born,</b> I set you apart; I {{appointed}} you as {{a prophet}} to the nations." [...] For some, this verse, while talking specifically about Jeremiah, {{is an indication that}} God is aware of the identity of [...] "developing unborn human beings even before they enter the womb", or that for everyone, God has a plan that abortion might be seen as frustrating. Others say that this interpretation is incorrect, and that the verse is not related to personhood or abortion, as Jeremiah is asserting his prophetic status as distinct and special.|$|E

A gentleman who was staying in the village <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>was</b> talking about wrecks, {{and he said that}} a couple of empty bottles, well corked, would keep up a fair swimmer for hours. So I made it; but no words could get your father to try it, though he was willing enough to say that it would {{probably}} keep him afloat. You'll try it, won't you, Will?" ...|$|R

He had a hundred pounds with me, but it all went in a year; and it's always been up and down, {{up and down with}} us ever since, but now it's nothing but down." ...|$|R

"Get {{along with}} you," [...] {{interrupted}} the old man, facetiously giving the chair a swing that caused all who stood around him to leap {{out of his}} way: [...] "will you hev the presumption to teach a man that knew how to scull a boat <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>wass</b> <b>born?</b> But, Taniel," [...] he added, in a more serious tone, [...] "we must hev one like this made for poor Tuncan." ...|$|R

[...] "What was Bonanza Creek but a moose-pasture? No miner'd look at it; yet they washed five-hundred-dollar pans {{and took out}} fifty million dollars. Eldorado was just as bad.

6000|$|... "Indeed they do, sir, in {{the most}} surprisingest manner! They was both antiquities, as we says in Hengland, when I came to this country, sir--and that <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> Mr. Hugh--an age agone. But there they sits, sir, {{day in and day}} out, looking like monumentals of past times. The nigger"--John had been long enough in the country to catch the vernacular--"The nigger grows uglier and uglier every year, and that is most of a change I can see in him; while I do think, sir, that the Indian grows 'andsomer and 'andsomer.

6000|$|... --Bedad I am, {{said the}} little old man. I have two {{bouncing}} grandchildren out at Sunday's Well. Now, then! What age {{do you think}} I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds. That was <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{your age}} I think. He {{ought to be}} older because I dreamed him long <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born.</b> But I'll never let him get any older than eleven or twelve; because if I did some day he might grow up {{altogether}} and then I'd lose him." ...|$|E

I'm {{glad to see}} you take it this way, because maybe you'll never grow hard an' callous. You're not to blame. This is Texas. You're your father's son. These are wild times. The law as the rangers are laying it down now can't change life all in a minute. Even your mother, who's a good, true woman, has had her share in making <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> this moment. For {{she was one of the}} pioneers--the fightin' pioneers of this state. Those years of wild times, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> developed in her instinct to fight, to save her life, her children, an' that instinct has cropped out in <b>you.</b> It will <b>be</b> many years before it dies out of the boys born in Texas." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's me. I went west a {{long time}} ago; <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born,</b> I guess. We don't get much news on the coast, so I sort of {{lost track of the}} folks back east, and I reckon they lost track of me, for the same reason." ...|$|E

[...] "Keep {{your hands}} from your bodkins, you two, {{for that was}} my trade <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born,</b> and, by God's soul!

"Ah, well! it is {{all very}} well," [...] said grandmamma, shaking her head, {{as she always did}} when out-argued by Beatrice, [...] "you girls think yourselves so clever, there is no talking to you; but I think you had much better let old Martha alone; she has done it well enough <b>before</b> ever <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>born,</b> and such a litter as you will make the Church won't be fit to be seen to-morrow!

6000|$|... "Sally Kittridge, don't be a-talkin' of {{what you}} don't know nothin' about!

She's took camomile and orange-peel, and snake-root and boneset, and dash-root and dandelion--and there hain't nothin' done her no good.
