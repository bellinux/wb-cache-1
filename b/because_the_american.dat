5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{technology}} school in Georgia was introduced in 1865 during the Reconstruction period. Two former Confederate officers, Major John Fletcher Hanson (an industrialist) and Nathaniel Edwin Harris (a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens {{in the town of}} Macon, Georgia after the Civil War, strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the industrial revolution that was occurring throughout the North. However, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> South of that era was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, {{a technology}} school was needed.|$|E
25|$|By {{his second}} year in office, Bush was told by his {{economic}} advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed {{that he had done}} everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans lived in poverty. Bush lost reelection in 1992 in large part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people, concerned about the economy, voted for change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{battle was}} a {{tactical}} draw but a British strategic victory <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had suffered so many casualties {{that they were}} now outnumbered. There were over 1,500 casualties including 258 killed.|$|R

50|$|There {{were several}} {{attempts}} to attack <b>the</b> <b>American</b> garrison in <b>the</b> town, but practically {{all of them}} failed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had superior arms. Don Guilermo Alkuino and Don Magdaleno Fernandez led the first attack with more than 200 men. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> soldiers fought another in Barrio Pomponan {{that resulted in the}} death of 30 men and the destruction of the barrio.|$|R
25|$|The NNL {{scheduled}} a best-five-of-nine championship series, {{with the first}} three games in St. Louis on September 19 through 21 and the next three games (home games for the Monarchs) played in Chicago <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Association's Kansas City Blues were finishing their season at home, tying up Muehlebach Field. Kansas City won the first game 8 to 6, as Bullet Rogan pitched a complete game and Newt Allen, Dobie Moore, and Frank Duncan hit home runs. St. Louis won the second game 6 to 3, behind the pitching of Roosevelt Davis and excellent plays in the field by Willie Wells, Cool Papa Bell, and Branch Russell.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his views}} as a {{possible}} candidate during an appearance on On the Record with Greta Van Susteren in March 2009, Gingrich said, [...] "I am very sad {{that a number of}} Republicans do not understand that this country is sick of earmarks. [...] are sick of politicians taking care of themselves. They are sick of their money being spent {{in a way that is}} absolutely indefensible... I think you're going to see a steady increase in the number of incumbents who have opponents <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> taxpayers are increasingly fed up." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{sides were}} overextended in the {{exhaustive}} sea, air and land battles for Guadalcanal. The Japanese were better at night combat (<b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> destroyers had only trained for attacks on battleships). However, the Japanese could not feed its soldiers so the Americans eventually won because of superior logistics. [...] The Navy built up its forces in 1942-43, {{and developed a}} strategy of [...] "island-hopping, that is to skip {{over most of the}} heavily defended Japanese islands and instead go further on and select islands to seize for forward air bases.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 the Air Ministry {{sold the}} {{airfield}} for civilian use. Bullingdon Rural District Council {{decided to build}} a new village - the first in England for 200 years - to be named after Birinus or Berin, a local saint. The word 'field' was added <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> called their base an airfield.|$|R

500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{title was}} different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name {{had to be}} re-shot, once with the actors saying [...] "philosopher's" [...] and once with [...] "sorcerer's". The {{children}} filmed for four hours and then did three hours of schoolwork. They developed a liking for fake facial injuries from the makeup staff. Radcliffe was initially meant to wear green contact lenses as his eyes are blue, and not green like Harry's, but the lenses gave Radcliffe extreme irritation. Upon consultation with Rowling, {{it was agreed that}} Harry could have blue eyes.|$|E
500|$|Filming did {{face some}} disruptions. The {{sequence}} where Lucas {{breaks into a}} car for some supplies was filmed at a street near Hyde Park. On {{one end of the}} street was an event in the park, while on the other end a wedding took place. Elsewhere, Fuller carried a mock-suitcase bomb to film in Grosvenor Square. However, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Embassy is situated next to the square, shortly after Fuller and the filming crew arrived, they found themselves surrounded by five armed American security officers who believed Fuller was about to commit an attack. Fortunately, location manager Patrick Stuart was able to [...] "sweet-talk" [...] the American officials, and they were allowed to film in the area.|$|E
500|$|The {{establishment}} of a school of technology was proposed in 1882 during the Reconstruction period. Major John Fletcher Hanson and Nathaniel Edwin Harris, two former Confederate officers who became prominent citizens {{in the town of}} Macon, Georgia after the war, strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the industrial revolution that was occurring throughout the North. Many Southerners at this time agreed with this idea, known as the [...] "New South Creed". Its strongest proponent was Henry W. Grady, editor of The Atlanta Constitution during the 1880s. A technology school was thought necessary <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> South of that era was mostly agrarian, and few technical developments were occurring. Georgians needed technical training to advance the state's industry.|$|E
5000|$|Following the ruling, the {{transcripts}} {{of the conversation}} between Campo and an informant were released, with Campo stating: [...] "We need <b>the</b> money ...

5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first battle of <b>the</b> conflict, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> {{had not yet}} heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the high ground behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of <b>the</b> island. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> failed to recapture the island.|$|R
500|$|A three-game Major League Baseball series {{between the}} Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies, {{scheduled}} June 25 to 27 at the Rogers Centre, was relocated to Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, after much discussion by league officials and amidst discontentment from fans, who highly anticipated {{the return of}} former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay to Toronto after being traded to the Phillies; <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> League Blue Jays was still officially the [...] "home" [...] team, the series {{marked the first time}} in Major League history that the designated hitter was used in a National League ballpark during the regular season.

Similarly, the Factory Theatre cancelled shows during the summit week.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} chapter, [...] "A Passing Nightmare", Chomsky turns his {{attention}} to weapons of mass destruction. He argues that rather than helping to eradicate nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry, the U.S. has continually increased its number of nuclear warheads, thereby encouraging other nations to do the same, putting the world in jeopardy of nuclear holocaust. Discussing {{the role of the}} U.S. in creating ballistic missile defense systems and encouraging the militarization of outer space, he notes that the U.S. government have continually undermined international treatise to decrease the number of weapons of mass destruction, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> socio-economic elite believe that [...] "hegemony is more important than survival." [...] However, he argues that there is still hope for humanity if the citizens of the world – the [...] "Second Superpower" [...] – continue to criticize and oppose the actions of the U.S. government.|$|E

5000|$|In the [...] "Sixty {{years after}} Hiroshima" [...] issue of <b>the</b> Weekly Standard, <b>American</b> {{historian}} Richard B. Frank {{points out that}} there are a number of schools of thought with varying opinions of what caused the Japanese to surrender. He describes what he calls the [...] "traditionalist" [...] view, which asserts that <b>the</b> Japanese surrendered <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> dropped <b>the</b> atomic bombs. He goes on to summarise other points of view.|$|R
5000|$|In an October 2006 {{article in}} The New Republic, Lawrence F. Kaplan echoes Williams's sentiments about {{the enthusiasm of}} the Yazidis for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{occupation}} of Iraq, in part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> protect them from oppression by militant Muslims and the nearby Kurds. Kaplan notes that the peace and calm of Sinjar is virtually unique in Iraq: [...] "Parents and children line the streets when U.S. patrols pass by, while Yazidi clerics pray {{for the welfare of}} U.S. forces." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, history docent Joost Rosendaal of Radboud University Nijmegen {{started a}} new study into the bombardment, which was {{eventually}} published in 2009 as Nijmegen '44. Verwoesting, verdriet en verwerking ("Nijmegen '44: Destruction, Grief, and Consolation". In it, he classified the attack as an opportunistic bombing rather than an error. Rosendaal rejects {{the notion of an}} 'error', <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> were negligent in properly identifying which city to bomb. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> [...] "intentionally bombed a target of opportunity, which, however, had not been unambiguously identified." ...|$|R
2500|$|In contrast, {{historian}} Ben Rubin {{argues that}} <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolution was {{a conflict that}} as often pitted neighbor against neighbor—Whigs (advocates of Revolution) against Tories (loyalists to Britain)—as it pitted nascent Americans against the British, many people stayed neutral until goaded into taking a stand in reaction to perceived atrocities. From this perspective, Benjamin Martin's joining of the militia becomes, according to commentator Jon Roland, a deep patriotism that [...] "shows them being called up, not {{as an act of}} an official, but by private persons aware of a common threat... militia duty to defend one another".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{negotiation}} between Great Britain and the rebellious Thirteen Colonies after the outbreak in April 1775 of the American War of Independence took place in September 1776, when a committee from the Second Continental Congress agreed to meet with Admiral Lord Richard Howe, who had been given limited powers to treat with colonies individually. [...] The limited authority given to both Howe and the American negotiators made it a virtual certainty that nothing would come of the meeting. The meeting was a failure, {{in part because the}} Congress had recently declared independence from Britain, something Howe was not authorised to recognise, and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> commissioners had no substantive authority from Congress to negotiate.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with GQ magazine, Lichtman explained his thought process for predicting a Trump impeachment: [...] "it {{is based on a}} deep study of history, including Trump's parallels to his impeached predecessors; a study of the process of impeachment; a study of Trump's vulnerabilities". He explained why he chose to write the book at this particular point, emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and [...] "because impeachment is a political process that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, it will be <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people demand it." [...] Lichtman said because there were many potential unlawful activities, [...] "I believe he is more vulnerable than any early president {{in the history of the}} nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The South Vietnamese won {{in large}} part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> had spent {{so much on the}} country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of {{military}} rule, as {{it would be a big}} public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. According to Karnow, for Khánh and his officers, [...] "their weakness was their strength". An anonymous South Vietnamese government official said [...] "Our big advantage over <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> is that they want to win the war more than we do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Judge Cummings dissented {{arguing that}} <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> with Disabilities Act of 1990, {{expanded}} {{the number of}} establishments in its definition of [...] "places of public accommodation," [...] this court should have expanded Title II to include membership organizations.

50|$|Jefferson and Madison {{start the}} rap battle by {{questioning}} the cabinet {{as to who}} aided <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolutionaries during their hour of need (the answer: France). Jefferson also argues that <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> signed a treaty between themselves and the King of France, they are honor bound to give aid to them as they enter a war with Britain. Jefferson then insults Hamilton, accusing him of being greedy and stating that he is disloyal. Jefferson notes that he is Secretary of State, not Hamilton, implying {{that he should have}} more influence on this decision than the Secretary of Treasury.|$|R
2500|$|By December 1984, {{significant}} differences in the value of negotiated contracts, and divergent union objectives had {{set the stage for the}} creation of the CAW, a process documented in the Genie Award winning film, Final Offer. In 1984, the Canadian section of the UAW, under the leadership of Bob White and his assistants Buzz Hargrove and Bob Nickerson, broke from the UAW, led by Owen Bieber, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> union was seen as giving away too much in the way of concessions during collective bargaining. Additionally, the UAW had been lobbying the U.S. Congress to force the transfer of auto production from Canada to the U.S. and the Canadian branch felt there was a lack of a representative voice during UAW's conventions. By [...] 1985 the split from the American union was complete and Bob White was acclaimed as the first President of the CAW. He served three terms as president..|$|E
2500|$|The American Humane Association (AHA) {{has been}} {{associated}} with monitoring American filmmaking since after the release of the 1939 film Jesse James, in which a horse was pushed off a plank and drowned in a body of water after having fallen 40 feet into it. Initially, monitoring of animal cruelty was a partnership between the AHA and officials in the Hays Office through the Motion Picture Production Code. Provisions in the code discouraged [...] "apparent cruelty to children and animals", and because the Hays Office had the power to enforce this clause, the American Humane Association (AHA) often had access to sets to assess adherence to it. However, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Humane Association's Hollywood office depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor sets, the closure of the Hays Office in 1966 corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets.|$|E
2500|$|Kellogg was {{the voice}} of the Oneidas and the Six Nations of the Iroquois on the {{national}} and international scene. In 1908, Kellogg embarked on a two-year European journey. In England, she immediately made an impression on British society and the international press. [...] "Wherever she has gone, society has simply ‘ovated’ her, and were she to remain in England long, she would doubtless be the leader of the circle all her own.” [...] While in London, Kellogg requested {{in a letter to the}} U.S. Department of the Interior that she be presented at Court. The request was denied, evidently <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ambassador was disinclined. In 1909, called “Princess Neoskalita” by the Los Angeles Times, Kellogg said she “did not consider her education complete until she had some knowledge of the social life, the art and literature of the French and English.” [...] Kellogg also wanted to forge connections and begin a movement in America to work to reorganize Indian affairs.

50|$|Conflict {{between the}} Indians of Alabama and American {{settlers}} increased {{rapidly in the}} early 19th century <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> kept encroaching on Native <b>American</b> territories. <b>The</b> great Shawnee chief Tecumseh visited the region in 1811, seeking to forge an Indian alliance among these tribes to join his resistance in the Great Lakes area.
