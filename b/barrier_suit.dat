40|$|Despite high {{expectations}} that shareholder derivative actions {{would serve as}} an important tool for improving corporate governance in China, only one lawsuit has been brought against a publicly listed Chinese company since such actions were formally introduced in 2005. Among the various <b>barriers</b> to such <b>suits,</b> {{and perhaps the most}} difficult obstacle for plaintiffs to surmount, is holding the requisite minimum of 1 % of corporate shares. It is difficult to reduce the threshold figure to a more accessible level, in part because using the minimum shareholding requirement as a mechanism for screening out frivolous litigation is inherently flawed. Yet, attempting to screen frivolous litigation through a judicial determination on the merits of a suit rather than using a minimum shareholding requirement is unlikely to work properly in China. The judiciary is weak, unsophisticated, and riddled with corruption. When the judicial system is in such a condition, it is unrealistic to expect that a derivative action specifically, or indeed, the private enforcement of law in general, can {{play a significant role in}} corporate governance.

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} system {{provides an excellent}} platform for cellular studies. Most importantly, a three-dimensional (3 D) cell culture model reconstructs more accurately the in vivo microenvironment of tissue. Accordingly, microfluidic 3 D cell culture devices could be ideal candidates for in vitro cell culture platforms. In this paper, two types of 3 D cellular aggregates, i. e., toroid and spheroid, are numerically studied. The studies are carried out for {{microfluidic system}}s containing U-shaped barrier as well as microwell structure. For the first time, we obtain oxygen and glucose concentration distributions inside a toroid aggregate {{as well as the}} shear stress on its surface and compare its performance with a spheroid aggregate of the same volume. In particular, we obtain the oxygen concentration distributions in three areas, namely, oxygen-permeable layer, multicellular aggregates and culture medium. Further, glucose concentration distributions in two regions of multicellular aggregates and culture medium are investigated. The results show that the levels of oxygen and glucose in the system containing U-shaped barriers are far more than those in the system containing microwells. Therefore, to achieve high levels of oxygen and nutrients, a system with U-shaped <b>barriers</b> is more <b>suited</b> than the conventional traps, but the choice between toroid and spheroid depends on their volume and orientation. The results indicate that higher oxygen and glucose concentrations can be achieved in spheroid with a small volume as well as in horizontal toroid with a large volume. The vertical toroid has the highest levels of oxygen and glucose concentration while the surface shear stress on its surface is also maximum. These findings can be used as guidelines for designing an optimum 3 D microfluidic bioreactor based on the desired levels of oxygen, glucose and shear stress distributions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA proper risk {{management}} scheme for CO 2 storage should include an adequate monitoring plan completed with a site-specific intervention plan {{in order to}} demonstrate that any undesired consequence can be prevented, if not corrected. In the case of CO 2 escape from the storage reservoir to an overlying aquifer through a vertical conduit (representing the degraded cement of a well or a permeable fault), directly modifying the leak hydraulic properties (e. g. permeability) may be unfeasible. An appealing option is to counter the driving forces of the migration (natural CO 2 buoyancy and injection-induced over-pressure) by increasing the pressure over the leak through brine or water injection within the overlying aquifer, i. e. by creating a "hydraulic barrier". The present article presents and discusses the operational and strategic issues associated with this corrective technique and proposes a methodology in order to set the main design parameters (injection flow rate and duration) depending on the site specificities. The methodology is tested on a leakage scenario and three implementation cases of hydraulic barriers (brine injection 10 m away from the leak with or without delay, or 1 km away without delay) are simulated using the 3 D multiphase flow transport code TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N. We assess their effectiveness for stopping the leakage and for trapping (residual and dissolution) the CO 2 accumulated in the overlying aquifer. This example shows that the hydraulic <b>barrier</b> can be <b>suited</b> to low transmissivity overlying aquifers, and that its effectiveness will primarily depend on {{the distance from the}} leak to the brine injection well. When possible, a brine injection within the overlying aquifer formation {{in the vicinity of the}} leak ensures a rapid stop of the leakage and an effective trapping of the CO 2...|$|R

These suits frequently involve matters of civil rights, such as sex-based discrimination in employment, but they also involve claims of defamation, violation of fair labor standards, and breach of employment contracts, among others. To justify the <b>barriers</b> to these <b>suits,</b> courts typically rely on concepts drawn from the First Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s Religion Clauses. In particular, courts frequently invoke theories of {{free exercise of religion}} by religious institutions, or notions of 2 ̆ 2 excessive entanglement 2 ̆ 2 between church and state, to justify this line of case law. Although cases of this character are frequent and geographically widespread, the Supreme Court has not taken up these issues for many years.

This approach, which centers on the appropriateness of judicial resolution of questions rather than on the character of the parties or the label associated with the cause of action, is both normatively superior to and capable of more principled application than its rivals.

The suspension touched off a wave of anger towards league president Clarence Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Campbell dismissed the warnings, and attended the March 17 game as planned. His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit. An hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction, and firefighters decided to clear the building. Fans leaving the game and a growing mob of angry demonstrators rioted outside of the Montreal Forum, which became known as l'affaire Richard, or the Richard Riot.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{electrodeposition}} of PdNi films with controllable composition and their suitability as electrical contacts in electronic and spintronic devices based on Silicon and Carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The electrodeposition process and characterisation of the electrical and magnetic {{properties of the}} deposited PdNi films are described. PdNi films with a wide composition range can be deposited from the same bath by changing the deposition potential. Electrical characterisation shows the formation of high quality PdNi-Si Schottky barriers while magnetic measurements prove the ferromagnetic nature of the PdNi films. Electrodeposited PdNi films are thus shown to be suitable contacts for electronic and spintronic devices. Hydrogen sensors comprising back to back electrodeposited PdNi-Si Schottky barriers are fabricated and characterised. The back to back architecture ensures low current operation at all biases. Palladium causes the Hydrogen molecules to dissociate and be absorbed by the film, while Nickel makes the sensor resistant to repeated cycling in the Hydrogen environment. The sensors exhibit extremely low idle currents, large percentage current increases on Hydrogen exposure and high selectivity for Hydrogen. These factors, {{in addition to the}} simplicity of fabrication and easy integration with conventional electronics show that electrodeposited PdNi-Si Schottky <b>barriers</b> are well <b>suited</b> for use as Hydrogen sensors. The workfunction change in PdNi films exposed to Hydrogen is used to characterise CNTs contacted by electrodeposited PdNi. The PdNi contacted CNTs exhibit ohmic characteristics, which change on exposure to Hydrogen. Examining this change allows differentiation between semiconducting and metallic CNTs. Raman spectroscopy is used to characterise the same CNTs and the results are compared with the electrical characterisation in Hydrogen. The electrical and Raman analysis experimentally verify the theoretically assigned CNT Raman features. The fabrication and electrical characterisation of CNT transistors incorporating electrodeposited PdNi contacts are presented. The CNTs are spin coated from a 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene dispersion and contacted with electrodeposited PdNi. The PdNi-Si Schottky barrier is used to suppress the current through the Silicon substrate during electrical characterisation. The operating restrictions imposed by the direct PdNi-Si contact and methods to overcome the same are discussed. The characteristics of the CNT transistor in a changing magnetic field at room temperature are presented. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
