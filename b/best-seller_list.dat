5|$|Some of the translators {{hired to}} work on the books were {{well-known}} authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book.

This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the <b>best-seller</b> <b>list</b> in France.|$|E
