40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the distribution of}} the "social wage" <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from welfare services, including the National Health Service, state education, social housing, and personal social services. The current Government has put a strong emphasis on improving public services and has begun to translate this into higher spending. Although most measures of poverty ignore the social wage, its inclusion is potentially very significant in monitoring the impact of government policies on the poorest households. The paper produces estimates {{of the value of the}} social wage for 1996 / 7 and 2000 / 01, using data from several large-scale household surveys, and makes comparisons with estimates from previous work going back to 1979. The results show that people in poorer households receive a greater share of <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from welfare services than those in richer households and that this 'pro-poor' bias has been rising gradually over the long-term. Since 1996 / 7, spending on welfare services has grown faster than in the past and there has been a further incremental shift in favour of lower income groups across all the major services. These changes have reinforced the re-distributional effects of tax and benefit policies over the same period, though they have not prevented inequality from rising. social wage, <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> redistribution, inequality, welfare spending...|$|R

40|$|In Germany, {{individuals}} {{in need of}} long-term care receive support through benefits of the long-term care insurance. A central goal of the insurance is to support informal care provided by family members. Care recipients can choose between <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> (formal home care services) and <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> cash. From a budgetary perspective family care is a cost-saving alternative to formal home care and to stationary nursing care. However, the opportunity costs resulting from reduced labor supply of the carer are often overlooked. We focus on the labor supply decision of family carers and the incentives set by the long-term care insurance. We estimate a structural model of labor supply and the choice of benefits of family carers. We find that <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> have small positive effects on labor supply. Labor supply elasticities of cash benefits are larger and negative. If both types of benefits increase, negative labor supply effects are offset to a large extent...|$|R

3000|$|A {{straightforward}} {{example is}} wind shelter from planted trees. Significant shelter may be provided at {{the boundary between}} forest and pastoral land ownerships, shelter then being a classical economic externality: the benefit is matched by neither monetary remuneration nor <b>benefit</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> to the forest owner. However, reduced wind-speed reduces heat loss from out-wintered livestock, which reduces energy consumption for temperature maintenance, reducing winter weight loss and increasing survival of offspring. Applying sale prices to the increased output gives the economic consequence of shelter.

Energy conservation enters the valuation via measurement of physical response to changed environment. In an experiment in Eddleston Forest near Edinburgh in the 1980 s, [...] "artificial sheep" [...] were used in open and forest conditions, the energy consumption entailed in maintaining mammalian body temperature being measured, inside simulated insulating layers.|$|E

This required inter-regional transfers, which are now no longer feasible with the demise of the USSR. Relatively high contribution rates also pose a problem for a nascent commercialized sector.

Funds <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> constituted almost 60 °/o of benefits from the national income for consumption, but their share <b>in</b> the general <b>benefits</b> is slowly decreasing. In the studied period cash benefits increased more quickly than <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> It seems that together with an increase of the importance of wages — as a basis for compemsation national income for consumption will show a diminishing tendency. This is particularly reffered to <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> because their excessive increase may lead to the waste of funds (e. g. medicines) national income for consumption realized by enterprise has an influence on the staff stabilization and creates basis for more efficient labour. However, different financial possibilities of firms as well as the policy of extra charges from the national budget cause differences <b>in</b> this <b>kind</b> of <b>benefits.</b> They are mostly concentrated in mining industry, heavy industry and chemical industry. They are small in the light industry and food industry — the sphere of non-material production is almost overlooked.
