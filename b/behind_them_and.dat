5|$|On July 12, Dean {{ordered the}} division's three regiments—the US 19th, 21st and 34th Infantry Regiments—to cross the Kum River, {{destroying}} all bridges <b>behind</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> to establish defensive positions around Taejon. Dean formed a {{line with the}} 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry facing east, and held the heavily battered 21st Infantry in reserve to the southeast. Taejon stood as a major transportation hub between Seoul and Taegu, giving it great strategic value for both sides. The division was attempting to make a stand at Taejon, the last place it could conduct a delaying action before the North Korean forces could converge on the unfinished Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The advance {{continued}} {{throughout the}} month and by 29 April, No. 3 Commando crossed the Elbe {{and carried out}} an attack on Launenberg. No. 6 Commando led the assault, with Brigade Headquarters and No. 3 Commando following shortly <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> established themselves on the high ground, before being clearing operations in Launenberg itself. By {{the end of the}} month all German opposition in the area had ceased and it marked the end of No. 3 Commando's offensive operations. On 7 May, when the Germans surrendered, No. 3 Commando was firmly established in Lübeck, where they began the next phase of their service history as occupation troops.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not be playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that any move would depend on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E

In disguises, they discover clues {{left behind by}} Anniyan, which are {{the names of the}} punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the rationale <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.|$|E
5|$|The English {{played the}} first half with the wind <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> their nine-man scrum {{dominated}} the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7–0 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in {{the first half}} of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the half way line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} has a {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E

5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 8, Lyon opened fire on the Alice Dean, {{intending}} to destroy or disable the steamers. The men had only ever fired the cannon at celebratory events and were unsure how to aim it properly. Two shots were fired, with the second one hitting the upper deck of the McCombs, passing through the ship and landing near {{a group of men}} on the shore, wounding a Confederate. Just as the shelling began Provost Marshal John Timberlake arrived on the scene from Corydon with a small company of reinforcements and assumed command. Timberlake, who was a colonel in the regular army, believed Morgan's force was small, and decided to spare the steamships and instead shell the massed cavalry. Before the cannon could be re-aimed, the superior Confederate artillery was set up and returned fire from their significantly higher position {{on the opposite side of}} the river. The dense morning fog in the valley obliged the Confederates to guess at their target. Their first shot landed short of the Legion's position, and the second shot landed <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> leveled the cabin. The Legion defenders set off a third shot that had already been loaded into their cannon, and fled into a nearby forest. As they moved up the ridge and into the woods, they became visible to the Confederate artillery who began to shell the forest. One shot struck a log where two of the defenders had stopped to rest. They were mortally wounded while the rest fled into the forest as the Confederates continued to shell the landing.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasid victory near Hama did not {{yet fully}} {{eradicate}} the Qarmatians from the area. Taking advantage {{of the absence of}} the local governor, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh, who went to suppress a revolt in Egypt, in 906, a part of the Banu Kalb Bedouin rose up in rebellion, led by the Qarmatian Abu Ghanim, called Nasr. They raided the Hawran and Tiberias, and launched an attack on Damascus. Although they defeated its garrison, they could not take the city itself, and moved onto Tiberias, which they pillaged. Al-Husayn ibn Hamdan was sent to pursue them, but they withdrew to the desert and poisoned the water holes <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> escaped. On 16 June 906, they attacked Hit on the Euphrates. The generals Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundajiq and Mu'nis al-Khadim marched against them from Baghdad, while al-Husayn ibn Hamdan moved against them from the west, trying to encircle them. To escape their predicament, the Bedouin killed Nasr and received a pardon by the caliphal authorities. The remaining Qarmatians moved south to Kufa, on the orders of the chief missionary Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh. On 2 October they launched an attack on the city, but although repulsed, they defeated a relief army sent from Baghdad to aid Kufa. Zikrawayh then marched to attack the caravans returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca. In November, three caravans where overwhelmed; the Qarmatians massacred indiscriminately—some 20,000 were reportedly killed in the second caravan alone—and carried off women and children as slaves, along with enormous booty. Finally, in early January 907, caliphal troops under Wasif ibn Sawartakin caught the Qarmatians near al-Qadisiyya and destroyed them. With these defeats, the Qarmatian movement virtually ceased to exist in the Syrian Desert, although their counterparts in Bahrayn remained an active threat for several decades to come.|$|E
