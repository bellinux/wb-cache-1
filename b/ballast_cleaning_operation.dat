40|$|The {{operation}} of railway track {{is likely to}} involve the presence of solid contaminants on the line at some stage. This may be from the dispersion of freight goods such as coal or minerals, or the presence of ballast stone thrown on to the track either by {{the passage of the}} train or during <b>ballast</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations.</b> In addition, where a driver experiences low traction (particularly on steep or liquid-contaminated track), sand may be deliberately placed on the track surface to improve traction. Railway track in dessert areas is also known to suffer from severe wear induced by wind-borne sand particles. The effect of these contaminants is of concern since they may cause damage and accelerated wear of both track and wheel. This paper attempts to examine the effect of brittle contaminant materials on the wear of railway track. A series of small-scale laboratory experiments has been carried out in which crushed granite ballast is fed into a rolling-sliding contact. The level of surface damage is shown to be slight and generally insignificant when compared to normal rail roughness. However, the repeated entrainment of solid particles can lead to excessive wear. An attempt has been made to quantify this wear process and to develop a simple empirical model...|$|R

40|$|When a {{malfunction}} in {{the collection}} system occurs and a pipe overflows, the wastewater may be discharged in the natural environment. To avoid such pollution, nuisances to inhabitants living nearby and extra cost for the operator, there {{is an issue of}} detecting early enough the buildup of obstructions in sewerage pipes in order to react before the damage is done. The aim of this thesis was thus to develop a decision support tool to detect obstructions and to optimize <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations.</b> Some additional specifications were the file size for sending by email, the simplicity of setup and use, the visual attractiveness and a quick visualization of results. The tool consists of two Excel files coupled with a database which permits to send a daily email to the operator with the functioning state of each measurement point. However, the tool does not do everything, human analysis is necessary to have a critical eye on the results and to decide when to trigger a <b>cleaning</b> <b>operation.</b> The main perspective {{at the end of this}} thesis is the replacement of the preventive <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations</b> that were previously performed with a fixed frequency per year by conditional <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations</b> triggered by the tool and to observe the decrease of <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations.</b> Other perspectives are to spread the tool to other sites and to use the received feedbacks to adjust the different parameters and eventually to determine an automatic trigger condition of <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
25|$|Regular {{inspection}} of the ballast shoulder is important; as noted earlier, the lateral stability of the track depends upon the shoulder. The shoulder acquires some amount of stability over time, being compacted by traffic; maintenance tasks such as replacing ties, tamping, and <b>ballast</b> <b>cleaning</b> can upset this stability. After performing these tasks, {{it is necessary for}} either trains to run at reduced speed on the repaired routes, or to employ machinery to compact the shoulder again.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There is {{no magic}} {{solution}} for data cleaning. The user has always {{to specify the}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations</b> to perform. A huge number of operations {{may have to be}} specified. Yet, this is the condition to detect and correct the data quality problems successfully. Most of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations</b> are generic enough to be applied to different databases. These operations may be limited to databases of the same domain or can be so general that are domain independent. The traditional approach to data cleaning is to specify the operations at the database schema level. Several changes are required to reuse a <b>cleaning</b> <b>operation</b> in another database. This paper presents an approach that supports the interoperability of the operations among different databases. This is achieved through an ontological level that supports the conceptual specification of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations.</b> This abstraction level isolates them from the schema of the databases and allows their reuse easily...|$|R

Therefore, while determining the acceptability of various ODC replacement cleaners, {{one aspect of the}} selection criteria included determining the extent of electric charge generation during a typical solvent <b>cleaning</b> <b>operation.</b> A total of six candidate replacement cleaners, sixteen critical substrates, and two types of cleaning swatch materials were studied in simulated <b>cleaning</b> <b>operations.</b> Charge generation and accumulation effects were investigated by measuring the peak voltage and brush discharging effects associated with each cleaning process combination. In some cases, charge generation was found to be very severe. Using the conductivity information for each cleaner, the peak voltage data could in some cases, be qualitatively predicted. Test results indicated that severe charging effects could result in brush discharges that could potentially result in flash fire hazards when occurring in close proximity to flammable vapor/air mixtures. Process controls to effectively mitigate these hazards are discussed...|$|R
