60|$|Murdstone and Grinby's {{trade was}} among {{a good many}} kinds of people, but an {{important}} branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits to certain packet ships. I forget now where they chiefly went, but I think there were some among them that made voyages both to the East and West Indies. I know that a great many empty bottles {{were one of the}} consequences of this traffic, and that certain men and boys were employed to examine them against the light, and reject those that were flawed, and to rinse and wash them. When the empty bottles ran short, there were labels to be pasted on full ones, or corks to be fitted to them, or seals to be put upon the corks, or finished <b>bottles</b> <b>to</b> be <b>packed</b> in casks. All this work was my work, and of the boys employed upon it I was one.|$|R
25|$|Chewing gum {{can come}} in a variety of formats ranging from 1.4-6.9 grams/piece and {{products}} can be differentiated by the consumers’ intent to form bubbles or the sugar/ sugarless dichotomy. Chewing gum typically comes in three formats: tablets, coated pellets, and sticks/ slabs. Bubble gum typically come in three formats as well: tablets, hollow balls, and cubes or chunks. Stick, slab, and tab gums typically come in packs of about 5-17 sticks and their medium size allows for softer texture. Pellet gums, or dragée gums, are pillow shaped pieces that are almost always coated. Packaging of pellet gums can vary from boxes <b>to</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>to</b> blister <b>packs.</b> The coating of pellet gum allows for the opportunity for multiple flavor sensations, since coating is done in a layering process and different flavor attributes can be added to various layers. Cube or chunk gums, which are typically intended for bubble blowing, are called cut and wrap gums as they are typically severed from continuous strands of extruded gum and packaged directly.|$|R
30|$|The study {{observed}} further that, {{the supply}} of affordable packaging materials poses another threat {{to the growth of}} women entrepreneurs. The majority of responded argued that “packaging materials hinder the business development”. Packaging materials were not available locally; hence they had to be imported from neighboring countries, making their price high and not easily affordable. Furthermore, it was noted that some of the packaging materials did not meet the required standards of Tanzania Bureau of Standard (TBS) and Tanzania Food and Drug Authority (TFDA) for certification in order to compete in the international market. Hence, poor packaging materials posed a problem for marketing their product and expanding their customers’ base. For example, they stated that “when packaging honey, we re-used plastic <b>bottle</b> used <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> sunflower oil when we fail <b>to</b> get new <b>bottles</b> due <b>to</b> its price and unavailability”. This is certainly detrimental to the product’s taste and quality. A good packaging of food products is a strategy of attracting more customers to buy a product as it creates confidence to the consumers that the product is of high quality. Improvement of packaging materials would guarantee women entrepreneurs to increase their market size by selling more in wider geographical area.|$|R
