25|$|One must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>when</b> {{measuring}} {{temperature to}} ensure that the measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|E
500|$|When {{handing out}} scripts {{for the attack}} on the beach, Bender told the crew he and others [...] "wanted this to be really big and really dramatic". They used arrows on wires to {{simulate}} hitting the fleeing victims, which included Neil Frogurt (Sean Whalen). A stunt double, Kim Koscki, was hired for the scene to stand in for Whalen; he applied anti-burn cream over his face and body for protection, and crew members waited nearby to quickly extinguish the flames once a scene was finished shooting. Due to the abundance of wires, the actors had to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>when</b> running, or risk tripping over them.|$|E

Stefanie is very skilled in action but since she never held that type of gun, we asked her to do some training at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wang Daliang, a China Youth University for Political Sciences {{linguistics}} scholar, {{said that}} [...] "Using obscure names to avoid {{duplication of names}} or to be unique is not good. Now {{a lot of people}} are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication." [...] Zhou Youyong, the dean of the Southeast University law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>when</b> making new naming laws.|$|E

In October 2011, News24 reported that the size of Camping's congregation had dwindled to [...] "about 25 adults on a typical Sunday". Camping and his followers largely avoided the media in the months following May 2011, and he remained in seclusion after October 21 passed without the predicted events. On October 21, Time magazine's website listed Camping's end times prediction as one of Times [...] "Top 10 Failed Predictions".|$|E
2500|$|Responses to the {{restriction}} and ban of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga were generally negative. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund requested that Dan Kanemitsu, a blogger, and a Japanese-to-English translator {{who has worked}} on translating many anime, weigh in on the situation. Kanemitsu criticized the government, saying, [...] "We should always <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>when</b> start to entrust the government with discriminatory polices, be that against people, sexuality, or mediums of self-expression. How would you like it if someone told you homosexuality could be tolerated in only certain mediums, or that you may dance to waltz music but not to polka tunes?" [...] Kanemitsu concluded his interview, saying, [...] "If unchecked, the logic behind how Imouto Paradise 2 was designated harmful to minors can be employed by those in power to enforce their own brand of morality upon the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|After leaving Asylum for Island Records, Waits {{released}} Swordfishtrombones in 1983, {{a record}} that marked a sharp turn in his musical direction. While Waits had before played either piano or guitar, he now gravitated towards less common instruments, saying, [...] "Your hands are like dogs, going to the same places they've been. You have to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>when</b> playing {{is no longer in}} the mind but in the fingers, going to happy places. You have to break them of their habits or you don't explore; you only play what is confident and pleasing. I'm learning to break those habits by playing instruments I know absolutely nothing about, like a bassoon or a waterphone." [...] Swordfishtrombones also introduced instruments such as bagpipes ("Town with No Cheer") and marimba ("Shore Leave") to Waits' repertoire, as well as pump organs, percussion (sometimes reminiscent of the music of Harry Partch), horn sections (often featuring Ralph Carney playing in the style of brass bands or soul music), experimental guitar, and obsolete instruments (many of Waits' albums have featured a damaged, unpredictable Chamberlin, and more recent albums have included the little-used Stroh violin).|$|E

2500|$|Five {{days after}} the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, the Watts Riots {{occurred}} in Hawkins' district. It {{was the first of}} many race riots in the 1960s. Hawkins urged his colleagues in Congress to increase antipoverty funds, but did not condone the violence. Due to his light skin and heightened racial tensions, Hawkins had to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>when</b> he visited his district shortly after the riots. The riots stalled the Great Society, particularly over the fair housing; blacks who benefited from Great Society laws were blamed as being harmful to the [...] "law and order" [...] of America, particularly if they were allowed to live next to whites. Fair housing was still an unpopular issue in America: Democratic Senate nominee Pierre Salinger lost to Republican George Murphy in California over the issue, marking the only Republican pickup amid Lyndon Johnson's crushing presidential victory over anti-civil rights Barry Goldwater in 1964. Open housing reform seemed next on the Great Society list after the Voting Rights Act was signed, but the Watts Riot put it on hold. It was not passed until after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|$|E
2500|$|While {{previous}} Zero Escape titles {{tell their}} narratives through visual novel segments, Zero Time Dilemma replaces them with cinema scenes, intended to feel familiar for Western players and [...] "emulate {{the feel of}} a big-budget American TV show". To further this effect, the option to turn off the subtitles was included. Due to this more cinematic approach, Uchikoshi was able to make use of his experience with writing the anime series Punch Line (2015). The inspirations for the change in format were the Telltale Games adventure game series The Walking Dead (2012–) and the Level-5 adventure game Time Travelers (2012). Uchikoshi said that this would make for a lower barrier of entry for people not necessarily interested in visual novels, and that mass appeal is important to Spike Chunsoft, as just a Japanese audience is not enough for the production of adventure games. The non-linear and episodic nature of the game's chapters was done to appeal to more casual players and people new to the series, as they can uncover the story at their own pace without being [...] "railroaded into doing one storyline from start to finish". The use of fragments added some challenge to writing the story: Uchikoshi had to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>when</b> planning the progression of the story, as changes to one fragment would also affect the fragments surrounding it. When breaking the story up into fragments, he considered what would be the most entertaining for players.|$|E
