A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the <b>black</b> <b>dogfish</b> is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>dogfish</b> forms shoals or {{schools that}} tend to be larger during the winter and spring.

5|$|Active and schooling, the <b>black</b> <b>dogfish</b> is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods.

There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The <b>black</b> <b>dogfish</b> contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|E
40|$|This survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in November and December 1999 on the western slope of the Porcupine Bank and the western and eastern slopes of the Porcupine Seabight. Fishing was carried out in five {{separate}} areas, in depths between 400 and 2, 000 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagase National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on a commercial long-liner, using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total 18 species of chondricthyan, 24 species of teleost fish and 1 species of cephalopod were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were bird beak dogfish, leafscale gulper shark, Portuguese dogfish and mora. Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 42 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were birdbeak <b>dogfish,</b> <b>black</b> mouth <b>dogfish</b> and greater lantern shark. Catch per 1, 000 hooks (CPU E) was highest abundances were found in the western and northwestern slope of the Porcupine Bank. The catch rates in the slopes of the Porcupine Seabight were considerable lower.

50|$|In Britain, surfcasting {{is often}} called beachcasting. It is a popular form of fishing which is carried out all around {{the coast of the}} British Isles. Beachcasters use very long fishing rods, usually between 12 and 16 feet. The beachcaster will stand on a beach or {{shoreline}} and cast out to sea with either a water filled float, or a lead weight weighing between 120g and 200g. Bait used in this form of fishing might include limpets, mussels, lugworm, ragworm, sandeel, mackerel strip, squid, peeler crab or razor fish. Additionally, artificial flies or even spinners may be used for species such as mackerel or bass. It is a common pastime in coastal areas of Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland and often results in the capture of large specimens of many species of fish, including: flatfish, bass, cod, whiting, pollack, <b>black</b> bream, <b>dogfish,</b> smooth hound, bull huss, rays and tope.|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} <b>black</b> <b>dogfish</b> under Least Concern worldwide; it is {{minimally}} affected by fishing activity across {{many parts of}} its range, while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995. By contrast, the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened. The reproductive characteristics of the <b>black</b> <b>dogfish,</b> such as a large female maturation size, may render it susceptible to overfishing, though it is more fecund than other deep-sea dogfish sharks.

5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>dogfish</b> is {{harmless}} {{to humans}} and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005.

5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, the <b>black</b> <b>dogfish</b> typically hunts in open water, {{but also}} scavenges off the bottom.

Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
