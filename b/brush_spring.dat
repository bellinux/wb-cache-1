25|$|Large brushes are desired for {{a larger}} brush contact area to {{maximize}} motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize {{the speed at which}} the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer <b>brush</b> <b>springs</b> {{can also be used to}} make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.|$|R

50|$|Part of the Bakke Mountain {{property}}, {{which in}} total covers between 700 and 750 acre, {{was at one}} point a turnip farm owned by the Tower family. When the property was first purchased by the Bakke family in the 1960s, the fields and meadows lined with rock walls used for small livestock grazing were still open and free of tree growth. As time went on and the fields went unused, low <b>brush</b> <b>sprang</b> up, followed by saplings, which by 2000 had become a full-fledged forest. Much of the unique New England wildlife attracted by the grassy fields, such as black bear, white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, moose, kestrel, and other species, began to disappear.|$|R

50|$|Advantages of a brushed DC motor include low initial cost, high reliability, {{and simple}} control of motor speed. Disadvantages are high {{maintenance}} and low life-span for high intensity uses. Maintenance involves regularly replacing the carbon <b>brushes</b> and <b>springs</b> which carry the electric current, {{as well as}} cleaning or replacing the commutator. These components are necessary for transferring electrical power from outside the motor to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor. Brushes consist of conductors.|$|R

50|$|The brushed DC {{electric}} motor generates torque directly from DC power supplied to the motor by using internal commutation, stationary permanent magnets, and rotating electrical magnets. <b>Brushes</b> and <b>springs</b> carry the electric current from the commutator to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor. Brushless DC motors use a rotating permanent magnet in the rotor, and stationary electrical magnets on the motor housing. A motor controller converts DC to AC. This design is simpler {{than that of}} brushed motors because it eliminates the complication of transferring power from outside the motor to the spinning rotor.An example of a brushless, synchronous DC motor is a stepper motor which can divide a full rotation into {{a large number of}} steps.|$|R

50|$|The shawls {{are made}} from a blend of silk and {{indigenous}} goat fiber, similar to cashmere or mohair. Harsh climate and the specific features of the area created perfect conditions for successful breeding of the Guberlinskoy breed that has a light, warm, soft, silky and long-fiber fluff. This particular type of wool is exclusively peculiar to this breed. The goats are <b>brushed</b> each <b>spring</b> to collect the fiber. Each goat gives off about a pound of fiber. The fiber is then handspun using a supported spindle. It is then plied against a commercial silk thread. The silk helps hold {{the shape of the}} lace, preventing it from needing to be blocked as often as it would without the silk. Originally the shawls were made entirely of goat fiber, but this changed. By plying with one silk single and one goat, the price of the shawls decreased, because the labor required to produce a shawl decreased. The silk also increased the strength of the shawl.|$|R
50|$|The {{climate is}} {{relatively}} dry {{with an average}} annual rainfall of about 20-25 inches but varying greatly within a range of less than 10 in to more than 40 in. The area is central oak woodland, grassland and chaparral. The valley's trees include the valley oak, the blue oak, and the interior live oak. Along the intermittent streams are found willows, cottonwoods, and white-barked sycamores. South facing hillsides are relatively barren, with scattered patches of buck brush (ceanothus) and scrubby blue oaks and live oaks. North facing hillsides are often covered with thick manzanita, poison oak, live oak, California buckeye (aesculus californica) and buck <b>brush.</b> In the <b>spring,</b> especially after wet winters, wildflowers proliferate, including the California poppy, the Mariposa lily, many forms of lupin and brodiaea.|$|R

40|$|Tool wear {{developed}} in the drilling of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and other FRP composites has been typically attributed in literature to the abrasive nature of the fibres. Unexpectedly, early research conducted by Sandvik Coromant found {{that the type of}} resin had an important influence on the tool wear {{developed in}} the drilling of CFRP composites with similar carbon fibre fabrics and different resins using coated and uncoated WC-Co tools. This thesis studied the influence of resin on tool wear in the drilling of CFRP composites by investigating the influence of workpiece constituents on a number of aspects relevant to the drilling operation. The resin showed {{a significant impact on the}} forces {{developed in the}} drilling of CFRP composites. Resins with a high degree of cross-linking developed greater thrust force (Fz) and torque (Mz) than low cross-linked matrices. On the other hand, torque showed to be more sensitive to changes in cutting speed (Vc) in drilling composites with high modulus (HM) CF fabrics than in composites with high strength (HS) CF fabrics. This behaviour was found to be related to the lower temperatures developed in the machining of HM CF-reinforced composites compared to HS CF-reinforced systems. The higher temperatures developed at lower cutting speeds compared to higher cutting speeds increased the ability of the composite to form longer and more twisted chips, thus requiring a higher torque to produce these. Considering the influence of the workpiece constituents on the aspects commented above, tool wear mechanisms in the drilling of CFRP composites were further investigated. No evidence of chemical wear was found, rendering the tool wear process fundamentally mechanical. Two types of mechanical wear regimes occurred; mild wear, involving the removal of the cobalt (binder) and the subsequent removal of carbide grains and severe wear, involving the hard polishing of the carbide phase and high tool material removal rates. Pin-on-disc experiments and further tool wear tests revealed that the abrasiveness of the composite and the tool-workpiece coefficient of friction (μ) are higher at the beginning of drilling than at later stages, i. e. when the workpiece temperature is below Tg. Hence, the influence of resin on tool wear relies on the ability of the resin to hold the reinforcement firmly during the drilling operation. At temperatures above Tg, the resin cannot longer hold the fibres tight against the cutting edge and tool wear-related phenomena decrease (fibre-flank face <b>brushing</b> and fibre <b>spring</b> back). ...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] Thursday, 12 / 28 / 44, 8 : 40 p. m. My darling bubsie-pie, Today I {{received}} four {{letters from}} you—two V-Mails both dated 12 / 15 and two air mails, one dated 12 / 7 {{and the other}} 12 / 18. Gosh, was I ever “tickled” to get the one dated 12 / 18 because that is after the German offensive began. As I said before, I’m a little anxious about you, but somehow or other, I’m sure you are all right. My feelings {{are a little bit}} muddled, but I’m sure that is not an unusual sign during this period of strife and uncertainty! In today’s mail I received a lovely Xmas card from Mrs. Luddecke and it has a snapshot of Karla on it. The baby looks very precious—very much alive and full of vim, vigor and vitality! You tell that to “Doc”—I don’t want him to think his precious baby looks simple! Rec’d the German invasion money and also your article that the soldier needs love in postwar. Yes, we have discussed the contents of the article many times! As yet, I haven’t rec’d any of the packages you sent me. Perhaps, darling, you sent me some souvenirs which are not passing the censor. Huh? However, I wish to hell they would forward me my suede <b>brush</b> before <b>spring!</b> In almost every package I have sent you I have enclosed some reading matter, and I shall try to continue to send you magazines and stuff with your food requests. I shall try like mad to get some pictures taken and send them on to you. By all means, send me any pictures that you take! I have a ½ day off Saturday and shall try to give your letter to one of the Kodak Co. and get you some more films, and also, I’ll try to send you an AEF message, although I haven’t had much success with your receiving them! The diplomatic service after the war sounds good to me and honey, [and] not bragging, but I think you would be very well qualified from an educational as well as character standpoint. I also think that that will be a big thing after the war, plus the fact that it’ll always be interesting and not monotonous. Of course, anything you chose to do, I’m right with you. My darling, I’m a little disappointed since so far none of your letters have [sic] commented on my job. You tell me not to work to[o] hard in your letter dated 12 / 18 and I assure you darling, that if I didn’t keep very, very busily occupied I’d “go to pot” because although I miss you more than mere words can say, I’m so very busy that I can’t let your being away prey on my mind. See my point! Today was another rather miserable day at work since the housekeeper is still ill and I had to send one of the ass’t teachers home as she couldn’t stand on her feet! Then, to top it off, I tried to impress Michael Berger that he couldn’t avoid eating things he didn’t like by claiming {{to have to go to}} the toilet. I let him go once, and when he had to go the second time in the space of 15 minutes, I said “no” he would have to wait until he finished his dinner, and dam [sic] if that little kid didn’t go ahead and dirty in his pants. Well, I made nothing of his dirty pants, ‘cause I still wanted to get my primary point across. I did, however, merely take his pants off and put them in a bag—“crap and all” and let his mother worry about it! But that’s the “ups and downs in a nursery school!” So far, I haven’t received any of the issues of “Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes” that you sent me! Don’t know what is wrong with the mail delivery but I’m trying to be very patient! Have been reading “The Laughter of M y Father” by Bulosan, a Filipino writer, and the book is light and entertaining. Last night, I decided to start reading “It Runs in the Family”—psychology stuff, but found it very easy reading, and some darn good common sense [sic. This James Lee Ellenwood writes such a terrific book that I recommend (and I’ve only read half the book) that every family have a copy. For example, why are there always arguements [sic] in a family and this is what he says, which I think is excellent: “Without any particular design life dumps four or five people into one house. It is not the purpose of this home to maintain order, to establish regularity, to perpetuate peace and quiet. The entire end and aim of this unit is to provide opportunity for the four or five to make the most of their lives. It is not nearly as important to have a home to be proud of as it is to have people in it who are having a swell time. In order to make this experience of living together a well-rounded influence, the people involved will and should have opposing likes and dislikes that will range the whole field, from recreation to religion, from personal preferences to politics. And why not?” A little further on in the book he goes on with “Life is an intricate venture leading us into numerous relationships. Successful living is not withdrawal or isolation, not even peace and calm. It is, rather, the best possible adjustment to the total experience of life. To be surprised over problems is to be naïve, and to be frustrated by them is to be defeated. ” I could go on and on as every word he says is worthwhile, but I hope to buy the book eventually and then, let’s plan to read it together in the near future! Today, on the bus I started the condensation in Reader’s Scope of “Some of My Best Friends Are Soldiers” by Margaret Halsey, and the exerpt [sic] is concerned with an incident having to do with race relations—or, I should say, religion—Jew-Gentile problem, and only Reader’s Scope would probably give you that part in full—certainly, not Reader’s Digest! The book is exceedingly cleverly written, and I’m thinking of buying it as soon as it comes out in the 1 editions because I think we will read the book, but we would never study it as we would “It Runs in the Family. ” I adore you my darling, and can’t wait for us to be together again—we have so much living and loving to do! Even in a lifetime, I won’t have enough of you! You’re all I want, my darling. God bless you, and goodnight, Edith [Transcription ends...|$|R
