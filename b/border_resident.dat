They tell it as an amusing but pointed illustration of the many struggles they have endured against a wide range of political opponents. Absurdly, in the early 1970 s Socosema had to fight to get Ciudad Juarez's garbage recognized by the federal government as Mexican. When the coop erative faced a tax bill from the Finance Ministry (Hacienda) charging im port duties on the recyclable materials the scavengers had recovered from the city's wastes, the cooperative countered with a very clever public re sponse. "Que nacionalidad tiene la basura?

40|$|Since 2009, {{more than}} 100, 000 ethnic Kachins and Kokangs have crossed into Yunnan Province of China to escape armed {{conflict}} in Kachin State and Shan State of Myanmar. China insists {{that they are}} border residents, not refugees. This article considers {{the legal status of}} the displaced ethnic Kachins and Kokangs from Myanmar in Yunnan Province of China in international law and Chinese law and evaluates China’s treatment of these two groups. It finds that the displaced Kachins and Kokangs in Yunnan merit refugee status under the Refugee Convention and Protocol and that many of them also qualify as border residents under the 1997 bilateral border management treaty between China and Myanmar and the 1990 Yunnan provincial rules governing border residents from Myanmar. It argues that refugee status and <b>border</b> <b>resident</b> status are not mutually exclusive and that those who simultaneously qualify for both types of status should be entitled to the rights attached to each. Therefore, China’s forced repatriation of the displaced Kachins and restriction on both groups’ freedom of movement in China amount to violation of its obligation under the Refugee Convention and Protocol...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{changing}} Vietnamese {{state control}} over the Vietnam-China border has impacted cross-border trade networks and livelihoods of <b>border</b> <b>residents</b> in Lao Cai province, North Vietnam. The investigation uses information from qualitative research with 91 marketplace traders and border officials at four crossing points in the province. I find that state {{control over the}} border and cross-border trade has increased as this trade has been progressively brought within legal parameters from 1954 to 2005. By taking a commodity chain approach to investigate the trade networks of three locally produced goods that move across the border I discuss the complex interactions of state policy, social relations and location factors in shaping contemporary cross-border trade. This investigation suggests that state policy to encourage small scale cross-border trade and new tradable commodities are increasing the livelihood options available to <b>border</b> <b>residents</b> in the province...|$|R

40|$|In July 2012, {{a diverse}} group of US {{residents}} living near the US-Mexico border met in El Paso, Texas for a conference entitled, We the Border: Envisioning a Narrative for Our Future.   This paper describes a vision for the US-Mexico border by diverse <b>border</b> <b>residents</b> that is at odds with the widespread view of the border {{as a threat to the}} United States. These <b>border</b> <b>residents</b> viewed their region as a set of human communities with rights, capacities, and valuable insights and knowledge. They embraced an alternative vision of border enforcement that would focus on “quality” (dangerous entrants and contraband) over “quantity” (mass migration enforcement).   They called for investments in the functionality and security of ports of entry, rather than in between ports of entry.   They noted the low crime rate in US border cities, and examined how policies of not mixing local law enforcement with federal immigration enforcement contributed to this achievement. They saw the border region as the key transportation and brokerage zone of the emerging, integrated North American economy. In their view, the bilingual, bicultural, and binational skills that characterize <b>border</b> <b>residents</b> form part of a wider border culture that embraces diversity and engenders creativity. Under this vision the border region is not an empty enforcement zone, but is part of the national community and its residents should enjoy the same constitutional and human rights as other US residents. The conference participants emphasized the necessity and value of accountability and oversight of central government enforcement operations, and the need for border communities to participate in federal decision-making that affects their lives.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} the underlying socioeconomic characteristics affecting dental insurance coverage, yearly dental visits, and factors related to visiting a dentist in Mexico among <b>border</b> region <b>residents.</b> Methods. Using data from the Border Epidemiological Study of Aging, dental utilization in the previous 12 months, dental visits to Mexico, and dental insurance (proxy) were calculated utilizing logistic regression. Three different models were utilized for the dependent variables adjusting for diverse socioeconomic characteristics such as gender, age, marital status, income, education, years of residence in the United States (for immigrants), English proficiency, general health status, employment and dental insurance. Results. After adjustment, diverse variables were significant for the three different models calculated. Conclusion. Although the Mexican health market constitutes a viable option for dental services for <b>border</b> <b>residents,</b> dental insurance and dental yearly visits were lower in this region when compared to national averages. ...|$|R

Data on 184 women, 15 - 44 years old, who gave birth between 1982 - 1987, were examined using a household survey and focus group discussions. The findings indicate that 10. 4 % of the sample crossed the border to give birth in the United States. Socio-economic and legal status, spoken English proficiency, history of U. S. residency, annual visits across the border, single parenthood and primiparity were factors significantly associated with childbirth in the United States. These factors, in addition to social class differentials in attitudes towards U. S. obstetrical care and citizenship-by-birth need to be examined in future studies of cross-border utilization of services. The findings also demonstrate that most U. S. deliveries were in the private sector and paid for out of pocket, representing a very low public health burden. Changes in Medicaid legislation, which have extended maternity care coverage to the undocumented, may encourage deliveries in the public sector. These effects, coupled with the bridging effects that newly legalized immigrant networks exert on friends and relatives, familiarizing them with U. S. health care resources, will require monitoring to determine changes in demand for U. S. maternity care by this population. prenatal care obstetrics Hispanics Mexican Mexican Americans U.
