40|$|Abstract. To improve weak {{classifiers}} <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting {{could be}} used. These techniques {{are based on}} combining classifiers. Usually, a simple majority vote or a weighted majority vote are used as combining rules in <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. However, other combining rules such as mean, product and average are possible. In this paper, we study <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) {{and the role of}} combining rules in <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. Simulation studies, carried out for two artificial data sets and one real data set, show that <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting might be useful in LDA: bagging for critical training sample sizes and boosting for large training sample sizes. In contrast to a common opinion, we demonstrate that the usefulness of boosting does not directly depend on the instability of a classifier. It is also shown that the choice of the combining rule may affect the performance of <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{improvement}} of the precision of classification algorithm results. Two various approaches are known: <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting. This paper describes a set of experiments with <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods. Our use of these methods aims at classification algorithms generating decision trees. Results of performance tests focused {{on the use of}} the <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods in connection with binary decision trees are presented. The minimum number of decision trees, which enables an {{improvement of the}} classification performed by the <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting methods, was found. The tests were carried out using the Reuter’s 21578 collection of documents as well as documents from an Internet portal of TV broadcasting company Markíza. The comparison of our results on testing the <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting algorithms is presented. 1...|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} proportion of food waste is produced by the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste. Potatoes, bread slices and apples are respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion. A majority of wasted food is avoidable, with the rest being divided almost equally by foods which are unavoidable (e.g. tea <b>bags)</b> <b>and</b> unavoidable due to preference (e.g. bread crusts) or cooking type (e.g. potato skins).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to safety design, new security measures will be implemented. All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before {{they enter the}} site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended <b>bags,</b> <b>and</b> retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E
5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic <b>bags</b> <b>and</b> fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E

5|$|The Reed & Smith group (which {{acquired}} New Taplow Mill in 1950) {{became one}} of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A Fourdrinier machine was installed in 1892 and continued to make paper at Higher Kings until about 1972. A new machine was built in 1956 to make blue sugar <b>bags</b> <b>and</b> other products, and has been modified over the years to make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers and boards.

5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal. Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier <b>bags</b> <b>and</b> sachets in the town.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra <b>bags</b> <b>and</b> timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her <b>bags</b> <b>and</b> runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|In Liverpool, at 8:30 am on 17 May, Saturday, {{the twins}} went into St Anne Street Police Station to report {{concerns}} over Sabina's children. At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London. A police report {{stated that the}} twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services, a motorway service station, as they were not feeling well. The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their <b>bags</b> <b>and</b> did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items. The manager of the service station was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, called the police. Officers arrived {{to talk to them}} but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E

San Francisco's second wave included the Avengers, Negative Trend, the Mutants, and the Sleepers. the Dils, from Carlsbad, moved between the two major cities. The Wipers formed in Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, there was the Lewd. Often sharing gigs with the Seattle punks were bands from across the Canada–US border. A major scene developed in Vancouver, spearheaded by the Furies and Victoria's all-female Dee Dee and the Dishrags. the Skulls spun off into D.O.A. and the Subhumans. The K-Tels (later known as the Young Canadians) and Pointed Sticks were among the area's other leading punk acts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bayesian model {{averaging}} {{also known}} as the Bayes optimal classifier (BOC) is an ensemble technique used extensively in the statistics literature. However, compared to other ensemble techniques such as <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting, BOC is less known and rarely used in data mining. This is partly due to model averaging being perceived as being inefficient <b>and</b> because <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting consistently outperforms a single model, which raises the question: “Do we even need BOC in datamining?”. We show that {{the answer to this question}} is “yes ” by illustrating that several recent efficient model averaging approaches can significantly outperform <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting in realistic difficult situations such as extensive class label noise, sample selection bias and many-class problems. To our knowledge the insights that model averaging can outperform <b>bagging</b> <b>and</b> boosting in these situations has not been published in the machine learning, mining or statistical communities. ...|$|R
