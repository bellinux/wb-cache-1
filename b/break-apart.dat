5000|$|The {{students}} of the IUEE (as above), sympathising {{with many of the}} faculty in exile, organised two study tours of the Soviet Union. The first one went to Kiev and Moscow, the second to Budapest and Prague. He attended both. The tour of the Ukraine gave him insight into the degree of hostility vis-à-vis Moscow, and the signs of dissidence in the leadership of the Komsomol. In Moscow, a student from the highest school of politics and administration leaked the shape of the army: suicides and an organizational incapacity. Moving on to Budapest, the dissent was quite open, and Bain saw the opportunity of a <b>break-apart</b> of the Communist Block. In a meeting with the then dissident Professor Géza Jeszenszky the option of letting East Germans out of Hungary was discussed as a means of bringing the Wall down. Bain also met with FIDESZ leaders, and learned that recently NGOs in Hungary were allowed to be financed internationally, an open door for the West to finance dissident organisations. He went to Prague to meet leaders of the democratic opposition, in an underground Café called [...] "U Kafku" [...] and further discussed the plan of letting East Germans through Czechoslovakia into Hungary. He was followed in Prague by the police, and in a jest of defiance took them on a 14 kilometre walk around Prague. On his return to the Europa Hotel, the receptionist called him into the lift and explained that the police had been through his belongings. He had to leave. Bain escaped from Prague due to an InterRail pass, he was able to get into a train without buying a ticket (he would have been noticed at the ticket counter). On the train, stooges noticed him but it was too late; the train had already crossed the border into Germany. In Munich, he was hidden by a friend for 5 days, while the German television showed pictures of him as accused of common crimes of murder in Czechoslovakia. He escaped from Munich thanks to former Hungarian exiles, in a freight compartment, then from Zurich to Geneva in a toilet compartment. On arriving in Geneva he went to the house of Professor Dusan Sidjanski. Here he discussed all the plans of the dissidence to bring down the Wall, and subsequently hid for a month in a flat in neighbouring France, in Annemasse. His research report signed with the pseudonym [...] "Orange" [...] was shared with Emile Noel, Secretary General of the European Commission. It was also shared with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as well as the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It is said {{to be one of the}} key documents that alerted the West of changes in the East, and triggered of a change in their foreign policy towards the East and Central Europe just a year and a half before the Wall falling.|$|E

The most common translocations documented in TFE 3 RCCs are t(X; 1) (p 11. 2;q 21) and t(X; 17) (p 11. 2;q 25) which leads to fusion of TFE 3 gene on Xp 11. 2 with PRCC or ASPL respectively. TFE 3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been inconsistent over time due to background staining problems in part related to fixation issues. Karyotyping to detect TFE 3 gene rearrangement requires typically unavailable fresh tissue. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is generally very challenging due to degradation of RNA in archival material. The study objective was to develop and validate a TFE 3 <b>break-apart</b> {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) assay to confirm Xp 11 translocation RCCs and ASPS. Methods Representative sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were selected in 40 possible cases. Approximately 60 tumor cells were analyzed in the targeted region.

Methods The presence of the molecular hallmark NAB 2 -STAT 6 gene fusion and for the defining fusion partner product STAT 6 was assessed in 11 cases of the genitourinary tract solitary fibrous tumours. NAB 2 -STAT 6 gene fusion analysis was performed using a <b>break-apart</b> fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probe using a probe cocktail with Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones for STAT 6 and NAB 2. Results Eleven solitary fibrous tumours were diagnosed in eight male patients and three female patients {{with a mean age}} of 46  years (range: 11 – 64  years). Four of the tumours had malignant histological features, and three were considered moderate risk for metastasis. With a mean follow-up time of 61  months, 1 recurred locally and 2 presented at distant metastatic sites. Using a <b>break-apart</b> FISH probe cocktail, we found the NAB 2 -STAT 6 gene fusion and nuclear STAT 6 expression in 58 % and 91 % of cases, respectively.

40|$|Acute {{promyelocytic leukemia}} (APL) is {{characterized}} by a reciprocal translocation t(15; 17) (q 22;q 21) leading to the disruption of Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and Retionic Acid Receptor Alpha (RARA) followed by reciprocal PML-RARA fusion in 90 % of the cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has overcome the hurdles of unavailability of abnormal and/or lack of metaphase cells, and detection of cryptic, submicroscopic rearrangements. In the present study, besides diagnostic approach we sought to analyze these cases for identification and characterization of cryptic rearrangements, deletion variants and unknown RARA translocation variants by application of D-FISH and RARA <b>break-apart</b> probe strategy on interphase and metaphase cells in a large series of 200 cases of APL. Forty cases (20 %) had atypical PML-RARA and/or RARA variants. D-FISH with PML/RARA probe helped identification of RARA insertion to PML. By application of D-FISH on metaphase cells, we documented that translocation of 15 to 17 leads to 17 q deletion which results in loss of reciprocal fusion and/or residual RARA on der(17). Among the complex variants of t(15; 17), PML-RARA fusion followed by residual RARA insertion closed to PML-RARA on der(15) was unique and unusual. FISH with <b>break-apart</b> RARA probe on metaphase cells was found to be a very efficient strategy to detect unknown RARA variant translocations like t(11; 17) (q 23;q 21), t(11; 17) (q 13;q 21) and t(2; 17) (p 21;q 21).

Concurrent BCL 2 and BCL 6 aberrations were also assessed. Data were correlated with clinicopathological variables and prognostic parameters. MYC rearrangements were observed in 39 / 432 evaluable cases (9 %), including 4 rearrangements detectable only with the dual-fusion probes, 15 detectable only with the <b>break-apart</b> probes and 20 detectable with both dual-fusion probes and <b>break-apart</b> probes. MYC rearrangements correlated with germinal center B-cell origin (P= 0. 02), MYC protein expression (P= 0. 032), and larger tumor mass size (P= 0. 0003). Patients with MYC rearrangements {{were more likely to be}} treatment resistant (P< 0. 0001). All types of MYC rearrangements were associated with poorer disease-specific survival, that is, 20 / 39 dead, median disease-specific survival 42 months, compared with 98 / 393 dead among the non-rearranged cases, median disease-specific survival not reached (P= 0. 0002). Cases with MYC rearrangements that overexpressed MYC protein were at risk with respect to disease-specific survival independent of the International Prognostic Index (P= 0. 046 and P< 0. 001, respectively). Presence of concurrent BCL 2 aberrations but not of BCL 6 aberrations was prognostically additive. Radiotherapy seemed to diminish the prognostic effects of MYC rearrangements in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients since only 2 / 10 irradiated patients with MYC rearrangements died of/with disease, compared with 16 / 28 non-irradiated patients with MYC rearrangements. We conclude that MYC rearrangements add prognostic information for individual risk estimation and such cases might represent a distinct, biologically determined disease subgroup...|$|E

Nevertheless, {{because of the small}} number of cases published, information on their clinical behavior, including propensity for local recurrence and metastasis, is quite limited, and no molecular genetic or cytogenetic data are available. We report a 46,XY,t(16; 17) (p 13. 3;q 21. 3) karyotype in a deep fibrous histiocytoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones refined the translocation breakpoints within 119. 9 kb at 16 p 13. 3 and 214 kb at 17 q 21. 3. Moreover, to ascertain whether they may be nonrandomly involved in changes in this rare tumor type, we designed two dual-color <b>break-apart</b> probes with BAC clones, mapping proximally and distally to the two breakpoints, to be tested in additional archival cases by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. No <b>break-apart</b> signals were observed in the six additional cases studied, indicating either that the translocation is sporadic or that it is rare in deep fibrous histiocytoma.

40|$|RET/PTC {{rearrangement}} and BRAF(V 600 E) mutation {{are the two}} prevalent molecular alterations {{associated with}} papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and their identification is increasingly being used {{as an adjunct to}} cytology in diagnosing PTC. However, there are caveats {{associated with the use of}} the molecular approach in fine-needle aspiration (FNA), particularly for RET/PTC, that should be taken into consideration. It has been claimed that a clonal or sporadic presence of this abnormality in follicular cells can distinguish between malignant and benign nodules. Nevertheless, the most commonly used PCR-based techniques lack the capacity to quantify the number of abnormal cells. Because fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most sensitive method for detecting gene rearrangement in a single cell, we compared results from FISH and conventional RT-PCR obtained in FNA of a large cohort of consecutive patients with suspicious nodules and investigated the feasibility of setting a FISH-FNA threshold capable of distinguishing non-clonal from clonal molecular events. For this purpose, a home brew <b>break-apart</b> probe, able to recognize the physical breakage of RET, was designed. While a >= 3 % FISH signal for broken RET was sufficient to distinguish nodules with abnormal follicular cells, only samples with a >= 6. 8 % <b>break-apart</b> FISH signal also exhibited positive RT-PCR results. On histological analysis, all nodules meeting the >= 6. 8 % threshold proved to be malignant.

40|$|Abstract. Anaplastic {{lymphoma}} kinase (ALK) -positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ALK+ DLBCL) is character-ized by {{the presence}} of immunoblastic or plasmablastic cells with a strong ALK protein expression that is frequently associ-ated with t(2; 17) (p 23;q 23). The present study reports a case of ALK+ DLBCL in a 26 -year-old male with a duodenal mass. Histologically, the neoplastic cells demonstrated prominent plasmablastic differentiation with abundant amphophilic cyto-plasma and central nucleoli. Paraffin immunohistochemistry revealed: an exclusively cytoplasmic granular expression of ALK; CD 138, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and CD 79 α posi-tivity; and focal expression of multiple myeloma oncogene 1 (Mum- 1), CD 30 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). However, the immunohistochemical staining was negative for CD 3, CD 38 and CD 20.

40|$|The {{primary and}} metastatic {{gastrointestinal}} synovial sarcoma is rare {{with a wide}} differential diagnosis. It usually expresses cytokeratins EMA, BCL 2 with an occasional CD 99, and S 100 positivity but not desmin. We present a case of metastatic synovial sarcoma with unusual immunophenotype causing diagnostic challenges. The tumor cells showed focal cytokeratin, EMA, and, unexpectedly, desmin positivity. Additional intranuclear TLE- 1 positivity and negativity for CD 34 and DOG- 1 were also identified. A diagnosis of monophasic synovial sarcoma was confirmed by using FISH <b>break-apart</b> probe. RT-PCR revealed the SYT-SSX 1 fusion gene. Intra-abdominal synovial sarcoma, either primary or metastatic, with unusual desmin positivity raises the diagnostic challenge, since {{a wide range of}} differential diagnoses could show a similar immunophenotype (leiomyosarcoma, desmoid tumor, myofibroblastic tumor, and rarely GIST etc.). Typical morphology and focal cytokeratin/EMA positivity should alert to this tumor, and FISH and RT-PCR remain the gold standard for the confirmation...|$|E
30|$|<b>Break-apart</b> {{fluorescent}} {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) {{is currently}} the only diagnostic tool approved by the FDA. The low incidence of ALK rearrangement (about 4  % in NSCLC) requires a more rapid and cost-efficient method for screening. Many countries have adopted immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening followed by FISH confirmation. In 2013, the IHC (Ventana Medical Systems) for ALK status was approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). A high concordance between IHC and FISH results has been reported. However, recent large-scaled studies have also found {{more than a few}} cases with discordant results between IHC and FISH. A single assay strategy can lead to inadequate selection of patients (Martin et al. 2015; Ilie et al. 2015). Some possible causes have been proposed. Intracellular and extracellular mucin can cause false-negative and false-positive results, respectively, in IHC analysis. In terms of FISH, atypical FISH signals, such as a 3 ′- 5 ′- 3 ′ red doublet pattern, and compressed z-stacked images for vertically split signals may give false-negative results. The unique method of IHC (Ventana Medical Systems) was the limitation of the present study.|$|E
40|$|A {{recurrent}} {{gene fusion}} between EML 4 and ALK in 6. 7 % of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and NKX 2 - 1 (TTF 1, TITF 1) high-level amplifications in 12 % of adenocarcinomas of the lung were independently reported recently. Because the EML 4 -ALK fusion was only shown by a reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction approach, we developed fluorescent {{in situ hybridization}} assays to interrogate more than 600 NSCLCs using <b>break-apart</b> probes for EML 4 and ALK. We found that EML 4 -ALK fusions occur in less than 3 % of NSCLC samples and that EML 4 and/ or ALK amplifications also occur. We also observed that, in most cases in which an EML 4 /ALK alteration is de-tected, {{not all of the}} tumor cells harbor the lesion. By using a detailed multi–fluorescent in situ hybridization probe assay and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, we have evidence that other, more common mecha-nisms besides gene inversion exist including the possibility of other fusion partners for ALK and EML 4.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a two {{patients}} who presented with a solitary, asymptomatic, angiomatoid nodule on the right thigh. Histopathological finding showed a poorly circumscribed lesion, located in the dermis. The morphological aspect strongly suggested the diagnosis of atypical fibrous histiocytoma (AFH), but surprisingly, the neoplastic cells were diffusely CD 30 +, with a membrane staining devoid of paranuclear dot. The lesions were tested for p 80 /ALK 1 expression. Surprisingly, we found a diffuse cytoplasmic positivity. Interestingly, using <b>break-apart</b> fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we evidenced an ALK rearrangement in nearly 50 % of the neoplastic cells. The expression of CD 30 and ALK 1 with ALK gene rearrangement raised the possibility of three diagnoses: a primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a cutaneous inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), an AFH of the skin associated with ALK gene rearrangement and CD 30 positivity. The three hypotheses were discussed and finally, although p 80 /ALK 1 expression and cytogenetic abnormalities in fibrous histiocytoma (FH) are not yet reported {{to the best of our}} knowledge, we favored the diagnosis of AFH...|$|E
40|$|Published in 2008, {{by experts}} of the World Health Organization, the new {{classification}} of hematological malignancies forced {{a change of}} look at chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations, which are important in establishing the diagnosis and prognosis for patients with these malignancies. The new classification includes a new category of neoplasms – hematological malignancies with hypereosinophilia. Due to the high diversity of causes of hypereosinophilia and underlying genetic changes, their differential diagnosis is based on classical cytogenetics, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and genetic molecular techniques. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells showed that the majority of hypereosinophilia cases can be characterized by the presence of normal karyotype. Therefore, routine cytogenetic diagnostics should be complemented by FISH with <b>break-apart</b> probes for potentially rearranged genes (e. g. CBFB, ETV 6) and unique probes for fusion genes (e. g. FIP 1 L 1 -PDGFRA), specific for hypereosinophilia-associated diseases. In differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia, the analysis of characteristic gene mutations (e. g. cKIT) and gene fusions (e. g. ETV 6 -PDGFRB) is also applied, using molecular genetic methods...|$|E
40|$|Background: Specific {{cytogenetic}} aberrations {{detected by}} conventional karyotyping or FISH {{play a major}} role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with acute leu-kemia. The FISH technique enhances the capacity of conventional karyotyping to detect subtle chromosomal aberrations. Multiprobe FISH assay (Cytocell, UK) can hybridize multi-ple probes to a single slide, thereby increasing the detection rate of cytogenetic aberrations. This study aimed to evaluate multiprobe FISH in detecting cytogenetic abnormalities in acute leukemia. Methods: Thirty newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients who attended the hematology clinic at Dong-A University Hospital from October 2008 to October 2012 were enrolled in the study. The multiprobe FISH results were compared with those of G-banding. Results: Multiprobe FISH detected the chromosomal aberrations identified by G-banding, as well as additional aberrations in 6 of 30 (20. 0 %) cases, which included ETV 6 /RUNX 1 translocation, p 16 deletion, TP 53 deletion, and IGH <b>break-apart.</b> Conclusions: The multiprobe FISH assay was a more sensitive and reliable technique com-pared with G-banding. It was also more cost-effective and yielded faster results...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) {{provides an}} important adjunct to conventional cytogenetics and molecular studies {{in the evaluation of}} chromosome abnormalities associated with hematologic malignancies. FISH employs DNA probes and methods that are generally not Food and Drug Administration-approved, and therefore, their use as analyte-specific reagents involves unique pre- and postanalytical requirements. We provide an overview of the technical parameters influencing a reliable FISH result and encourage laboratories to adopt specific procedures and policies in implementing metaphase and interphase FISH testing. A rigorous technologist training program relative to specific types of probes is detailed, as well as guidance for consistent interpretation of findings, including typical and atypical abnormal results. Details are provided on commonly used dual-fusion, extra signal, and <b>break-apart</b> probes, correct FISH nomenclature in the reporting of results, and the use of FISH in relation to other laboratory testing in the ongoing monitoring of disease. This article provides laboratory directors detailed guidance to be used in conjunction with existing regulations to successfully implement a FISH testing program or to assess current practices, allowing for optimal clinical testing for patient care...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} several years we have {{observed}} a significant increase in our understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive lung cancer. Specifically in the non-small cell lung cancer sub-types, ALK gene rearrangements represent a sub-group of tumors that are targetable by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Crizotinib, resulting in significant reductions in tumor burden. Phase II and III clinical trials were performed using an ALK <b>break-apart</b> FISH probe kit, making FISH the gold standard for identifying ALK rearrangements in patients. FISH is often considered a labor and cost intensive molecular technique, and in this study we aimed to demonstrate feasibility for automation of ALK FISH testing, to improve laboratory workflow and ease of testing. This involved automation of the pre-treatment steps of the ALK assay using various protocols on the VP 2000 instrument, and facilitating automated scanning of the fluorescent FISH specimens for simplified enumeration on various backend scanning and analysis systems. The results indicated that ALK FISH can be automated. Significantly, both the Ikoniscope and BioView system of automated FISH scanning and analysis systems provided a robust analysis algorithm to define ALK rearrangements. In addition, the BioView system facilitated consultation of difficult cases via the internet...|$|E
