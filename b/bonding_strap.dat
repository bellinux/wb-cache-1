40|$|Trends in {{aircraft}} design and manufacture are towards {{the reduction of}} manufacturing cost and structural weight while maintaining high level of safety. These reductions {{can be achieved by}} using integral structures. However, integral structures lack redundant structural members, hence fail safety is not guaranteed. <b>Bonded</b> selective reinforcements (<b>straps)</b> can obviate this problem and improve the damage tolerance capability of integral structures, although increase the design di±culties. The objective of this research is to develop an effective analysis method to predict the fatigue crack growth (FCG) life of integral structures reinforced by bonded crack retarders, determine the effectiveness of the reinforcements, and assess the important strap design parameters. The main mechanisms that influence the crack propagation have been identified, modelled, and discussed. When a crack propagates in the panel skin, <b>bonded</b> <b>straps</b> delay the fracture growth by exerting bridging forces at the crack tip. Nevertheless damage also affects the strap due to the stiffness mismatch and high stress concentration, and the strap/substrate interface is affected by a progressive delamination that advances together with the substrate crack and limits the strap bridging action. Tensile thermal residual stresses (TRS) in the cracked substrate, caused by the adhesive cure process, act to open the crack and hence increase the growth rate. Last but not least, secondary bending caused by the non-symmetric configurations induces a stress gradient along the crack front. This reduces the effectiveness of the bridging action and causes a curved crack front. An enhanced 2 D FE modelling technique that takes into account of these mechanisms and their interactions has been developed and implemented in a computerprogram that interfaces the commercial code NASTRAN. This program is used to calculate the stress intensity factors and the FCG life of <b>bonded</b> <b>strap</b> reinforced integral structures. This modelling technique has been validated {{for a wide range of}} test samples in terms of TRS and their redistribution with crack propagation, disbond areas, and FCG lives. The FCG life of a large scale integral skin-stringer panel reinforced by various <b>bonded</b> <b>straps</b> has also been predicted and compared with the experiments. Numerical predictions have shown good agreement with the experimental measurements. Parametric studies have been conducted to understand the effectiveness of different strap configurations on crack growth retardation; these include different strap materials, strap dimensions and locations on the substrate. A design tool has been developed aimed at achieving optimal crack retarder design in terms of prescribed fatigue life target and minimum structural weight. In conclusion, a novel modelling tool has been developed, the effectiveness of <b>bonded</b> <b>straps</b> in retarding fatigue crack growth has been demonstrated and, following the parametric analysis, the most important parameters in the design of <b>bonded</b> <b>straps</b> have been identified.

Fatigue crack growth behaviour in metallic substrates with <b>bonded</b> <b>straps</b> has been determined. SENT and M(T) test coupons and large scale skin-stringer panels were tested at constant and variable amplitude loads. The strap materials were glass fibre polymer composites, GLARE, AA 7085 and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Comprehensive measurements were made of residual stress fields in coupons and panels. A finite element model to predict retardation effects was developed. Compared to the test result, predicted crack growth life had an error range of - 29 % to 61 %. Mechanisms and failure modes in the <b>bonded</b> <b>strap</b> reinforced structures have been identified. The strap locally reduces substrate stresses and bridges the crack faces, inhibiting crack opening and reducing crack growth rates. In the absence of residual stress, global stiffness ratio accounts for effects of both strap modulus and strap cross section area.

The residual stress evolution has been measured in situ during crack growth using neutron diffraction, and modelled with a finite element approach. The peak residual stresses induced by the mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion between the strap and plate materials were seen to be fairly constant with crack growth. Good correlation between the experimental and the modelling results was found, except at very long crack lengths for a specimen that exhibited considerable fracture surface roughness at long crack lengths.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 2 D FE modelling technique for predicting fatigue crack growth life of integral structures reinforced by <b>bonded</b> <b>straps.</b> This kind of design offers {{a solution to}} the intrinsic lack of damage tolerance of integral structures. Due to the multiple and complex failure mechanisms of bonded structures, a comprehensive modelling technique is needed to evaluate important design parameters. In this Part I of a two-part paper, the actions and mechanisms involved in a bonded structure are discussed first, followed by presenting the modelling approaches to simulate each mechanism. Delamination or disbond of the strap from the substrate is modelled by computing the strain energy release rate on the disbond front and applying a fracture mechanics criterion. Thermal residual stresses arising from the adhesive curing process and their redistribution with the substrate crack growth are calculated and taken into account in the crack growth analysis. Secondary bending effect caused by the un-symmetric geometry of one-sided strap is also modelled. In the classic linear elastic fracture mechanics, a non-dimensional stress intensity factor, i. e. the geometry factor β, depends only on the sample’s geometry. This β factor cannot be found for this kind of bonded structures, since the magnitude of disbond is related to the applied stress and the disbond size modifies the geometry of the structure. Moreover, secondary bending effect is geometric nonlinear thus the stress intensity factor cannot be normalised by the applied stress. For these reasons an alternative technique has been developed, which requires calculating the stress intensity factors at both the maximum and minimum applied stresses for each crack length. This analysis technique is implemented in a computer program that interfaces with the NASTRAN commercial code to compute the fatigue crack growth life of strap reinforced struct...|$|R

40|$|Fibre Metal Laminates (FML’s) {{have been}} {{developed}} {{in the past to}} increase the fatigue characteristics of laminated aluminium structures by adding fibres in the bond line. The fibres are insensitive to the occurring fatigue stresses in FML’s and bridge the fatigue cracks in the metal layers by restraining the crack opening. This results in a complex mechanism of crack growth in the metal layers and delamination growth at the interface between metal and fibre layers that, if in optimal balance, result sin the excellent fatigue characteristics for which FML’s are known. The complex mechanism has been investigated by many researchers in the past and is understood with the development of a recent analytical and physical sound prediction model. The main conclusion from previous research is that FML’s can not be dealt with as a monolithic material, but have to be treated as a composite with metal and fibre reinforced polymer behaviour. To make the step towards full FML structures possible, the effect of external stiffening elements on the fatigue crack growth mechanisms inside the FML must be fully understood. The approach generate this understanding is two-fold. First, fatigue crack growth experiments have been performed on three types of Centre Crack Tension specimen, with different symmetric titanium strap geometries. The first type consists of <b>bonded</b> <b>straps</b> {{at the edges of the}} specimen, to investigate the effect of a crack approaching stiffeners. The second type consist of an intact <b>strap</b> <b>bonded</b> over the fatigue crack centre to investigate the bridging effect of the strap, while the third type consist of a central strap which is cracked together with the fatigue crack in the FML. This type is investigated to understand the effect of the additional load from the cracked strap on the fatigue crack in the FML substrate. To make a proper correlation, tests have also been performed on these three specimen types with a monolithic aluminium substrate, to distinct the FML fatigue mechanisms from the monolithic aluminium behaviour. Second, the available analytical model has been modified to describe the effect of the three strap geometries. Correlation between the model and the experimental measurements provided additional information about the bridging- and delamination mechanisms inside the FML substrate. This paper presents the experimental work and the analysis and modelling work. Fatigue crack growth results will be presented in form of crack growth rates, crack opening contours and delamination shapes.

40|$|The {{deformation}} and adhesive stresses in <b>bonded</b> single <b>strap</b> {{butt joints}} were theoretically studied. An equation {{with a weak}} coupling relation between the peel and shear stresses was noticed in the literature, and an incorrect track to derive the peel stress closed-form solution suggested by past researchers was identified.

Mathematical difficulties in the analysis were solved and thus closed-form solutions for both the adhesive peel and shear stresses have been successfully developed in this study. In the proposed solutions the adherends and doublers can be different in material and thickness. Good agreement in the adhesive stresses between the closed-form solutions and finite element results was achieved for the joints.

The test specimen was an internally pressurized, aluminum cylindrical shell reinforced with two externally <b>bonded</b> aluminum tear <b>straps</b> around its circumference. The shell contained an initial, axial through-crack centered between the straps.

40|$|Repair on damaged {{composite}} panels was conducted. To {{better understand}} adhesively bonded repair, the study investigates {{the effect of}} design parameters on the joint strength. The design parameters include bondline length, thickness of adherend and type of adhesive. Adhesives considered {{in this study were}} tested to measure their tensile material properties. Three types of adhesively <b>bonded</b> joints, single <b>strap,</b> double strap, and single lap joint were considered under changing bondline lengths, thickness of adherend and type of adhesive. Based on lessons learned from bonded joints, a one-sided patch repair method for composite structures was conducted. The composite patch was bonded to the damaged panel by either film adhesive FM- 73 M or paste adhesive EA- 9394 and the residual strengths of the repaired specimens were compared under varying patch sizes. A new repair method using attachments has been suggested to enhance the residual strength. Results obtained through experiments were analyzed using finite element analysis to provide a better repair design and explain the experimental results. It was observed that the residual strength of the repaired specimen was affected by patch length. Method for rapid repairs of damaged composite structures was investigated. The damage was represented by a circular hole in a composite laminated plate. Pre-cured composite patches were bonded with a quick-curing commercial adhesive near (rather than over) the hole. Tensile tests were conducted on specimens repaired with various patch geometries. The test results showed that, among the methods investigated, the best repair method restored over 90 % of the original strength of an undamaged panel.

40|$|Pultruded {{composites}} {{are usually}} manufactured by pulling fibres {{that have been}} immersed in resin through a heated die. The material is layered, usually with the main component being {{a thick layer of}} unidirectional material (UD). This is often sandwiched between outer layers of a randomly orientated material. In the current work the outer layers comprise a chopped strand mat (CSM) material stitched on a woven roving mat, known as complex mat (CM). For protection purposes, a thin layer of material, known as a ‘surface veil’, that consists of thermoplastic fibres wetted with polyester resin is deposited on the surface. Investigations into <b>bonded</b> pultruded butt <b>strap</b> joints have been carried out by the authors showing that the joint efficiency was poor. This was attributed to damage initiating in the UD/CSM material interface, as a result of poor interlaminar mechanical properties, exacerbated by the large stress discontinuities at the adhesive/surface veil/CM and CM/UD interfaces. The failure essentially results in a detachment of the surface of the pultruded material. To identify a means of increasing the joint efficiency it is necessary to establish the stress distribution in the joint particularly at the interfacial layers in the pultruded material to define how the load is carried and transferred to each layer. To do this an experimental technique known as thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) is used. TSA is a non-contact technique that provides a full field map of the stresses on the surface of a component. The application of TSA to composite materials is described in the paper. To obtain quantitative stress data from TSA it is necessary to ‘calibrate’ the materials; the calibration approach is also described in the paper. The TSA data provides a layer-by-layer map of the stresses from the joint interface on the surface through the complex mat layer into the UD.

The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate that the BCR hybrid technology – beneficial for upper wing cover – could also be applied to lower wing covers. The project also focused on evaluating BCR most important parameters. The fatigue life improvement obtained from BCR was evaluated through a series of coupons and skin-stringer assemblies tested under constant and variable amplitude loading. While the coupon tests demonstrated a life improvement of only 17 % under constant amplitude loading, the variable amplitude load tests performed on the skin-stringer assembly demonstrated increased fatigue lives with a factor of 5 and reduced crack growth rates with a factor of 5 to 6. A finite element calculation tool was developed in order to conduct a parametric analysis of BCR geometry through the evaluation of the substrate stress intensity factor in the case of fatigue loading. The main difficulty was to include the interacting mechanism of the substrate lead crack and the disbond of the adhesive layer. The novelty of the approach was to incorporate the fatigue delamination calculation in order to evaluate the fatigue disbond propagation with crack growth. This was embedded in a 3 D finite element design tool ReSLIC (Reinforced Structures Life Improvement Calculation). A necessary step to the development of ReSLIC was the analysis of fatigue properties of the adhesive system in order to provide input data for fatigue delamination calculations.

40|$|Today, {{there are}} only a few types of {{structural}} engineering applications where structural adhesives play a role, in contrast to other engineering sectors. The possibilities and difficulties of structural adhesive bonding in structural engineering, especially for steel-to-steel connections, are investigated. Practically all structural adhesives are polymers. The cohesive properties mainly depend on their polymer structure and eventual additives. Specific adhesion covers all adhesion types through intermolecular forces (chemical, adsorptive, diffusive and electrostatic). For specific adhesion, good wetting is important. Mechanical adhesion is characterised by interlocking. The mechanical behaviour of most structural adhesives is best described by the Drucker Prager (or related) model. Therefore the tension strength is limited, hence connections should be designed for shear and compression. Lap connections are prone to shear lag which causes a low effectiveness of long laps. Shear lag is mainly influenced by the axial stiffness of the adherents, and shear stiffness and thickness of the adhesive. Lap connections are also prone to peel, due to eccentricity of the lines of action (externally and/or internally). Peel is mainly influenced by adhesive and adherent thicknesses, bending stiffness of the adherents and axial stiffness of the adhesive. The material properties of adhesive are strongly influenced by time-and-environmental effects, especially temperature, moister and creep are important. The mechanical properties of adhesive bonds provide potential for lengthening of steel beams, structures with thin elements, small tolerances or HSS, and fatigue sensitive, composite, hybrid and laminated structures. Due to the relative low weight, adhesive bonds have potential for light weight structures. Due to the appearance, aesthetics may allow the choice for adhesive bonding. For structural engineering there are four specific points of attention. Firstly, the strength of adhesive bonds depend on the adhesive thickness. An optimal thickness exists which is relatively small. The tolerances used in structural engineering make the application of a thin bondline difficult. Secondly, the service life of structural engineering applications is usually 50 years. At such time spans the time-and-environmental effect may lower the design strength drastically. Thirdly, for adhesive bonding a clean working environment is needed, which is difficult to achieve on a construction site. Finally, there is a lack in knowledge, products and code/directives for structural engineering. For adhesive bonded beam-to-column connections a continuous beam instead of a continuous column is beneficial with respect to tension. Nevertheless, tension is hard to avoid in T- or X-shaped beam-to-column connections. An L-shaped roof connection is the most suitable beam-to-column connection for adhesive bonding. The connection can be achieved by two adhesive bonded L-shape plates to the flanges of the beam and column at the inner and outer corner. Linear elastic FEM calculations with linear elements show that, due to shear lag, the effective length of these plates is limited. Due to the large differences of axial stiffness over the width of an H-shaped profile, load transfer mainly takes place near the web. Calculations with higher order element or non-linear material behaviour are not possible with commercial computers. To increase the efficiency of load transfer at the middle of a lap, stepped adherents can be used. The change of axial stiffness at the steps causes an uplift of the shear stress distribution. FEM and practice tests are executed for an adhesive <b>bonded</b> stepped double <b>strap</b> connection. The connection exists of two 15 mm thick steel plates (S 235) which are bonded (Sikadur- 30) by two bonded (Sikadur- 30) steel stepped straps. The straps exists of three 3 mm thick, steel plates (S 235) of 200 mm, 400 mm and 600 mm length. FEM calculations predict a nearly linear load-displacement curve and a failure load of at least 400 kN. The load-displacement curves of the practice tests are similar to the FEM curves up to 300 kN, afterwards the curve slowly flattens. A mean failure load of 561 kN, a sample standard deviation of 12. 85 kN and a 5 th percentile failure load of 549 kN have been achieved. Failure was imposed by adhesion failure; all connections show delamination near nearly all lap ends. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
