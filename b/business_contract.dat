5|$|The next year, Edwards {{published}} a significant treatise entitled Bibliographic Catalogue of the Described Transformation of North American Lepidoptera. In {{response to an}} invitation and after arranging a <b>business</b> <b>contract,</b> he traveled back to Australia to accept a position as stage manager of a theatrical company in Melbourne. Frustrated with the experience, Edwards sailed back to New York the next year {{with the intention of}} returning to acting, but poor health kept him from full enjoyment of the limelight. In March, Edwards appeared as Holofernes in Love's Labour's Lost at Augustin Daly's Daly Theatre, but was often short of breath and unable {{to keep pace with the}} run—his part was given to a young Tyrone Power who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver Surface for Daly's road show of The School for Scandal.|$|E
25|$|Republican {{senators}} {{said they}} {{voted against it}} because it was unenforceable, a position also taken by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Obama administration. However, the DOD and the White House stated they agreed with the intent of the legislation and suggested {{it would be better if}} it was broadened to prohibit the use of arbitration in cases of sexual assault for any <b>business</b> <b>contract,</b> not just federal contractors. Senators explained their vote against the legislation by saying it was a political attack on Halliburton and that the Senate shouldn't regulate contracts. The latter argument is countered with many examples of similar restrictions on contractors such as discrimination, bonuses and health care. Others felt it was unconstitutional and that arbitration is useful in resolving disputes, often faster, privately and cheaper.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} uses for {{employing}} economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on {{the conditions of}} a <b>business</b> <b>contract.</b> This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc. [...] Although {{this is an example}} of the successful application of food power, it is not a political objective. Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer. This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and land holding. [...] What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life. [...] A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies. [...] Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable. [...] Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN. A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category: the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate. [...] The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government.|$|E

40|$|This work {{relates to}} private {{autonomy}} in <b>business</b> <b>contracts.</b> The thesis is developed in two parts.

The second part deals with relations between private autonomy and market regulation. It looks at private autonomy from a historical perspective and analyzes the various private autonomy limits introduced by the recent rules governing corporate contracts. The work concludes with the configuration of a new trend and with {{the analysis of the}} impact this may have in the traditional theory of contract and autonomy negotiations. ...|$|R

2500|$|When Islam came, for the {{situations}} {{where people were}} taken into slavery (e.g. debt), Islam imposed Shari’ah solutions to those situations other than slavery. ...

2500|$|ASME {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} standards-developing {{organizations}} in America. It produces approximately 600 codes and standards covering many technical areas, such as fasteners, plumbing fixtures, elevators, pipelines, and power plant systems and components. [...] ASME's standards are developed by committees of subject matter experts using an open, consensus-based process. [...] Many ASME standards are cited by government agencies as tools to meet their regulatory objectives. [...] ASME standards are therefore voluntary, unless the standards have been incorporated into a legally binding <b>business</b> <b>contract</b> or incorporated into regulations enforced by an authority having jurisdiction, such as a federal, state, or local government agency.

2500|$|Documents feature {{prominently}} in {{all manner of}} business and personal affairs. Almost any type of document may become disputed in an investigation or litigation. For example, a questioned document may be {{a sheet of paper}} bearing handwriting or mechanically-produced text such as a ransom note, a forged cheque, or a <b>business</b> <b>contract.</b> It may be material not normally thought of as a 'document'. FDEs define the word [...] "document" [...] in a very broad sense as being any material bearing marks, signs, or symbols intended to convey a message or meaning to someone. This encompasses traditional paper documents but also includes things like graffiti on a wall, stamp impressions on meat products, or covert markings hidden in a written letter, among others.|$|E
2500|$|In some situations, a {{questioned}} document {{such as a}} ransom note, or an extortion letter, {{may exist}} which can be determined {{to be the source}} of indentations detected on another piece of paper (e.g., an offender's notepad). [...] Alternatively, indentations detected on a <b>business</b> <b>contract</b> might match information present on another such document. [...] In some situations this would be an entirely innocent finding; however, if the two businesses are supposed to be operating independent of one another, then the finding could be significant. [...] Decipherable indentations may also provide valuable information even when a second document is not present or cannot be located. [...] For example, an anonymous letter may bear impressions of writing that relate to some mundane activity of the offender which could ultimately lead an investigator to a particular suspect.|$|E

Small businesses are legally obligated to receive a fair portion (23 percent) of {{the total value of}} all the government's prime contracts as mandated by the Small Business Act of 1953. Since 2002, a series of federal investigations have found fraud, abuse, loopholes, and a lack of oversight in federal small <b>business</b> <b>contracting,</b> which has led to the diversion {{of billions of dollars in}} small <b>business</b> <b>contracts</b> to large corporations.|$|R
2500|$|When the Washington posting {{came to an}} end in June 1954, O'Brien and {{his family}} took a tour of Europe before sailing from Southampton for Australia on the [...] on 8 August. In April 1955 he became the {{director}} of engineering and sales with Howard Auto-Cultivators Pty Ltd, a Sydney firm that made rotary hoes. The company incorporated in October 1958, and the tool room was put up for sale. When no buyer was found, O'Brien bought it himself, setting up a new <b>business,</b> <b>Contract</b> Tooling Pty Ltd (CTPL), on 27 August 1959. He remained with CTPL until he decided to retire in 1972, and sold the company. He became involved in local politics. He was elected to the Woollahra Council on 9 December 1968, and served two terms as the mayor, from 1971 to 1972, and from 1975 to 1976. He died in Darlinghurst on 27 May 1980, and was buried in the South Head Cemetery in Bronte. A memorial service was held at St Mary Magdalene Church in Rose Bay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{constitution}} {{of a company}} is usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "articles of association". Companies are presumed to adopt a set of [...] "Model Articles", unless the incorporators choose different rules. The Model Articles set out essential procedures for conducting a company's business, such as when to hold meetings, appointment of directors, or preparing accounts. These rules may always be changed, except where a provision is a compulsory term deriving from the Companies Act 2006, or similar mandatory law. In this sense a company constitution is functionally similar to any <b>business</b> <b>contract,</b> albeit one that is usually variable among the contracting parties with less than consensus. In Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd, Lord Hoffmann held that courts construe the meaning of a company's articles {{in the same way as}} any other contract, or a piece of legislation, mindful of the context in which it was formulated. So in this case, the appropriate construction of a company's articles led to the implication that a director could be removed from office by shareholders (and did not have a job for life), even though a literal construction would have meant no person possessed the two classes of shares required to remove that director under the articles. Even if companies' articles are silent on an issue, the courts will construe the gaps to be filled with provisions consistent with the rest of the instrument in its context, as in the old case of Attorney General v Davy where Lord Hardwicke LC held that a simple majority was enough for the election of a chaplain.|$|E
