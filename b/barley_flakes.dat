40|$|ABSTRACT Differences in glycemic {{responses}} to various starchy foods {{are related to}} differences {{in the rate of}} starch digestion and absorption. In this study, the importance of the degree of gelatinization and the product thickness for postprandial glycemic and insulinemic {{responses to}} rolled oats and barley were studied in healthy subjects (5 men and 5 women). Thick (1. 0 mm) rolled oats were made from raw or preheated (roasted or steamed) kernels. In addition, thin (0. 5 mm) rolled oats were made from roasted or roasted and steamed (processed under conditions simulating commercial production) oat kernels. Finally, steamed rolled barley kernels (0. 5 or 1. 0 mm) were prepared. All thin flakes elicited high glucose and insulin responses [glycemic index (GI), 88 – 118; insulinemic index (II), 84 – 102], not significantly different from white wheat bread (P. 0. 05). In contrast, all varieties of thick oat flakes gave significantly lower metabolic responses (GI, 70 – 78; II, 58 – 77) than the reference bread (P, 0. 05). Thick <b>barley</b> <b>flakes,</b> however, gave high glucose and insulin responses (GI, 94; II, 84), probably because the botanical structure underwent more destruction than the corresponding oat flakes. We conclude that minimal processing of oat and <b>barley</b> <b>flakes</b> had a relatively minor effect on GI features compared with the more extensive commercial processing. One exception was thick oat flakes, which in contrast to the corresponding <b>barley</b> <b>flakes,</b> had a low GI. J. Nutr. 130 : 2207 – 2214, 2000.

40|$|Aspergillus phoenicis is an {{interesting}} heat tolerant fungus that can synthesize enzymes with several applications in the food industry due to its great hydrolytic potential. In this work, the fungus produced high enzymatic levels when cultivated on inexpensive culture media consisting of flakes from different origins such as cassava flour, wheat fibre, crushed soybean, agro-industrial wastes, starch, glucose or maltose. Several enzymatic systems were produced from these carbon sources, but amylase was the most evident, followed by pectinase and xylanase. Traces of CMCases, avicelase, lipase, &# 946;-xylosidase, &# 946;-glucosidase and &# 945;-glucosidase activities were also detected. Amylases were produced on rye flakes, starch, oat flakes, corn flakes, cassava flour and wheat fibre. Significant amylolytic levels were produced in the culture medium with glucose or when this sugar was exhausted, suggesting an enzyme in the constitutive form. Cassava flour, rye, oats, barley and corn flakes were also used as substrates in the hydrolytic reactions, aiming to verify the liberation potential of reducing sugars. Corn flakes induced greater liberation of reducing sugars {{as compared to the}} others. Thin layer chromatography of the reaction end products showed that the hydrolysis of cassava flour liberated maltooligosaccharides, but cassava flour and corn, rye, oats and <b>barley</b> <b>flakes</b> were hydrolyzed to glucose.

The two concentrates were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Lambs were slaughtered at 105 days of age. The conversion indices were similar (4. 52, 4. 77 and 4. 61 Meat FU/kg gain) for the three treatments, but the diet 3 led to heavier carcasses (17. 57 kg), although with greater adipose covering, and better dressing percentages {{than the other two}} diets. The histological dissection of the proximal pelvic limb indicated a good tissue composition (total lean 56. 16 %) but confirmed the higher fat percentage (total fat 16. 24 %), particularly subcutaneous (11. 44 %), of the group receiving only MC. Animals on diet 3 gave carcasses with an adequate commercial weight at the age of 90 – 95 days and therefore it seems possible to anticipate slaughtering these animals earlier and perhaps obviate the excessive adiposity of the carcass.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} resistant starch (RS) content in a selection of typical starchy foods on the Swedish market. In addition, the daily RS intake was estimated from Swedish food consumption data. DESIGN: The major forms of RS, including physically encapsulated starch, were determined with an in vitro method using chewing as a pre-step before enzymatic incubation. SETTING: The study was performed at the Department of Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, Lund University, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Six healthy subjects were used to chew the food products before enzymatic incubation of the samples. RESULTS: Twenty-five cereal, potato and legume products were included in the study. The highest RS concentration was noted in the legume group (9. 5 - 11. 1 % total starch basis). Commercially processed potato products were found to have a higher RS content (4. 8 - 5. 9 %), compared with boiled potatoes (2. 0 %). Among the cereal products, bread with enclosure of intact rye grains, <b>barley</b> <b>flakes</b> and semolina porridge, respectively, were identified to have a RS level in the higher range (4. 5 - 6. 0 %). The daily RS intake was estimated to be 3. 2 g. CONCLUSIONS: The main RS sources in the Swedish diet are bread and potato products, which contribute approximately 1. 3 and 1. 2 g RS per day, respectively. Based on food habits the RS intake may vary considerably, thus when added to dietary fibre intake, the contribution of RS may be of nutritional importance for certain individuals.

40|$|Grunnet et høyt innhold av bio-aktive komponenter som fenoliske syrer, blir bygg mer og mer benyttet som en funksjonell matingrediens. Prosessering, som fermentering og koking, kan føre til en frigjøring av disse fenoliske syrene fra byggmatriksen. Dette fordi ulike fysiske og biologiske prosesser foregår i matvaren under prosessering noe som igjen kan påvirke biotilgjengeligheten av fenoliske komponenter. I denne studien undersøkes effektene av fermentering og koking på frie fenoliske syrer i byggproduktene avskallet bygg, byggflak og byggmel. Fermentering av byggmel med Lactobacillus reuteri SD 2112 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 førte til en signifikant økning i nivå av fri kaffesyre (CA), p- kumarinsyre (p-CA) og ferulsyre (FA) i tillegg til nivå av summen av frie fenoliske syrer. Tilsetning av pentopan førte til en signifikant økning i disse resultatene. Når det gjelder koking ble det kun observert en signifikant økning i summen av frie fenoliske syrer i kokt avskallet bygg. Etter tilsetning av pentopan ble det en signifikant økning i summen av frie fenoliske syrer i byggmel. Tidligere {{in vitro}} fordøyelse-studier har vist at fenoliske syrer kan ha en hemmende effekt på enzymatisk aktivitet av pankreatisk α-amylase. Denne hypotesen blir ikke bekreftet i denne studien. Allikevel, resultatene tyder på at melkesyre og eddiksyre i byggprodukter kan virke hemmende på fordøyelse av stivelse. Denne virkningen kan delvis motvirkes av tilsetting av pentopan. I tillegg til fermentaing kan koking ha en hemmende effekt på fordøyelse av stivelse. Dette er tilfelle for avskallet bygg og byggflak, men ikke byggmel. Studien kan oppsummeres med at prosessering av bygg har potensial til å øke nivået av fenoliske syrer i tillegg å redusere fordøyelse av stivelse. For øvrig er det ikke alltid en sammenheng mellom disse virkningene. Bioactive {{compounds}} such as phenolic acids {{have resulted in}} the widespread acceptance of barley as a functional food ingredient. Food processing methods such as fermentation and boiling can result in a release of phenolic acids from the barley matrix. This {{is due to the fact}} that various physical and biological processes are initiated in the barley during processing which subsequently affects the bioavailability of phenolic compounds. In the present study the effects of fermentation and boiling on the free phenolic acid content in hulled barley, <b>barley</b> <b>flakes</b> and barley flour was investigated. Fermentation of barley flour with Lactobacillus reuteri SD 2112 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 resulted in a significant increase in the levels of free caffeic acid (CA), p-Coumaric acid (p-CA), and ferulic acid (FA in addition to the level of total free phenolic acids. These effects were significantly enhanced by the addition of the commercial xylanase (pentopan). With respect to boiling, a significant increase in the level of total free phenolic acids was only observed in boiled hulled barley. However there was a significant increase in the level of total free phenolic acids in boiled barley flour following the addition of pentopan. Previous in vitro digestion studies have shown that phenolic acids can have an inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of pancreatic α-amylase. This hypothesis is not supported by the current study. However, the results suggest that the presence of lactic acid or acetic acid in barley products may exert an inhibitory effect on the digestion of starch. This effect appears to be partially counteracted by the addition of pentopan. In addition to fermentation starch digestion also appears to be hindered in by thermal processing such as boiling. This is the case for both hulled barley and <b>barley</b> <b>flakes.</b> A synopsis of the study shows that processing of barley has the potential to increase the level of phenolic acids in addition to decreasing starch digestion. However there is not always a correlation between these effects...|$|E

Diets {{had little effect}} on the physical traits of meat but Diet 3 (MC without hay) had a higher percentage of ether extract both in M. longissimus lumborum (3. 61 %) and in M. semitendinosus (3. 01 %). Cholesterol content (48. 33 mg/ 100 g) was not affected by diet. The fatty acid profile was affected by the different diets: the intramuscular fat from lambs on Diet 3 was more saturated (43. 88 %) and with less essential fatty acids (ω- 3 : 0. 92 % and ω- 6 : 10. 15 %) than the fat of the other two diets (Diet 1 : respectively, 42. 98 %, 1. 28 % and 10. 50 %; Diet 2 : respectively 43. 20 %, 1. 20 % and 10. 67 %). M. longissimus lumborum had a dietetically better acid profile than the semitendinosus muscle. Depot and intermuscular fat in Diet 3 showed a positive increase (P≤ 0. 05) in the level of unsaturation (52. 31 % vs. 50. 38 % in Diet 1 and 50. 96 % in Diet 2). A comparison between tissues highlighted a similar composition between the subcutaneous and intermuscular fats of the proximal pelvic limb that were different (P≤ 0. 01) from the subcutaneous fat of the loin. Despite these small differences, the quality of the meat and of the fat of these lambs was dietetically good. The addition of 5 % maize oil to the concentrate did not show any unfavourable physiological side effects in the lambs and modified favourably the subcutaneous and intermuscular fat; the total quantity of unsaturates and the good content of stearic acid highlight the good dietetic characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Barley landraces have {{experienced}} years {{of natural and}} farmer massal selection in favour of his particular trait of interest (food, feed or malt) without any scientific background on their performance, quality or inner properties. Eight hundred and seventy eight barley landraces, collected from farmers’ sites typically used for food belonging to forty three countries, were investigated to uncover the elite properties of this international barley landraces. Series of agro-morphological, physiological and quality analyses were performed. Greater genotype effect over environment for agro-morphological and physiological traits was detected by GGE Biplot analysis when considering cultivars grown under adverse environmental conditions of the two ICARDA’s experiment stations. Strong evident correlations between traits for individuals from different countries were observed (positive: grain yield and biomass; peduncle extrusion and peduncle length, negative: heading date with grain yield and peduncle properties. The wild relative Hordeum ssp spontaneum was clearly distinct from the cultivated barley as depicted with principal coordinate and cluster analyses. The geographical representation of the agro-morphological and physiological traits based on their averages could guide an efficient collection of a specific trait of interest (e. g. trait: material with high canopy temperature depression to be collected in Morocco, high fluorescence ratio in China and high chlorophyll content in Iran). Genetic diversity study of 304 subset barley landraces from 29 countries with twenty SSR markers was also conducted. Out of them, 19 highly polymorphic markers have identified three distinct germplasm pools: 1) Eastern Africa and South America, 2) Caucasus and 3) Central Asia, Near East, Northern Africa and Eastern Asia. Barley subspecies (H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare, H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. distichon, H. ssp spontaneum and H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare f agriochrithon) were separated into three distinct groups (cultivated barleys, H. ssp spontaneum and H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare f agriochrithon) leading {{to the possibility of}} rejection the hybrid origin of H. vulgare ssp vulgare convar. vulgare f agriochrithon. Modernization of barley landraces, staple food used traditionally for making typical recipes, for food uses through assessing its food quality richness is indeed possible. Out of 878 barley landraces, 45 samples have been identified as being suitable for use in the production of pearled barley, barley flour and/or <b>barley</b> <b>flakes.</b> This project has disclosed the richness of the wild barley Hordeum ssp spontaneum in terms of protein content and β-glucans content. The significant correlation between protein content and the minerals Zn and Fe confirmedprevious reports in the literature. In addition, this work revealed that barley landraces are potential source β-glucans and micronutrients (i. e. Zn and Fe) thereby highlighting the potential for these landraces to be utilized in breeding programs that are targeting the enhancement of barley for use in food applications. The genotype by environmental effect of ß-Glucan determined by Megazyme kit on a subset of 242 barley landraces from 31 countries grown during the cropping seasons 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007 in two ICARDA’s contrasting environmental experiment stations was supported disclosing high ß-Glucan values in Eritrea, Palestine and Algeria. Barley landraces were also characterized by high amylose content mainly the wild relative and by diverse viscosity properties leading to the possibility of developing food barley products like noodles or cookies. Correlation between amylose content and ß-Glucan was revealed same as soft kernel and viscosity parameters. This latter was also correlated positively with TKW and ß-Glucan and negatively with protein content. H. ssp spontaneum also features high viscosity values. The results spotlight the interest of barley landraces especially Hordeumssp spontaneum in food industries for making various food barley products with typical characteristics e. g. barley food rich in amylose content for obese patients. The association studies of Granule Bound Starch Synthase I (GBSSI) and Starch Synthase IIa (SSIIa) genes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with food quality characteristics in barley, comprising amylose content, viscosity properties and physicochemical parameters, revealed many SNPs of GBSS 1 and SSIIa genes that were significantly related to food quality traits and amongst them few ones have led to amino acid changing (amylose, amylopectin, hardness, β-glucans, viscosity parameters, plumpness, protein and zinc. From these results, barley landraces might be considered as source of food barley products development and SNPs starch genes (GBSSI and SSIIa) as tools for food quality traits changing via mutations at the appropriate associated SNP...|$|E

40|$|Indospicine (L- 2 -amino- 6 -amidinohexanoic acid) is {{a natural}} {{hepatotoxin}} found {{in all parts of}} some Indigofera plants such as I. linnaei and I. spicata. Several studies have documented a susceptibility to this hepatotoxin in different species of animals, including cattle, sheep, dogs and rats, which are associated with mild to severe liver disease after prolonged ingestion. However, there is little published data on the effects of this hepatotoxin in camels, even though Indigofera plants are known to be palatable to camels in central Australia. The secondary poisoning of dogs after prolonged dietary exposure to residual indospicine in camel muscle has raised additional food safety concerns. In this study, a feeding experiment was conducted to investigate the in vivo accumulation, excretion, distribution and histopathological effects of dietary indospicine on camels. Six young camels (2 – 4 year old), weighing 270 − 390 kg were fed daily a roughage diet consisting of Rhodes grass hay and lucerne chaff, supplemented with Indigofera and steam <b>flaked</b> <b>barley.</b> Indigofera (I. spicata) was offered at 597 mg DM/kg body weight (bw) /day designed to deliver 337 µg indospicine/kg bw/day, and fed for a period of 32 days.

Concentrations of indospicine in the plasma and muscle biopsy samples were quantitated by validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC−MS/MS).

40|$|Nutrition {{is known}} to have an {{important}} bearing on reproductive function in female cattle. Major reproductive events that are influenced by nutrition include the onset of ovulation at puberty and the resumption of ovulation postpartum. Although the impact of nutrition on reproduction in female cattle is generally recognised, information is lacking on details of the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and ovarian function. This applies in particular to beef cattle maintained on subtropical pastures. The primary aim in the present thesis was to characterise the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and ovarian function in Zebu (Brahman, Bos indicus) and Zebu crossbred (Droughtmaster, Brahman x Shorthorn (Bos taurs)) beef cattle in relation to the onset of ovulation at puberty (Brahman) and resumption of ovulation postpartum (Droughtmaster). In the first major study, pre-pubertal Brahman heifers were assigned to either moderate nutrition (MN, n = 11)) or improved nutrition (IN, n = 11). Supplementation with cottonseed meal and steamed <b>flaked</b> <b>barley</b> was used to ensure differences in live weight gain and body condition score (BCS) between heifers on MN and IN. Heifers were monitored at 2 -week intervals for body weight, BCS and circulating concentrations of GH, IGF- 1, leptin, insulin and glucose. Ovarian follicular status was recorded by ultrasonography at the same time. Liver biopsies were obtained at 8 - 10 weeks intervals. Faecal samples were collected at the time of liver biopsies to ascertain dietary crud protein (CP) and dry matter digestibility (DMD). Pastures were sampled on six occasions at approximately 8 - 10 weeks intervals to determine trace mineral content. The trace minerals of particular interest were copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn). Heifers on IN had greater (P 0. 05) between the IN and MN for trace minerals. The analysis of liver concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn indicated that there was no difference (P > 0. 5) between heifers on MN and IN. Heifers on IN had greater (P 0. 05) between the heifers on IN and heifers on MN. All heifers on IN had attained puberty by 23 months of age whilst only one heifer on MN had reached puberty at the same time. Puberty in heifers on IN appeared to be influenced, in part, by increasing day length as the majority of heifers attained puberty over a 3 -month period between 21 and 23 months of age which coincided with the winter-to-spring transition. It was concluded from the findings that heifers on IN had a generally improved metabolic homeostasis which was linked with greater body weight and body condition, and this induced an earlier attainment of puberty. In the second major study, Droughtmaster cows were assigned to moderate pasture (MP, n = 7) or improved pasture (IP, n = 7) from 6 to 7 months of gestation until 6 months after calving. Starting at 1 week after calving, cows were monitored for body weight and body condition at 2 -week intervals. Circulating concentrations of metabolic regulators (GH, IGF- 1, leptin, insulin and glucose) were monitored weekly and ovarian follicular function was recorded at the same time by rectal ultrasonography. Faecal samples were collected at 3 -week intervals to determined dietary CP and DMD. Pastures were sampled on four occasions at 5 -weeks intervals to ascertain trace mineral status. Cows underwent liver biopsies at 3 -week intervals during the postpartum period to determine the liver concentrations of trace elements (Cu, Mn and Zn) and to evaluate gene expression. Cows on IP had greater (P 0. 05) for liver concentrations of Mn and Zn between cows on MP and IP, but the latter cows had greater (P 0. 05) between the cows on IP compared with cows on MP. All cows on IP had resumed ovulation by Week 16 postpartum whereas only 1 of 7 cows on MP had shown ovulation by Week 19 (P < 0. 01). It was concluded from the findings that cows on IP had a significantly improved metabolic homeostasis than cows on MP and that this induced an earlier resumption of ovulation postpartum. This is the first study to demonstrate long- term differences in metabolic homeostasis achieved by pasture-based nutritional management in postpartum beef cows. The most notable feature of liver gene expression was an apparent greater expression of genes linked with fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and IGF- 1 at Week 6 postpartum for cows on IP compared with cows on MP. It is not known how an apparent increase in expression of these genes at Week 6 postpartum might be temporally related to the resumption of ovulation between Weeks 11 and 16 for cows on IP. The above reseach has provided important new information on the interrelationships between nutrition, metabolic homeostasis and reproductive function in Zebu and Zebu crossbred pubertal heifers and postpartum cows. Lont-term nutritional management can be used to achieve differences in metabolic homeostasis that are related to the initiation of ovulation at puberty and resumption of ovulation postpartum. Differences in circulating concentrations of IGf- 1, leptin, insulin and glucose that are linked to the initiation (puberty) and resumption (postpartum) of ovulation could be interpreted to suggest that these metabolic indicators act at both the brain and somatic tissues to influence reproduction in female cattle. Potential actions of metabolic indicators at the brain to influence reproduction are particularly intriguing given the presence of specific receptors for IGF- 1 on GnRH neurons and leptin on KISS- 1 neurons within the hypothalamus...|$|R
