40|$|A {{new method}} of {{determining}} in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) as recently developed {{in which the}} digestion is conducted with the forage samples in filter bags. Our objective was to compare the filter bag and conventional IVDMD analysis methods using smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] samples. In addition, the filter <b>bag</b> <b>analysis</b> systems for determining non-sequential neutral and acid detergent fiber (NDF and ADF), respectively, were compared with the non-sequential conventional analysis systems. In the filter bag systems, the forage samples are sealed in filter bags and the analyses are conducted on a batch basis rather than {{on an individual basis}} as in the conventional IVDMD and fiber analysis procedures. The filter <b>bag</b> <b>analysis</b> methods produced results similar to the conventional methods and ranked the forage samples in the same relative order...|$|E

The wild boar now inhabits {{almost the entire}} Iberian territory, where today {{it is one of}} the most important big game species. In this paper, for the first time, <b>bag</b> <b>analysis</b> from two ecological different regions are presented and compared to the employed hunting techniques. One represents the well-preserved Mediterranean forests of south-western Spain, the other, located in south Portugal, is a farmland with interspersed forest areas. Our results indicate a stronger hunting intensity and also a higher wild boar population density in the Portuguese study areas. The stronger hunting intensity may result in a younger wild boar population. We also found considerable differences between the shooting techniques used in both regions and those employed in the north-east of the peninsula. It does therefore not seem advisable to directly compare bag statistics from different regions of the Iberian peninsula...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{sustainable}} {{management of the}} waste along with the availability of crude glycerol (CG) has generated interest on glycerol-based cultures. To date, CG is used as cheap substrate in fermentation in replace of glucose or other types of substrates. In this study, raw CG {{is used as a}} sole substrate for the locally isolated microorganisms from biodiesel sludge to produce bio-hydrogen via dark-fermentation. Prior to the isolation of potential microbes, preliminary test was done to ensure that hydrogen is among the gases produced during the fermentation. This preliminary test was conducted using the wastewater. Mixed-microbes including the potential microbes were expected to be in the wastewater and help in the bioconversion of both pure and crude glycerol to hydrogen. The experiment using pure commercial glycerol was also conducted to compare the performance and conversion of the hydrogen. The gas was collected in a sampling <b>bag.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the gas was done using GC-TCD with argon as carrier gas. Isolation and screening of potential hydrogen producer has successfully isolated 10 potential microorganisms. Screening was based on their ability to produce gas globules in the agar. Findings on the gas analysis showed that the microorganisms produced only hydrogen and carbon dioxide. No traces of methane was observed from the GC analysis indicating that no methanogenic microbes in the mixedcultures, and no foam was produced during the dark-fermentation using crude glycerol as carbon source. In contrast, foam is formed in the fermentation of pure commercial glycerol. From the findings, it can be concluded that the isolated microbes has the potential to produce hydrogen from the raw crude glycerol...|$|E

We applied the code to the peak <b>bagging</b> <b>analysis</b> of solar-like oscillations observed in a challenging F-type star. By means of Diamonds one is able to detect the different backgrounds in the power spectrum of the star (e. g. stellar granulation and faculae activity) and to understand whether one or two oscillation peaks can be identified or not. In addition, we demonstrate a novel approach to peak bagging based on multimodality, which is able to reduce significantly the number of free parameters involved in the peak bagging model. This novel approach is therefore of great interest for possible future automatization of the entire analysis technique.

40|$|Heavy duty on-road {{vehicles}} represent one of {{the largest}} sources of NOx emissions and fuel consumption in North America. Heavy duty vehicles are predominantly fueled with diesel, with the recent interest in natural gas (NG) systems. As emissions and greenhouse gas regulations continue to tighten new opportunities for advanced fleet specific heavy duty vehicles are becoming available with improved fuel economy. NOx emissions have dropped 90 % for heavy duty vehicles with the recent 2010 certification limit. Additional NOx reductions of another 90 % are desired for the South Coast Air basin to meet its 2023 NOx inventory requirements and the California optional low NOx standard in 2015. One of the difficulties in quantifying NOx emissions at the levels proposed in this research (90 % of the 2010 certification level ~ 0. 02 g/bhp-hr) is the measurement methods are approaching their detection limit to sufficiently quantify NOx emissions. Three upgraded NOx measurement methods were considered which include a raw NOx measurement integrated with real time exhaust flow, a real-time ambient correction approach, and a trace level ambient analyzer for accurate <b>bag</b> <b>analysis.</b> In summary the improved methods varied in their success where the raw sampling approach showed to be the most accurate and precise over the rage of conditions tested. The ISL G NZ 8. 9 liter NG engine met and exceeded the target NOx emissions of 0. 02 g/bhp-hr. This engine significantly reduced 97 %- 100 % of NOx emissions compared with previous ISL G 8. 9 engines. The NOx emissions decreased as the duty cycle was decreased which was the opposite trend for the diesel vehicles. It is expected NG vehicles could {{play a role in the}} reduction of the south coast NOx inventory problem given their near zero emission factors demonstrated...|$|E

Microplastics can also be obtained directly in the form of fibers from washing, as particles from cosmetic products or as by-product of larger plastic parts. In our thesis we wanted to prove, that the current concentration of microplastics in the environment (compost heap) has an impact on terrestrial organisms, in this case terrestrial isopod crustaceans, Porcelio scaber. We hypothesised, that microplastics would have an impact on feeding, as it acumulates in the gut. We also anticipated that this would reflect in altered digestive gland (hepatopancreas) energy reserves in terms of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Animals were exposed to food, contaminated with microplastics and maintained properly in Petri dish. Exposure lasted 14 days under standard laboratory conditions. We used environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics in compost heap (4 mg microplastics/g dry food). We tested three types of plastics: isolated from the cosmetic product in two different fractions and isolated from PVC <b>bags.</b> <b>Analysis</b> showed that the tested concentrations of microplastics had no effect on feeding and energy reserves after 14 days of exposure.

40|$|The peak <b>bagging</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{namely the}} fitting and {{identification}} of single oscillation modes in stars' power spectra, coupled {{to the very}} high-quality light curves of red giant stars observed by Kepler, can {{play a crucial role}} for studying stellar oscillations of different flavor with an unprecedented level of detail. A thorough study of stellar oscillations would thus allow for deeper testing of stellar structure models and new insights in stellar evolution theory. However, peak bagging inferences are in general very challenging problems due to the large number of observed oscillation modes, hence of free parameters that can be involved in the fitting models. Effciency and robustness in performing the analysis is what may be needed to proceed further. For this purpose, we developed a new code implementing the Nested Sampling Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm, a powerful statistical method well suited for Bayesian analyses of complex problems. In this talk we show the peak bagging of a sample of high signal-to-noise red giant stars by exploiting recent Kepler datasets and a new criterion for the detection of an oscillation mode based on the computation of the Bayesian evidence. Preliminary results for frequencies and lifetimes for single oscillation modes, together with acoustic glitches, are therefore presented.

40|$|Stars {{originate}} by {{the gravitational}} {{collapse of a}} turbulent molecular cloud of a diffuse medium, and are often observed to form clusters. Stellar clusters therefore {{play an important role}} in our understanding of star formation and of the dynamical processes at play. However, investigating the cluster formation is diffcult because the density of the molecular cloud undergoes a change of many orders of magnitude. Hierarchical-step approaches to decompose the problem into different stages are therefore required, as well as reliable assumptions on the initial conditions in the clouds. We report for the first time the use of the full potential of NASA Kepler asteroseismic observations coupled with 3 D numerical simulations, to put strong constraints on the early formation stages of open clusters. Thanks to a Bayesian peak <b>bagging</b> <b>analysis</b> of about 50 red giant members of NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, the two most populated open clusters observed in the nominal Kepler mission, we derive a complete set of detailed oscillation mode properties for each star, with thousands of oscillation modes characterized.

Finally, our observational findings will be compared with hydrodynamical simulations for stellar cluster formation to constrain the physical processes of turbulence, rotation, and magnetic fields that are in action during the collapse of the progenitor cloud into a proto-cluster...|$|R

Fifty-three patients underwent two successive 13 C-UBTs with an interval of 48 to 72 hours. The 106 collected bags were randomly reanalyzed immediately or 72 hours later. In 26 volunteer subjects, the 13 C-UBT was performed both in a fasting condition and after a nonstandardized meal. The reproducibility was assessed by the method of Bland and Altman. Results. The mean of difference between two successive tests was 0. 14 0 / 00 (standard deviation, 0. 90), and the coefficient of repeatability was 1. 80 (confidence interval, 95 %). The difference between two successive analyses was always less than 2. 2 % of the initial value. The coefficient of variation between two successive tests for the influence of a meal was 11. 24.

40|$|Abstract—Combining several ANNs into an {{ensemble}} normally {{results in a}} very accurate and robust predictive model. Many ANN ensemble techniques are, however, quite complicated and often explicitly optimize some diversity metric. Unfortunately, the lack of solid validation of the explicit algorithms, at least for classification, makes the use of diversity measures {{as part of an}} optimization function questionable. The merits of implicit methods, most notably bagging, are on the other hand exper-imentally established and well-known. This paper evaluates a number of straightforward techniques for introducing implicit diversity in ANN ensembles, including a novel technique pro-ducing diversity by using ANNs with different link structures. The experimental results, comparing altogether 54 setups and two different ensemble sizes on 30 UCI data sets, show that all methods succeeded in producing implicit diversity, but that the effect on ensemble accuracy varied. Still, most setups evaluated did result in more accurate ensembles, compared to the baseline setup, especially for the larger ensemble size. As a matter of fact, several setups even obtained significantly higher ensemble accuracy than <b>bagging.</b> The <b>analysis</b> also identified that diversity was, relatively speaking, more important for the larger ensembles. Looking specifically at the methods used to increase the implicit diversity, setups using the technique that utilizes the randomized link structures generally produced the most accurate ensembles.

This report extends the knowledge about geographical distribution and confirms the association of M. pusilla with hosts Columbiformes, contributing to the knowledge of the family Hippoboscidae in the country...|$|R
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{assessing}} the environmental impacts and benefits of the current municipal solid waste management system and two modified systems, EASEWASTE, a life-cycle-based model, {{was used to evaluate}} the waste system of Hangzhou city in China. An integrated model was established, including waste generation, collection, transportation, treatment, disposal and accompanying external processes. The results showed that CH 4 released from landfilling was the primary pollutant contributing to global warming, and HCl and NH 3 from incineration contributed most to acidification. Material recycling and incineration with energy recovery were important because of the induced savings in material production based on virgin materials and in energy production based on coal combustion. A modified system in which waste is transported to the nearest incinerators would be relatively better than the current system, mainly due to the decrease of pollution from landfilled waste and the increase in energy production from waste avoiding energy production by traditional power plants. A ban on free plastic bags for shopping was shown to reduce most environmental impacts due to saved oil resources and other materials used in producing the plastic <b>bags.</b> Sensitivity <b>analysis</b> confirmed the robustness of the results. LCA methodology and a model like EASEWASTE are very suitable for evaluating the overall environmental consequences, and can be used for decision support and strategic planning in developing countries such as China where pollution control has become increasingly important with the rapid increase of wast...|$|R
40|$|Section 1. XAS analysis. Approximately 100 mg {{samples of}} dried red mud samples K 1 a and K 1 c and the {{precipitate}} recovered from red mud leachate experiments {{were prepared for}} XAS analysis by vigorous homogenisation in an acid washed agate mortar and pestle and pressed into 8 mm pellets held in Kapton ™ tape. Standard materials were also prepared as pressed pellets using cellulose as a diluent to reduce chemical thickness (to achieve an edge step between 0. 5 and 1. 5 in transmission mode, see below) and held in Kapton ™ tape. Solutions of sodium arsenate and sodium arsenite were prepared at 1000 mg. L- 1 and held in polythene <b>bags</b> for <b>analysis.</b> A sodium vanadate solution was prepared in 0. 1 mol. L- 1 NaOH, also at 1000 mg. L- 1, and held in polythene bags as above. As, Cr and V K-edge spectra were collected on beamline I 18 at the Diamond Light Source operating at 3 GeV with a typical current of 200 mA, using a nitrogen cooled Si(111) double crystal monochromator and focussing optics. A pair of plane mirrors was used to reduce the harmonic content of the beam and Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors were used to produce a relatively unfocused beam (approximately 0. 5 mm diameter at the sample). For standards prepared as pressed pellets, K-edge spectra were collected in transmission mode at room temperature (~ 295 °K). For samples an...|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} eight coal samples were {{obtained}} from the states of Nasarawa and Gombe, Nigeria. Three samples were collected at different spots from Shankodi-Jangwa coal seam, Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. Three and two coal samples were respectively collected from Garin Maiganga coal mines and Tai coal deposit, both in the Akko Local Government Area of Gombe State. In each case, the coal samples collected from the coal mines were mixed properly and divided into four segments. In each of the segment, a particular size of the sample constituent - large, medium and small particles - was picked round to give almost equal representation of the segment, and the sample at large. A reference coal sample was obtained from the National Metallurgical Development Centre, Jos. The coal samples were shade-dried to remove the free moisture and then ground to fine powder, sieved through 250 and 425 [*]μm, and kept in an airtight polythene <b>bag</b> for further <b>analysis.</b>|$|R
30|$|About 400 – 500  g {{wet weight}} of mixed surface sediments (0 – 10  cm) were {{collected}} using an Ekman bottom sampler (Hydro-Bios, Kiel, Germany). To reduce {{the heterogeneity of}} sediments and avoid the effects of water and plant, three equal samples were collected and mixed as one. Soil samples from plant beds weighing 300 – 400  g were collected using a soil auger (XDB-TR 7, sampling depth: 1.5  m, drill diameter: 5  cm; Beijing New Landmark Soil Equipment Co., Ltd.) at depths of 0 – 30  cm. Immediately after collection, soil temperature, pH, and redox potential (Eh) were measured using an IQ 150 probe (HACH, USA); then, samples were preserved in bags on ice for transportation. Samples for ammonium-N, nitrate-N, and nitrite-N assays were stored under - 4  °C. The remaining samples were frozen, air dried, and sieved through a 100 -mesh sieve to remove coarse particles. The sediment/soil samples were then stored in plastic <b>bags</b> for further <b>analysis.</b>|$|R
