For high Kow chemicals that do not reach steady-state in environmental compartments quickly, the steady-state based models could overestimate chemical concentrations and lead to errors in environmental evaluation. A time-dependent food web bioaccumulation model was developed to improve {{the evaluation of the}} fate and effects of pesticides in aquatic environments. The performance of the model was evaluated by simulating a Bluegill <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>study</b> for metaflumizone and microcosm studies for three pesticides, metaflumizone, kresoxim-methyl and pyraclostrobin.

40|$|Emodin {{is a major}} active {{anthraquinone}} {{of various}} herbal laxatives, which can exert many pharmacological effects. However, chronic use of anthranoid laxatives, even at low dosages, may cause melanosis coli (MC). It {{has been suggested that}} the accumulation of anthraquinones is a risk factor in the MC process. To investigate the accumulation of emodin, we conducted a <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>study</b> of emodin in zebrafish eleutheroembryos. Based on the economic cooperation and development (OECD) 305 test, zebrafish eleutheroembryos were exposed to emodin at a constant concentration for 48 h, before the test media were replaced by the blank medium for 24 h of depuration. To eliminate the effect of metabolism of emodin for assessment of the bioconcentration factor (BCF), we also conducted a modified test for which zebrafish eleutheroembryos were exposed to the non-renewed test media, whose emodin concentration decreased with time. At different exposure time points, zebrafish eleutheroembryos and exposure media were sampled for analysis of emodin concentration using HPLC-MS/MS. The results showed rapid accumulation of emodin in zebrafish eleutheroembryos to reach a steady-state concentration within 24 h. Meanwhile, emodin was actively metabolized by zebrafish eleutheroembryos to result in 29. 5 – 40. 7 % of its elimination. In the groups with high or low concentrations of emodin, the standardized BCF (sBCF) values in the standard test were 24. 0 and 20. 0, while those in the modified test were 50. 4 and 52. 0. These results showed that emodin could accumulate in zebrafish eleutheroembryos when used for 48 h and beyond, suggesting that the accumulation of anthraquinones may be a risk factor in the MC process. Accordingly, emodin should be unsuitable for long-term use due to its accumulation...|$|E

The results showed that total concentrations extracted by SPME combined with internal standards and LLE are equal. The results further verify the possibility of simultaneous extraction of total and freely dissolved HOC concentrations by SPME. Freely dissolved concentrations allow the assessment of sorption and bioavailability of HOCs in <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>studies</b> and their potential impact on resulting bioconcentration factors (BCFs). Reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations can result in an underestimation of BCFs if they are calculated based on total water concentrations. For polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, a significant increase in BCF value was observed when freely dissolved concentrations were taken into account. However, log BCF values calculated based on freely dissolved concentrations did not correlate linearly with log KOW values above 5 to 6. This pointed to further influences besides a reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations by sorption to organic matter.

Variability in muscle concentrations between fish species decreased when concentrations were normalized to lipid content. Several studies describe the residue distribution over different organs (e.g., [31, 45, 47 – 53]).

30|$|An {{important}} {{aim of the}} European Community Regulation on {{chemicals and}} their safe use is the identification of (very) persistent, (very) bioaccumulative, and toxic substances. In other regulatory chemical safety assessments (pharmaceuticals, biocides, pesticides), the identification of such (very) persistent, (very) bioaccumulative, and toxic substances is of increasing importance. Solid-phase microextraction is especially capable of extracting total water concentrations {{as well as the}} freely dissolved fraction of analytes in the water phase, which is available for bioconcentration in fish. However, although already well established in environmental analyses to determine and quantify analytes mainly in aqueous matrices, solid-phase microextraction is still a rather unusual method in regulatory ecotoxicological research.

30|$|The {{use of the}} {{relationship}} with KOW is proposed by Regulation 253 / 2011 (REACH) [5] as a preliminary screening procedure for PBT or vPvB categorization but a criterion is not provided in the Regulation. The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) proposed the value of log KOW > 4.5 as a criterion for B [82]. However, KOW {{does not account for}} metabolic transformation and active excretion processes [24]. Therefore, false positives are highly probable and KOW must be assumed only as an indicator of worst-case conditions of the ‘potential’ for bioconcentration. More complex models, based on several molecular properties and descriptors, have been recently developed [83 – 85]. These models are more powerful than the simple relationship with KOW; however, with the exception of EPISUITE 4.1 [83], they are limited to prediction of bioconcentration and do not consider biotransformation and/or excretion. As <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>studies</b> are required for registration of PPPs with a log KOW of > 3, modeling or extrapolation of BCF from properties such as KOW is not necessary.|$|R
40|$|Surfactants are {{a commercially}} {{important}} group of chemicals widely {{used on a}} global scale. Despite high removal efficiencies during wastewater treatment, their high consumption volumes mean that a certain fraction will always enter aquatic ecosystems, with marine environments being the ultimate sites of deposition. Consequently, surfactants have been detected within marine waters and sediments. However, aquatic environmental studies have mostly focused on the freshwater environment, and marine studies are considerably underrepresented by comparison. The present review aims to provide a summary of current marine environmental fate (monitoring, biodegradation, and bioconcentration) and effects data of 5 key surfactant groups: linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, alcohol ethoxysulfates, alkyl sulfates, alcohol ethoxylates, and ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride. Monitoring data are currently limited, especially for alcohol ethoxysulfates and alkyl sulfates. Biodegradation was shown to be considerably slower under marine conditions, whereas ecotoxicity studies suggest that marine species are approximately equally as sensitive to these surfactants as freshwater species.

30|$|Bioconcentration {{guidelines}} such as OECD TG 305 [1], the United States Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (U.S. EPA OPPTS) 850.1730, [10] and Japanese Industrial Standards [11] {{emphasize the}} importance of lipid normalization; however, a clear guidance on lipid measurement in fish is missing. The results obtained with different extraction methods may differ quite considerably [6, 8, 9, 12 – 18], leading to over- or underestimations when normalizing BCF values to lipid contents. Therefore, the selection of appropriate extraction techniques using mixed systems of nonpolar and polar solvents is required to ensure the complete extraction of total lipids from fish/tissue samples. In this context, the OECD 305 guideline [1] recommends the use of chloroform/methanol for determination of fish lipid content. The microgravimetric assay for total lipids described by Gardner et al. [19] is given as a key reference. However, a broad range of analytical procedures are available which can be used for lipid measurements as part of <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>studies</b> and thus may have a potential impact on the results obtained. To guarantee the comparability of BCFs obtained in different studies, the analytical procedures should be further standardized. Therefore, in the course of revising OECD guideline 305 [1], lipid determination is one point that needs clarification.|$|R

The following study examined the uptake of arsenic in crawfish after long-term exposure to this mixture, and the health risks associated with consumption of these crawfish. Bioconcentration and depuration experiments using a 50 : 50 by concentration mixture of the two herbicides, with and without surfactant, were performed to quantify how much arsenic is concentrated in the edible tissue of the crawfish. Of the three tissues (muscle, gill, and hepatopancreas) sampled hepatopancreas bioconcentrated the highest amount of arsenic. Surfactant significantly reduced this uptake but did not affect bioconcentration of arsenic into other tissues. Surfactant had no effect on depuration of arsenic from any of the tissues. Cooking lowered hepatopancreatic arsenic content, possibly as a result of structural changes in the hepatopancreas. Assessment of the human health risk associated with consuming these crawfish showed an exposure dose at the high end of consumption that was approximately twice the reference dose for arsenic.

Bioaccumulation also {{plays an important role}} in terms of evaluating secondary poisoning. To date, the vast majority of research on bioaccumulation has been conducted on aquatic organisms and uptake through the gills. <b>Bioconcentration</b> <b>studies</b> are commonly carried out according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) test guideline (TG) 305 [4] which was recently revised and now provides an additional test for dietary uptake.

This may involve the use of invertebrate species, in vitro approaches or in silico modelling. Recent scientific progress has yielded a large number of strategies and concepts for assessing chemical bioaccumulation. To address these issues, a workshop, organised by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) and Fraunhofer IME in June 2014, focused on bioaccumulation and its current developments and challenges in the regulatory context. In several talks, the results of UBA funded research projects on bioaccumulation issues were presented. Participants from academia, industry and regulatory bodies discussed which refinements of the test systems and screening approaches would be necessary or useful and which additional research is needed to improve bioaccumulation assessment (B-assessment).|$|R

Separate toxicity studies were conducted prior to <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>studies</b> using {{a range of}} chemical concentrations to establish the sublethal exposure conditions for the earthworms. The objectives of the present studies were to: (1) develop an experimental test system for estimating bioconcentration potentials of new and emerging munition compounds that partition into earthworms, using aqueous exposure media; and (2) apply this experimental model to establish original bioconcentration data for 4 -NAN, 3, 5 -DNoTAME, and 2 -M- 5 -NPYNE. Experimental design includes earthworm exposures to chemicals for up to 14 days in aqueous media (R 6 mbke medium; 0. 08 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 ̆ 082, 0. 5 mM MgSO 2 ̆ 084, and 0. 8 mM NaHCO 2 ̆ 083) {{in the presence of}} water-washed coarse sand (0. 52 ̆ 0131. 0 mm) substrate.

30|$|SPME {{coupled to}} GC is a {{well-established}} method in water analysis, especially for total analyte concentrations, and seems capable of automatically measuring analyte {{concentrations in the}} water phase in standardized <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>studies.</b> However, with few limitations, automated SPME allows the gain of free analyte concentrations simultaneously. With regard to the partitioning of HOCs in aquatic systems, it can be expected that the conventional extraction procedure (LLE) may capture significant amounts of molecules bound to suspended and dissolved OM that are not available to fish. These amounts do not contribute to BCF but are extracted by the classical total extraction techniques. Aqueous analyte concentrations with special reference to different contents of TOC were investigated [28]. These first {{results showed that the}} freely dissolved concentration of highly HOCs can be significantly reduced due to sorption to natural OM - already beneath the permitted concentration of 2 mg L- 1 TOC in the dilution water according to OECD TG 305. It is to be expected that resulting BCF values for highly HOCs may be inaccurate and lead to an underestimation of BCFs. This aspect was raised by Jonker and van der Heijden [13], although their study on the determination of BCFs was not carried out with fish and without measuring of TOC concentrations. To examine if there is an underestimation of fish BCFs caused by measuring artifacts, flow-through fish tests with HOCs should be carried out under realistic conditions. Likewise, the influence of different organic carbon levels and the influence of OM quality in experimental systems should be investigated in-depth. Based on the approaches and studies described here, {{it will be possible to}} further elucidate whether highly HOCs with log KOW values > 5 bioconcentrate less than what may be expected from their hydrophobicity.|$|R
30|$|The Dessau Workshop on {{bioaccumulation}} gave {{a comprehensive}} {{overview of the}} state of the art of B-assessment, provided insights into the problems and challenges faced by the regulatory authorities and described new research concepts and their regulatory implications. In brief, the use of the standard BCF test following OECD TG 305 has been demonstrated to generate reliable results with aquatic exposure for the majority of neutral, lipophilic organic substances. In addition, using column generated concentrations and keeping the total organic carbon in the test system as low as possible, flow-through tests can be also carried out with highly lipophilic test items (HOCs)SPME measurements used for the extraction of freely dissolved concentrations can provide important insights into the presence of molecules bound to organic matter and thus the bioavailability of HOCs in flow-through tests. Consequently the recommendation of SPME for measuring aqueous HOC concentrations has been included in the revised OECD TG 305. The elimination half-life (EL 0.5) might be considered as a potential metric which could harmonise the different bioaccumulation metrics. The prediction of bioaccumulation by in vitro approaches such as fish S 9 liver fractions and primary hepatocytes shows high potential to reduce the need for animal testing. Alternatively, <b>bioconcentration</b> <b>studies</b> with the freshwater invertebrate H. azteca may support animal welfare considerations using a non-vertebrate species. Physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models can improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms bioaccumulation processes and reduce uncertainty of regulatory decision in the future. Organism–water and tissue–water partitioning coefficients for many neutral chemicals can be accurately predicted by combination of compositional information and PP-LFER models. In contrast, sorption of ions is complex and still not well understood. The use of the model COSMOmic in combination with optimised membrane dipole potentials is recommended for charged compounds. The use of new screening criteria for non-lipid accumulating substances may help to identify such compounds which pose a risk for bioaccumulation. The acquisition of information on bioaccumulation/biomagnification potential and the mechanisms involved as well as the potential to reduce the need for vertebrate testing should be explored further at all levels, and incorporated into a comprehensive testing and assessment strategy that goes beyond a mere bioconcentration factor. Concluding, we strongly recommend that the proposed amendments will be considered for implementation into the current and future guidance documents.|$|R

Here, WoE is used as a quantitative procedure for evaluating the strength of studies, based on how they were conducted, and the relevance of the data from the studies to characterization of the COC, CPY, as a POP or PBT chemical. Strength of studies was evaluated by a numerical scoring system (see the ‘Quality assurance’ section).

Samples (kidney, liver, muscle, A. crassus and P. macrocephalus) of 20 eels harbouring A. crassus and another 20 harbouring both A. crassus and P. macrocephalus were selected for element analysis by ICP-MS. The highest concentrations of Cr, Ni and Zn were detected in P. macrocephalus. However, there was a higher liver and muscle Cr concentration in eels not infected by P. macrocephalus. Also, the nematode A. crassus presented higher Cr concentrations in those eels harbouring P. macrocephalus. Results suggest that P. macrocephalus individuals accumulate Cr and Ni while levels of Cr in eel livers and Ni levels in eel kidney are reduced. The system P. macrocephalus/A. anguilla yielded bioaccumulation factors for Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn, whereas bioaccumulation of Cu, Cr and Pb in A. crassus varied according to eel co-infection with P. macrocephalus, thus emphasising the possible role of cestode infection in metal metabolization/storage processes in host tissues. Results suggest that heavy metal pollution in Ria de Aveiro has been decreasing although it is still higher than in other contaminated areas in Europe. Nevertheless, eel consumption in Ria de Aveiro represents no risk for humans although they may represent a real contamination risk for wildlife.

30|$|For highly HOCs, an {{alternative}} fish dietary bioaccumulation approach will be recommended {{in the future}} by OECD TG 305. The dietary approach yields a biomagnification factor (BMF) rather than a BCF. Being able to estimate a BCF from the data generated in the dietary study {{would be a great}} advantage and would meet an accepted regulatory need. Therefore, the estimation of BCFK values from data generated in the dietary studies is currently under investigation to keep the results of <b>bioconcentration</b> and biomagnification <b>studies</b> comparable [29]. However, this approach seems to be very complicated and might be even impossible due to the clear differences in the biomagnification and bioconcentration processes. In addition, defined regulatory cutoff criteria for the biomagnification potential of chemical compounds are still missing. Under such circumstances, the estimation of BCFs for highly HOCs in flow-through fish tests might remain essential in the future. SPME is a state-of-the-art technology which delivers results comparable to conventional extraction methods. Freely dissolved concentrations of (highly) HOCs can be obtained. Consequently, unsuitable experimental conditions for flow-through fish tests can be identified. Thus, the reliability of test results and the quality of BCF values for (highly) HOCs can be improved.|$|R

The system was tested with hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o-terphenyl (oTP), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBA) (log[*]KOW 5. 5 – 7. 8) in 2 flow-through fish tests with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The analysis of the test media applied during the <b>bioconcentration</b> factor (BCF) <b>studies</b> showed that stable analyte concentrations of the 4 HOCs were maintained in the test system over an uptake period of 8 wk. Bioconcentration factors (L[*]kg− 1 wet wt) were estimated for HCB (BCF 35 [*] 589), oTP (BCF 12 [*] 040), and PCB 153 (BCF 18 [*] 539) based on total water concentrations. No bioconcentration could be determined for DBA, probably because of the rapid metabolism of the test item. The solid-phase desorption dosing system is suitable to provide stable aqueous concentrations of HOCs required to determine the bioconcentration in fish and represents {{a viable alternative to}} the use of solubilizing agents for the preparation of test solutions.

40|$|Present study {{deals with}} the effects of glyphosate-based herbicide, Excel Mera 71 on Anabas testudineus, Heteropnestes fossilis and Oreochromis niloticus in field {{conditions}} (1. 85  kg/ha) based on anti-oxidative, metabolic and digestive responses. For this study following biomarkers viz., acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), amylase, lipase and protease were investigated in gill, stomach, intestine, liver, kidney, brain, muscle and spinal cord of the concerned fish species. Enzyme activities were significantly altered by glyphosate exposure after 30 days, these activities were tissue as well as species specific. The results suggested that these biomarkers could be used to assess the ecological risks of glyphosate on fish. Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) studied in different aquatic natural macrophytes showed order of Alternanthera philoxeroides > Azolla pinnata > Lemna sp. (Minor)  > Lemna sp. (Major)  > Pistia stratiotes, while transfer factor (TF) showed the order of Pistia stratiotes > Alternanthera philoxeroides > Lemna sp. <b>Bioconcentration</b> factor (BCF) <b>study</b> showed maximum accumulation of glyphosate in liver, kidney or intestine, and minimum either in bone or stomach irrespective of fish species. An integrated biomarker response (IBR), which uses a battery of biomarkers to calculate the standardized scores for each biomarker responses ranging from physiological to biochemical/molecular responses, was evaluated by combining the multiple biomarkers into a single value to evaluate quantitatively the toxicological effects of glyphosate. In general, the multiple indices exhibited variations and A.  testudineus was more affected than other fish species; maximum IBR value was observed for LPO and minimum in case of ALT. The order of integrated biomarkers caused by glyphosate treatment was recorded as follows: LPO > Amylase > CAT > AST > Protease > Lipase > ALP > GST > AChE > ALT for A.  testudineus, LPO > AChE > AST > Protease > CAT > Amylase > Lipase > GST > ALP > ALT for H.  fossilis and AChE > CAT > LPO > AST > Amylase > GST > Protease > ALP > Lipase > ALT for O.  niloticus. Finally, IBR analysis is able to distinguish the variations between different parameters and might be a useful tool for the quantification of integrated responses induced by glyphosate toward fish...|$|R
40|$|Per- and polyfluorinated {{substances}} (PFASs) are persistent, bioaccumultative {{and toxic}} substances, with unique physiochemical properties. Widespread application in {{commercial and industrial}} products {{has resulted in a}} global distribution of these substances. Their surface-active and non-flammable properties make them suitable additives in aqueous fire fighting foam (AFFF). AFFF containing PFASs was earlier widely used at Norwegian airports. Although restrictions on the use of PFASs were implemented in 2007, recent studies have reported elevated concentrations of PFASs, and especially PFOS, in freshwater fish collected in the vicinity of airports. In this <b>study,</b> <b>bioconcentration</b> and transcriptional effects of PFASs were investigated in a controlled exposure study. Juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) were exposed to a PFAS mixture simulating airport leachate (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFHxA, PFPeA and 6 : 2 FTS) in two different concentrations, a low and a high. The low mixture had concentrations in a range similar to levels of PFASs found in a lake in the vicinity of Harstad/Narvik airport Evenes. The expression of genes involved in estrogenic responses (VTG), lipid metabolism (PPARα PPARγ and AOX), oxidative stress (MT, GCS, Trx), biotransformation (CYP 1 A) and membrane transportation (ABCb 1) were quantified in liver and gills using real time RT-qPCR. Chemical analysis of water and whole fish was performed using LC/MS-MS. The study was run for a total of 13 weeks, including a depuration period of 10 weeks. PFOS and PFHxS were found to bioconcentrate following exposure to the AFFF-related PFASs. There was significant elimination of PFHxS from fish during the 71 -day depuration period, in contrast to PFOS for which no elimination could be observed. The half-life of PFHxS under the conditions of the study was estimated to 16 days. No bioconcentration could be observed for PFPeA, PFHxA PFOA and 6 : 2 FTS in brown trout. Effects on the expression of some genes were observed in liver, whereas the expression of all genes investigated remained unaltered in gills. AFFF-related PFAS had most pronounced effect on gene expression of VTG. The expression of VTG was dramatically up-regulated in fish exposed to the high concentration mixture of PFASs during exposure. Expression of AOX and PPARγ increased during the exposure period and PPARα was up-regulated after depuration in fish exposed to the low concentration mixture of PFASs. However, up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism did not lead to increased activity of AOX or lipid peroxidation, measured in a parallel study of biochemical responses. A significant change in expression {{from the end of the}} exposure period to the end of depuration was observed for ABCb 1, MT, GCS and Trx in fish exposed to the high concentration mixture of PFASs. Similar alterations in expression of ABCb 1, MT, GCS, Trx, AOX and PPARγ were, however, observed in control fish suggesting exposure conditions could be at least partly involved. Based on our findings, AFFF-related PFASs do not seem to induce lipid metabolism or oxidative stress in brown trout and have minor effects of genes related to biotransformation and membrane transport. However, potential endocrine effects of AFFF-related PFASs on brown trout should be further elucidated, both in the field as well as laboratory exposure...|$|R
