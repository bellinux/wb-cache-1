5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to <b>bruxism</b> (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This <b>bruxism</b> can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E
5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with <b>bruxism,</b> the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests {{that there may be}} a degree of inherited susceptibility to develop sleep <b>bruxism.</b> 21–50% of people with sleep <b>bruxism</b> have a direct family member who had sleep <b>bruxism</b> during childhood, suggesting that there are genetic factors involved, although no genetic markers have yet been identified. Offspring of people who have sleep <b>bruxism</b> are more likely to also have sleep <b>bruxism</b> than children of people who do not have <b>bruxism,</b> or people with awake <b>bruxism</b> rather than sleep <b>bruxism.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} epidemiologic reports of <b>bruxism</b> concluded a prevalence of about 22.1–31% for awake <b>bruxism,</b> 9.7–15.9% for sleep <b>bruxism,</b> and an overall prevalence of about 8–31.4% of <b>bruxism</b> generally. The review also concluded that overall, <b>bruxism</b> affects males and females equally, and affects elderly people less commonly.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of <b>bruxism</b> with temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, or temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome) is debated. Many suggest that sleep <b>bruxism</b> {{can be a}} causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD. Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of <b>bruxism.</b> Others {{suggest that there is}} no strong association between TMD and <b>bruxism.</b> A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported <b>bruxism</b> is used to diagnose <b>bruxism,</b> there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when stricter diagnostic criteria for <b>bruxism</b> are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower. In severe, chronic cases, <b>bruxism</b> can lead to myofascial pain and arthritis of the temporomandibular joints.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of bruxism: one occurs during sleep (sleep <b>bruxism)</b> and one during {{wakefulness}} (awake <b>bruxism).</b> Dental damage may be similar in both types, but the symptoms of sleep <b>bruxism</b> tend to be worse on waking and improve {{during the course of}} the day, and the symptoms of awake <b>bruxism</b> may not be present at all on waking, and then worsen over the day. The causes of <b>bruxism</b> are not completely understood, but probably involve multiple factors. Awake <b>bruxism</b> is thought to have different causes from sleep <b>bruxism,</b> and is more common in females, whereas males and females are affected in equal proportions by sleep <b>bruxism.</b> Several treatments are in use, although there is little evidence of robust efficacy for any particular treatment.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} significant psychosocial risk factors for <b>bruxism,</b> particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} triggering factor. It has been reported that persons with <b>bruxism</b> respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without <b>bruxism.</b> Stress has a stronger relationship to awake <b>bruxism,</b> but the role of stress in sleep <b>bruxism</b> is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep <b>bruxism.</b> However, children with sleep <b>bruxism</b> have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with <b>bruxism</b> {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of <b>bruxism,</b> e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to <b>bruxism.</b> Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify <b>bruxism.</b> Awake <b>bruxism</b> often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between <b>bruxism</b> and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a wide}} {{variation}} in reported epidemiologic data for <b>bruxism,</b> and this {{is largely due to}} differences in the definition, diagnosis and research methodologies of these studies. E.g. several studies use self-reported <b>bruxism</b> as a measure of <b>bruxism,</b> and since many people with <b>bruxism</b> are not aware of their habit, self-reported tooth grinding and clenching habits may be a poor measure of the true prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Botulinum toxin (Botox) {{is used as}} a {{treatment}} for <b>bruxism,</b> however there is only one randomized control trial which has reported that Botox reduces the myofascial pain symptoms. This scientific study was based on thirty people with <b>bruxism</b> who received Botox injections into the muscles of mastication and a control group of people with <b>bruxism</b> who received placebo injections. Normally multiple trials with larger cohorts are required to make any firm statement about the efficacy of {{a treatment}}. In 2013, a further randomized control trial investigating Botox in <b>bruxism</b> started. There is also little information available about the safety and long term followup of this treatment for <b>bruxism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Given {{the strong}} {{association}} between awake <b>bruxism</b> and psychosocial factors (the relationship between sleep <b>bruxism</b> and psychosocial factors being unclear), {{the role of}} psychosocial interventions could be argued to be central to the management. The most simple form of treatment is therefore reassurance that the condition does not represent a serious disease, which may act to alleviate contributing stress. Other interventions include relaxation techniques, stress management, behavioural modification, habit reversal and hypnosis (self hypnosis or with a hypnotherapist). Cognitive behavioral therapy has been recommended by some for treatment of <b>bruxism.</b> In many cases awake <b>bruxism</b> can be reduced by using reminder techniques. Combined with a protocol sheet this can also help to evaluate in which situations <b>bruxism</b> is most prevalent.|$|E
25|$|Occlusal splints (also termed dental guards) are {{commonly}} prescribed, mainly by dentists and dental specialists, {{as a treatment}} for <b>bruxism.</b> Proponents of their use claim many benefits, however when the evidence is critically examined in systematic reviews of the topic, it is reported that there is insufficient evidence to show that occlusal splints are effective for sleep <b>bruxism.</b> Furthermore, occlusal splints are probably ineffective for awake <b>bruxism,</b> since they tend to be worn only during sleep. However, occlusal splints may be of some benefit in reducing the tooth wear that may accompany <b>bruxism,</b> but by mechanically protecting the teeth rather than reducing the bruxing activity itself. In a minority of cases, sleep <b>bruxism</b> may be made worse by an occlusal splint. Some patients will periodically return with splints with holes worn through them, either because the <b>bruxism</b> is aggravated, or unaffected by the presence of the splint. When tooth-to-tooth contact is possible through the holes in a splint, it is offering no protection against tooth wear and needs to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bruxism</b> is {{excessive}} {{teeth grinding}} or jaw clenching. It is an oral parafunctional activity; i.e., it is unrelated to normal function such as eating or talking. <b>Bruxism</b> {{is a common}} behavior; reports of prevalence range from 8–31% in the general population. Several symptoms are commonly associated with <b>bruxism,</b> including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches, tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and fillings) to teeth. But symptoms may be minimal, without patient awareness of the condition.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{examples}} include levodopa (when {{used in the}} long term, as in Parkinson's disease), fluoxetine, metoclopramide, lithium, cocaine, venlafaxine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylphenidate (used in attention deficit hyperactive disorder), and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and similar gamma-aminobutyric acid-inducing analogues such as phenibut. <b>Bruxism</b> can also be exacerbated by excessive consumption of caffeine, as in coffee, tea or chocolate. <b>Bruxism</b> has also been reported to occur commonly comorbid with drug addiction. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) {{has been reported to}} be associated with <b>bruxism,</b> which occurs immediately after taking the drug and for several days afterwards. Tooth wear in people who take ecstasy is also frequently much more severe than in people with <b>bruxism</b> not associated with ecstasy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{publications}} list tooth wear as {{a consequence}} of <b>bruxism,</b> but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and <b>bruxism.</b> Tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition. This is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in <b>bruxism,</b> and affects the occlusal surface (the biting surface) of the teeth. The exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the <b>bruxism</b> occurs, e.g., when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles, this can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth. To grind the front teeth, most people need to posture their mandible forwards, unless there is an existing edge to edge, class III incisal relationship. People with <b>bruxism</b> may also grind their posterior teeth (back teeth), which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Once tooth wear progresses through the enamel layer, the exposed dentin layer is softer and more vulnerable to wear and tooth decay. If enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed, the tooth will effectively be weakened, and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in <b>bruxism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatment for <b>bruxism</b> {{revolves}} around repairing {{the damage to}} teeth that has already occurred, and also often, via {{one or more of}} several available methods, attempting to prevent further damage and manage symptoms, but there is no widely accepted, best treatment. Since <b>bruxism</b> is not life-threatening, and there is little evidence of the efficacy of any treatment, it has been recommended that only conservative treatment which is reversible and that carries low risk of morbidity should be used. The main treatments that have been described in awake and sleep <b>bruxism</b> are described below.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} <b>bruxism</b> is largely unknown, {{but it is}} {{generally}} accepted to have multiple possible causes. <b>Bruxism</b> is a parafunctional activity, but it is debated whether this represents a subconscious habit or is entirely involuntary. The relative importance of the various identified possible causative factors is also debated.|$|E
25|$|The ICSD-R {{states that}} 85–90% {{of the general}} {{population}} grind their teeth to a degree at some point during their life, although only 5% will develop a clinical condition. Some studies have reported that awake <b>bruxism</b> affects females more commonly than males, while in sleep <b>bruxism,</b> males are as equally affected as females.|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs, {{including}} both prescribed and recreational drugs are thought {{by some to}} cause the development of <b>bruxism,</b> however others {{argue that there is}} insufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion. Examples may include dopamine agonists, dopamine antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alcohol, cocaine, and amphetamines (including those taken for medical reasons). In some reported cases where <b>bruxism</b> is thought to have been initiated by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, decreasing the dose resolved the side effect. Other sources state that reports of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors causing <b>bruxism</b> are rare, or only occur with long-term use.|$|E
25|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of <b>bruxism</b> is advantageous, {{due to the}} possible damage that may be incurred and the detrimental effect on quality of life. A {{diagnosis of}} <b>bruxism</b> is usually made clinically, and is mainly based on the person's history (e.g. reports of grinding noises) {{and the presence of}} typical signs and symptoms, including tooth mobility, tooth wear, masseteric hypertrophy, indentations on the tongue, hypersensitive teeth (which may be misdiagnosed as reversible pulpitis), pain in the muscles of mastication, and clicking or locking of the temporomandibular joints. Questionnaires can be used to screen for <b>bruxism</b> in both the clinical and research settings.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{reported}} to brux as commonly as adults. It is possible for sleep <b>bruxism</b> to occur {{as early as the}} first year of life – after the first teeth (deciduous incisors) erupt into the mouth, and the overall prevalence in children is about 14–20%. The ICSD-R states that sleep <b>bruxism</b> may occur in over 50% of normal infants. Often sleep <b>bruxism</b> develops during adolescence, and the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-olds is about 13%. The overall prevalence in adults is reported to be 8%, and people over the age of 60 {{are less likely to be}} affected, with the prevalence dropping to about 3% in this group.|$|E
25|$|Disturbance of the dopaminergic {{system in}} {{the central nervous system}} has also been {{suggested}} {{to be involved in the}} etiology of <b>bruxism.</b> Evidence for this comes from observations of the modifying effect of medications which alter dopamine release on bruxing activity, such as levodopa, amphetamines or nicotine. Nicotine stimulates release of dopamine, which is postulated to explain why <b>bruxism</b> is twice as common in smokers compared to non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep <b>bruxism</b> that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep <b>bruxism</b> is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and audio–video recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of <b>bruxism.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Bruxism</b> {{is usually}} {{detected}} {{because of the}} effects of the process (most commonly tooth wear and pain), rather than the process itself. The large forces that can be generated during <b>bruxism</b> can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system, namely the teeth, the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull (the temporomandibular joints). The muscles of mastication that act to move the jaw can also be affected since they are being utilized over and above of normal function.|$|E
25|$|A mandibular {{advancement}} device (normally {{used for}} treatment of obstructive sleep apnea) may reduce sleep <b>bruxism,</b> although its use {{may be associated with}} discomfort.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} occlusal trauma (as may occur during <b>bruxism)</b> is a causative factor in {{gingivitis}} and periodontitis is not widely accepted. It {{is thought that}} the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal (biting) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest, which may result in increased tooth mobility, however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced. Tooth movement that occurs during occlusal loading is sometimes termed fremitus. It is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease (gum disease), however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments. It is also generally accepted that periodontal disease {{is a far more}} common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of <b>bruxism,</b> although <b>bruxism</b> may much less commonly be involved in both.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>bruxism</b> {{activity}} is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths {{of a second}} (like chewing), and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds (clenching). Some individuals clench without significant lateral movements. <b>Bruxism</b> can also {{be regarded as a}} disorder of repetitive, unconscious contraction of muscles. This typically involves the masseter muscle and the anterior portion of the temporalis (the large outer muscles that clench), and the lateral pterygoids, relatively small bilateral muscles that act together to perform sideways grinding.|$|E
25|$|A {{grinding}} or tapping noise during sleep, sometimes {{detected by}} a partner or a parent. This noise can be surprisingly loud and unpleasant, and can wake a sleeping partner. Noises are rarely associated with awake <b>bruxism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} <b>bruxism</b> will {{experience}} no pain. The presence or degree of pain {{does not necessarily}} correlate with the severity of grinding or clenching. The pain in the muscles of mastication caused by <b>bruxism</b> can be likened to muscle pain after exercise. The pain may be felt over {{the angle of the}} jaw (masseter) or in the temple (temporalis), and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw. Most (but not all) <b>bruxism</b> includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only, which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles. The temporomandibular joints themselves may also become painful, which is usually felt {{just in front of the}} ear, or inside the ear itself. Clicking of the jaw joint may also develop. The forces exerted on the teeth are more than the periodontal ligament is biologically designed to handle, and so inflammation may result. A tooth may become sore to bite on, and further, tooth wear may reduce the insulating width of enamel and dentin that protects the pulp of the tooth and result in hypersensitivity, e.g. to cold stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} can {{be treated}} using clonazepam as a third-line treatment option {{as the use of}} clonazepam is still investigational. <b>Bruxism</b> also responds to clonazepam in the short-term. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder responds well to low doses of clonazepam.|$|E
25|$|The ICSD-R also {{described}} three {{different types of}} sleep <b>bruxism</b> according to the duration the condition is present, namely acute, which lasts for less than one week; subacute, which lasts {{for more than a}} week and less than one month; and chronic which lasts for over a month.|$|E
25|$|Tooth wear may {{be brought}} to the person's {{attention}} during routine dental examination. With awake <b>bruxism,</b> most people will often initially deny clenching and grinding because they are unaware of the habit. Often, the person may re-attend soon after the first visit and report that they have now become aware of such a habit.|$|E
25|$|The ICSD-R {{described}} {{three different}} severities of sleep <b>bruxism,</b> defining mild as occurring less than nightly, with no damage to teeth or psychosocial impairment; moderate as occurring nightly, with mild impairment of psychosocial functioning; and severe as occurring nightly, and with {{damage to the}} teeth, tempormandibular disorders and other physical injuries, and severe psychosocial impairment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bruxism</b> {{can cause}} {{significant}} tooth wear {{if it is}} severe, and sometimes dental restorations (crowns, fillings etc.) are damaged or lost, sometimes repeatedly. Most dentists therefore prefer to keep dental treatment in people with <b>bruxism</b> very simple and only carry it out when essential, since any dental work is likely to fail in the long term. Dental implants and complex bridgework for example are relatively contraindicated in bruxists. In the case of crowns, {{the strength of the}} restoration becomes more important, sometimes at the cost of aesthetic considerations. E.g. a full coverage gold crown, which has a degree of flexibility and also involves less removal (and therefore less weakening) of the underlying natural tooth may be more appropriate than other types of crown which are primarily designed for esthetics rather than durability. Porcelain veneers on the incisors are particularly vulnerable to damage, and sometimes a crown can be perforated by occlusal wear.|$|E
25|$|The Individual (personal) Tooth-Wear Index was {{developed}} to objectively quantify the degree of tooth wear in an individual, without being affected {{by the number of}} missing teeth. <b>Bruxism</b> is not the only cause of tooth wear. Another possible cause of tooth wear is acid erosion, which may occur in people who drink a lot of acidic liquids such as concentrated fruit juice, or in people who frequently vomit or regurgitate stomach acid, which itself can occur for various reasons. People also demonstrate a normal level of tooth wear, associated with normal function. The presence of tooth wear only indicates that it had occurred {{at some point in the}} past, and does not necessarily indicate that the loss of tooth substance is ongoing. People who clench and perform minimal grinding will also not show much tooth wear. Occlusal splints are usually employed as a treatment for <b>bruxism,</b> but they can also be of diagnostic use, e.g. to observe the presence or absence of wear on the splint after a certain period of wearing it at night.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{dentistry}} (<b>bruxism,</b> snoring {{and sleep}} apnea), while not {{recognized as one}} of the nine dental specialties, qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The resulting Diplomate status is recognized by the AASM, and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA). The qualified dentists collaborate with sleep doctors at accredited sleep centers and can provide several types of oral appliances or upper airway surgery to treat or manage sleep-related breathing disorders as well as tooth-grinding and clenching.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} of {{citalopram}} include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include <b>bruxism,</b> vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime {{rather than in the}} morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.|$|E
