5|$|Having <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{by the new}} {{contract}} offered to him by Tamworth, Smith agreed on 25 May 2010 to join fellow Conference Premier team Mansfield Town on a one-year contract. He made his debut in a 3–1 home victory over Forest Green on 14 August 2010, {{the opening day of}} 2010–11, and his first goal came from a close range header as Mansfield beat Eastbourne Borough 4–0 at home on 25 September. He was Mansfield's stand-in captain for a 1–1 away draw with Gateshead on 2 October 2010. However, after Mansfield signed defenders Rhys Day and Simon Grand, Smith became surplus to requirements and was made available on loan.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{opted for}} a 4–4–2 formation, with the only change from their FA Cup winning team four days earlier being the {{inclusion}} of Gary McAllister {{at the expense of}} Vladimír Šmicer. Robbie Fowler who had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> to be a substitute for the FA Cup final was again on the bench. Emile Heskey and Michael Owen were picked to spearhead Liverpool's attack. Alavés opted to play a 5–3–2 formation, with Cosmin Contra, Dan Eggen, Antonio Karmona, Óscar Téllez and Delfí Geli in defence. In attack, Martín Astudillo and Jordi Cruyff were chosen to play behind lone striker Javi Moreno.|$|E
5|$|After scoring two {{consecutive}} ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pathan was elevated to {{opening in the}} second innings of the Second Test in Delhi, after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness. Having taken 3/34 from 22 overs in the first innings, Pathan scored 93 runs, building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436. In the following match in Ahmedabad, he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall {{during the first half}} of the opening day. He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series, which India won 2–0. Pathan later admitted that he had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> in failing to score a Test century. Following his strong performances in 2005, Pathan was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.|$|E

5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the leaders}} of Kentucky's Confederate {{government}} had remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. Bragg had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{with the number of}} soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued. Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort. On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by the Confederate legislative council. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E

25|$|The {{anteater}} {{was chosen}} in 1965 when students {{were allowed to}} submit mascot candidates, which would be voted on in a campus election. Three undergraduates named Pat Glasgow, Bob Ernst, and Schuyler Hadley Basset III were credited with choosing the anteater and designing a cartoon representation, having <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> with other candidates such as a roadrunner, unicorn, seahawk and golden bison.|$|E
25|$|Both Bragg and Smith had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{with the}} number of volunteers from Kentucky. Wagonloads of rifles had been sent to the Commonwealth to equip the {{anticipated}} recruits, but although Confederate sympathies were high, willing volunteers were not, and many of the rifles remained on the wagons. Bragg hoped to rally potential recruits by installing Richard Hawes, governor of Kentucky's Confederate shadow government, in an inauguration ceremony in Frankfort. The elected government fled to Louisville just before the Confederates arrived in Frankfort.|$|E

The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because he was putting people to work through the Works Progress Administration and providing social aid programs.|$|E
25|$|Miguel Gatins and Robert Rivard {{questioned}} whether the Mexican justice system worked.

25|$|With Thomas Bromley, the Solicitor General from 1569, Gerard had {{to settle}} many {{problems}} of jurisdiction. One {{of the most important}} concerned an attempt in 1576 by Worcester and Worcestershire to shake off the authority of the Council of Wales and the Marches - a bid which Gerard and Bromley turned down. Gerard must have <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> that it was Bromley, about a decade younger than himself, who was appointed Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in 1579, although he was rewarded with a knighthood in that year.|$|E

25|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had {{developed}} {{the film as}} far back as 1997. In 1999, Paul Hunter was attached to direct, followed by Tarsem Singh in 2001. Warner Bros. hoped Singh could begin filming in 2002 with Nicolas Cage attached to star in the lead role but Singh ended up dropping out, a move that inspired dueling lawsuits from Tarsem and Warners. Keanu Reeves became attached in 2002. Alan Moore, original creator of John Constantine, had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the previous adaptations of his other comics From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, refused credit for the film and asked that his royalties be distributed among the other creators.|$|E
25|$|Then ITC Entertainment President Sir Lew Grade {{abruptly}} cancelled the series' {{production in}} late 1975, when ratings in the United States had dropped during the later autumn {{months of the}} year. Grade had already <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{by the lack of}} an American network broadcast sale. Gerry Anderson and Fred Freiberger rallied and pitched the idea of a new series with the addition of an alien character to Moonbase Alpha, who would shake up the dynamic of interaction on the Moonbase and regain viewer interest in the United States. On the strength of Anderson and Freiberger's proposal of adding an alien character from the planet Psychon named , Mandell approved a renewal of the series for a second year.|$|E
25|$|After $19 million total {{had been}} spent, the cathedral was reopened in 2010 and rededicated on its 158th anniversary later that year. A {{thousand}} people attended the Mass celebrated by Hubbard {{along with his}} New York counterpart, Timothy Dolan, and Dolan's predecessor, Cardinal Edward Egan. Hubbard called the cathedral's presence among the many state government buildings nearby {{a reminder of the}} presence of God in human affairs and said it was for the whole community, not just Albany's Catholics. He called particular attention to the restored original colors, recalling how he had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the building's gloomy interior on his first visit to it as a boy. Many who attended were impressed with the restoration, particularly the return of the original paint.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, Maria Pavlovna {{visited her}} son Lennart {{and his family}} in Mainau. They bonded over their shared {{interest}} in photography and she got along with his wife, even though the grand duchess had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> when her son renounced his royal status in order to marry a commoner in 1932. Maria Pavlovna, who had little maternal feelings, took no interest in her two grand daughters: Birgitta, then four years old and Marie Louise age two. She asked Lennart to call her by her name as she felt embarrassed {{to have such a}} grown up son. Thanks to Lennart, the King of Sweden, who sympathized with Maria Pavlovna, arranged a Swedish diplomatic passport for her to replace her old Nansen passport. This gave her a broader freedom of movement.|$|E
25|$|Together with Tsaritsa Elizabeth of Russia, Maria Theresa {{formed a}} {{defensive}} agreement {{known as the}} Treaty of Two Empresses in 1746 which aligned Austria and Russia against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. Elizabeth feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion and saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the Commonwealth of Poland–Lithuania. In 1750, Great Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact (despite dynastic links, the British viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French) in return, the British expected Austrian and Russian defense {{in the case of}} a Prussian attack on the Electorate of Hanover, which King George II also ruled in personal union. At the same time, though, Maria Theresa, who had <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> with Britain's performance as her ally in the War of the Austrian Succession, took the controversial step of pursuing warmer relations with Austria's longstanding rival, the Kingdom of France.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Staton commanded the first British air raid on Berlin {{on the night of}} 1/2 October 1939, leading four of No. 10 Squadron's Whitleys to the enemy capital through severe weather to drop propaganda leaflets. On 20 February 1940, Staton was awarded one of the first three Distinguished Service Orders (DSO) granted to the RAF during the war. The DSO is customarily awarded for meritorious or distinguished service in combat. He is known to have flown on numerous raids during this time and <b>been</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the inaccuracy he observed. He attempted to rectify the situation by use of flares for target marking. He also suggested forming a unit dedicated to marking targets; though he would not see it, this suggestion would eventually lead to formation of the Pathfinder Force, later raised as No. 8 Group, Bomber Command. In the same edition of the London Gazette he also received a mention in despatches.|$|E
