2500|$|In two story {{buildings}} using [...] "platform framing" [...] (sometimes called [...] "western" [...] style construction, where {{walls are}} progressively erected upon the lower story's upper diaphragm, unlike [...] "eastern" [...] or <b>balloon</b> <b>framing),</b> the upper walls {{are connected to}} the lower walls with tension elements. In some cases, connections may be extended vertically to include retention of certain roof elements. [...] This sort of strengthening is usually very costly with respect to the strength gained.|$|E
2500|$|In later developments, most {{particularly}} in urban contexts, the log frame was then further {{covered in a}} layer of wooden planks. It is hypothesised {{that it was only}} from the 16th century onwards that wooden houses were painted in the familiar red-ochre or punamulta, containing up to 95% iron oxide, often mixed with tar. The <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> technique for timber construction popularized throughout North America only came to Finland in the 20th century. Finnish master builders had travelled to the USA to see how the industrialisation of the timber-framing technique had developed and wrote about it positively in trade journals on their return. Some experiments were made in using the wooden frame, but initially it was not popular. One reason was the thin construction's poor climatic performance (improved in the 1930s with the addition of insulation): also significant was the relatively low price of both timber and labour in Finland. However, by the outbreak of the First World War, the industrialsed timber construction system had become more widespread. Also a comparatively recent [...] "import" [...] to Finland is the use of wooden shingles for roofs, dating only from the early 19th century. Previous to that, the traditional system had been a so-called birch-bark roof (in Finnish, malkakatto), comprising a wooden slat base, overlaid with several layers of birch-bark and finished off with a layer of long timber poles by weighed down in places by the occasional boulder. Traditionally, the whole structure was unpainted. The coating of shingles with tar was the modern appropriation of a material first produced in the Nordic countries during the Iron Age, a major export product, especially in sealing wooden boats.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{not certain}} who {{introduced}} <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> in the United States. However, the first building using <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> was possibly a warehouse constructed in 1832 in Chicago, Illinois, by George Washington Snow. Architectural critic Sigfried Giedion cited Chicago architect J. M. Van Osdel's 1880s attribution, as well as A. T. Andreas' 1885 History of Chicago, to credit Snow as 'inventor of the balloon frame method'. In 1833, Augustine Taylor (1796-1891) constructed St. Mary's Catholic Church in Chicago using the <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> method. In the 1830s, Hoosier Solon Robinson published articles about a revolutionary new framing system, called [...] "balloon framing" [...] by later builders. Robinson's system called for standard 2x4 lumber, nailed {{together to form a}} sturdy, light skeleton. Builders were reluctant to adopt the new technology, however, by the 1880s, some form of 2x4 framing was standard.Alternatively, a precursor to the balloon frame may have been used by the French in Missouri as much as thirty-one years earlier.|$|E

50|$|Historically mankind fitted {{naturally}} shaped {{wooden poles}} together as framework {{and then began}} using joints to connect the timbers, a method today called traditional timber framing or log framing. Timber framing was superseded by <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> beginning in the 1830s in America which {{is made up of}} many lightweight wall members called studs rather than using fewer, heavier supports called posts, and was nailed together rather than using joinery. The studs in a balloon frame extend two stories from sill to plate. Platform framing superseded <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> and is the standard wooden framing method today. The name comes from each floor level being framed as a separate unit or platform.|$|E

50|$|The barn is an {{excellent}} example and the last known example of the work of C. V. Kindig and Sons, the leading round barn builders in northwestern Indiana in the early twentieth century. One of the significant construction improvements that typifies round barns is the use of <b>balloon</b> <b>framing.</b> Without the numerous structural supports found in barns that did not use <b>balloon</b> <b>framing,</b> (typically early polygonal barns), interiors like that of the Leedy Barn could more efficiently accommodate the needs of the farmer. The belief that increased efficiency would improve a farm's profitability was an underlying principle behind the introduction of the centralized barn form.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Balloon</b> <b>framing</b> is {{a method}} of wood {{construction}} also known as [...] "Chicago construction" [...] in the 19th century used primarily in areas rich in softwood forests: Scandinavia, Canada, the United States up until the mid-1950s, and around Thetford Forest in Norfolk, England. It uses long continuous framing members (studs) that run from the sill plate to the top plate, with intermediate floor structures let into and nailed to them. [...] Here the heights of window sills, headers and next floor height would be marked out on the studs with a story pole. Once popular when long lumber was plentiful, <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> has been largely replaced by platform framing.|$|E
50|$|Studs {{are usually}} slender so more studs are needed than in post and beam framing. Sometimes studs are long, as in <b>balloon</b> <b>framing</b> where the studs extend two stories and carry a ledger which carries joists. <b>Balloon</b> <b>framing</b> {{has been made}} illegal in new {{construction}} in many jurisdictions for fire safety reasons because the open wall cavities allow fire to quickly spread such as from a basement to an attic; the plates and platforms in platform framing providing an automatic fire stop inside the walls, and so are deemed much safer by fire safety officials. Being thinner and lighter, stick construction techniques are easier to cut and carry and is speedier than the timber framing.|$|E
