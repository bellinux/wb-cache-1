2500|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: [...] or adult F. gigantica: 25–75×12mm, fasciolosis is a big concern. The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans. Treatment with triclabendazole has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as <b>bithionol</b> are moderately effective but also cause more side effects.

50|$|This {{inhibition}} of the sAC enzyme by <b>bithionol</b> at the bicarbonate binding site is demonstrated through a mixed-inhibition graph, where higher concentrations of <b>bithionol</b> {{have a lower}} Vmax and a larger Km. This translates to a decreased rate of reaction and a decreased affinity between substrates when <b>bithionol</b> is in higher concentrations.|$|E

50|$|The drug {{of choice}} to treat paragonimiasis is praziquantel, {{although}} <b>bithionol</b> may also be used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bithionol</b> is an {{anthelmintic}} used {{to treat}} Anoplocephala perfoliata (tapeworms) in horses and Fasciola hepatica (liver flukes).|$|E
50|$|These intermolecular {{interactions}} {{are capable of}} binding <b>bithionol</b> to the bicarbonate binding site of soluble adenylyl cyclase efficiently enough to cause a sort of competitive inhibition with the usual bicarbonate substrate. The side chain of Arginine 176 within the bicarbonate binding site of the sAC protein interacts significantly with the aromatic ring of the <b>bithionol</b> molecule. This allosteric, conformational change interferes with {{the ability of the}} active site of sAC to adequately bind ATP to convert it into cAMP. The Arginine 176 usually interacts with the ATP and other catalytic ions at the active site, so when it turns from its normal position to interact with the <b>bithionol</b> inhibitor, it no longer functions in keeping the ATP bound to the active site.|$|E
50|$|Based on its {{relationship}} to the organochlorine, hexachlorophene, which {{has been shown to be}} a successful, but isomer-specific inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase, <b>bithionol</b> was chosen to study potential inhibitors of the sAC enzyme. These two organochlorine compounds have similar chemical structures. <b>Bithionol</b> has two aromatic rings with a sulfur atom bonded between them and multiple chlorine ions and hydroxyl groups coming off of the phenyl groups. These functional groups are capable of hydrophobic, ionic, and polar interactions.|$|E
50|$|Praziquantel {{treatment}} is ineffective.There are case reports of nitazoxanide being successfully used in human fasciolosis treatment in Mexico. There are also reports of <b>bithionol</b> being used successfully.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{in order}} for <b>bithionol</b> to {{potently}} inhibit the soluble adenylyl cyclase enzyme, it requires concentrations that are cytotoxic in vivo. Thus, it cannot {{be used as the}} therapeutic drug needed to inhibit soluble adenylyl cyclase and therefore decrease the accumulation of cAMP within the cell. However, it does shed some light on the search for a compound that will eventually be able to target the bicarbonate binding site of the soluble adenylyl cyclase enzyme. <b>Bithionol</b> is the first known sAC inhibitor to act through the bicarbonate binding site via a mostly allosteric mechanism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bithionol</b> has {{antibacterial}} and anthelmintic properties {{along with}} algaecide activity. It was formerly used in soaps and cosmetics until the FDA banned it for its photosensitizing effects. The compound {{has been known}} to cause photocontact sensitization.|$|E
50|$|The proper {{diagnosis}} of acanthocephaliasis in humans is made through fecal analysis, which if the host is infected should contain adult worms or eggs. To obtain the worms from the host, piperazine citrate, levamisole and <b>bithionol</b> can be {{administered to the}} patient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bithionol</b> {{has been}} shown to be a potent {{inhibitor}} of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), an intracellular enzyme important in the catalysis of ATP to cAMP. Soluble adenylyl cyclase is uniquely activated by bicarbonate. The cAMP formed by this enzyme is associated with capacitation of sperm, eye pressure regulation, acid-base regulation, and astrocyte/neuron communication.|$|E
50|$|In {{another form}} of inhibition, <b>bithionol</b> is a much larger {{molecule}} than simple sodium bicarbonate, so it {{is large enough to}} reach through a small channel in the sAC compound and physically interfere with the ability of ATP to fit into and thus bind to the active site to be converted to cAMP.|$|E
5000|$|Praziquantel {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{individuals}} infected with P. skrjabini parasites. [...] Prazinquatal acts quickly to cure paragonimiasis, showing results after even one day, unlike the previously used drug <b>bithionol,</b> which required extended treatment and involved more severe side effects. [...] The latest drug being investigated to treat paragonimiasis is triclabendazole.|$|E
50|$|Praziquantel {{has been}} used to {{effectively}} treat paragonimiasis by separating the tegument. An effectively complete rate of cure may be expected after three days of treatment if there has not been too much permanent damage, such as from intracranial effects. Other medications can also be used such as <b>bithionol,</b> niclofan, and triclabendazole with high cure rates.|$|E
50|$|According to the CDC, {{praziquantel}} is {{the drug}} of choice to treat paragonimiasis. The recommended dosage of 75 mg/kg per day, divided into 3 doses over 3 days has proven to eliminate P. westermani. <b>Bithionol</b> is an alternative drug for treatment of this disease but is associated with skin rashes and urticaria. For additional information, see the recommendations in The Medical Letter (Drugs for Parasitic Infections).|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} drug {{option is}} Tetrachloroethylene, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, but its use has been superseded by new antihelminthic drugs (like Praziquantel). A 1978 study {{also looked at}} the efficacy of several drugs on metagonimiasis infection, including <b>bithionol,</b> niclosamide, nicoflan, and Praziquantel. All drugs showed lower prevalence of eggs in feces, however only Praziquantel showed complete radical cure. Therefore, the authors concluded Praziquantel was the most highly effective, was very well tolerated, and was the most promising drug against metagonimiasis.|$|E
5000|$|Laboratory {{testing on}} mice treated {{once or twice}} daily with {{albendazole}} were shown {{to have a significant}} reduction in worm count when compared to the untreated mice group. The effective dosage at which albendazole has been shown effective is 90 mg/kg twice a day for 21 straight days. On the other hand, there are other antihelminthic drugs available such as <b>bithionol,</b> thiabendazole, metronidazole, and others, that did not reveal any significant therapeutic effects in experimentally G. spinigerum infected ...|$|E
50|$|In {{pharmaceutical}} technology acidic pharmaceutical substances {{are often}} converted into sodium salts, {{because they are}} more stable, more soluble or membrane-permeable than the drug itself. Example of such sodium salts are (selection): Bispyribac, <b>bithionol,</b> bosentan, brequinar, bromfenac, Cefmenoxime, ceftiofur, citicoline, diclofenac , Floxacillin, fosinopril, naproxen, Netobimin, ozagrel, pantoprazole, pemetrexed, sitamaquin, sitaxentan, sulfamiderazin, sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfathiazole, sulfazecin, thiamylal and mesna. The disodium salt of cromolyn is also used as drug. Most of these salts are sodium salts of organic carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{detected}} mainly on identification of eggs by microscopic demonstration in faeces or in duodenal aspirate. But other sophisticated {{methods have been}} developed such as ELISA, which {{has become the most}} important clinical technique. Diagnosis by detecting DNAs from eggs in faeces are also developed using PCR, real-time PCR, and LAMP, which are highly sensitive and specific. Imaging diagnosis has been studied in depth and is now widely used. Drugs used to treat infestation include triclabendazole, praziquantel, <b>bithionol,</b> albendazole, levamisole and mebendazole. However, benzimidazoles are very weak as vermicide. As with other trematodes, praziquantel is the drug of choice. Lately, tribendimidine has been acknowledged as an effective and safe drug.|$|E
5000|$|Praziquantel, 20 mg/kg body weight, {{three times}} a day. Praziquantel causes immobilized {{contraction}} of the worm, such that {{it can no longer}} grasp the intestinal walls, and can be eliminated from the bodyThree 2-g doses of niclosamide or two 50 mg/kg doses of <b>bithionol</b> have also proven to be effective when Praziquantel was either not available or treatment was refused. [...] However, a single 2-g dose of niclosamine proved to be ineffective treatment therapy, as did 100 mg orally of mebendazole twice a day for three days.If diarrhea recurs, general supplements must also be provided in order to maintain electrolyte balance and meet nutritional requirements.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: 20 - 30 xx 13 mm or adult F. gigantica: 25-75×12 mm, fasciolosis is a big concern. The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans.

Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as <b>bithionol</b> are moderately effective but also cause more side effects.

50|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment is transferring the affected fish to a freshwater bath {{for a period of}} 2 to 3 hours. This is achieved by towing the sea cages into fresh water, or pumping the fish from the sea cage to a tarp filled with fresh water. Mortality rates have been lowered by adding Levamisole to the water until the saturation is above 10ppm. Due to the difficulty and expense of treatment, the productivity of salmon aquaculture is limited by access to a source of fresh water. Chloramine and chlorine dioxide have also been used. Other potential in-feed treatments such as immunosupportive-based feeds, mucolytic compounds such as L-cysteine ethyl ester and the parasticide <b>bithionol</b> have been tested with some success although not developed for commercial use.|$|E
50|$|Fasciolosis is an {{important}} cause of both production and economic losses in the dairy and meat industry. Over the years, the prevalence has increased {{and it is likely}} to continue increasing in the future. Livestock are often treated with Flukicides, which are chemicals toxic to flukes. The two chemicals used are triclabendazole and <b>bithionol.</b> Ivermectin, which is widely used for many helminthic parasites, has low effectivity against F. hepatica, as does praziquantel. For humans, the type of control depends on the setting. One important method is through the strict control over the growth and sales of edible water plants such as watercress. This is particularly important in highly endemic areas. Some farms are irrigated with polluted water, hence, vegetables farmed from such land should be thoroughly washed and cooked before being eaten.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the toxicity of <b>bithionol</b> to Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in fresh- and seawater and the efficacy of <b>bithionol</b> as a 1 h seawater bath treatment for amoebic gill disease (AGD). To examine toxicity, fish were bathed for 1, 3 and 6 h in <b>bithionol,</b> an anti-protozoal at 0, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 35 mgL(- 1) with toxicity determined by time to morbidity. Efficacy was examined by bathing AGD-affected Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout for 1 h at <b>bithionol</b> concentrations of 1 - 25 mgL(- 1). Efficacy was determined by examining gill amoeba counts and identifying percent lesioned gill filaments at 1 and 24 h after bath exposure to <b>bithionol.</b> For both species, <b>bithionol</b> {{was determined to be}} toxic at 25 and 35 mgL(- 1) exhibiting median lethal times (LT 50 s) ranging from 21 to 84 min. Morbidity occurred in the 5 and 10 mgL(- 1) treatments, however, due to sampling regime there were not enough fish available to calculate LT 50 s. Only <b>bithionol</b> at 1 mgL(- 1) was considered non-toxic with no signs of morbidity. <b>Bithionol</b> was more toxic in seawater than freshwater and had no acute effects on gill Na+/K+ ATPase and succinic dehydrogenase, or plasma osmolality and chloride concentration. <b>Bithionol</b> at 1 mgL(- 1) reduced percent lesioned gill filaments in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout by 33 and 27 per cent, respectively, compared to the seawater control. Similarly, numbers of amoeba were reduced by 33 and 43 per cent for Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, respectively, when compared to the seawater control. Furthermore, <b>bithionol</b> reduced percent lesioned gill filaments as much as did the current industry standard of freshwater. This study demonstrated that a 1 h seawater bath containing 1 mgL(- 1) <b>bithionol</b> could be an improvement to the current method of treatment for AGD-affected Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the efficacy of <b>bithionol</b> as an oral treatment for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar affected by amoebic gill disease (AGD). The current commercial management strategy of AGD is a costly 3 h freshwater bath. It is labour intensive {{and the number of}} baths needed appears to be increasing; hence, there is an effort to identify alternative treatments. Efficacy was examined by feeding AGD-affected Atlantic salmon twice daily to satiation with <b>bithionol,</b> an antiprotozoal, at 25 mg kg− 1 feed. Three seawater (35 ‰, 17 °C) re-circulation systems were used each consisting of three tanks containing 32 Atlantic salmon smolts with an average (±SEM) mass of 90. 4 g (± 5. 2). Three feeds were examined in the trial including <b>bithionol,</b> plain commercial control and oil coated commercial control. Feeding commenced 2 weeks prior to exposure to Neoparamoeba spp. at 300 cells L− 1 and continued for 28 days post-exposure. Efficacy was determined by examining gross gill score and identifying percent lesioned gill filaments twice weekly for 4 weeks post-exposure. <b>Bithionol</b> when fed as a two-week prophylactic treatment at 25 mg kg− 1 feed delayed the onset of AGD pathology and reduced the percent lesioned gill filaments by 53...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bithionol,</b> dichlorophene, and hexachlorophene, {{which are}} used in {{treating}} some helminthic infections, killed trophozoites of Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis in modified BI-S- 33 and Asami media, respectively. Virtually all G. lamblia and T. vaginalis cells were killed within 24 h with a 0. 42 mM concentration of these compounds, except that 0. 93 mM dichlorophene was required for sterilizing T. vaginalis in the same period. In modified BI-S- 33 and Asami media from which bovine and human sera were omitted, respectively, the inhibitory actions of the compounds against in vitro growth of these protozoa were significantly enhanced. Trophozoites of G. lamblia and T. vaginalis could be killed in shorter than 10 min with 0. 074 mM dichlorophene and 0. 0025 mM hexachlorophene, respectively, in serum-free media. G. lamblia, which was incubated in the complete medium containing dichlorophene, showed a characteristic swelling of the ventral side which led to disruption of the parasite, whereas <b>bithionol</b> caused a thin crack in the cytoplasm of T. vaginalis incubated in Asami medium. The crack appeared to enlarge and result in vacuolization of T. vaginalis. These observations suggest that <b>bithionol,</b> dichlorophene, and hexachlorophene merit further evaluation to ascertain whether they are useful for treatment of giardiasis and trichomoniasis...|$|E
40|$|Allergic photocontact {{sensitization}} {{could be}} induced in guinea pigs with 3, 3 ', 4 ', 5 -tetra-chlorosalicylanilide (TCSA), 3, 4 ', 5 -tribromosalicylanilide (TBS), and <b>bithionol</b> using pretreatment with {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (SLS) and long-wave ultraviolet (UVA) radiation. Mid-wave ultraviolet below 320 nm (UVB) was not necessary for the induction of sensitization. Combined use of SLS pretreatment with UVA radiation resulted in more effective sensitization than combined UVB and UVA radiation. Higher sensitization rates to TCSA and TBS were achieved by allowing rest periods between each of 5 2 -hr exposures to UVA than by daily 1 -hr exposures for 10 consecutive days.

40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is a {{pathogenic}} fungus that {{is responsible}} for up to half a million cases of meningitis globally, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Common fungistatic drugs, such as fluconazole, are less toxic for patients but have low efficacy for initial therapy of the disease. Effective therapy against the disease is provided by the fungicidal drug amphotericin B; however, due to its high toxicity and the difficulty in administering its intravenous formulation, it is imperative to find new therapies targeting the fungus. The antiparasitic drug <b>bithionol</b> has been recently identified as having potent fungicidal activity. In this study, we used a combined gene dosing and drug affinity responsive target stability (GD-DARTS) screen as well as protein modeling to identify a common drug binding site of <b>bithionol</b> within multiple NAD-dependent dehydrogenase drug targets. This combination genetic and proteomic method thus provides a powerful method for identifying novel fungicidal drug targets for further development...|$|E

40|$|Large-conductance-Ca 2 +-activated {{potassium}} Slo 1 {{channels are}} well characterised {{members of the}} Slo channel family. The other members, Slo 3 and Slo 2. χ, are less characterised and their physiological roles are elusive. Little is known of the pH-sensitive Slo 3 channel, aside from a role regulating Ca 2 + influx through CatSper channels during capacitation in spermatozoa. This thesis aims to investigate mSlo 3 pharmacology and determine if mSlo 3 - EST’s encode novel isoforms. Na+-activated Slo 2. χ channels (Slo 2. 1 /Slo 2. 2) are thought to mediate adaptation of neuronal action potential firing rate and slow after hyperpolarisations following repetitive firing. We aim to characterise hSlo 2. 2 a currents and their <b>bithionol</b> sensitivity, an activator of a rat isoform. Mutation of the conserved phenylalanine in the S 6 -domain (mSlo 3 -F 304 /hSlo 1 -F 380) to tyrosine has similar effects on Slo channels, namely a negative shift in the voltagedependence of activation {{and an increase in}} membrane conductance. mSlo 3 pharmacology matches the IKSper profile and suggests roles for mSlo 3 as a pharmacological target in infertility treatment. This work identified a novel splice-variant of mSlo 3; CV 562866 lacks transmembrane domains and is more widely expressed than mSlo 3. CV 562866 protein is expressed in vivo, and contains the nominal RCK 2 domain. CV 562866 affects functional expression of mSlo 3 and mSlo 1 channels in Xenopus oocytes, decreasing and increasing expression respectively. This study examined the hSlo 2. 2 a channel characteristics, which unlike the previously reported rSlo 2. 2 a channel, mediates a non-rectifying K+ current. <b>Bithionol</b> activates hSlo 2. 2 a channels with an EC 50 of 1. 29 ± 0. 12 μM and activation was Na+ co-operative. We found a candidate <b>bithionol</b> binding site in the C-terminal domain near the “Cl- bowl”. Due to toxicity of hSlo 2. 1 expression; determination of the <b>bithionol</b> selectivity of Slo 2. χ channels was unattainable. In vivo, Slo 2. χ channels act as a background K+ conductance, activated by a variety of conditions, stabilising the resting membrane potential of the cell. This study suggests Slo 2. χ are viable pharmacological targets for treatment of inflammatory pain. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|New polyomaviruses are {{continually}} being identified, {{and it is}} likely that links between this virus family and disease will continue to emerge. Unfortunately, a specific treatment for polyomavirus-associated disease is lacking. Because polyomaviruses express large Tumor Antigen, TAg, we hypothesized that small molecule inhibitors of the essential ATPase activity of TAg would inhibit viral replication. Using a new screening platform, we identified inhibitors of TAg's ATPase activity. Lead compounds were moved into a secondary assay, and ultimately two FDA approved compounds, <b>bithionol</b> and hexachlorophene, were identified as the most potent TAg inhibitors known to date. Both compounds inhibited Simian Virus 40 replication as assessed by plaque assay and quantitative PCR. Moreover, these compounds inhibited BK virus, which causes BKV Associated Nephropathy. In neither case was host cell viability compromised at these concentrations. Our data indicate that directed screening for TAg inhibitors is a viable method to identify polyomavirus inhibitors, and that <b>bithionol</b> and hexachlorophene represent lead compounds that may be further modified and/or ultimately used to combat diseases associated with polyomavirus infection. © 2012 Elsevier B.
