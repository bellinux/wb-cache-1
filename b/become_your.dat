500|$|After the enthronement proper, {{the act of}} homage takes place: the archbishops {{and bishops}} swear their fealty, saying [...] "I, N., Archbishop [...] of N., will be {{faithful}} and true, and faith and truth will bear unto you, our Sovereign Lord , King [...] of this Realm and Defender of the Faith, and unto your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God." [...] The peers then proceed to pay their homage, saying [...] "I, N., Duke [...] of N., do <b>become</b> <b>your</b> liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship; and faith and truth will I bear unto you, to live and die, against all manner of folks. So help me God." [...] The clergy pay homage together, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Next, {{members of the royal}} family pay homage individually. The peers are led by the premier peers of their rank: the dukes by the premier duke, the marquesses by the premier marquess, and so forth.|$|E
500|$|Some {{time has}} passed (at least two generations). In a remote wooded valley where the Rhine flows, the ageless Rhinemaidens {{continue}} to mourn for the gold, pleading with the [...] "Sun-woman" [...] to send them a champion who will return the gold to them. Siegfried's horn is heard, and he soon appears, having lost his way while hunting. The maidens greet him with their old playfulness and offer to help him, {{for the price of}} the ring on his finger. After a flirtatious exchange, Siegfried offers, apparently sincerely, to give them the ring. But instead of wisely simply accepting his offer, the mood of the naive, formerly flirtatious [...] Rhinemaidens suddenly becomes solemn: they warn Siegfried he will be killed that very day unless he delivers the ring to them. But brave Siegfried will never submit to any such implied threat and declares: [...] "By threatening my life and limb, even if it weren't worth as much as a finger, you won't get the ring from me!" [...] The maidens are scornful of his folly: [...] "Farewell, Siegfried. A proud woman will today <b>become</b> <b>your</b> heir, scoundrel! She'll give us a better hearing". Siegfried is not aware that it is to Brünnhilde that they refer. They swim off, leaving a puzzled Siegfried to ponder their words and to admit to himself that he could happily have seduced any one of them.|$|E

2500|$|Later in the interview, Harrison voiced {{her opinion}} on the major {{difference}} between major record labels and independent labels, saying, [...] "Major labels {{have a system that}} you have to go through.

2500|$|Emma Watson, Rooney Mara, Shailene Woodley and Mia Wasikowska {{were all}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Joy. Brie Larson was cast after an associate of Abrahamson suggested that he see her in Short Term 12. Larson consulted with a trauma expert and a nutritionist for the role, went on [...] "a restrictive diet" [...] and avoided sunlight. She said she saw the film less as a crime story and more of [...] "a story of love and freedom and perseverance and {{what it feels like to}} grow up and <b>become</b> <b>your</b> own person." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lynne later {{spoke of}} the {{recording}} sessions: [...] "Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'...

[...] Orbison was given one solo track, [...] "Not Alone Anymore", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. Rolling Stone included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{circumvent}} the indoctrination of students, this method of education uses Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language, 1828 {{as a part of}} its curriculum and maintains that [...] "It will equip you for Christian leadership, strengthen your vocabulary, give you an edge in communicating your view and <b>become</b> <b>your</b> foundation for thinking and reasoning Biblically. This tool can be the turning point for you to be more effective in communicating Christian principles used in government, economics, and marketing or for your student to clearly understand how the Bible has influenced every area of life".

2500|$|The {{deceleration}} of war {{included the}} Sancak-i Serif. Sancak-i Serif {{is used as}} a gathering point for the military units. The banner was occasionally carried into battles to encourage troops and ensure victory. The banner would be taken out of its box by the Sultan and affixed to a staff. He would carry it from the Chamber of the Holy Relics to the Throne Room while officials called out “God is great”. After this, the banner was carried from the Throne Room to the Gate of Felicity and placed there. The grand vizier would receive the banner from the sultan in a ceremony in the Throne Room. While the grand vizier and the şeyhülislâm stood in attendance, the sultan would kiss the Holy Banner and entrust it to his grand vizier with the words: “I entrust the Sacred Standard to you and you to God. May He be your helper (a better translation: “May He <b>become</b> <b>your</b> Defender and Supporter”)!” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 21 BC, having now {{reached the}} age of 18, Julia married Agrippa, a man from a modest family who had risen to become Augustus' most trusted general and friend. This step {{is said to have been}} taken partly on the advice of Maecenas, who in {{counseling}} him remarked: [...] "You have made him so great that he must either <b>become</b> <b>your</b> son-in-law or be slain." [...] Since Agrippa was nearly 25 years her elder, it was a typical arranged marriage, with Julia functioning as a pawn in her father's dynastic plans. There is from this period the report of an infidelity with one Sempronius Gracchus, with whom Julia allegedly had a lasting liaison (Tacitus describes him as [...] "a persistent paramour"). This was the first of a series of alleged adulteries. According to Suetonius, Julia's marital status did not prevent her from conceiving a passion for Augustus' stepson, and thus her stepbrother, Tiberius, so it was widely rumoured.|$|E
5000|$|Well, if {{you think}} about it as a storyteller the {{potential}} for interesting drama is much more interesting if Malcolm is the biological father and not Neil.
