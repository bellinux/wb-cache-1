5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E

Xwechtáal passed out, and when he awoke, he was on top of a mountain and the water was everywhere. He waited until the water receded, then climbed down the mountain. Following the mountain to the lake, he found the old corpse of the serpent, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> bones. Xwechtáal then took one of the vertebrae of the serpent and acquired magical supernatural powers with it.|$|E

Delayed by the Winter War with Finland, Soviet Union began heightening tensions in late spring 1940 just as Nazi Germany was winning the Battle of France. Though the Lithuanian government and army had several months to plan for a contingency, the reaction was sluggish and no decisive steps were taken. The military developed a defensive plan against Russia (known as Plan R), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a slightly modified Plan L for defense against Poland.|$|E
25|$|Ian sparks a {{friendly}} rivalry with Denise Fox (Diane Parish) {{as the two}} engage in a fruit-selling war, though he irritates her. Denise's sister Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) attempts to set them up on a date but this upsets Denise who kisses Kim's boyfriend Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn). Kim discovers this and disowns her sister, so Ian allows Denise to stay with him, igniting a friendship between them. It eventually leads to a relationship when he confides in her about {{his life on the}} streets. Ian decides to open a restaurant, though Lucy is worried it will fail because of his mental illness. He runs out of money for construction but then finds a box of cash that used to belong to Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). He also gets Janine to invest in the restaurant, and eventually tricks Lucy into signing over all of the businesses to him. Peter (now played by Ben Hardy) returns to live with the family, and is soon followed by Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene), the daughter of Ian's dead ex-wife of the same name. Ian lets Cindy stay, and Denise also moves in with the family. However Carl White (Daniel Coonan), an associate of Derek, arrives in Walford and soon works out that Ian has spent Derek's money. Carl claims the money was his, and so extorts large sums of cash from Ian as payback. Carl is violent, and burns Ian's hand when he tries to refuse to pay him before promising that the debt will be paid if Ian lies in court, and says that he saw Max tampering with the brakes of Carl's car. Ian reluctantly agrees, but {{on the day of the}} court case he is kidnapped by Phil, and Max is found not guilty. It is then revealed that Max was in on the kidnapping, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> to lure Carl into a trap. Ian then has to face the consequences of his actions, and Denise is angry when she finds out the truth.|$|E

Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste wrote that [...] "there wasn’t a ton of action this week, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> enough to keep Michael’s personal growth on our radar as we continue to brace ourselves for his grand finale." ...|$|E

We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E

[...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal.

I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage or anything like that, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> bizarre. It {{was one of those}} things that I got really nervous about."

500|$|However, as time passed, Saavedra and Moreno {{distanced from}} each other. There was some initial {{distrust}} in the Junta towards Saavedra, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{the result of}} his desire for honours and privileges rather than an actual power struggle. When the initial difficulties were solved, Saavedra promoted an indulgent policy, while Moreno insisted on taking radical measures. For instance, the Junta discovered on October 16 that some members of the Cabildo secretly swore loyalty to the Regency Council. Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent, and Saavedra replied that the government should promote leniency, and rejected the use of the Regiment of Patricians to carry out such executions. Saavedra prevailed, and the plotting members of the Cabildo were exiled instead of executed. Overall, Moreno was supported by [...] "The Star" [...] regiment, {{the other members of the}} Junta, and the activists of the May Revolution; Saavedra was supported by the merchants, the loyals to the old regime that saw him as a lesser evil, and the Regiment of Patricians, which was the largest one.|$|E

Although it is billed as a [...] "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" [...] (Leto's [...] longtime pseudonym), [...] "City of Angels" [...] is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> such a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate to put my name on that piece." [...] Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from Kanye West, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, Juliette Lewis, Heather Levinger, Haywood, Lindsay Lohan, Olivia Wilde, Steve Nash, Ashley Olsen, Lily Collins, James Franco, Selena Gomez, Alan Cumming, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, Shaun White, Corey Feldman, and Yosh.

500|$|The Postman Always Rings Twice {{became a}} major box office success, which {{prompted}} the studio to take more risks on Turner, casting her outside of the glamorous sex symbol roles {{she had come to}} be known for. In August 1946, it was announced Turner was set to replace Katharine Hepburn in the big-budgeted historical drama Green Dolphin Street (1947), a role for which she darkened her hair and lost 15 pounds. It was Carey Wilson who insisted on casting Turner based on her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice. Turner later recalled she was surprised about replacing Hepburn, saying: [...] "I'm about the most un-Hepburnish actress on the lot. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what I wanted to do." [...] It was her first starring role that did not center on her looks. In an interview, Turner said: [...] "I even go running around in the jungles of New Zealand in a dress that's filthy and ragged. I don't wear any make-up and my hair's a mess." [...] Nevertheless, she insisted she would not give up her glamorous image.|$|E

Barrichello said [...] "It is the most dangerous thing that I have been through", and [...] "There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it." [...] Schumacher said that [...] "Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through." [...] Ross Brawn said [...] "at {{the end of the}} day he gave him enough space. You can argue that it was marginal, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> tough – tough racing." [...] A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 Nürburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that [...] "would have shown a better example to our young drivers". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Schumacher accepted the decision, and apologised.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the McNair and {{the band}} parted ways, with neither party giving a {{definitive}} rationale. Hopper explained [...] "We {{had a hard time}} recording Hot Boxing, because our drummer had {{a lot of things in}} the way...

[...] She has alternately explained that the split was due to the [...] "alternative lifestyles" [...] of McNair and the rest of the group and that McNair's musicianship was not as competent as the other members. The remaining trio recruited session drummer Josh Freese and engineers Sandy Solomon and Bernie Zwass to record a cover of Tom Waits' [...] "Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis" [...] at Plus Four Recordings Studios, in Sherman Oaks, California in June 1995 for the compilation album [...] Freese joined the group in November–December of that year in Los Angeles, California to record Rubbing Doesn't Help. Mould was unavailable, so the band relocated to Los Angeles and worked with producer Geza X at his home studio in attempt to make a more [...] "eclectic" [...] album that would represent the diversity of their songwriting. After hearing some demos, the band decided to hire him to produce the actual album and moved to Los Angeles for recording. The album produced the singles [...] "Open the Door" [...] and [...] "This Family" [...] (the former also had a music video), as well as the EP Fire All Your Guns at Once.
