Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E

As a result, Captain Peter Barron of the brigade's anti-tank battery was given command of 10 Para. One of the official war photographers inside the perimeter wrote:"This is the fourth day of fighting and camera work is almost out of the question. All day we have been under shell, mortar and machine gun fire. We are completely surrounded and our perimeter is becoming smaller every hour, now it is a matter of fighting for our lives. If our land forces don't make contact with us soon then we've had it".|$|E

He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own.

A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

Sharon decides {{to go to the}} police and finds Grant outside the police station as a result of being drunk and disorderly. Grant goes to The Queen Vic where he flirts with Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris). Grant tells Courtney that Phil killed Peggy. When Courtney tells Grant that Sharon wanted to meet him, he goes to see Sharon and declares his love to her, but she is not interested. Grant accuses Phil of killing Peggy and asks for his money back, but Phil does not have it. Grant tries to persuade Sharon to go to Portugal with him but she declares her love for Phil. Grant telephones Courtney to ask to stay with her but she refuses. Grant then meets Belinda again and they go to her home for sex but are interrupted by her family. Phil finds a letter in Sharon's bag that Michelle sent Peggy, revealing that Grant fathered Michelle's child, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous) 21 years previously. Grant visits Jane where he learns that she has been paralysed by her adoptive son Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington). He admits that he has lost his home and business in Portugal and is in debt. Grant and Jane both comfort each other, but Ian walks in on them and shouts at Grant for deserting his family. Grant leaves, ignoring Phil, who is attempting to tell him about Mark. Courtney calls Grant, who is staying with Sal due to losing his villa and bar in Portugal, for help after Ben and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) are kidnapped by the men who attacked Ben and killed his boyfriend Paul Coker (Jonny Labey). Grant rushes to Courtney's aid and assumes Mark is attacking her, but Sharon tells him he is Michelle's son. Phil initially insists he does not need Grant's help but then accepts it. Phil collapses so Grant vows to rescue Ben. Mark gets in Grant's car to help him, and they find Ben and Grant scares off the men. Grant reconciles with Phil, admitting he no longer wants the money Phil borrowed from him, and Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Courtney is angry with Grant when he stops her kissing Mark. Grant confronts Ian about keeping the secret for so long and punches him after Ian insults his parenting skills. Sharon tells him the reasons Michelle did not want him involved and Grant agrees that Mark would be better off not knowing, but Jane convinces Grant otherwise, so Grant offers to take Mark for a drink. After a heart to heart, Grant realizes that Mark would be better off not knowing and decides to return to Portugal after seeing Phil. Phil gives him money, and he reunites with Courtney and the pair return to Portugal.

500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly window dressing and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's {{still very much}} a calling card. However there are reasons for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would be far <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears of war and the familiar patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world better than we found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men who came before them."

[...] Upchurch, along with Rik Skews of Computer and Video Games, agreed, {{pointing out that the}} electronic version was <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the concept of Freeze Time than implementing a recreation of dice rolls and sequence of turns found in the board game. [...] A few reviewers disagreed. [...] Dee and Jay of Dragon wanted a [...] "computer game that was faithful to the elements of the board game", and said {{the video game}}'s design proved too difficult for them; they found controlling five or more Marines in real-time against Genestealers impossible. [...] Similarly, Amiga Forces Mark Smith and Ian Osborne were flustered by having to command several Marines at the same time while they came under sudden attacks from several directions. [...] The Marines' slow speed were another frustration. [...] Offering another insight, Meer opined the Marines' slow response was integral to the game's atmosphere: made slow and cumbersome by the game's design and interface, the Marines' battles against fast and deadly foes became nerve-wrecking affairs for the player. [...] Likewise, May found the multitasking nature of the game crucial to its intensity. [...] Rob Mead offered an opinion not from a player of the board game in his article for Amiga Format. [...] He rated the video game [...] "very good but not brilliant", and suggested it would appeal more to aficionados of the board game because such players tend to appreciate attention to detail, planning, and tactics.|$|E

40|$|MBA - WBSExchange traded {{funds have}} {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of interest in markets where they have been introduced including in the South African investment market. In South Africa exchange traded funds are still relatively new and the range available is fairly narrow, however their popularity is growing at a fast rate. Since the introduction of exchange traded funds in South Africa, starting with the listing of the Satrix 40 in November 2000, exchange traded funds have emerged as a viable investment alternative to unit trust funds. Given that exchange traded funds are available at low cost, and that they are likely to outperform active funds of similar risk, the question is: would an investor be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> investing in an exchange traded fund than in a unit trust portfolio. The purpose of this research was to compare the performance of an aggregate domestic general equity unit trust fund, to that of the Satrix 40, an exchange traded fund, and to determine if an investor would have been <b>better</b> <b>off</b> investing <b>with</b> the aggregate general equity unit trust manager or in the Satrix 40. Results from the comparative study of performance indicate that, after costs, the cumulative average abnormal returns of the Satrix 40 are significantly more than those for an aggregate general equity unit trust portfolio. This suggests that an investor would have been <b>better</b> <b>off</b> investing <b>with</b> the Satrix 40...|$|R
