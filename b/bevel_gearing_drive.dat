50|$|Canadian {{accident}} {{investigators found}} that a <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> in the oil pump drive had failed, shutting off lubrication to the propeller. This caused the propeller to decouple from the engine, allowing it to windmill at high speed. Moreover, during the emergency descent, the pilots had allowed the aircraft's airspeed to increase {{too close to the}} maximum allowable. This put significant strain on the windmilling propeller and in all probability caused it to fail in flight. The possibility of the <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> failing causing the propeller to windmill had not been foreseen by Vickers engineers, and there was therefore no mention of it in the training or operations manual.|$|R

40|$|Damages {{of a large}} spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> as used {{in heavy}} {{industry}} typically affect the pinion. Even if the gear still could be used, the complete pair has to be changed. This leads to long off times, high costs, and unnecessary waste. This paper applies a recent design technology for spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> {{to the production of}} a replacement pinion for the sake of energy saving, reduction of costs and off times, and for the realization of green engineering. The process involves the following steps. First, the real tool surface of the gear is measured by a CMM. Based on the new design method, the tooth surface of the mating pinion is derived from this discrete point cloud. In order to improve the meshing performance, the resulting surface of the pinion is modified in the third step. Finally, the pinion is produced on a CNC machining center. In contrast to other approaches, none of these steps needs the parameters of the special machine tool defining the original gear pair. It is worth noting that our technology can also be profitable to gain more freedom in the design of new gear pairs...|$|R

40|$|The Indian textile {{industry}} is one {{the largest and}} oldest sectors {{in the country and}} has a major share in the national economy. Powerloom industry in Maharashtra is more rapidly growing industry than in other states in India. Solapur is the home of Handloom and Power loom industry which provides employment to a large number of workers (approximately 100000). The jacquard drive system in a power loom is obtained by a chain drive system. In the present system, frequent chain failure and jerky power transmission is observed. Field visits are carried out in order to investigate the reasons of failure of the existing chain drive system. The chain drive fails due to long distance between shafts, swaying effect, misalignment between the axis of shaft and inadequate lubrication. Failure issues are responsible for the downtime and probable rejection of product due to interruption in weaving cycle.
