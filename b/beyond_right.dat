5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and <b>beyond</b> <b>right</b> field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
25|$|The {{ballpark}} {{offers a}} wide choice of restaurants. There are 25 fixed concessions stands, along with 112 movable ones. A Hard Rock Cafe is {{located within the}} ballpark, but it is open to anyone at the 161st St. and River Ave. entrance year round. The Hard Rock Cafe at Yankee Stadium officially opened on March 30, 2009, and an opening ceremony took place on April 2, 2009. A steakhouse called NYY Steak is located <b>beyond</b> <b>right</b> field. Celebrity chefs will occasionally make appearances at the ballpark's restaurants and help prepare food for fans in premium seating {{over the course of}} the season. Above Monument Park in center field is the Mohegan Sun sports bar, whose tinted black glass acts as the ballpark's batter's eye. After the 2016 season, the Yankees began doing updates to Yankee Stadium including the Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck and Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace. The Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck above the Mohegan Sun sports bar is an outdoor gathering space in center field with clear full views of the playing field available to all ticketed guests. The Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace overlook the visitors' and Yankees' bullpens respectively. The new AT Sports Lounge is behind section 134 on the main level and features a full bar, tables, stools and large screen TVs. The new Budweiser Party Decks located at sections 311 and 328 in the upper deck feature shaded standalone bar areas serving beer, cocktails and food. There is a new SunRun Kids Clubhouse located on the 300 level in right field and outfitted with Yankees-themed playground equipment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Beyond</b> <b>right</b> {{field is}} China Basin, {{a section of}} San Francisco Bay, which is dubbed McCovey Cove after famed Giants first baseman and left-handed slugger Willie McCovey, and into which a number of home runs have been hit on the fly. As of August 21 2017, 75 [...] "splash hits" [...] have been knocked into the Cove by Giants players since the park opened; 35 of those were by Barry Bonds, {{and the most recent}} being Denard Span hitting one off Carlos Carrasco of the Cleveland Indians on July 19, 2017. These hits are tallied on an {{electronic}} counter on the right field wall. Opponents have hit the water on the fly 42 times; Todd Hundley of the Los Angeles Dodgers was the first visitor to do so on June 30, 2000. Curtis Granderson of the New York Mets, Luis Gonzalez of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cliff Floyd of the Chicago Cubs are the only visiting players to do so twice, while Carlos Delgado of the New York Mets has performed the feat three times. [...] Adam LaRoche has also hit three splash hits, twice with the Arizona Diamondbacks and once with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Curtis Granderson of the New York Mets most recently hit one into the water as a visiting player on August 19, 2016 On June 27, 2010, David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox became the first American League player to hit a splash hit. The only other AL players who have done it are Mitch Moreland of the Texas Rangers on June 9, 2012 and Adam Dunn of the Chicago White Sox on August 13, 2014. Barry Bonds is the Giant who has hit the most home runs into [...] "The Cove" [...] as Giants fans call it and is the only one to have had hit 2 splash hits in one game (a feat he accomplished twice).|$|E

The former might govern according to the laws, but the latter placed himself above the laws (Cont. Soc., III. x.) This corresponded to Locke's distinction: [...] "As usurpation is the exercise of power which another hath a right to, so tyranny is the exercise of a power <b>beyond</b> <b>right,</b> which nobody can have a right to."

60|$|Nevertheless, at half-past eleven, this morning, {{seemingly}} {{by way of}} answer, {{there does}} wait on him at Frouarde, some Deputation from the mutinous Regiments, from the Nanci Municipals, to see what can be done. Bouille receives this Deputation, 'in a large open court adjoining his lodging:' pacified Salm, and the rest, attend also, being invited to do it,--all happily still in the right humour. The Mutineers pronounce themselves with a decisiveness, which to Bouille seems insolence; and happily to Salm also. Salm, forgetful of the Metz staircase and sabre, demands that the scoundrels 'be hanged' there and then. Bouille represses the hanging; but answers that mutinous Soldiers have one course, and not more than one: To liberate, with heartfelt contrition, Messieurs Denoue and de Malseigne; to get ready forthwith for marching off, whither he shall order; and 'submit and repent,' as the National Assembly has decreed, as he yesterday did in thirty printed Placards proclaim. These are his terms, unalterable as the decrees of Destiny. Which terms as they, the Mutineer deputies, seemingly do not accept, it were good for them to vanish from this spot, and even promptly; with him too, in few instants, the word will be, Forward! The Mutineer deputies vanish, not unpromptly; the Municipal ones, anxious <b>beyond</b> <b>right</b> for their own individualities, prefer abiding with Bouille.|$|E
6000|$|Prince Karl--Daun {{there as}} second, but Karl now the {{dominant}} hand--was {{on the heels}} of Bevern, march after march. Prince Karl cut athwart him by one cunning march, in Liegnitz Country; barring him from Schweidnitz, the chief stronghold of Silesia, and to appearance from Breslau, the chief city, too. Bevern, who did not want for soldiership, when reduced to his shifts, now made a beautiful manoeuvre, say the critics; struck out leftwards, namely, and crossed the Oder, as if making for Glogau, quite beyond Prince Karl's sphere of possibility,--but turned to right, not to left, when across, and got in upon Breslau from the other or east side of the River. Cunning manoeuvre, if you will, and followed by cunning manoeuvres: but the result is, Prince Karl has got Schweidnitz to rear, stands between Breslau and it; can besiege Schweidnitz when he likes, and no relief to it possible that will not cost a battle. A battle, thinks Friedrich, is what Bevern ought to have tried at first; a well-fought battle might have settled everything, and there was no other good likelihood in such an expedition: but now, by detaching reinforcements to this garrison and that, he has weakened himself <b>beyond</b> <b>right</b> power of fighting. [OEuvres de Frederic, iv. 141, 159.] Schweidnitz is liable to siege; Breslau, with its poor walls and multitudinous population, can stand no siege worth mentioning; the Silesian strong places, not to speak of meal-magazines, are like to go a bad road.
