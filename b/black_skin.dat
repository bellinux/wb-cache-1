5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} Large Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat, but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the <b>black</b> <b>skin</b> of the purebred Large Black.|$|E

The remains were found to be of a 30 year-old woman who grew up in East Sussex, but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving her <b>black</b> <b>skin</b> and an African skeletal structure. Her ancestors came from below the Saharan region, {{at a time when the}} Roman Empire extended only as far as North Africa.|$|E
25|$|Leukoedema is common. It {{occurs in}} about 70-90% of <b>black</b> <b>skinned</b> adults and about 50% of <b>black</b> <b>skinned</b> children. The {{prevalence}} in white skinned people is considerably less, but reports range {{from less than}} 10% to more than 90%, probably varying depending upon the population studied, and the methods used in the study, e.g. examination conditions and the diagnostic criteria. The ethnic variation {{may be explained by}} genetic factors or simply because <b>black</b> <b>skinned</b> people have greater amount of melanin in the mucosa, making it appear darker (termed racial or physiologic pigmentation). This darker mucosa may make the edematous changes more noticeable, whereas in the mucosa of people with lighter skin types leukoedema gives a milder presentation.|$|R

5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as <b>black</b> <b>skin</b> and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E

5|$|Contacts {{between the}} Ethiopian Empire and Imperial China {{seem to have}} been very limited, if not mostly indirect. There were some {{attempts}} in Chinese historiographic and encyclopedic literature to describe parts of Ethiopia or outside areas that it once controlled. Zhang Xiang, a scholar of Africa–China relations, asserts that the country of Dou le described in the Xiyu juan (i.e. Western Regions) chapter of the Book of Later Han was that of the Aksumite port city of Adulis. It was from this city that an envoy was sent to Luoyang, the capital of China's Han dynasty, in roughly 100 AD. The 11th-century New Book of Tang and 14th-century Wenxian Tongkao describe the country of Nubia (previously controlled by the Aksumite Kingdom) as a land of deserts south of the Byzantine Empire that was infested with malaria, where the natives of the local Mo-lin territory had <b>black</b> <b>skin</b> and consumed foods such as Persian dates. In his English translation of this document, Friedrich Hirth identified Mo-lin (Molin) with the kingdom of 'Alwa (Upper Kush) and neighboring Lao-p'o-sa with the kingdom of Maqurra (Lower Kush), both in Nubia.|$|E

When Mr. Brockway arrives, he sees Darrin and Dorothy {{standing}} next to each other and assumes they are married to each other. When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After discovering that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African-American woman, Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account. Through witchcraft, Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see everyone in the room, including himself, as having <b>black</b> <b>skin.</b> On Christmas Day, while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens, Mr. Brockway arrives, apologizes for his previous actions, and repents of his racism.

25|$|Ibn Khaldun, the Arab {{sociologist}} and polymath, similarly linked {{skin color}} to environmental factors. In his Muqaddimah (1377), {{he wrote that}} <b>black</b> <b>skin</b> {{was due to the}} hot climate of sub-Saharan Africa and not due to African lineage.

25|$|Joseph Smith and Brigham Young {{reasoned}} that <b>black</b> <b>skin</b> {{was a result}} of the Curse of Cain or the Curse of Ham. They used these Biblical curses to justify slavery. Young believed the curse made black people ineligible to vote, marry white people, or hold the priesthood. Successive presidents continued to use the Biblical curses to justify excluding black men from the priesthood.

5000|$|Examples of [...] "Sambo" [...] as {{a common}} name can be found {{as far back as}} the 19th century. In Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair (serialised from 1847), the <b>black</b> <b>skinned</b> Indian servant of the Sedley family from Chapter One, is called Sambo. Similarly, in Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), one of Simon Legree's overseers is named Sambo. Instances of it being used as a stereotypical name for African Americans can be found as early as the Civil War.|$|R
25|$|Trim (naqyutkaun in Cup'ig) on parka, hat, and boot is {{decorative}} trimming {{elements such}} as patchwork pieces or tassel. Parka trim pieces made primarily of white and <b>black</b> <b>skin</b> of caribou or reindeer, also now largely replaced by calfskin. The fur of the wolf and wolverine are utilized by the Alaska Natives for parka trimming. Wolverines have a somewhat higher basal metabolic rate than other animals their size, which means their internal fire burns a little hotter. To help hold in heat, they wear a long, luxuriously thick coat. Trappers prize this fur because the texture of wolverine hair also keeps it from absorbing moisture. Used widely as trim on parka hoods, cuffs and collars, it readily sheds frost that would otherwise build up from steaming breath.|$|E
25|$|Throughout her career, Saint Phalle was outspoken in {{addressing}} important {{political and cultural}} issues of the time. Her Tirs series and assemblages reflected {{the violence of the}} early 1960s Algerian War for independence from France, and asserted her rebellion as part of second-wave feminism. Her enormous, curvaceous Nanas celebrated the fecund female form, featuring large breasts and buttocks, splayed limbs, joyous dance postures, and often, <b>black</b> <b>skin.</b> She was one of the earliest artistic champions of AIDS awareness, creating artworks and a widely-distributed book. Shortly before her death, she exhibited drawings critical of the George W Bush administration. In addition to her artworks, she wrote extensively in both French and in English, and granted numerous interviews; much of this material is collected in her archives.|$|E
25|$|While in France, Frantz Fanon {{wrote his}} first book, <b>Black</b> <b>Skin,</b> White Masks, an {{analysis}} of the impact of colonial subjugation on the African psyche. This book was a very personal account of Fanon’s experience being black: as a man, an intellectual, and a party to a French education. Although Fanon wrote the book while still in France, most of his other work was written while in North Africa (in particular Algeria). It was during this time that he produced his greatest works, A Dying Colonialism and The Wretched of the Earth. In it, Fanon lucidly analyzes the role of class, race, national culture and violence in the struggle for decolonization. In this work, Fanon expounded his views on the liberating role of violence for the colonized, as well as the general necessity of violence in the anti-colonial struggle. Both books established Fanon in the eyes of much of the Third World as one of the leading anti-colonial thinkers of the 20th century. In 1959 he compiled his essays on Algeria in a book called L'An Cinq: De la Révolution Algérienne.|$|E

Freire was teaching the poor and illiterate members of Brazilian society to read {{at a time when}} literacy was a requirement for suffrage and dictators ruled many South American countries.
