40|$|Abstract: Biomass <b>briquettes</b> are a biofuel {{substitute}} to {{coal and}} charcoal. <b>Briquettes</b> are mostly {{used in the}} developing world where cooking fuels are not as easily available. <b>Briquettes</b> are used to heat industrial boilers in order to produce electricity from steam. The <b>briquettes</b> are con-fired with coal in order to create the heat supplied to the boiler. People have been using biomass <b>briquettes</b> since before recorded history. Biomass <b>briquettes</b> are made from agriculture waste and are a replacement for fossils fuels such as oil or coal, and can be used to heat boiler in manufacturing plants. Biomass <b>briquettes</b> are a renewable source of energy and avoid adding fossils carbon to the atmosphere. The extrusion production technology of <b>briquettes</b> is the process of extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure. There is a tremendous scope to bring down the waste of convention energy sources to a considerable level through the development, propagation of non-convention <b>briquettes</b> technology i. e. <b>briquettes</b> machine, <b>briquettes</b> plant, biomass <b>briquettes</b> plant for production of agro residue <b>briquettes</b> to meet thermal energy requirement.

The work {{deals with}} the effects of water {{sorption}} by plant biomass <b>briquettes.</b> The influence of water sorption was studied especially in relation to the <b>briquette</b> material and their volume and shape changes. It was found that the weight of water absorbed by a <b>briquette</b> can be up to more triple then the initial weight of the dry <b>briquette.</b> Changes in the density and shape of <b>briquettes</b> were observed, depending on the amount of water catch by <b>briquette.</b> The water sorption by <b>briquette</b> is an irreversible process. The biggest changes of <b>briquette,</b> caused by sorption water, are the volume and shape changes. The volume change is always positive.
