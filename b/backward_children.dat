25|$|Psychology {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a major subject at the university by Professor Imre Sándor, who realized {{that the study of}} psychology {{is just as important as}} that of pedagogy. Accordingly, on 20 October 1926, he filed his petition to the directors of the university for the establishment of a fundamentally different, modern Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of <b>Backward</b> <b>Children,</b> Psychotechnics, and Pedagogical Somatology.|$|E

60|$|That, however, is {{something}} of a digression. The intelligent inquirer who has squared his initially materialistic system of morals with the problems arising out of the necessity of sustaining pride and preference, is then invited to explore an adjacent thicket of this tortuous subject. It is, we hold, of supreme importance in our state to sustain in all our citizens, women as well as men, a sense of personal independence and responsibility. Particularly is this the case with mothers. An illiterate mother means a <b>backward</b> <b>child,</b> a downtrodden mother bears a dishonest man, an unwilling mother may even hate her children. Slaves and brutes are the sexes where women are slaves. The line of thought we are following out in these papers necessarily attaches distinctive importance to the woman as mother. Our system of morals, therefore, has to make it worth while and honourable to be a mother; it is particularly undesirable that it should be held to be right for a woman of exceptional charm or exceptional cleverness to evade motherhood, unless, perhaps, to become a teacher. A woman evading her high calling, must not be conceded the same claim upon men's toil and service as the mother-woman; more particularly Lady Greensleeves must not flaunt it over the housewife. And here also comes the question of the quality of jealousy, whether being wife of a man and mother of his children does not almost necessarily give a woman a feeling of exclusive possession in him, and whether, therefore, if we are earnest in our determination not to debase her, our last shred of polygamy does not vanish. From first to last, of course, it has been assumed that a prolific polygamy alone can be intended, for long before we have plumbed the bottom of the human heart we shall know enough to imagine what the ugly and pointless consequences of permitting sterile polygamy must be.|$|R

40|$|Children {{with disabilities}} are a {{minority}} that are not prioritised {{in the context of}} education programmes in India, although they are often found in many marginalised groups that are catered for if non-disabled ? for example, girls, scheduled tribe, scheduled caste, and other <b>backward</b> caste <b>children.</b> Inclusive education may be a way of merging these children’s needs in order to improve school quality and achieve EFA. However, a dominant special needs conceptualisation of IE in India, combined with negative attitudes towards disability, are currently preventing this approach. After exploring the relevance of disability and inclusive education in the context of EFA, this paper analyses the interpretation and implementation of inclusive education in India. The issues and constraints faced by the stakeholders involved, and the implications these may have, particularly for children with disabilities, lead to the conclusion that a twin-track approach to disability may assist not only in improving education access, but also the reconceptualisation of inclusive education as a school quality issue. In the long-term, it is hoped that this could assist in fulfilling the right to education for all children...|$|R

40|$|A {{sample of}} 99 {{children}} completed a causal learning task {{that was an}} analogue of the food allergy paradigm used with adults. The cue competition effects of blocking and unovershadowing were assessed under forward and <b>backward</b> presentation conditions. <b>Children</b> also answered questions probing their ability to make the inference posited to be necessary for blocking by a reasoning account of cue competition. For the first time, children’s working memory and general verbal ability were also measured alongside their causal learning. The magnitude of blocking and unovershadowing effects increased with age. However, analyses showed that {{the best predictor of}} both blocking and unovershadowing effects was children’s performance on the reasoning questions. The magnitude of the blocking effect was also predicted by children’s working memory abilities.

60|$|It so {{happened}} that, {{about this}} time, George Griswold, the only son before referred to, {{returned to his}} native village, after having completed his theological studies at a neighboring institution. It is interesting to mark the gradual development of mind and heart, {{from the time that}} the white-headed, bashful boy quits the country village for college, to the period when he returns, a formed and matured man, to notice how gradually the rust of early prejudices begins to cleave from him--how his opinions, like his handwriting, pass from the cramped and limited forms of a country school into that confirmed and characteristic style which is to mark the man for life. In George this change was remarkably striking. He was endowed by nature with uncommon acuteness of feeling and fondness for reflection--qualities as likely as any to render a <b>child</b> <b>backward</b> and uninteresting in early life.|$|R

And no human being possessing such constitutionals has a better chance of being made unhappy by them than the <b>backward,</b> uninteresting, wrong-doing <b>child.</b> We can all sympathize, to some extent, with men and women; but how few can go back to the sympathies of childhood; can understand the desolate insignificance of not being one of the grown-up people; of being sent to bed, {{to be out of the}} way in the evening, and to school, to be out of the way in the morning; of manifold similar grievances and distresses, which the child has no elocution to set forth, and the grown person no imagination to conceive.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{kinematics}} of the pelvis and the right hip and the electromyographic activity of the gluteus maximus and biceps femoris during <b>backward</b> walking in <b>children</b> with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and children without known disabilities. Subjects included 6 children, three with a diagnosis of spastic diplegia and three without known disabilities. The results of the study showed important differences between the experimental group and the control group. Subjects with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (SDCP) walked backwards with less hip extension, more body rotation, shorter and slower steps, and used a higher percentage of their maximum voluntary contraction than the control group. No significant differences were found between both groups in the total amount of hip sagittal range of motion; however, these motions occurred towards flexion in the group of children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and towards neutral and extension in the control group. Independent backward walking seems not to be an effective way to promote active hip extension in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Clinicians using backward walking in therapeutic programs may benefit from this data...|$|R
