5|$|Although The Wrestlers was {{probably}} exhibited {{as part of}} a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the <b>bargain</b> <b>price</b> of 30guineas by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|While {{traditionally}} the Sirens had been depicted as human–animal chimeras, Etty portrayed them as naked young women, {{on an island}} strewn with decaying corpses. The painting divided opinion {{at the time of}} its first exhibition, with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant. Possibly owing to its unusually large size, 442.5cm by 297cm (14ft 6in by 9ft 9in), the work initially failed to sell, and was bought later that year at a <b>bargain</b> <b>price</b> by the Manchester merchant Daniel Grant. Grant died shortly afterwards, and his brother donated The Sirens and Ulysses to the Royal Manchester Institution.|$|E
25|$|The rise of Chinese {{immigration}} turned Hong Kong {{into the}} main manhua-ready market, especially with {{the baby boom generation}} of children. The most influential manhua magazine for adults was the 1956 Cartoons World, which fueled the best-selling Uncle Choi. The availability of Japanese and Taiwanese comics challenged the local industry, selling at a pirated <b>bargain</b> <b>price</b> of 10 cents. Manhua like Old Master Q were needed to revitalize the local industry.|$|E

25|$|Tupper {{traveled}} to London in summer 1879 {{to attempt to}} persuade the British government (then headed by the Earl of Beaconsfield {{in his second term}} as prime minister) to guarantee a bond sale to be used to construct the railway. He was not successful, though he did manage to purchase 50,000 tons of steel rails at a <b>bargain</b> <b>price.</b> Tupper's old friend Sandford Fleming oversaw the railway construction, but his inability to keep costs down led to political controversy, and Tupper was forced to remove Fleming as Chief Engineer in May 1880.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Rouse {{sold his}} {{interest}} in One Liberty Place to Japanese insurance company Chyoda. Also, in 1995, {{the owners of the}} Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which included Rouse, defaulted on its US$64 million loan. After a sheriff's auction on December 4 of that year, the creditor, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, took ownership of the property. The hotel again changed ownership in 1996 when Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association agreed to sell all its hotel properties to Starwood Lodging Trust. In 1999 One Liberty Place, Two Liberty Place, and the Shops of Liberty Place were put up for sale. At the time, One Liberty Place was owned by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and Chyoda. Two Liberty Place was owned by a partnership led by Willard Rouse called 1650 Market Associates and the Shops of Liberty Place was owned jointly by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and 1650 Market Associates. One Liberty Place and the Shops at Liberty Place were sold later that year to Sunbelt Management a Palm Beach Gardens, Florida firm owned by German businessman Hugo Mann. Sunbelt acquired the property for a <b>bargain</b> <b>price</b> of US$250 million. The <b>bargain</b> <b>price</b> was a result of One Liberty Place being 99.9 percent leased {{at the time of the}} sale and the majority of long-term leases signed when the real estate market was depressed. Rents for One Liberty Place were around US$10 lower than competing office buildings. Two Liberty Place was struggling to find a buyer because it was uncertain Cigna would renew its lease which would expire in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1866, the Guion Line was {{successful}} in the Liverpool-Queenstown-New York steerage trade. In 1875, Guion began commissioning express liners to compete for first class business, but its first two ships were total failures. William Pearce, the controlling partner of the John Elder shipyard, was convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port. When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the Guion line at a <b>bargain</b> <b>price</b> of £140,000 {{at a time when}} express liners typically cost £200,000. He also agreed to share the initial costs. Stephen Guion, managing director of the line, personally owned the new vessel.|$|E

Daniel attempts to buy the farm at a <b>bargain</b> <b>price.</b> However, Eli, Paul's twin brother and pastor of a local church, is aware of his plan. Eli demands $10,000 and states that {{it is for the}} church. An agreement is made and Daniel goes on to acquire all the available land in the area, except for one holdout: William Bandy. Oil production begins, but an on-site accident kills a worker and a gas blowout robs H. W. of his hearing. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli demands the $5,000 Daniel still owes his family, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table, Eli berates his father for trusting Daniel.|$|E

500|$|Armstrong was {{a member}} of the Old South Church. [...] He served on its vestry (including as its secretary), and was chosen deacon in 1829. [...] When the church was {{formally}} incorporated in 1844 Armstrong was named as one of its proprietors. [...] In 1816 Armstrong discovered the original manuscript of the third volume of colonial Governor John Winthrop's History of New England in the church's tower; the volume was presented to the Massachusetts Historical Society. [...] He was also in part responsible for the church's loss of a perfect specimen of the 17th century Bay Psalm Book, one of five that had been willed to the church by Thomas Prince, an early minister of the congregation. [...] Writer Robert Wallace suggests that Armstrong's trade of two copies of the book in exchange for offers by the recipients, George Livermore and Edward Crowninshield, to rebind the other copies was naive, and was essentially a scam by Livermore and Crowninshield (both knowledgeable in the rare book trade) to acquire the valuable books for a <b>bargain</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
