In addition, civil and criminal suits alleging abuse during interrogation and detention have been brought against some police and prosecution officials. In 2003, the use of leather restraining <b>body</b> <b>belts</b> was abolished. Softer leather handcuffs without <b>body</b> <b>belts</b> were instituted as substitute restraining devices.

The Florentine curve rear window treatment was adopted for sedans. Three chrome moldings bordered the rear license plate on either side and deck lid decorations consisted of a V-shaped ornament and a Cadillac crest. The Coupe de Ville had a golden script nameplate at the upper <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> just forward of the rear window pillar. The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> moldings, a distinctive rear fender design, with twin round taillights halfway up the fenders and flatter pointed tailfins. Tubeless tires were a new standard Cadillac feature. Sales reached a record 118,190, accounting for nearly 84% of all Cadillacs sold.

50|$|The miner's apron (Arschleder, Bergleder or Fahrleder) {{is part of}} the {{clothing}} worn, especially historically, by miners in the mining industries of German-speaking Europe. Variously called in English a miner's apron, a miner's after-apron, breech leather or miner's leather apron, it was a leather apron that served to keep the seat of the trousers from wearing out when working or moving around the mine (Fahrung) as well as keeping out the cold and moisture when sitting. It also provided protection especially when entering inclined mineshafts. Another advantage was that it stabilised the internal organs from mechanical shock and vibration by acting as a sort of kidney belt. The miner's apron was a triangular or, more rarely, semi-circular piece of leather and was supported by the <b>body</b> <b>belt.</b> In Germany the design of the modern miner's apron is governed by DIN standard 23307 Gesäßleder für den Bergbau (Arschleder).|$|E

50|$|The {{creature}} then stalks {{down and}} kills {{the others in}} the lighthouse. Vince dies first, then Adelaide. With its presence now revealed, the alien sheds its disguise: revealing itself to be a Rutan, the hereditary enemies of the Sontarans, a green blob-like amphibious life form, whose scout ship crash landed in the sea and is trying to summon its mother ship. With the Rutans losing the war against the Sontarans, they plan to turn Earth into a base for its strategic position, which will allow them to launch a counterattack. However, once the Sontarans find the planet, it will become subject to a photonic bombardment, taking countless lives. The lighthouse and Victorian-age technology provide little ammunition in dealing with the Rutan; however, the Doctor modifies a weapon to destroy the alien, who was susceptible to high temperatures. The Doctor and Skinsale retrieve diamonds from Palmerdale's <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> to use the weapon, but Skinsale is killed by the Rutan in the process. The Doctor uses the diamonds as a focus for the electric lighthouse beam to convert it into a high-energy laser by which he destroys the Rutan mother ship. Disobeying the Doctor, Leela watches the laser destroy the ship and is momentarily blinded, as a side effect the blinding flash turns Leela’s eyes from brown to blue. The Doctor quotes Wilfrid Wilson Gibson's poem Flannan Isle as the two take their leave.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} are {{a crucial}} tool {{to understand the}} relationship between debris discs and planetary companions. As debris disc observations are now reaching unprecedented levels of precision over a wide range of wavelengths, an appropriate level of accuracy and consistency is required in numerical simulations to confidently interpret this new generation of observations. However, simulations throughout the literature have been conducted with various initial conditions often with little or no justification. In this paper, we aim to study the dependence on the initial conditions of N-body simulations modelling the interaction between a massive and eccentric planet on an exterior debris disc. To achieve this, we first classify three broad approaches used in the literature and provide some physical context for when each category should be used. We then run a series of N-body simulations, that include radiation forces acting on small grains, with varying initial conditions across the three categories. We test the influence of the initial parent <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> width, eccentricity, and alignment with the planet on the resulting debris disc structure and compare the final peak emission location, disc width and offset of synthetic disc images produced with a radiative transfer code. We also track the evolution of the forced eccentricity of the dust grains induced by the planet, as well as resonance dust trapping. We find that an initially broad parent <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> always results in a broader debris disc than an initially narrow parent <b>body</b> <b>belt.</b> While simulations with a parent <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> with low initial eccentricity (e ~ 0) and high initial eccentricity (0 < e < 0. 3) resulted in similar broad discs, we find that purely secular forced initial conditions, where the initial disc eccentricity is set to the forced value and the disc is aligned with the planet, always result in a narrower disc. We conclude that broad debris discs can be modelled by using either a dynamically cold or dynamically warm parent belt, while in contrast eccentric narrow debris rings are reproduced using a secularly forced parent <b>body</b> <b>belt...</b>|$|E

40|$|This Alert {{presented}} the warning that workers may die or be injured if scaffold equipment and fall protection systems are either defective or are misused. Falls {{have been a}} leading cause of traumatic occupational death. Fatal falls from scaffolds during the period from 1980 through 1985 accounted for 17 % of all falls from elevations (461 of 2705), second only to falls from buildings. Regulations were promulgated in 1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers from the hazards of working from scaffolds in general industry and in the construction industry. Currently regulations have been proposed which would apply to the design, construction and use of all scaffolds in construction. These regulations provide for a competent person to inspect scaffolds and equipment before use, the use of scaffold components capable of supporting proper loads, the proper shielding of ropes from corrosive processes or heat, and the use of both guardrail systems and <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> or harness systems for work from suspension scaffolds.

This study aims to determine the fall prevention perfor-mance of two types of safety belts: a <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> 1), which {{has been used for}} more than 40 yr in the Japanese construction industry as a general type of safety equipment for fall accident prevention, and a full harness 2, 3), which has been used in many other countries. To determine human tolerance for impact trauma, this study discusses features of safety belts with reference 4 – 9) to relevant studies in the medical science, automobile crash safety, and aircrew safety. For this purpose, simple drop tests were carried out in a virtual workplace to measure impact load, head acceleration, and pos-ture in the experiments, the Hybrid-III pedestrian model 10) was used as a human dummy. Hybrid-III is typically employed in official automobile crash tests (New Car Assessment Program: NCAP) and is currently recognized as a model that faithfully reproduces dynamic responses. Experimental results shows that safety performance strongly depends on both the variety of safety belts used and the shock absorbers attached onto lanyards. These findings indicate that fall prevention equipment, such as safety belts, lanyards, and shock absorbers, must be improved to reduce impact injuries to the human head and body during falls...|$|E
