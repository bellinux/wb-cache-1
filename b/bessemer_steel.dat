This bridge was constructed from <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel,</b> which proved too brittle and so the bridge was replaced again in 1898. The replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated into position, allowing the old structure to be removed and the new one put in place in 27½ hours on March 13 and March 14, 1898.|$|E
25|$|Carnegie {{made his}} fortune in the steel industry, {{controlling}} the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the Bessemer process for steel making. Sir Henry Bessemer had invented the furnace which allowed the high carbon content of pig iron to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way. The steel price dropped as a direct result, and <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.|$|E
25|$|Clara Ward {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, the {{daughter}} of Captain Eber Brock Ward (1811–1875) and his second wife, Catherine Lyon, a niece of Senator Benjamin Wade. A wealthy man, often stated to be Michigan's first millionaire, E.B. Ward had holdings in Great Lakes steamships; lumbering at Ludington, Michigan; iron and steel manufacturing at Wyandotte, Michigan, Leland, Michigan, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois; and silver mining in Colorado. He manufactured the first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> {{to be made in}} the United States at his plant in Wyandotte. Ward was president of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad from 1860 until his death on 2 January 1875 in Detroit.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{invention}} of the <b>Bessemer</b> process, <b>steel</b> mills have replaced ironwork, based on puddling or fining methods. New ways to produce steel appeared later: from scrap melted in an electric arc furnace and, more recently, from direct reduced iron processes.|$|R

50|$|Rail {{corrugation}} may {{be prevented}} by selecting rails with material compositions {{that are more}} resistant to corrugation. Heat-treated alloy steel rails with relative hardness are the most resistant as opposed to <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steels</b> due to a greater relative hardness. Rails with a Brinell hardness of 320-360 are best for corrugation resistant rails. Trains may vary speed on the tracks {{in an effort to}} prevent corrugation from affecting sections or rail on a transit systems. Varying a train’s speed, direction, and tonnage are beneficial for combating the growth of rail, as corrugation is caused by continually uniform friction. On subways and major transit systems, {{it is not possible to}} vary the direction of trains, making the use of annual and bi-annual rail grinding processes more applicable.|$|R
25|$|By 1889, the U.S. {{output of}} steel {{exceeded}} {{that of the}} UK, and Carnegie owned {{a large part of}} it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the J.

Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark Eads Bridge project across the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.|$|E
25|$|Although the Brogden {{family were}} the main {{shareholders}} in the new company and Alexander Brogden was the chairman, the family, for the first time, relinquished control over their fortunes as the new company had {{a large number of}} 'vocal' shareholders in the Manchester and Southport areas who closely monitored the progress of the new venture. In 1873, during a major strike among the iron company workers in south Wales, Alexander Brogden acted unilaterally and settled amicably with the workforce a month before the strike eventually ended {{in the rest of the}} coalfield. In the immediate aftermath of the strike Alexander Brogden was so highly regarded by his workforce in Maesteg that, for a time, it was suggested that the planned town hall in the valley should be named in his honour. By 1874 however, after a brief period of prosperity, profits slumped as the Tondu and Llynvi works faced competition from cheaper producers abroad and, more importantly, from cheap <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel.</b> Losses accumulated until the company's debenture holders opted for voluntary liquidation in January 1878.|$|E

500|$|The most {{economically}} {{important aspect}} of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> making process and the [...] "basic slag" [...] smelting chemistry, which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.|$|E

She was also too slow for use as a reconnaissance vessel or a leader of a torpedo boat flotilla. As a result, she saw little active service. In September, Zara participated in a demonstration of the fleet's torpedo vessels for Kaiser Franz Joseph I in Pola. Franz Joseph came aboard Zara to observe a group of torpedo boats launch an attack against an old schooner.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century iron and steel became a leading industry, in second place by value added, with {{machinery}} being in first place.

2500|$|<b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> became brittle {{with age}} because {{nitrogen}} was introduced when air was blown in.

[...] After World War II the OHF was displaced by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which used oxygen instead of air and required about 35–40 minutes to produce a batch of steel compared to 8 to 9 hours for the OHF. The BOF also was more energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt <b>steel</b> warships. The <b>Bessemer</b> process for <b>steel</b> {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships.

The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|R
50|$|This {{phase was}} {{important}} {{also for the}} integration of new technologies in architecture and design.

2500|$|Steel {{is often}} cited as {{the first of several}} new areas for {{industrial}} mass-production, which are said to characterise a [...] "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the 1860s, when Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten pig iron into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality. [...] <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was being displaced by the open hearth furnace {{near the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{industrialist}} Moses Taylor, a protégé of John Howland's, {{had organized}} the Franklin Iron Company to supply pig iron for rail tracks to the Midland Railroad and the Sussex Railroad (of {{which he was}} part-owner). Taylor wanted to link his railroads with the Scranton-owned Delaware & Lackawanna, and believed the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Co. could turn his pig iron into finished steel—but only if the company adopted the Bessemer process. Together, Moses Taylor and W.W. Scranton convinced the company's other investors to adopt the Bessemer process in 1875, and to merge the Taylor and Scranton railways in 1881. The first [...] "blow" [...] (or pouring of molten steel from the Bessemer furnace into molds) occurred on October 23, 1875, and the first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> rolled in the mill on December 29, 1875.|$|E
2500|$|From 1855 {{the firm}} was working with Henry Bessemer, {{inventor}} of the eponymous process, in steel manufacture; he described William Galloway as [...] "my old friend" [...] when writing in 1905. He had been a customer of the firm since 1843 when he had developed a process for refining sugar and employed the Galloways to construct it. Bessemer and Galloways {{conducted a series of}} experiments throughout 1855 on land bought for the purpose at the Knott Mill Ironworks. This was while he was trying to prove his method, and Galloways are thought likely to have constructed the equipment that Bessemer used in his later trials at Baxter House in London, after which he announced the process to the world in August 1856 at Cheltenham. From these events comes the claim, frequently made including by John Galloway, that the first ingots of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> were made at the Knott Mill Ironworks. Furthermore, the Galloways were the first to license Bessemer's process, obtaining the rights to operate it in Manchester and for a radius of [...] around before the process was made public. Within a month of his announcement Bessemer had raised £27,000, granting further licenses to the Dowlais Ironworks in South Wales, Govan Iron Works (Glasgow), Butterley Iron Company (Derbyshire), and a tin-plate company in Wales.|$|E
50|$|Anthony Bessemer was a British {{engineer}} and industrialist, who spent {{large portions of}} his life in the Netherlands and France before returning to live in London and Hertfordshire.

In England he operated a type foundry in Charlton, Hertfordshire with his business partner J.J. Catherwood and then in London, according to Thomas Curson Hansard also acting as a punchcutter.

The Bessemer process introduced nitrogen into the steel, which caused the steel to become brittle with age. The open hearth furnace began to replace the Bessemer process near the end of 19th century, improving the quality of steel and further reducing costs. Thus steel completely replaced the use of iron in rails, thus becoming standard for all railways.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., {{commercial}} {{steel production}} using this method stopped in 1968. It {{was replaced by}} processes such as the basic oxygen (Linz-Donawitz) process, which offered better control of final chemistry. The Bessemer process was so fast (10-20 minutes for a heat) that it allowed little time for chemical analysis or adjustment of the alloying elements in the <b>steel.</b> <b>Bessemer</b> converters did not remove phosphorus efficiently from the molten steel; as low-phosphorus ores became more expensive, conversion costs increased. The process permitted only limited amount of scrap steel to be charged, further increasing costs, especially when scrap was inexpensive. Use of electric arc furnace technology competed favourably with the Bessemer process resulting in its obsolescence.|$|R
2500|$|Thomas Carnegie's {{experience}} {{in running the}} Lucy furnaces led him to co-found the Edgar Thomson Steel Works. In early 1871, William Coleman {{became interested in the}} new Bessemer process steel-making furnaces, and he traveled throughout Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania to view these new works. Coleman invited Thomas Carnegie to join him in building the new steel works, and together they purchased [...] of land about [...] east of Pittsburgh known as Braddock's Field (a historic battlefield where French and Indian forces from Fort Duquesne defeated British General Edward Braddock on July 5, 1755, in the Battle of the Monongahela). (Thomas borrowed the money for his investment from his brother.) Coleman and Carnegie lived near one another in Homewood and went to work together on the streetcar, and it was during these daily commutes that the men worked on their plans for the new steel works. Although Thomas asked Andrew to invest in the new mill, Andrew refused (considering it too risky a venture). Thomas then prevailed upon David McCandless, a wealthy Pittsburgh merchant {{and vice president of the}} Exchange National Bank. McCandless agreed, and brought in William P. Shinn (a Norman Medal-winning engineer) as treasurer. In the spring of 1872, Andrew Carnegie (while on a bond-selling trip) made a survey of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> works in Europe and returned to the U.S. highly enthusiastic about the new project. Andrew subsequently invested $250,000 in the works. Meanwhile, Coleman, McCandless, Scott, and Thomas Carnegie had purchased a newly platted tract in Pittsburgh, subdivided it, and sold the lots at a significant profit. The partners then invested $50,000 each in the steel mill. A new company, Carnegie, McCandless & Co., was formed on January 13, 1873, to build the works.|$|E

50|$|Iron {{production}} in South Wales peaked in 1871, {{after which the}} process was remorseless decline. An exception was at Dowlais, where the <b>Bessemer</b> process of <b>steel</b> making was instigated from 1865. This required a different quality of iron ore, not available locally, and the potential traffic flow of imported ore encouraged thoughts of improved railway connection. Several unsuccessful schemes were put forward, but {{a joint venture between}} the Rhymney Railway and the Great Western Railway (by now owner of the Taff Vale Extension line) resulted in the Taff Bargoed Joint Line. This opened on 10 January 1876 for goods and minerals from Taff Bargoed Junction, immediately west of Llancaiach station, to Dowlais. Passenger operation started on 1 February 1876.|$|R
50|$|This {{process was}} refined in the 18th century with the {{introduction}} of Benjamin Huntsman's crucible steel-making techniques, which added an additional three hours firing time and required additional large quantities of coke. In making crucible steel, the blister steel bars were broken into pieces and melted in small crucibles, each containing 20 kg or so. This produced higher quality crucible steel but increased the cost. The Bessemer process reduced the time needed to make steel of this quality to about half an hour while requiring only the coke needed initially to melt the pig iron. The earliest <b>Bessemer</b> converters produced <b>steel</b> for £7 a long ton, although it initially sold for around £40 a ton.|$|R
