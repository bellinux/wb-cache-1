The {{painting}} shows a room inside a shinden partitioned off by kichō room dividers featuring the design of decaying trees. Empress Shōshi, with the <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> is partially visible at the top. Court ladies are serving various types of ritual food.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E

Either he was drunk or he enjoyed killing civilians." [...] Abdul Samad, a 60-year-old farmer who lost eleven family members, eight of whom were children, spoke about the incident: [...] "I don't know why they killed them. Our government told us {{to come back to}} the village, and then they let the Americans kill us." [...] One grieving mother, holding a dead <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> said, [...] "They killed a child, was this child the Taliban?

500|$|Camila grows {{very ill}} {{and a boy}} is sent to inform Miguel Angel Face that her {{condition}} has worsened. He dresses quickly and rushes to the Two Step to see her. Eventually relieved of charges by the President, Fedina de Rodas is purchased by a brothel, {{and when it is}} discovered that she is holding her dead <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> she is placed in a hospital. Miguel Angel Face informs Major Farfan, who is {{in the service of the}} President, that there is a threat to his life. By this act saving a man in danger, Angel Face hopes [...] "God would grant him Camila's life in exchange". General Canales escapes into a village and, assisted by three sisters and a smuggler, crosses the frontier of the country after saving the sisters by killing a doctor who harassed them with the payment of an absurd debt.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{includes}} {{a host of}} minor characters who, in Richard Franklin's words, [...] "grope for the means to assert the validity of self and to anchor this individuality in a nightmare which constantly faces it with black nothingness". These characters range from Colonel José Parrales Sonriente, otherwise known as the [...] "man with the little mule", whose murder at the Cathedral Porch opens the novel, {{to a series of}} beggars, prisoners, minor officials, relatives, flatterers, barkeepers and prostitutes. Some of these are tragic figures, such as Fedina de Rodas, who readers see tortured and then sold to a brothel while she still clutches her dead <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> Others, however, provide comic relief. Sometimes they have colorful or playful names or nicknames, such as [...] "Flatfoot" [...] (a beggar), the [...] "Talking Cow" [...] (a woman who delivers a speech of praise to the President), or Doña Benjamin VenJamón, who, with her husband the puppet-master Don Benjamin, closes the novel with a lament for the demise of the Cathedral Porch.|$|E

No more need to reach for her purse and hunt for credit cards, no need to log into her laptop and try to recall the web address of the store she visited last week, and surely no need to find a babysitter to cover for her while she runs to the local store.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the renewal}} of the war with Poland, Gustavus Adolphus had to leave his wife again. It is likely that she gave way to hysterical grief, as we know she did in 1627, and it is {{probably}} {{for this reason that}} the king let his queen join him in Livonia after the Poles had been defeated in January 1626. By April, Maria Eleonora found she was again pregnant. No risks were taken this time and the astrologers predicted the birth of a son and heir. During a lull in the warfare, Gustavus Adolphus hurried back to Stockholm to await the arrival of the baby. The birth was a difficult one. On 7 December, a baby was born with a fleece (lanugo), which enveloped it from its head to its knees, leaving only its face, arms and lower part of its legs free. Moreover, it had a large nose and was covered with hair. Thus, it was assumed the baby was a boy, and so the King was told. Closer inspection, however, determined that the baby was a girl. Gustavus Adolphus' half-sister Catherine informed him that the child was a girl. She [...] "carried the <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> to the king in a condition for him to see and to know and realise for himself what she dared not tell him". Gustavus Adolphus remarked: [...] "She is going to be clever, for she has taken us all in." [...] His disappointment did not last long, and he decided that she would be called Christina after his mother. He gave orders for the birth to be announced with all the solemnity usually accorded to the arrival of a male heir. This seems to indicate that Gustavus Adolphus, at the age of 33, had little hope of having other children. Maria Eleonora's state of health seems to be the most likely explanation for this. Her later portraits and actions, however, do not indicate that she was physically fragile.|$|E

60|$|I {{was in the}} carrier's cart when I {{heard her}} calling to me. I looked out, and {{she stood at the}} garden-gate alone, holding <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> for me to see. It was cold still weather; and not a hair of her head, nor a fold of her dress, was stirred, as she looked intently at me, holding up her child.|$|R

60|$|So I lost her. So I saw her afterwards, in {{my sleep}} at school--a silent {{presence}} near my bed--looking at me with the same intent face--holding up her <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
60|$|Even {{though she}} knew not to what fate she was going, or how soon that fate might {{overtake}} her, still was she happy and thankful for the moment, however brief, that she might press <b>her</b> <b>baby</b> tightly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> She could scarce wait for {{the coming of the}} day that she might look again upon the bright face of her little, black-eyed Jack.|$|R

5000|$|The Derby War Memorial was {{designed}} by Charles Clayton Thompson and stands before the Derby Guildhall. It features a bronze figure of the Virgin Mary holding the <b>baby</b> Jesus <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> by the sculptor George Arthur Walker.

6000|$|Stead {{had heard}} quite {{enough to make}} him very uneasy, and wish to get home with his tidings to his father. There was a girl {{standing}} by with a <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and she asked: ...|$|E
60|$|But Bell {{thought the}} {{occasion}} required milk, {{and there was}} none in the kitchen. She {{went out to the}} byre, still with the <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and saw Sanders Elshioner sitting gloomily on the pigsty.|$|E
60|$|The pony made short {{work of the}} {{remaining}} loaves, which she devoured with great zest. As Hilda had predicted, they seemed to hearten her. The food and drink, with {{a bucket of water}} dashed on her hoofs, gave her new vigour like wine. We gulped down our eggs in silence. Then I held Hilda's bicycle. She vaulted lightly on to the seat, white and tired as she was, with the <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> left <b>arm,</b> and <b>her</b> right hand on the handle-bar.|$|R
50|$|In another {{image from}} Satna, Vinayaki is one among five theriocephalic goddesses. The central figure, the cow-headed yogini, Vrishabha, holds the <b>baby</b> Ganesha <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> Vinayaki, a minor figure, is pot-bellied and carries an ankusha (elephant goad) like Ganesha. In this configuration, Vrishabha may be {{considered}} as a mother of Ganesha and other goddesses, thus signifying a sibling relationship between Vinayaki and Ganesha. Another interpretation suggests that all the female deities, including Vinayaki, are mothers of the infant god.|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} be happy, however, till she had made Mr. Arabin take the child to himself and thus, as it were, adopt him as his own. The moment the idea struck her she took the <b>baby</b> up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and, opening <b>her</b> door, ran quickly down to the drawing-room. She at once found, by his step still pacing on the floor, that he was there, and a glance within the room {{told her that he}} was alone. She hesitated a moment and then hurried <b>in</b> with <b>her</b> {{precious}} charge.|$|R
