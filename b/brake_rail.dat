40|$|Abstract. Magnetic track brake is a {{new kind}} of <b>rail</b> transit vehicle <b>braking</b> mode, this paper {{introduces}} its composition, structure, working principle and braking control methods, and analyzes its application. 1 Concept and classification of magnetic track brake The force which slowing down or stopping the train, keeping the train speed stability when downhill driving, making the train stopped in place even on the slopes is known as brake. The way using electromagnetic effect for braking, is known as the electromagnetic brake. According to the application of electromagnetic <b>brake</b> implementation on <b>rail</b> transit vehicle, there are two main types: electromagnetic <b>rail</b> <b>brake</b> and electromagnetic eddy current <b>brake.</b> Electromagnetic <b>rail</b> <b>brake</b> (also called magnetic track brake) is a kind of contact friction braking, basing on the wheel/rail adhesion. The electromagnetic force sucks the magnetic track brake which mounted on bogie and rail. Through the device {{at the bottom of the}} magnetic rail wear, the sliding friction between the plate and rails, train the kinetic energy into heat energy and make it escape into the atmosphere, so as to realize the train slowing down or stop. We divided magnetic track brake into electromagnetic track brake and magnetic track brake wit...|$|R
50|$|Each coach {{rests on}} two twin-axle bogies. Only the bogie at the {{close-coupled}} {{end of the}} coach is driven. Power transmission from the motor is achieved using a Voith hydrodynamic transmission system with a converter (Wandler) and a T 311r coupling. Up to Class 628, a T 320 double-converter transmission was used. Motor and transmission are suspended elastically under the lightweight coach body. The operating brake is an automatic compressed air KE disc brake with automatic load braking and electronic anti-skid protection. In addition, for rapid <b>braking,</b> electromagnetic <b>rail</b> <b>brakes</b> are used; these can also be activated separately if required.|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} rail vehicles, {{such as the}} "Adler", a {{mechanical}} screw brake on the tender was enough in 1835 to slow the train down safely from its permitted speed of 28 km/h. More than 100 years later, in addition to mechanical pneumatic <b>braking</b> systems, electro-magnetic <b>rail</b> <b>brakes</b> were already being used {{in order to bring}} the streamlined motor coach, the DRG 137 of the Cologne design, from a speed of 160 km/h to a stop over a distance of 800 metres.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{fail-safe}} systems is the overflow tube in baths and kitchen sinks. If the valve sticks open, rather than causing an overflow and damage, the tank spills into an overflow. Another common example is that in an elevator the cable supporting the car keeps spring-loaded brakes open. If the cable breaks, the <b>brakes</b> grab <b>rails,</b> and the elevator cabin does not fall.|$|R

50|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of the moving vehicle is {{converted}} to heat by the eddy current flowing through the electrical resistance of the rail, {{which leads to a}} warming of the rail. An advantage of the linear brake is that since each section of rail passes only once through the magnetic field of the brake, in contrast to the disk brake in which each section of the disk passes repeatedly through the <b>brake,</b> the <b>rail</b> doesn't get as hot as a disk, so the linear brake can dissipate more energy and have a higher power rating than disk brakes.|$|R

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking has {{previously}} been developed for use in calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel. Heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is accounted for. The thermal model was calibrated using results from both standard brake rig tests and tests when a “rail-wheel” {{was introduced in the}} rig. Furthermore, the model was successfully calibrated using results from field studies. In the present work, the thermal model is utilised to study temperatures and partitioning of heating power during different braking set-ups and braking loads. First, the influences from geometrical changes are studied, with parameters such as wheel design, wheel wear and block wear. Also the effect of brake block configuration is studied. Second, the influence from brake block material is considered. Third, the influences from braking parameters are studied. Gradient braking on mountain descents is simulated but also the related case of brake system malfunctioning. Stop braking is studied. Fourth, the importance of rail chill is investigated with respect to shape and size of the contact patch between wheel and rail. A general result from the present parametric study is that rail chill is important for a useful simulation of wheel temperatures and heat partitioning at drag <b>braking.</b> <b>Rail</b> chill consumes a considerable part of the total heat at drag braking and it becomes increasingly important as the tread temperature rises. For example, {{at the end of a}} brake cycle at 30 kW per wheel for 30 min with composition brake blocks using a 920 mm wheel, 21 % of the total heat enters the rail...|$|R
