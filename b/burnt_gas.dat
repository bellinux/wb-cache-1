40|$|Recirculating <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> {{exist in}} most {{combustion}} systems, {{they play a}} non negligible role in gas turbines, car engines and furnaces. In gas turbine combustion chambers, <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> are useful at two subsequent levels. Hot recirculating combustion products contribute to flame stabilization downstream of the swirled injection and they are also useful to dilute the reaction zones to help homogenizing temperature. In car engines, EGR (Engine Gas Recirculation) is widely adopted and is seen {{as one of the}} promising approach to achieve a careful control of the ignition process in the quest for reliable HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) engines. There, the detail of the chemical composition of the residual <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> is of importance to monitor auto-ignition. <b>Burnt</b> <b>gases</b> present in furnaces contribute to flame stability. When dilution by <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> reaches a sufficiently high level, the MILD (Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution) or the Flameless regimes are observed. In this last case, the high dilution by <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> leads to a strong decrease of temperature gradients, combustion then occurs in a regime that is accompanied by a drastic reduction of NOx emission. Accordingly, there exists almost no practical combustion systems where recirculating <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> are not intimately involved in the process. They therefore control part of the behavior of the turbulent reaction zones. The accurate control of recirculating hot products is now the main target of many design studies devoted to real combustion chambers. Nevertheless, so far, only few studies have discussed dilution by <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> in the context of turbulent combustion modeling. The objective {{of this paper is to}} start addressing some aspects of the numerical modeling of flame dilution by <b>burnt</b> <b>gases.</b> The impact of burnt products on the chemical structure of oxy-flames is first investigated. Prototype laminar premixed flames are simulated using detailed chemistry to seek out the major modifications observed when fresh reactants are mixed with burnt products, whose temperature may vary. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of flames propagating in a rotating flows are then reported. The results are used to analyze the structure of the leading edge flame that ensures flame stabilization. The impact of <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> on flame propagation is isolated and it is found that hot products strongly modify the vorticity field to enhance the flame displacement velocity...|$|R

The furnace was operated with Dutch natural gas (DNG) at 10 kW and at an equivalence ratio of 0. 8. OH∗chemiluminescence images {{were taken to}} characterize the reaction zone. The chemiluminescence intensity is relatively low compared to conventional flames and relatively uniformly distributed in the reaction zone due to the dilution effects of recirculated <b>burnt</b> <b>gases.</b> Visible flames were not observed. To characterize the dilution effects of <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> on reactions, flamelets generated with diluted fuel and diluted air, instead of flamelets based on pure fuel and air, were applied in an extended Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) approach. <b>Burnt</b> <b>gases</b> at stoichiometric mixture fraction rather than those at global equivalence ratio were considered as diluent, which is more appropriate for furnaces operating at lean condition.

The damper should have remained slightly open to allow <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> from the fire to escape up the chimney. It was supposed that the damper had been closed fully and partial combustion had occurred effectively generating town gas ("acting as a retort"). The gas eventually escaped and the resultant explosion caused major damage to the boiler and flue.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{efficiency}} can {{be achieved}} in longer barrel firearms because they have better volume ratio. However, the efficiency gain is less than corresponding to the volume ratio, because the expansion is not truly adiabatic and <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> becomes cold faster because of exchange of heat with the barrel. Large firearms (such as cannons) achieve smaller barrel-heating loss because they have better volume-to-surface ratio.High barrel diameter is also helpful because lower barrel friction is induced by sealing compared to the accelerating force. The force {{is proportional to the}} square of the barrel diameter while sealing needs are proportional to the perimeter by the same pressure.|$|E

In the presence of firedamp the flame intensifies. The flame must be kept fairly high in normal use, a small flame permits the enclosed space to fill with firedamp/air mixture and the subsequent detonation may pass through the gauze.

40|$|Premixed laminar {{combustion}} {{in closed}} vessels {{has been widely}} used for the determination of laminar burning velocities. A novel multiple <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> zone model has been developed to describe the different aspects of premixed laminar combustion in a closed spherical vessel. The mixture is divided into burnt and unburnt gases with the flame front as a discontinuity. Unburnt gases {{are assumed to be}} in a frozen chemical state. However, burnt gases are divided into a number of <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> zones. For the methane–air mixture the model is used to determine the temperature distribution within the <b>burnt</b> <b>gas,</b> the relationship between the pressure rise and mass fraction burnt, the variation of the combustion products with temperature and pressure, the spatial distribution of the gas density, the influence of elevated initial temperature, pressure and molecular structure. This computation allows for the variation in heat capacity of the constituents, and solves the equilibrium combustion equation for the ten major species (N 2, O 2, H 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, O, H, NO, OH).

Flames provide a convenient system in which to study the kinetics of high temperature gas reactions because wall reactions are absent and the relatively high linear velocities enables quite rapid reactions to be followed; e. g. radical recombination reactions at atmospheric pressure.

40|$|Abstract: A {{thermochemical}} {{model was}} newly {{proposed in the}} present study. The proposed model was developed to maintain an accuracy for detonation simulations with the detailed chemical reaction model under thermally perfect gas condition and to reduce computational load. The proposed model consists of three gas components, which are premixed detonable gas, <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> and inert gas. For chemical reactions, it is considered that premixed detonable gas reacts to <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> under the one-step irreversible chemical reactions. The thermodynamic data for premixed detonable gas and inert gas follow the enthalpy changes of the mixture as thermally perfect gas, and {{it is assumed that}} the <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> is isentropically expanded. In the present study, single-cycle and multiple-cycle operations of one-dimensional and two-dimensional single-tube Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) were investigated with the proposed model. For one-dimensional simulations of single-tube, single-cycle PDE, advantages of the proposed model compared with some other models were shown using pressure and temperature profiles at the closed and open ends of the tube. Furthermore, two-dimensional simulations of single-tube, multiple-cycle PDE were carried out to investigate the spatial distributions and histories of the thermodynamic properties with the proposed and the detailed models. The spatial distributions and histories of the thermodynamic properties of the proposed model were in good agreement with those of the detailed model. The proposed model dramatically reduced the CPU time required for simulation to about 9 % for one-dimensional analysis and 14 % for two-dimensional analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{stationary}} upward {{propagation of}} a very lean methane/air flame in a long vertical tube open {{at the bottom and}} closed at the top is simulated numerically using a single overall chemical reaction to model combustion and assuming an optically thin gas and a transparent or non-reflecting tube wall to approximately account for radiation losses from CO 2 CO 2 and H 2 OH 2 O. Buoyancy plays a dominant role in the propagation of these flames and causes a large region of low velocity of the <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> relative to the flame to appear below the flame front when the equivalence ratio is decreased. The size of this region scales with the radius of the tube, and its presence enhances the effect of radiation losses, which would be otherwise negligible for a standard flammability tube, given the small concentration of radiating species. Heat conduction is found to be important in the low velocity region and to lead to a conduction flux from the flame to the <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> that causes extinction at the flame tip for a value of the equivalence ratio near the flammability limit experimentally measured in the standard tube. The effect of radiation losses decreases with the radius of the tube. Numerical results and order-of-magnitude estimates show that, in the absence of radiation, a very lean flame front fails to propagate only after recirculation of the <b>burnt</b> <b>gas</b> extends to its reaction region and drastically changes its structure. This condition is not realized for the standard flammability tube, but it seems to account for the flammability limit measured in a tube of about half the radius of the standard tube...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{new model}} for Flameless Combustion (FC) {{based on the}} {{tabulation}} of diluted homogeneous reactors (DHR) is presented. This model is developed within the Large Eddy Simulations (LES) approach because LES has a good potential for correctly predicting the ternary mixing of FC. In DHR, a ternary mixture of fuel, air and <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> at equilibrium is considered as an initial condition for the reactor calculations. The auto-ignition of this mixture is then tabulated {{as a function of}} the input parameters which are mixture fraction, fresh gases temperature, dilution fraction, progress variable and enthalpy loss. The enthalpy loss is introduced by decreasing the temperature of the diluting <b>burnt</b> <b>gases.</b> The DHR model is first evaluated over the partially premixed Sandia Flame D. Correct results are obtained for this flame, although CO is overestimated by the model. This discrepancy is attributed to the usage of homogeneous reactors which impedes to account for the influence of scalar dissipation. Secondly, the flameless configuration of Verissimo et al., characterized by a strong enthalpy loss due to wall heat losses, is used to assess the performance of the model. Combustion results are found in correct agreement for temperature and major species. The largest discrepancies are found for CO again, although the axial shape for this species is correctly predicted...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instability}} analysis {{behind the}} Darrieus-Landau instability [...] considers a planar, premixed flame front subjected to very small perturbations. It {{is useful to}} think of this arrangement as one in which the unperturbed flame is stationary, with the reactants (fuel and oxidizer) directed towards the flame and perpendicular to it with a velocity u1, and the <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> leaving the flame also in a perpendicular way but with velocity u2. The analysis assumes that the flow is an incompressible flow, and that the perturbations are governed by the linearized Euler equations and, thus, are inviscid. With these considerations, the main result of this analysis is that, if the density of the <b>burnt</b> <b>gases</b> is less than that of the reactants, which is the case in practice due to the thermal expansion of the gas produced by the combustion process, the flame front is unstable to perturbations of any wavelength. Another result is that the rate of growth of the perturbations is inversely proportional to their wavelength; thus small flame wrinkles (but larger than the characteristic flame thickness) grow faster than larger ones. In practice, however, various diffusive mechanisms that are not taken into account by the analysis of Darrieus and Landau stabilize the flame.|$|R
