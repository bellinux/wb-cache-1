5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have special requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned. Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (or general ledger), nonprofits can {{have more than one}} general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E
5|$|With {{national}} stability secured, Richard began {{negotiating a}} permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded {{the territory of}} Aquitaine possessed by the English crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay homage to the King of Francea condition that proved unacceptable to the English public. Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years. As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry Isabella, daughter of Charles VI of France, when she came of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular because the princess was then only six years old, and thus would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> an {{heir to the throne}} of England for many years.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to {{the recovery of the}} species.|$|E

25|$|Detection (often called extraction) is an {{algorithm}} {{which is}} applied to the attacked signal to attempt to extract the watermark from it. If the signal was unmodified during transmission, then the watermark still is present and it may be extracted. In robust digital watermarking applications, the extraction algorithm should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the watermark correctly, even if the modifications were strong. In fragile digital watermarking, the extraction algorithm should fail if any change is made to the signal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of an {{accident}} (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station. Furthermore, ITER's type of fusion power has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary {{for the construction of a}} weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO2, SO2, or NOx by-products are produced).|$|E
25|$|With a {{contract}} signed in 1991, AECL, {{in partnership with}} MDS Nordion, began construction of the MAPLE dedicated isotope-production facility.

Each reactor is designed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> at least 100% of the world's medical isotopes, meaning that the second reactor {{will be used as}} a back-up to ensure an uninterruptible supply.

25|$|For {{the most}} part {{advances}} in crusher design have moved slowly. Jaw crushers have remained virtually unchanged for sixty years. More reliability and higher production {{have been added to}} basic cone crusher designs that have also remained largely unchanged. Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation. For instance, a 48-inch (120cm) cone crusher manufactured in 1960 may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> 170 tons/h of crushed rock, whereas the same size crusher manufactured today may produce 300 tons/h. These production improvements come from speed increases and better crushing chamber designs.|$|E
25|$|In the {{examples}} used the frequency used is 110 beats/s, {{which is the}} typical frequency found in insects. Butterflies have a much slower frequency with about 10 beats/s, {{which means that they}} can't hover. Other insects may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a frequency of 1000 beats/s. To restore the insect to its original vertical position, the average upward force during the downward stroke, Fav, must be equal to twice the weight of the insect. Note that since the upward force on the insect body is applied only for half the time, the average upward force on the insect is simply its weight.|$|E
25|$|However, {{most of the}} {{criticism}} of the agreement has focused on its potential impact on Peru's agricultural sector. By planting crops to similar to those subsidized by the U.S., Peru faced a competitive disadvantage {{in the production of}} agricultural products because poor farming families with inadequate tools, technology and techniques may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> crops at low enough prices to export. In response to these concerns, Peruvian lawmakers created a Compensation Fund which directed $34 million per year to cotton, maize/corn, and wheat producers for a five-year period to help them adjust to the new competitive pressures.|$|E
