40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{wireless}} coverage in <b>bounded</b> <b>areas.</b> Coverage {{is one of the}} fundamental requirements of wireless networks. There has been considerable research on optimal coverage of infinitely large areas. However, in the real world, the deployment areas of wireless networks are always geographically bounded. It is a much more challenging and significant problem to find optimal deployment patterns to cover <b>bounded</b> <b>areas.</b> In this paper, we approach this problem starting from the development of tight lower bounds on the number of nodes needed to cover a bounded area. Then we design several deployment patterns for different kinds of convex and concave shapes such as rectangles and L-shapes. These patterns require only few more nodes than the theoretical lower bound, and can achieve efficient coverage. We have also carefully addressed and evaluated practical conditions such as coverage modeling and connectivity regarding our deployment patterns...|$|E

Using the similarity between the averaged SP for locally constant randomized Parisi matrices and the partition function of directed polymers on disordered trees, we show that for times t>t_ cr (where t_ cr is some critical time) a "lacunary" structure of the ultrametric space occurs with the probability 1 - const/t. This means that the escape from some <b>bounded</b> <b>areas</b> of the ultrametric space of states is locked and the kinetics is confined in these areas for infinitely long time.

40|$|Abstract — In present {{scenario}} of research, network congestion {{is one of}} the most interesting area. Congestion in internet is a long-standing problem and in modern days internet service providers use congestion control and congestion avoidance techniques to avoid congestion collapse. Internet congestion appears when a large volume of data is being routed on low bandwidth lines or across networks that have high latency and cannot handle large volumes. Due to such heavy load on network, disconnectivity appears and internet traffic share of operators fluctuate. Naldi (2002) explored a model based on Internet Traffic Share problem between comparative operators mode. The basic idea of Naldi (2002) was extended by Thakur and Shukla (2010) in which disconnectivity factor was introduced and mathematical relationship of traffic share and network blocking probability with special reference for disconnectivity factor was examined. This relationship originates probability based quadratic function which has a definite <b>bounded</b> <b>area.</b> This area contains many network parameters and to assess various properties of internet traffic it is necessary to estimate. The aim of this paper is to develop an appropriate approach for estimation of such kind of <b>bounded</b> <b>area</b> by using Simpson 1 / 3 rule usually applied in numerical quadrature. It is found that probability of disconnectivity (i. e. S 1 and S 2) is directly proportional to <b>bounded</b> <b>area.</b> This study is an attempt to establish the relationship among internet traffic share status and network disconnectivity parameters. Graphical study is also performed to support for numerical facts...|$|R

40|$|Heuristics {{used for}} solving hard {{real-time}} search problems have regions with depressions. Such regions are <b>bounded</b> <b>areas</b> {{of the search}} space in which the heuristic function is exceedingly low compared to the actual cost to reach a solution. Real-time search algorithms easily become trapped in those regions since the heuristic values of states in them {{may need to be}} updated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-theart real-time search algorithms like LSS-LRTA∗, LRTA∗ (k), etc., improve LRTA∗’s mechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those algorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding or escaping depressed regions. This paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a heuristic depression. We apply the principle to LSS-LRTA ∗ producing aLSS-LRTA∗, a new real-time search algorithm whose search is guided towards exiting regions with heuristic depressions. We show our algorithm outperforms LSS-LRTA∗ in standard real-time benchmarks. In addition we prove aLSS-LRTA∗ has most of the good theoretical properties of LSS-LRTA∗...|$|E
