After recalling briefly the results before 1959, sets with positive reach and their associated curvature measures are introduced. We develop an integral and current representation of these curvature measures and show how the current representation helps to prove integralgeometric formulas, such as the principal kinematic formula.

These <b>block</b> and <b>random</b> copolymers {{were designed to}} have similar molecular weights and comonomer ratios; both types of copolymers showed thermosensitivity in aqueous solutions with similar cloud points. The copolymers self-assembled into micelles in water as shown by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron micros-copy. The hydrodynamic diameter of the micelles formed by the block copolymer is much larger and exhibited a broad and gradual shrinkage from 20 to 54 °C below its cloud point, while the micelles formed by the random copolymers are smaller in size but exhibited some swelling in the same temperature range. Based on in vitro drug release studies, 78 % and 24 % paclitaxel (PTX) were released in 24 h from micelles self-assembled by the <b>block</b> and <b>random</b> copolymers, respectively.

Several discoveries, including the occurrence of entirely new genes in unexpected life forms without any precursors, and the <b>random</b> <b>mosaic</b> distribution of genes across organisms in higher taxa undermine the principal assertions of this theory. We present {{a new model of}} the pre-biotic parallel evolution of eukaryotic genomes starting with the structurally complex split genes, which are far more probable of supporting biological information and of occurring in random DNA sequences than contiguous genes. By comparing the mosaic patterns of simulated genomes and extant genomes, we show that genomes arising from simulated assembly of random split genes form the same gene distribution patterns observed in extant eukaryotes. This parallel genome origin model eliminates the post-genomic and classical conundrums faced by the linear branching evolution model. |$|R

In the fly eye, the <b>random</b> <b>mosaic</b> of color-detecting R 7 photoreceptor subtypes is determined by stochastic ON/OFF expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss). In a genome-wide association study, we identified a naturally occurring insertion in a regulatory DNA element in ss that lowers the ratio of SsON to SsOFF cells. This change in photoreceptor fates shifts the innate color preference of flies from green to blue. The genetic variant increases the binding affinity for Klumpfuss (Klu), a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that regulates ss expression. Klu is expressed at intermediate levels to determine the normal ratio of SsON to SsOFF cells. Thus, binding site affinity and transcription factor levels are finely tuned to regulate stochastic expression, setting the ratio of alternative fates and ultimately determining color preference...|$|R
