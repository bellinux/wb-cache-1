5|$|Mind of a Man is a {{game show}} {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network, with DeRay Davis as host. On each episode, two female contestants attempt {{to figure out what}} men <b>believe</b> <b>about</b> marriage, dating, work, and other subjects. Similar to Family Feud, the questions have previously been answered by a survey of one hundred men. Over the course of four rounds, a celebrity panel consisting of two men and a woman helps the contestants by offering their opinions about the correct answers to the surveys. The winner advances to the bonus round, which features a top prize of $10,000.|$|E
25|$|She {{promoted}} {{the idea that}} ancient societies exhibited a unity of science and religion that humanity has since lost, with their achievements and knowledge being far in excess of what modern scholars <b>believe</b> <b>about</b> them. Blavatsky also taught that a secret brotherhood has conserved this ancient wisdom religion throughout the centuries, and that members of this fraternity {{hold the key to}} understanding miracles, the afterlife, and psychic phenomena, and that moreover these adepts themselves have paranormal powers.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I <b>believe,</b> <b>about</b> thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. I admire his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E

25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but also what people B, irrationally <b>believe</b> <b>about</b> the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E
500|$|While free on bail, Vicious smashed a {{beer mug}} {{in the face}} of Todd Smith, Patti Smith's brother, and was arrested again on an assault charge. On 9 December 1978 he was sent to Rikers Island jail, where he spent 55 days and {{underwent}} enforced cold-turkey detox. He was released on 1 February 1979; sometime after midnight, following a small party to celebrate his release, Vicious died of a heroin overdose, aged 21. Reflecting on the event, Lydon said, [...] "Poor Sid. The only way he could live up to what he wanted everyone to <b>believe</b> <b>about</b> him was to die. That was tragic, but more for Sid than anyone else. He really bought his public image." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his review, Roger Ebert {{defended the}} artistic license of Russian roulette, arguing [...] "it is the {{organizing}} {{symbol of the}} film: Anything you can <b>believe</b> <b>about</b> the game, about its deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply to the war as a whole. It is a brilliant symbol because, {{in the context of}} this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Insight 1 – People {{seeing and}} {{accepting}} {{the reality that}} their emotional disturbances at point C are only partially caused by the activating events or adversities at point A that precede C. Although A contributes to C, and although disturbed Cs (such as feelings of panic and depression) {{are much more likely}} to follow strong negative As (such as being assaulted or raped), than they are to follow weak As (such as being disliked by a stranger), the main or more direct cores of extreme and dysfunctional emotional disturbances (Cs) are people’s irrational beliefs — the [...] "absolutistic" [...] (inflexible) [...] "musts" [...] and their accompanying inferences and attributions that people strongly <b>believe</b> <b>about</b> the activating event.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, at the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, Hynek {{presented}} his thoughts {{in his speech}} [...] "What I Really <b>Believe</b> <b>About</b> UFOs". [...] "I do believe", he said, [...] "that the UFO phenomenon {{as a whole is}} real, but I do not mean necessarily that it's just one thing. We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate in the atmosphere", or whether they differ [...] "as a rain shower differs from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower." [...] We must not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.|$|E
40|$|Both Fyodor Dostoevsky and Flannery O’Connor {{used the}} {{grotesque}} to portray their beliefs about human nature. Both believed that mystery {{is a crucial}} element of truth and humanity’s understanding is limited. Although they employed the grotesque differently, the similarities of their style stem from the similarities of their beliefs. O’Connor often referred to Dostoevsky’s artistry and his theology, and she was influenced by both. A comparison of Ivan Karamazov in Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov and Hazel Motes in O’Connor’s Wise Blood reveals the similarities in what each author <b>believed</b> <b>about</b> humanity’s capability to understand truth. What both authors <b>believed</b> <b>about</b> human nature, and the limitations of every aspect of humanity, particularly human reason, led to {{their use of the}} grotesque...|$|R

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} speech MSNBC host Chris Matthews admitted, [...] "I {{have to tell}} you, a little chill in my legs right now. That is an amazing moment in history right there. It is surely an amazing moment. A keynoter like I have never heard." [...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the first black {{president}} there. And the reason I say that is because I think the immigrant experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama <b>believe</b> <b>about</b> this war?" [...] On PBS, columnist David Brooks responded positively, [...] "This is why you go to conventions, to watch a speech like this," [...] while Mark Shields said, [...] "A star is born." ...|$|E
