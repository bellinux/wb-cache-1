5000|$|One way {{to create}} a dual band <b>blade</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is to create a}} slot in a <b>blade</b> <b>antenna</b> that is less than or on the order of [...] so that the lower {{frequency}} does not 'see' the slot (it is a rule of thumb that the perturbation created by a discontinuity less than [...] on a structure is negligible).|$|E

50|$|A <b>blade</b> <b>antenna</b> is {{an attempt}} to create a broader band {{monopole}} (when compared to a thin wire monopole). Most blade antennas are trapezoidal in shape. Variations have been made on this shape for aerodynamic purposes and notches have been introduced in order to achieve a better broad band performance. This type of monopole antenna is generally used in aviation for VHF and UHF frequency range.|$|E
5000|$|Under the [...] "BIG SAFARI" [...] program name, RC-135Vs were {{upgraded}} {{from the}} RC-135C [...] "Big Team" [...] configuration. RC-135Ws were originally delivered as C-135B transports, and most were modified from RC-135Ms. This {{is the only}} difference between the V and W variants; both carry the same mission equipment. For many years, the RC-135V/W could be identified by the four large disc-capped MUCELS antennas forward, four somewhat smaller <b>blade</b> <b>antennae</b> aft and myriad of smaller underside antennas. Baseline 8 Rivet Joints (in the 2000s) introduced the first major change to the external RC-135V/W configuration replacing the MUCELS <b>antennas</b> with plain <b>blade</b> <b>antennas.</b> The configuration of smaller underside antennas was also changed significantly.|$|R

50|$|By the {{preceding}} section, {{it is seen}} that a dual band <b>blade</b> <b>antenna</b> can be polarity diverse as well as dual band.

50|$|An {{electronic}} reconnaissance {{variant of}} the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept <b>blade</b> <b>antenna</b> on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.|$|E

50|$|As of 2014 the Polish Air Force was {{planning}} to retain the Su-22s in service. It is hoped that this decision will {{have a positive impact}} on Polish industry, as the WZL nr 2 repair facility in Bydgoszcz will maintain the remaining aircraft under contract to the Air Force. The decision would also allow the Air Force to retain the well-trained ground crews and pilots, currently operating the machines. The Poles consider the Su-22 easier to maintain and repair than the other main combat aircraft types currently in Polish service (mainly the MiG-29 and the F-16). They also suffer from fewer malfunctions and other problems (high, 70-75% non-error index). It is also the only plane in Polish inventory equipped for electronic intelligence, warfare, and support of ground systems. The Polish Air Force has retained a large stockpile of air-to-ground weapons for use with the Su-22. By some estimates, the cost of destroying these resources would be higher than the projected cost of continuing Su-22 operations. It was decided, that starting from 2015, only 12 Su-22M4 and 4-6 Su-22UM3K out of 32 remaining would undergo a refit, increasing their lifespan for another ten years. For economical reasons the aircraft are not modernized, apart from fitting an additional radio RS-6113-2 C2M with a <b>blade</b> <b>antenna</b> on the top, but they receive a new grey multishade camouflage, similar to other Polish aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ground plane}} {{used with a}} {{monopole}} may be the actual earth; {{in this case the}} antenna is mounted on the ground and one side of the feedline is connected to an earth ground {{at the base of the}} antenna. This design is used for the mast radiator antennas employed in radio broadcasting at low frequencies, as well as other low frequency antennas such as the T-antenna and umbrella antenna. At VHF and UHF frequencies the size of the ground plane needed is smaller, so artificial ground planes are used to allow the antenna to be mounted above the ground. A common type of monopole antenna at these frequencies consists of a quarter-wave whip antenna with a ground plane consisting of several wires or rods radiating horizontally or diagonally from its base; this is called a ground-plane antenna. At gigahertz frequencies the metal surface of a car roof or airplane body makes a good ground plane, so car cell phone antennas consist of short whips mounted on the roof, and aircraft communication antennas frequently consist of a short conductor in an aerodynamic fairing projecting from the fuselage; this is called a <b>blade</b> <b>antenna.</b> [...] The most common antenna used in mobile phones is the inverted-F antenna, which is a variant of the inverted-L monopole. Bending over the antenna saves space and keeps the it within the bounds of the mobile's case but the antenna then has a very low impedance. To improve the match the antenna is not fed from the end, rather some intermediate point, and the end is grounded instead. The quarter-wave whip and rubber ducky antennas used with handheld radios such as walkie-talkies and cell phones are also monopole antennas. These don't use a ground plane, and the ground side of the transmitter is just connected to the ground connection on its circuit board. The hand and body of the person holding them may function as a rudimentary ground plane.|$|E

It describes the concept {{as well as}} the first realization of the newly developed system. Furthermore it presents the results of on-ground tests conducted on a turn-table with the system installed into a mock-up of a rocket section. The promising outcome of these tests justified the subsequent preparation of a flight experiment. In the second part of this paper, the results of the maiden flight of the IGAS system onboard a real sounding rocket, the Rexus- 4 vehicle, are summarised and discussed. The qualification flight has demonstrated that the system, in general, performs well and even outperforms the traditionally used combination of tip and <b>blade</b> <b>antennas.</b> However, it has also been recognized, that further adaptations in the GPS receiver software...|$|R
40|$|The design goal is {{to develop}} a 118 - 157 MHz, {{vertically}} polarized, low-profile (or conformal) antenna as a replacement for VHF AM <b>blade</b> <b>antennas</b> on aircraft. This design is to be arrived at by scaling the dimensions of an antenna designed for a center frequency of 1. 1 GHz. The design prior to scaling may have the following maximum dimensions: diameter less than 3. 70 in. and thickness less than 0. 50 in. Although a four-arm spiral design was originally suggested, a two-arm spiral may also be used, as both mode- 1 and mode- 2 (sum and difference) radiation patterns aren't required. While a four-arm spiral can easily be designed should both sum and difference patterns be required, the two-arm design will provide the required sum pattern and simplify the design problem somewhat: only one feed is required, and the feed area geometry is more straightforward. Polarization requirements dictate that a slot spiral be used, as opposed to a wire spiral. Two similar radiating structures were considered. The first is the standard archimedean spiral antenna. The second is a hollow archimedean spiral antenna, essentially a standard archimedean spiral with the inner portion removed...|$|R
40|$|In {{preparation}} for the European Space Agency Maxus- 4 mission, a sounding rocket test flight was carried out at Esrange, near Kiruna, Sweden on February 19, 2001 to validate existing ground facilities and range safety installations. Due {{to the absence of}} a dedicated scientific payload, the flight offered the opportunity to test multiple GPS receivers and assess their performance for the tracking of sounding rockets. The receivers included an Ashtech G 12 HDMA receiver, a BAE (Canadian Marconi) Allstar receiver and a Mitel Orion receiver. All of them provide C/A code tracking on the L 1 frequency to determine the user position and make use of Doppler measurements to derive the instantaneous velocity. Among the receivers, the G 12 has been optimized for use under highly dynamic conditions and has earlier been flown successfully on NASA sounding rockets. The Allstar is representative of common single frequency receivers for terrestrial applications and received no particular modification, except for the disabling of the common altitude and velocity constraints that would otherwise inhibit its use for space application. The Orion receiver, finally, employs the same Mitel chipset as the Allstar, but has received various firmware modifications by DLR to safeguard it against signal losses and improve its tracking performance. While the two NASA receivers were driven by a common wrap-around antenna, the DLR experiment made use of a switchable antenna system comprising a helical antenna in the tip of the rocket and two <b>blade</b> <b>antennas</b> attached to the body of the vehicle. During the boost a peak acceleration of roughly l 7 g's was achieved which resulted in a velocity of about 1100 m/s {{at the end of the}} burn.

Next, the main communications area of the antenna is determined by considering a flight scenario, and then the minimum gain requirements of the antenna are derived in the operating frequency band.

40|$|Foreground {{subtraction}} {{in global}} redshifted 21 cm measurements {{is limited by}} frequency-dependent (chromatic) structure in antenna beam patterns. Chromatic beams couple angular structures in Galactic foreground emission to spectral structures {{that may not be}} removed by smooth functional forms. We report results for simulations based on two dipole antennas used by the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES). The residual levels in simulated foreground-subtracted spectra are found to differ substantially between the two antennas, suggesting that antenna design must be carefully considered. Residuals are also highly dependent on the right ascension and declination of the antenna pointing, with RMS values differing by as much as a factor of 20 across pointings. For EDGES and other ground-based experiments with zenith pointing antennas, right ascension and declination correspond directly to the local sidereal time and the latitude of the deployment site, hence chromatic beam effects should be taken into account when selecting sites. We introduce the "blade" dipole antenna and show, via simulations, that it has better chromatic performance than the "fourpoint" antenna previously used for EDGES. The <b>blade</b> <b>antenna</b> yields 1 - 5 ~mK residuals across the entire sky after a 5 -term polynomial is removed from simulated spectra, whereas the fourpoint antenna typically requires a 6 -term polynomial for comparable residuals. For both antennas, the signal-to-noise ratio of recovered 21 cm input signals peaks for a 5 -term polynomial foreground fit given realistic thermal noise levels. Comment: 12 pages. 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of two TCAS systems is {{studied in the}} presence of electromagnetic scatterers. TCAS is an aircraft mounted angle of arrival (AOA) system, which estimates the bearing of a signal transmitted from a mode-S transponder on another nearby aircraft (intruder). Two systems are studied: (1) Comparison of Relative Amplitude system (CRA), and (2) Spiral Phase Antenna (SPA). The CRA antenna receives the reply via four switched beams. The bearing is estimated by comparing the amplitudes of the received signal. The SPA is based on the phase interferometer, which utilizes the received phase via sum and difference beams. The AOA is computed by comparing the reply with similar values on a calibration table, which is generated by modeling the TCAS antenna on the bare fuselage of a Boeing 727 - 200. The antenna patterns for the TCAS are found via high frequency methods based on the Uniform Geometric theory of Diffraction (UTD). By minimizing the standard deviation of the bearing error in a specified angular sector, optimal locations for top and bottom mounted TCAS antennas are found on the Boeing 727 - 200, 737 - 300 and 747 - 200 airframes. It will be shown that the overall bearing errors of the amplitude system are consistently smaller than the spiral phase TCAS. The effect of two types of nearby scatterers [...] antennas, and engine inlets [...] is studied. The AT 741 L-band blade, DMC 60 - 1 VHF Communication antenna were chosen as being representative antenna interference examples. Models are derived for the blades via a moment method analysis followed by a least squares procedure to synthesize the scattering patterns. Studies were conducted to estimate the minimum separation between the two antennas for acceptable operation. It will be shown that the spiral phase TCAS is adversely affected by the presence of a <b>blade</b> <b>antenna.</b> The amplitude system does not suffer from this limitation, especially for the forward look angles which are of most interest here. A model to represent the inlet scattering is based on the multiple scattering method and UTD. The engine on top of the B 727 - 200 fuselage is modeled by a terminated circular waveguide. Then, the effect of moving the antenna forward on the fuselage is studied. It is again shown that the {{performance of}} the amplitude system is superior...|$|E
