40|$|This paper proposes an {{absorption}} {{refrigeration cycle}} device using a plate <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> {{in order to}} improve the start-up process to reduce the time to reach the steady state condition. A conventional absorption refrigeration cycle device using a shell&tube generator places a rectifier above the generator to remove absorbent from generated refrigerant vapor and to raise concentration of refrigerant vapor. However the replacement of a shell&tube <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> by a plate <b>type</b> <b>generator</b> makes it difficult to include the rectifier within an absorption refrigeration system. Therefore, the cycle proposed in the present study introduced a partial condenser instead of a rectifier. Refrigerant vapor in the partial condenser is cooled by coolant so that only absorbent within the generated vapor condenses by utilizing the difference of boiling temperature. Then, the analytical model was formulated in order to investigate the effectiveness of the plate <b>type</b> <b>generator.</b> The analytical results show that the start-up time is reduced with the plate <b>type</b> <b>generator...</b>|$|R

Micro EDM deposition is a new EDM method, in which the process conditions includes selecting air as working medium, short pulse duration, long pulse interval, low discharge current and setting the tool electrode as anode. In micro EDM deposition experiments, two <b>types</b> pulse <b>generators</b> of transistor <b>type</b> and RC type are applied respectively.
