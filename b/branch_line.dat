50|$|The Dunstable <b>Branch</b> <b>Lines</b> were railway <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> that {{joined the}} English town of Dunstable {{to the main}} lines at Leighton Buzzard and Welwyn. The two lines were under {{separate}} ownership and joined {{just east of the}} Dunstable North station.|$|R
5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla <b>branch</b> <b>line,</b> {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases {{the capacity of the}} <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> from four to eight trains per hour. The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to allow more services to run at shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South <b>Branch</b> <b>line,</b> {{located on}} the Wappocomo property, {{became part of the}} Chessie System.

2500|$|The Canadian Northern Railway was an upstart {{regional}} {{system for}} the prairies that had begun in Manitoba under entrepreneurs William Mackenzie and Donald Mann in 1899 through their amalgamation of several smaller <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> [...] The CNoR started {{the process of building}} Canada's second transcontinental system between 1903 and 1912. [...] The system was built from Winnipeg west to Vancouver and east to Toronto and Montreal.

5|$|In 1972, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was {{merged into}} the Chessie System, which planned to close and abandon the South <b>Branch</b> <b>line.</b> The Romney spur through Depot Valley {{remained}} in service and was {{illustrated by the}} United States Geological Survey on its 1973 Romney Quadrangle topographic map. On October 11, 1978, the Chessie System transferred ownership of the South <b>Branch</b> <b>line</b> to the South Branch Valley Railroad, which in turn was {{owned and operated by}} the West Virginia State Rail Authority. During this transition, the Romney spur of the South Branch Valley Railroad was abandoned, after which all rail and commercial activity at Valley ceased.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained, the <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> was in extremely poor condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line trains, the Illawarra railway line carries interurban and freight traffic. The Cronulla <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> and the Eastern Suburbs Railway are exclusively used by passenger trains.|$|E
50|$|CN {{also was}} given free rein {{by the federal}} {{government}} following deregulation of the railway industry in the 1970s, as well as in 1987, when railway companies began to make tough business decisions by removing themselves from operating money-losing <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> In CN's case, some of these <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> were those it had been forced to absorb through federal government policies and outright patronage, while others were from the heady expansion era of rural <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> in the 1920s and early 1930s and were considered obsolete following the development of local road networks.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E
5|$|Standard gauge rail {{services}} from Sydney {{came with the}} extension of the Main Southern line to Cootamundra and Junee in 1878 and the construction of the Murrumbidgee River Railway Bridge in 1881 allowed the line to be extended past Wagga Wagga to Henty and Albury later that year. A <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> was constructed to Temora in 1893 and extended to Barellan in 1908, Griffith in 1916 and Hillston in 1923. Further south, a <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> was completed from Junee to Narrandera in 1881 and extended to Hay by 1882. Another branch pushed south from Narrandera toward the Victorian border reaching Jerilderie in 1884 and the Murray at Tocumwal in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The Chard Canal was a tub boat canal built between 1835 and 1842. Chard <b>Branch</b> <b>Line</b> {{was created}} in 1860 to connect the two London and South Western Railway and Bristol and Exeter Railway main lines and ran through Chard until 1965.|$|E

5|$|The horsecar {{system was}} more {{expensive}} to operate than electric trams, and Christiania (later Kristiania) Elektriske Sporvei ("Kristiania Electric Tramway") was founded to establish an electric tram service. The initiative came from the engineers H. E. Heyerdahl, A. Fenger-Krog and consul L. Samson. KSS immediately attempted to buy the company, but the purchase failed. On 2 March 1894, the Briskeby Line opened, which ran westwards from the Østbanen station (Oslo East station) via the city centre and Briskeby to Majorstuen, using a 600 volt supply. At the same time, a <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> opened from the Briskeby Line at Slottsparken, heading further west to Skillebekk. At first a shuttle service was provided on the <b>branch</b> <b>line,</b> but by April a through service was offered to Østbanen station. The <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> was extended to Nobels gate on 31 December 1894, to Thune in 1901 and to Skøyen station on 21 June 1903 and {{is now known as}} the Skøyen Line.|$|E
5|$|The pre-war {{operation}} of the station and the <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> features in a pivotal scene in Geoffrey Household's novel Rogue Male, when {{the pursuit of the}} protagonist by enemy agents sees them repeatedly using the station's escalators, passageways and the shuttle service.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the Talyllyn Railway by volunteers was {{the inspiration for the}} 1953 film The Titfield Thunderbolt, an Ealing Studios comedy about a group of villagers attempting to run a service on a disused <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> after closure. T. E. B. Clarke, the script writer for the film, had heard about the {{preservation of}} the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film. In the book Railway Adventure Tom Rolt recalled that he had hoped the film might be produced on the Talyllyn, but it was eventually filmed on the recently closed Camerton branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> along the Cam Brook valley in Somerset.|$|E
