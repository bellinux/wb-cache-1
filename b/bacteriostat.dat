50|$|A {{bacteriostatic}} {{agent or}} <b>bacteriostat,</b> abbreviated Bstatic, is a biological or chemical agent that stops bacteria from reproducing, while not necessarily killing them otherwise. Depending on their application, bacteriostatic antibiotics, disinfectants, antiseptics and preservatives can be distinguished. When bacteriostatic antimicrobials are used, {{the duration of}} therapy must be sufficient to allow host defense mechanisms to eradicate the bacteria. Upon removal of the <b>bacteriostat,</b> the bacteria usually start to grow again. This {{is in contrast to}} bactericides, which kill bacteria.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves of}} E. dura {{are rich in}} oils, {{particularly}} β-phellandrene and 1,8-cineole. These oils may be suitable for development of a <b>bacteriostat.</b>|$|E
40|$|Detection of β-galactosidase {{with the}} aid of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) was {{examined}} as a means for distinguishing between Citrobacter and Salmonella. Several factors which influence sensitivity and reliability of the test were studied. A <b>bacteriostat,</b> sodium azide, was included to permit prolonged incubation of weak and negative strains of enteric bacilli. By the procedure described, salmonellae gave negative ONPG tests; all of 171 strains of Citrobacter gave positive tests...|$|E

Physico-chemical measurements of critical micelie concentration (cmc), specific gravity, and viscosity (to {{the limit of}} their water solubility) of these derivatives are compared and discussed. The application of these materials in the so]ubilization of a selected group of perfume compounds i observed. A controlled experiment demonstrating the use of ETHOXYLATES in adjusting the viscosity. of a cosmetic gel shampoo is il-lustrated.

40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} colonizing {{soil water}} sampling devices (lysimeters) reduced concentrations of biodegradable organic chemicals, including 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid methyl ester, alachlor, methyl m-chlorobenzoate, and metolachlor as water entered through porous ceramic cups. In some cases, losses exceeded 99 %. Additions of either a biocide (sodium hypochlorite) or a <b>bacteriostat</b> (copper salt) prevented microbial activity so that concentrations of test chemicals inside lysimeters equaled those outside. Field studies further indicated that treating lysimeters with a copper salt effectively prevented microbial activity. Thus, chemically treating soil water samplers could improve {{the accuracy of}} soil water data {{for a wide variety}} of analytes, including environmentally important organics, such as pesticides and industrial wastes, and inorganics, such as ammonia and nitrate...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{efficient}} procedure {{was developed for}} {{the isolation of the}} <b>bacteriostat</b> triclosan from deodorant stick and soap matrices using supercritical f uid extraction (SFE). Quantitative recovery for triclosan was obtained with two sequential 7. 5 -min extraction steps using supercritical carbon dioxide at a density of 0. 85 g/ml and at a temperature of 40 øC for stick preparations or 50 øC for soap products. The SFE method was compared with conventional liquid extraction and was found to achieve improved recovery and spec-ificity within a shorter time span. The automated extraction by SFE minimized sample handling, affording enhanced precision. Moreover, SFE reduced the use of hazardous olvents. Triclosan was assayed in com-mercial deodorant products by high-performance liquid chromatography after extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide according to the described procedure...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{reproducible}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system {{was developed for}} sunflower (Helianthus annuusL.) ‘KBSH- 1 ’. The objective was to substantially eliminate the in vitroregeneration component from the transformation protocol. Two-d-old seedlings with one cotyledon detached were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciensstrain LBA 4404 /pKIWI 105 harbouring genes for β-glucuronidase (GUS) and neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II). Following co-cultivation, seedlings were grown aseptically for 5 d on a growth regulator-free basal medium supplemented with 250 μ g ml^- 1 cefotaxime (a <b>bacteriostat</b> used to control gram negative bacteria). Seedlings were screened for transient GUS expression and the shoot portions of the putative transformants were utilized for propagation as transgenic plants. The excised shoots that initiated roots following selection were subsequently transferred to a glasshouse. Molecular analysis of transgenic plants confirmed concordance between the presence of foreign genes and enzyme activity. The transformation regime facilitated rapid generation of up to 2...|$|E
40|$|Green waste' (food, agro-industrial {{and forest}} residues) is a renowned {{valuable}} resource of polyphenols. Natural polyphenols are relatively efficient in the clean-up of environmental pollutants {{based on their}} unique traits of chelation, adsorption, reduction, complexation, nutrient cycling, antibacterial effects and plant growth promotion. These significant traits have found emerging applications in the removal of heavy metals, pathogenic bacteria and dyes from contaminated soil and water through existing bioremedial techniques such as biosorption, phytoextraction and coagulation. Increasingly, polyphenol-rich natural extracts harnessed for green nanoparticle synthesis (production of particles between 1 and 100 nm in size using biological entities such as microorganisms or plant biomass) have found promising use as a remedial agent in the detoxification of toxic pollutants. However, current bioremediation approaches do not sufficiently exploit natural polyphenols, which are abundantly available and are non-toxic. This review examines the extent of natural polyphenol availability in green waste, and provides a critical view on the existing remedial options, knowledge gaps and hence scope for future research. It highlights the use of natural polyphenol-rich green wastes as nanofertilizers, bioamendments, biofilters and <b>bacteriostats.</b> Field application strategies such as microbe-assisted phytoremediation, bioaugmention and biostimulation are also emphasized, showing the multifunctional biotechnological potentials offered by natural polyphenols...|$|R
40|$|The {{additives}} and contaminants which {{occur in}} textile fibers vary widely, {{depending on the}} type of fiber and the pretreatment which it has received. Synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester contain trace amounts of contaminants such as catalysts and catalyst deactivators which remain after the synthesis of the basic polymers. In addition, there are frequently a number of materials which are added to perform specific functions in almost all man-made fibers. Examples of these would include traces of metals or metal salts used as tracers for identification of specific lots of fiber, TiO 2 or similar materials added as delustrants, and a host of organic species added for such special purposes as antistatic agents or flame retardants. There may also be considerable quantities of residual monomer or small oligomers dissolved in the polymer matrix. The situation becomes even more complex after the fibers are converted into fabric form. Numerous materials are applied at various stages of fabric preparation to act as lubricants, sizing agents, antistats, bleaches, and wetting agents to facilitate the processing, but these are normally removed before the fabric reaches the cutters of the ultimate consumers and therefore usually do not constitute potential hazards. However, there are many other chemical agents which are frequently added during the later stages of fabric preparation and which are not designed to be removed. Aside from dyes and printing pigments, the most common additive for apparel fabrics is a durable press treatment. This generally involves the use of materials capable of crosslinking cellulosics by reacting through such functions as N-methylolated amides or related compounds such as ureas and carbamates. These materials pose some potential hazards due to both the nitrogenous bases and the formaldehyde which they usually release. There is usually also some residual catalyst in fabrics which have received such treatments. Other types of chemical treatments which are often applied to fabrics to achieve special effects include flame retardants, soil release agents, antistatic agents, softeners, water and/or oil repellents, ultraviolet absorbers, <b>bacteriostats,</b> and fungistats...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{has become}} one of the world’s most severe problems because of the overuse of antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more difficult to kill and more expensive to treat. Researchers have been studied on antibiotic alternatives such as antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides. A functional bacteria MB 01 producing lipopeptides which can be used as <b>bacteriostat</b> was isolated from the Bohai Sea sediments, which had been identified as Bacillus licheniformis by the morphological, physiological, and biochemical identification and 16 s rDNA sequence. The lipopeptides produced by MB 01 were determined to be cyclic surfactin homologs by LC-ESI-MS structural identification after crude extraction and LH- 20 chromatography. [M+H]+m/z 994, 1008, 1022, and 1036 were all the characteristic molecular weight of surfactin homologs. CID analysis revealed that the molecular structure of the lipopeptides was Rn-Glu 1 -Leu/Ile 2 -Leu 3 -Val 4 -Asp 5 -Leu 6 -Leu/Ile 7. The lipopeptides showed well resistance to UV light and the change of pH and temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} and excretion of “C-labeled 3, 4, 4 ’-trichlorodiphenylurea {{has been studied}} in the rat after oral and iv administration. More than 80 % of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the feces and urine over 5 days. Five isolated metabolites were characterized by mass spectrometry and by comparative thin-layer chromatography with synthesized compounds. Metabolites found include 2 ’-hydroxy-, 3 ’-hydroxy-, 6 -hydroxy-, 2 ’, 6 -dihydroxy-, and 3 ’, 6 -dihydroxy- 3, 4, 4 ’-trichlorodiphenylurea. Trichlorocarbanilide (TCC) 1 (3, 4, 4 ’-trichloro-diphenylurea) is a potent antibacterial agent used extensively in deodorant soaps in the United States. The parent compound, urea, was first mentioned as a <b>bacteriostat</b> in 1906 (1) and reviewed in 1944 (2). Despite its widespread use by the general population, there are no published studies on the metabolism of TCC or other diarylureas (carbaniides). 2 Inasmuch as the toxic effects of many compounds are medi-ated by metabolites rather than the parent mole-cule, {{it is important to}} determine the metabolic profile of TCC and related compounds. There is evidence for the metabolism of chlo-rophenylureas. For example, the herbicides, Monuron, Diuron and Linuron, are chlorophen-ylmethylureas or chlorophenylmethoxyureas which undergo biotransformation in the rat. The pathways of metabolism included N-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation as well as glucuroni-dation and sulfation of the resulting metabolite...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of the}} available data on {{the risks and benefits}} of hexa-chlorophene suggests that there is ample evidence for the toxic potential; whereas there is no substantial evidence of its benefit in life-threatening staph 80 / 81 epidemics, and effective less toxic alternatives are available. In view of its limited usefulness and definite toxicity, the routine use of hexachlorophene is unjustified. POSITION PAPERS on the use of hexa-chlorophene in newborn nurseries have been presented in recent years by both the Ameri-can Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The AAP and FDA positions, derived from a large body of information, hold that there is a definite toxic potential in the use of hexa-chlorophene for bathing of newborn infants, and that its efficacy appears to be limited to non-life-threatening infections. Much of the large body of literature deal-ing with the use of hexachlorophene in pedi-atric practice reflects adversary positions con-cerning either its benefits or its risks. As with any form of therapy, the decision whether or not to use an agent can only be made after a careful analysis of both benefitand risk. This paper review the data that resulted in the positions of the AAP and FDA on the use of hexachlorophene with newborn infants. Critical evaluation of the information sug-gests that the evidence for the toxic potential of hexachlorophene is ample, whereas there is no substantial evidence of its benefit in the life-threatening diseases that physicians felt that they were treating with the <b>bacteriostat...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into the effect of 2 - 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (24 D) and other herbicides on soil populations. Experiments were devised {{to test the hypothesis}} that the initial lag period in detoxication is a combination of a period of adaptation followed by proliferation. Methods employed were dilution plate counts, variations in conditions of treatment, respiration studies, and the use of a <b>bacteriostat</b> and pre-enrichment of the soil with autotrophic organisms. An active organism, which would decompose 24 D when inoculated into an aerated suspension of sterile soil, was isolated from soil enriched to this herbicide. There is a significant correlation between 24 D concentration and bacterial numbers in the soil. Applications of this herbicide stimulated the rate of respiration of an enriched soil and of a culture of the isolated active organism. Results indicate complete oxidation of the molecule. The evidence suggests that the organisms responsible occupy sites on the surfaces of the soil crumbs where the anion is adsorbed. These sites are quite distinct from those occupied by the nitrifying and thiosulphate-oxidising autotrophs. Proliferation of organisms begins on the fifth or sixth day of treatment, at which time it is calculated that a slow breakdown of herbicide begins. It was concluded that the organism responsible for the detoxication of 24 D in soils undergoes a period of adaptation to the new substrate, lasting five or six days. During the following time, all the sites on the soil crumbs where the 24 D anion can be adsorbed are occupied to give a saturated soil. When herbicide is reapplied, rapid breakdown ensues accompanied by a high rate of carbon dioxide evolution and sufficient proliferation to replace those bacteria which have died. It is probable that a similar process occurs when soil is treated with other phenoxyacetic acids. <p...|$|E
