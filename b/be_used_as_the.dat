5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome.

It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E

After the atomization polishing, the surface roughness of copper was 7. 61 nm and the material removal rate was 188 nm/min; After the traditional polishing, the surface roughness was 15. 22 nm and the material removal rate was 236 nm/min. The dosage of polishing slurry used in the atomization polishing is dozens of times less than that in the traditional polishing...|$|R
5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E

Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor, with Napoleon forcing the empire's dissolution in 1806.

5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium.

This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|As the day (26 January 1965) of {{switching}} over to Hindi as sole {{official language}} approached, the anti-Hindi movement gained momentum in Madras State with increased support from college students.
