5|$|As {{the trial}} progressed however, Le Gris' {{testimony}} suffered several <b>blows.</b> <b>The</b> unwavering accusations directed at him by Marguerite and the shame such accusations brought to her were, {{in the eyes}} of the court, a powerful reason why the charges were not invented. Then, even as the trial progressed, one of the men providing Le Gris' alibi, named Jean Beloteau, was arrested in Paris and charged with rape. This charge seriously undermined Beloteau's testimony and Le Gris' defence. Finally, Carrouges himself offered counter-testimony in court that a healthy, strong man with long experience of horsemanship and a stable full of horses like Le Gris could certainly have made the 50mile trip without difficulty, even accounting for the snow.|$|E

The season ended in {{controversial}} circumstances at Villa Park, and with a 3–2 defeat to Aston Villa ending any hopes of winning the league, Sandy Turnbull and Villa captain Alex Leake exchanged <b>blows.</b> <b>The</b> Football Association launched {{an investigation into the}} violence, and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the 1905–06 season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake. No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and the evidence was not made public. The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign. He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road. The FA acted on his information, and fined Manchester City £900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players, boardroom members and staff members.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Accountancy)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. This thesis {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} {{of the factors that}} motivate trainee auditors to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle on wrongdoing in an audit firm. It investigates whether organisational justice (comprised of procedural, interactional and distributive justice) is positively correlated with <b>the</b> willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. It also investigates whether the type of justice (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) affects <b>the</b> decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Finally, it investigates whether professional performance, morality-proxied by a sense of religion-, seniority, age and gender affect this decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. The results indicate that most trainee auditors‟ sense of organisational justice is positively correlated to their likelihood to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. All three justice dimensions (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) are found to increase trainee auditors‟ propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. High interactional justice is found to be a greater motivation to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle than procedural and distributive justice. Low distributive justice is found to be least effective as an impediment to whistleblowing, whilst low procedural and interactional justice are more effective than low distributive justice in deterring whistleblowing. This research finds that age, gender, seniority and religion do not affect the trainee auditor‟s propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Most recent performance ratings do not affect trainee auditors‟ decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle, except in the case of trainees who received a low performance rating when there was low interactional justice...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} from a study that investigates the relationship between ethical climates and police whistle-blowing on five forms of misconduct in the State of Georgia. The results indicate that a friendship or team climate generally explains willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle, but not the actual frequency of <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Instead, supervisory status, a control variable investigated in previous studies, is the most consistent predictor of both willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle and frequency of <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> whistle.

5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of <b>blows.</b> <b>The</b> retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E

Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson <b>blows</b> <b>the</b> house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E
