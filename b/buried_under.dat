5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of the deceased. The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of the deceased in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> religious architecture had differing roles than those <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> secular architecture.|$|E

40|$|Determining the {{population}} density of ectotherms is often confounded by individual activity levels, which are {{highly dependent on}} ambient climatic conditions. In this study we used radio-telemetry and streamside surveys to examine the influence of local climatic conditions on individual activity levels (detectability) and streamside density of a population of endangered giant barred frog (Mixophyes iteratus) along the Coomera river in south-east Queensland. Temperature {{was the most important}} climatic variable influencing the behaviour and hence detectability of M. iteratus. The results indicated that males <b>bury</b> <b>under</b> the leaf litter during cold conditions (< 18 é so fewer were detected during surveys. Although females were also found to <b>bury</b> <b>under</b> the leaf litter in cold weather, no significant relationship between exposure and streamside density was detected. This is likely to be due to the lower number of females detected during surveys. The streamside density of juveniles was significantly related to temperature and rainfall, but little {{of the variance in the}} data was explained by climatic conditions, despite greater numbers of juveniles being found than adults. These results indicate that, for increased efficiency, surveys of Mixophyes iteratus should be undertaken when temperatures exceed 18 îNo Full Tex...|$|R
