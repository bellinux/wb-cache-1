40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This {{investigation}} has analyzed {{and described the}} impact of place on one of man's activities [...] the production of sugar beet seed. It is apparent that in this activity man's relationship to the earth is especially close and dependent upon a number of factors. These are localizing factors. Sugar <b>beets</b> <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> <b>seed</b> are sensitive {{to a number of}} environmental elements, particularly to the physical element of temperature. Relative compatibility with certain established farming systems and the establishment of seed producing organizations in places favorable <b>for</b> sugar beet <b>seed</b> production are other localizing factors. Since the market <b>for</b> sugar beet <b>seed</b> is tightly controlled by contracting, and since the seed producing agencies have been established in certain favorable areas, and since quantity needs are rather static, it is probable that sugar beet seed production will continue to be localized in the present production areas. Furthermore, no great increase in quantity of production can be expected. The long, relatively mild winters with temperatures favorable to development of the reproductive phase of growth in the sugar beet have made the Willamette Valley of Oregon one of the two chief sugar beet seed producing areas of the United States. Because it is the place offering the best opportunity for total or complete reproduction in all varieties, the Willamette Valley is the foremost producer of seed of bolting resistant varieties of sugar beets. For the same reason, it is the most prominent place <b>for</b> producing <b>seed</b> breeders' elite and stock <b>seed</b> <b>for</b> increase. It is probable that these aspects of the United States sugar beet seed industry will remain localized to the Willamette Valley. The Willamette Valley has ample land on which sugar beets <b>for</b> <b>seed</b> could be raised should demand <b>for</b> <b>seed</b> ever warrant expansion. Sugar beets <b>for</b> <b>seed</b> compete favorably with other crops grown on the Valley's best soils; the present situation indicates that the same kind of competition could be carried to any suitable part of the Valley. With the only slight expansion now taking place, localization within the Willamette Valley will likely remain within a radius of 30 to 40 miles of Salem, and principally on a north -south axis on the more suitable alluvial soils...|$|R
