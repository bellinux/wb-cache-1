60|$|These examples, I think, {{demonstrate}} that we cannot settle {{the rank of}} a group by {{a consideration of the}} degree in which certain characters resemble or differ from those in what is admitted to be a lower group; and they also show that the highest group of a class may be more closely connected to one of the lowest, than some other groups which have developed laterally and diverged farther from the parent type, but which yet, owing to want of balance or too great specialization in their structure, have never reached a high grade of organization. The Quadrumana afford a very valuable illustration, because, owing to their undoubted affinity with man, we feel certain that they are really higher than any other order of Mammalia, {{while at the same time}} they are more distinctly allied to the lowest groups than many others. The case of the Papilionidæ seems to me so exactly parallel to this, that, while I admit all the proofs of affinity with the undoubtedly lower groups of Hesperidæ and moths, I yet maintain that, owing to the complete and even development of every part of their organization, these insects best represent the highest perfection to which the <b>butterfly</b> <b>type</b> has attained, and deserve to be placed at its head in every system of classification.|$|E

Initially, many people were disappointed because the first TRX450R was very weak compared to the CRF450R. Honda claims that it designed the TRX450R engine to produce more torque so that the engine was more suited for ATV purposes. In 2004 and 2005, the only interchangeable part between the ATV and motorcycle engines was the camshaft. In 2006, Honda overhauled the TRX450R engine to make it more similar to its motorcycle variant. This included a more aggressive cam profile, a larger bore with a shortened stroke, a new, short skirt piston and titanium rather than steel valves.

40|$|Cases {{where three}} kinds of {{fluctuations}} having the different typical scale-lengths coexist are analyzed, and the statistical theory of strong turbulence in inhomogeneous plasmas is developed. Statistical nonlinear interactions between fluctuations are kept in the analysis as the renormalized drag, statistical noise and the averaged drive. The nonlinear interplay through them induces a quenching or suppressing effect, even if all the modes are unstable when they are analyzed independently. Variety in mode appearance takes place: one mode quenches the other two modes, or one mode is quenched by the other two modes, etc. The bifurcation of turbulence is analyzed and a phase diagram is drawn. Phase diagrams with cusp type catastrophe and <b>butterfly</b> <b>type</b> catastrophe are obtained. The subcritical bifurcation is possible to occur through the nonlinear interplay, even though each one is supercritical turbulence when analyzed independently. Analysis reveals that the nonlinear stability boundary (marginal point) and the amplitude of each mode may substantially shift from the conventional results of independent analyses. ...|$|E

40|$|After {{undergoing}} a study about current engine modelling and mapping approaches {{as well as}} the engine modelling requirements for different applications, a major problem found to be present is the extensive and time consuming mapping procedure that every engine has to go through so that all control parameters can be derived from experimental data. To improve this, a cycle-by-cycle modelling approach has been chosen to mathematically represent reciprocating engines starting by a complete dynamics crankshaft mechanism model which forms the base of the complete engine model. This system is modelled taking into account the possibility of a piston pin offset on the mechanism. The derived Valvetrain model is capable of representing a variable valve lift and phasing Valvetrain which can be used while modelling most modern engines. A <b>butterfly</b> <b>type</b> throttle area model is derived as well as its rate of change which is believed to be a key variable for transient engine control. In addition, an approximation throttle model is formulated aiming at real-time applications. Furthermore, the engine inertia is presented as a mathematical model able to be used for any engine. A spark ignition engine simulation (SIES) framework was developed in MATLAB SIMULINK to form the base of a complete high fidelity cycle-by-cycle simulation model with its major target to provide an environment for virtual engine mapping procedures. Some experimental measurements from an actual engine are still required to parameterise the model, which is the reason an engine mapping (EngMap) framework has been developed in LabVIEW, It is shown that all the moving engine components can be represented by a single cyclic variable which can be used for flow model development.

Compounds 1 – 4 were investigated via direct current and alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements, and {{it was found that}} each complex displayed single-molecule magnet (SMM) behavior. All four compounds display unique coordination and geometric environments around the DyIII ions and it was found that each displays a different anisotropy barrier. Ab initio calculations were performed on 1 – 4 and these determined the low lying electronic structure of each DyIII ion and the magnetic interactions for each cluster. It was found that there was a strong correlation between the calculated energy gap between the ground and first excited states of the single-ion ligand-field split DyIII levels and the experimentally observed anisotropy barrier. Furthermore, the transverse g factors found for the DyIII ions, defining the tunnelling rates within the ground Kramers doublets, are largest for 1, which agrees with the experimental observation of the shortest relaxation time in the high-temperature domain for this complex. The magnetic exchange between the DyIII ions revealed overall antiferromagnetic interactions for each compound, derived from the dominant dipolar exchange resulting in nonmagnetic ground states for 1 – 4.
