40|$|We {{study the}} spindown of {{isolated}} neutron stars from initially rapid rotation rates, driven by two factors: (1) gravitational wave emission due to r-modes and (2) magnetic braking. In {{the context of}} isolated neutron stars, we present the first study including self-consistently the magnetic damping of r-modes in the spin evolution. We track the spin evolution employing the RNS code, which accounts for the rotating structure of neutron stars for various equations of state. We find that, despite the strong damping due to the magnetic field, r-modes alter the <b>braking</b> <b>rate</b> from pure magnetic braking for B ≤ 10 ¹³ G. For realistic values of the saturation amplitude αsat, the r-mode can also decrease the time to reach the threshold central density for quark deconfinement.

40|$|Cataclysmic {{variables}} undergo periodic nova explosions {{during which}} a finite mass of material is expelled {{on a short}} timescale. The system widens and, as a result, the mass-transfer rate drops. This state of hibernation {{may account for the}} variety of cataclysmic variable types observed in systems of similar mass and period. In the light of recent changes to the theory of nova ignition and magnetic braking we investigate whether hibernation remains a viable mechanism for creating cataclysmic variable diversity. We model the ratio of time spent as dwarf novae (DNe) to nova-like systems (NLs). Above a critical mass-transfer rate the system is NL and below it a DN. The dominant loss of angular momentum is by magnetic <b>braking</b> but the <b>rate</b> is uncertain. It is also uncertain what fraction of the mass accreted is expelled during the novae.

40|$|Determining {{whether or}} not an event was a cause of a road {{accident}} often involves determining the truth of a counterfactual conditional, where what happened is compared to {{what would have happened}} had the putative cause been absent. Using structural causal models, Pearl and his associates have recently developed a rigorous method for posing and answering causal questions, and this approach is especially well-suited to the reconstruction and analysis of road accidents. Here we apply these methods to freeway rear-end collisions. Starting with video recordings of accidents on I- 94, trajectory information on a platoon of vehicles involved in a crash is extracted from the video record and these trajectories are then used to estimate each driver's initial speed, following distance, reaction time, and <b>braking</b> <b>rate.</b> Using Brill's model of rear-end accidents it is then possible to simulate what would have happened had, other things equal, certain driver reactions been other than they were.

These tasks can be effectively performed only when using train running time models which reliably describe actual speed profiles. To this purpose calibration of model parameters against field data is a necessity. In this paper a simulation-based optimization approach is introduced to calibrate the parameters of the train dynamics equations against field data collected at the level of track sections. A genetic algorithm is used to minimize the error between simulated and observed speed profiles. Furthermore, a procedure for the estimation of train lengths has been developed. This method has been applied to trains with different rolling stock running on the Rotterdam-Delft corridor in the Netherlands. The model parameters were calibrated for a significant number of trains of different compositions. We also derived probability distributions for each parameter which can be usefully employed for simulations. The results show that the train length estimation model obtained good computation accuracy. The effectiveness of the calibration method in giving a reliable estimation of the real train path trajectories is shown. It has been observed that some of the parameters of tractive effort and resistance do not affect the train behaviour significantly. Also, the <b>braking</b> <b>rate</b> is significantly smoother than the default value used by the railway undertaking while calibrated resistance parameters tend to have lower mean than defaults.

40|$|We {{resume the}} {{discussion}} about irradiation-driven mass transfer cycles in semi- detached compact binary systems. The analytical model that describes the onset of these cycles, which occur on a thermal timescale of the donor star, is reexamined. We take into account a contribution of the thermal relaxation which {{is not related to}} the irradiation of the donor star and which was neglected in previous studies. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) containing extended giant donors are more stable than previously thought. CVs close to the upper edge of the period gap can undergo cycles for low angular momentum loss rates, as they have been suggested by recent magnetic braking prescriptions, while they are stable for high braking rates. A model for the irradiation geometry that takes into account surface elements near the terminator of the donor star indicates that possibly also low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can undergo mass transfer cycles. Regarding the <b>braking</b> <b>rate,</b> which is necessary to drive cycles, basically the same restrictions apply for short period LMXBs as they do for short period CVs. We confirm that LMXBs containing giants can undergo cyles. In terms of an irradiation efficiency parameter α CVs are susceptible to the irradiation instability for α >= 0. 1 while LMXBs are susceptible for α <= 0. 1. The predictions of the analytical model are checked by the first long-term evolutionary computations of systems undergoing mass transfer cycles with full 1 D stellar models. For unevolved main sequence (MS) and giant donors the analytic model provides reasonable values for the boundaries of the stable and unstable regions while CVs containing highly evolved MS donors are more stable at high braking rates than expected. Taking into account irradiation the minimum period of CVs is increased by up to 1 - 2 minutes, depending on α. Comment: 19 pages, 24 figures, accepted by A&...|$|E

40|$|We {{would like}} to comment on the paper of {{discovering}} two absorption lines (Sanwal et al. 2002) that an unequal discussion was taken about those two potential possibilities in generating the absorption features. The authors ’ bias, that the features are associated with atomic transitions of once-ionized helium, rejects the possibility that such a pulsar-like star is a bare strange star (Xu 2002); but we are sorry that this conclusion can not be fully accepted. Whereas, we tend to suggest that the absorptions are two cyclotron lines.

All the gait parameters were very variable, both between birds, and within the same bird, even when bodyweight and speed were controlled for. Despite the high variability, however, significant differences were identified in many of the gait parameters between the different groups. The vertical and craniocaudal GRF's of Brown Leghorns showed similar characteristics to those produced in human walking. The peak vertical forces were of a similar order of magnitude in the birds as in humans (125 - 150 % bodyweight), and the peak craniocaudal forces, and the rate of change of force, were closely tied to speed.
