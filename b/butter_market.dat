There was a Town Hall, {{situated}} in the Square, which was built in 1887-8 and demolished in March 1986; it featured prominently just prior to its demolition in the 1985 television drama Blott on the Landscape. The other notable civic building in the centre of town is the Buttercross (named as it was the <b>butter</b> <b>market</b> {{at the site of the}} medieval High Cross); it was the home of the town council after the demolition of the Town Hall and prior to the closure of the courts.

30|$|Firstly, spatial {{transmission}} effects between World and EU butter {{prices are}} analysed, given the recent greater market {{orientation of the}} CAP. The underlying economic justification for this analysis is spatial arbitrage (Listori and Esposti 2012). For the case of <b>butter</b> <b>markets,</b> this means that when World prices rises, arbitrageurs will start to buy butter in the EU and sell on the World market. 11 This will, in turn, increase EU prices.|$|R
50|$|The co-op {{was often}} accused of unfair {{competition}} and false advertising {{in its early}} years, and compelled to defend its inspection and certification processes. Eventually, however, the sweet <b>butter</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy drove competitors either to match the quality of butter produced under the Land O'Lakes name or see their sales decline. Many competitors in the dairy products business copied the Land O'Lakes approach, and the certification of quality became a proven marketing technique in other product lines as well.|$|R

It was created to centralise the overseas marketing of Irish dairy products to achieve economies of scale and greater brand recognition. At the time of the Board's creation, the European Economic Community's market was closed to Irish butter, and the United Kingdom market limited Irish imports by an import quota.|$|R

With the decline of banana growing, dairying was the main industry in the Noosa Shire from the 1930s to the 1960s, when competition from margarine, the loss of <b>butter</b> <b>markets,</b> and pasture decline saw dairying replaced by beef cattle. By the 1990s, Pomona was relying on fruit and furniture manufacture for its livelihood.|$|R

A number of dairy co-operatives were formed, and the Parthenaise was used to produce a type of <b>butter</b> <b>marketed</b> as [...] "Charente-Poitou", which quickly became well-known. By the late nineteenth century there were some 1.1 million head.|$|R
50|$|The {{town hall}} was {{commissioned}} in 1749. The building {{was first used}} as a <b>butter</b> <b>market,</b> butter being the main marketable product for many farmers of the day. The town hall was extended and changed at various intervals over the years.|$|E

50|$|In 1912, <b>butter</b> <b>markets</b> {{operated}} on Wednesdays and Fridays near the present creamery. The main market was in Bantry with fair day the first Friday each month. The pig fair {{was held on}} a Thursday. In the early 20th century, Bantry celebrated the fourth largest fair in Ireland. The railway ran {{as many as eight}} carriages to carry cattle and pigs to Cork. The annual horse fair was Ballibui in August in Dunmanway. When the marts started, especially Bandon and Skibbereen (started by Cork Co-Operative Marts in 1958) it sounded the death knell of the cattle fair. Durrus Fair held near Creamery and was revived in 1937 after 20 years.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 about 78% of Queensland's milk {{production}} went into making butter, and in 1928 about 10% of Queensland's population was largely {{dependent on the}} dairy industry. By 1929 the Wide Bay district (of which Hervey Bay was a part) was the second highest milk producer after the Moreton District. However, when the dairy industry declined in Queensland from the 1950s onwards, due to increased competition, a loss of <b>butter</b> <b>markets</b> and higher overheads, many farmers either switched to bulk {{milk production}} or left the industry. While some old dairies were upgraded by those farmers who remained in the industry, the rest were demolished, used for storage or left derelict.|$|R

50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Franks settled in Düren. The Frankish king Pippin der Kleine (Pippin the Short) often visited Düren in the 8th century and held a few {{important}} conventions there. Pippin was the father of the famous emperor Charlemagne. The Franks made of Durum a royal palace, from which the name Palatine (Pfalz in German) is derived. Charlemagne sojourned a few times there. The castle was built at the place where, in 1991, the Saint Anne Church is located today. Due to the frequent visits of Charlemagne, a few markets sprang up, such as the corn, cattle, wood, chicken, and <b>butter</b> <b>markets,</b> all of which contributed to Düren's development.|$|R

In July 2000 it acquired the dairy and cheese products division of Unigate in London and in November 2002 it acquired the St Ivel spreads company which had been based in Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. In September 2004 it went on to acquire the Country Life butter brand from the English <b>Butter</b> <b>Marketing</b> Company. In July 2006 it acquired Express Dairies from Arla Foods for £33m. In October 2006, it sold {{the majority of its}} own label cheese business to First Milk, its Scottish equivalent, along with the creameries and factory that produce most of the products concerned.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a common {{practice}} for some years for Iowa creameries to send samples of butter to the Iowa Experiment Station for chemical analysis. These analyses reveal {{the fact that there}} is considerable variation in the chemical composition of butter manufactured in the various creameries. At times there are large variations in the composition of butter manufactured in the same creamery. A project was initiated in 1980 to determine the extent of such irregularities and at the same time to assist the creameries to manufacture butter of a more uniform chemical composition. Similar work was carried on by the University of California as early as 1925; Oregon State College began a similar project in 1929. The Land O’Lakes Company, of Minneapolis, Minn., has maintained a service laboratory for its group of creameries for several years. During recent years service laboratories have been established by various <b>butter</b> <b>marketing</b> groups as well as by some of the Agricultural Experiment stations...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} Danish {{agricultural}} exports {{at the end}} of the nineteenth century is often attributed to the establishment of a direct trade with Britain. Previously, exports went mostly via Hamburg, but this changed with the loss of Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia in the war of 1864. After this, quantity and price data imply narrowing price gaps and thus imply gains for Danish producers. Why then did Denmark not discover the British market earlier? We show that <b>butter</b> <b>markets</b> in both countries were integrated in the eighteenth century, but through the Hamburg hub. We then demonstrate that there were sound economic reasons for this well into the nineteenth century. However, movements to establish a direct trade were afoot from the 1850 s.
