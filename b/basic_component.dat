5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> {{sound of}} a Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} {{electromagnetic}} pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E

We {{propose a}} {{classification}} {{for a set}} of linearly recursive func-tions, which can be expressed as instances of a skeleton for parallel linear recursion, and present new parallel implementations for them. This set in-cludes well known higher-order functions, like Broadcast, Reduction and Scan, which we call <b>basic</b> <b>components.</b> Many compositions of these <b>basic</b> <b>components</b> are also linearly recursive functions; we present transformation rules from compositions of up to three <b>basic</b> <b>components</b> to instances of our skeleton.

25|$|Due to the {{chirality}} {{of their}} component amino acids, all strands exhibit right-handed twist evident in most higher-order β-sheet structures. In particular, the linking loop between two parallel strands almost {{always has a}} right-handed crossover chirality, which is strongly favored by the inherent twist of the sheet. This linking loop frequently contains a helical region, in which case it is called a β-α-β motif. A closely related motif called a β-α-β-α motif forms the <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> {{of the most commonly}} observed protein tertiary structure, the TIM barrel.|$|E

25|$|Wine was {{the third}} <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> of the Parisian meal. Wealthier Parisians {{consumed}} wines brought from Bordeaux and Burgundy; the Parisian middle class and workers drank wines from regions all over France, usually brought in barrels by boat or by road. In 1725 there were an estimated 1,500 wine merchants in Paris. The royal government profited from the flood of wine coming to Paris by raising taxes, until wine was the most highly taxed product coming into the city in 1668, each barrel of wine barrel of wine entering Paris by land was taxed 15 livres, and 18 livres if it arrived by boat. By 1768 the government raised the taxes to 48 livres by land and 52 by water. To avoid the taxes, hundreds of taverns called guinguettes sprang up just outside the tax barriers {{on the edges of}} the city, at Belleville, Charonne, and new shanty-towns called La Petite-Pologne, Les Porcherons, and La Nouvelle-France. A pint of wine sold in these taverns was taxed 3.5 sous a pint, while the same amount was taxed 12 to 15 sous inside Paris. The tax was hated by the Parisians, and was an important cause of the growing hostility to the royal government before the Revolution.|$|E
500|$|A {{waveguide}} filter is {{an electronic}} filter that is constructed with waveguide technology. [...] Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted. [...] Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the passband), {{while others are}} rejected (the stopband). [...] Filters are a <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications. [...] These include selection of signals and limitation of noise. [...] Waveguide filters are most useful in the microwave band of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low loss. [...] Examples of microwave filter use are found in satellite communications, telephone networks, and television broadcasting.|$|E
500|$|A <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> of {{waveguide}} filters is {{the cavity}} resonator. [...] This {{consists of a}} short length of waveguide blocked at both ends. [...] Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected {{back and forth between}} the two ends. [...] A given geometry of cavity will resonate at a characteristic frequency. [...] The resonance effect can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies. [...] Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure. [...] However, if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal. [...] A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter.|$|E

[...] Most of the <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running Whirlwind-SAGE program to develop an automated radar shield. [...] Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies {{by the end of the}} 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility. [...] More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a Cold War military perspective. [...] Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on psychology, cognitive science and neuroscience through the mind-computer analogy.|$|E

Vitamin B1 as thiamine diphosphate is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase which are all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. [...] Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is a constituent of FMN and FAD which are necessary for many redox reactions. [...] Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan is {{a component of the}} coenzymes NAD and NADP which in turn are required for electron transport in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as many other redox reactions. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is a constituent of coenzyme A, a <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is a cofactor for many enzymes especially transaminases involve in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 (cobalamins) contain a corrin ring similar in structure to porphyrin and is an essential coenzyme for the catabolism of fatty acids as well for the biosynthesis of methionine.|$|E
2500|$|In Lurianic Kabbalah, reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic, but an {{expression}} of Divine compassion, the microcosm {{of the doctrine of}} cosmic rectification of creation. Gilgul is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul, conditional upon circumstances. Luria's radical system focused on rectification of the Divine soul, played out through Creation. The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence. Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that [...] "came into this world to receive a rectification". A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate, vegetative or animal creations. The most <b>basic</b> <b>component</b> of the soul, the nefesh, must leave at the cessation of blood production. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes. Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfill each of the 613 Mosaic commandments that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the Messianic Era begins. Non-Jewish observance of the 7 Laws of Noah assists the Jewish people, though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose.|$|E
