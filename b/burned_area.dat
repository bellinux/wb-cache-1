Reconstruction was made with appeal for subsidies from the king, who imposed an alignment plan whose implementation was entrusted to the engineer Garella. This plan went further than a simple plan of reconstruction since it provided a true alignment of streets, and imposed some rules of urbanism as, for example, the construction of houses of two floors and a ground floor; it also prohibited thatched roofs.

40|$|Carnivores play {{a central}} role in {{ecosystem}} processes by exerting top-down control, while fire exerts bottom-up control in ecosystems throughout the world, yet, little is known about how fire affects short-term carnivore distributions across the landscape. Through the use of a long-term data set we investigated the distribution of lions, during the daytime, in relation to <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We found that lions avoid <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> despite the fact that herbivores, their prey, are attracted to <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> Prey attraction, however, likely results from the reduction in cover caused by burning, that may thereby decrease lion hunting success. Lions also do not preferentially utilize the edges of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> over unburned areas despite the possibility that edges would combine the benefit of cover with proximity to abundant prey. Despite the fact that lions avoid <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> lion territory size and reproductive success were not affected by the proportion of the territory burned each year. Therefore, burning does not seem to reduce lion fitness perhaps because of the heterogeneity of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> across the landscape or because it is possible that when hunting at night lions visit <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> despite their daytime avoidance of these areas [Current Zoology 59 (3) : 335 – 339, 2013]...|$|R

500|$|On August 28, 2014, Stanislaus Forest {{supervisor}} Susan Skalski {{signed a}} Record of Decision approving the Rim Fire Recovery Project. The plan allowed logging within {{an area of}} , including interior portions of the <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> and along roadways. Its goals were to: [...] "Salvage dead trees to capture economic value; remove roadside hazard trees to protect public and worker safety; reduce fuels for future forest resiliency; improve roads for hydrologic function; and, enhance wildlife habitat. A portion of the money captured from the salvage logging was ear-marked for additional projects following the fire." [...] The plan attempted to balance competing interests. Instead of the 660 million board feet initially proposed for logging, the final plan included salvage logging of 210 million board feet. The plan left small areas untouched as snag habitat for Black-Backed Woodpeckers and other snag-dependent wildlife. Instead of building permanent new roads, the plan eliminated permanent new road construction and reduced the mileage of temporary roads {{as part of the}} salvage logging plan. The Forest Service said that the final plan reflected a collaboration between the timber industry and various environmental groups, who had joined together in an attempt to find consensus on the recovery process. Skalski cited that collaborative agreement as being influential in her decision to significantly reduce the amount of salvage material. Forestry officials praised the plan, but some environmental groups denounced it.|$|E

Thus, we analyzed both the land use of 2008 that became burned in 2010, as which land use the <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> of 2008 became {{in the year of}} 2010. The study was performed by 5 TM Landsat satellite images, with the aid of two software programs: one for the interpretation of patterns burned in Landsat scenes (TerraAmazon 4. 1. 0) and other for the crossing of data by intersection process (ArcGIS 10). Two intersections were processed with the following masks of state of Mato Grosso: <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> 2008 x land use 2010 and <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> 2010 x land use 2008. Through these intersections we were able to identify which the <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> of 2008 became in a land use in 2010, as well as the land uses in 2008 which were characterized as <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in 2010. The results were similar: in both analyzes, the clean pasture was with highest percentage. About 40 % of the <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in 2008 became clean pasture in 2010 and 31 % of the <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in 2010 used to be clean pasture in 2008.

At the species level, the relationship was explored between habitat breadth, distribution extent and the ability to occupy recently <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> Location: Iberia and Southern France Methods: Fieldwork and bibliography were assembled to obtain breeding bird inventories for 21 <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> mostly large wildfires (135 - 23, 800 ha). The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the 11 fire locations surveyed using transects. Results: Single <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species (mean = 7. 6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species, including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa, Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens also bred in particular <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> After controlling for the extent of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine occurrence in <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> was positively related to the species’ habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> and species composition was correlated with the fire extent (Mantel test). Species richness tended to increase with increasing fire area. From the regression equation 5, 9, 12 - 13 and 16 - 17 open-habitat species may be expected to occur in <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> of 100, 1000, 10, 000 and 100, 000 ha, respectively. Conclusions: This study stresses the importance of biogeographical constraints on colonisation of new habitat patches created by disturbances. The extent of the fire rather than the proximity between <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> influenced species richness and composition of open-habitat birds in recently <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> The best post-fire colonisers were generalists regarding habitat structure.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate at regional scale the variability in <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> over the savannahs of West Africa and their links with the rainfall and the large-scale climatic indexes such as the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and sea surface temperature gradient (SSTG). Daily satellite products (L 3 JRC) of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> from the SPOT Vegetation sensor at a moderate spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km between 2000 and 2007 were analyzed over the West African savannah in this paper. Results from seasonal analysis revealed a large increase in <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> from November to February, with consistent peaks in December at the regional scale. In addition, about 30 % of the pixels are burned {{at least four times}} within the 7 -year period. Positive correlations were found between <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> and rainfall values obtained from the TRMM satellite over savannahs located above 8 ° N, meaning that a wet rainfall season over these regions was favorable to biomass availability in the next dry season and therefore may induce an increase in <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in this region. Moreover, our results showed a nonlinear relationship between the large-scale climatic indexes SOI, MEI, NAO and SSTG and burned-area anomalies. Positive (negative) correlations between <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> and SOI (MEI) were consistent over the Sahel and Sudano-Sahelian areas.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Spatial and {{temporal}} analysis of MODIS and AVHRR images {{have been carried}} out to discriminate <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> from other land covers. Spatial {{and temporal}} analysis were per-formed based on statistical separability and temporal changes. The objective of these analysis was to find out the most sensitive bands for burned land mapping in order to design spectral in-dices better adapted to the discrimination of <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> MODIS images were found to be more sensitive than AVHRR images, caused by both the better spatial and spectral resolution. The near infrared and short-wave infrared bands were found more adequate than visible channels to separate <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> from other land covers, although the thermal channels of AVHRR also contributed significantly to separability indices. This may be caused by the short time span be-tween fire occurrence and image acquisition. These analysis will be the basis to derive global mapping of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> from coarse resolution sensors, such as MODIS and AVHRR. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} improvements to the quantitative modelling of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in Europe under historical climate. The Standalone Fire Model (SFM) based on a state-of-the-art large scale mechanistic fire modelling algorithm is used to reproduce historical <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> reported in the two publicly available datasets – European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) and Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). The most recent versions of these sources allow a broader validation of SFM’s modelled <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> at a country level. Our analysis is carried out for the years 2000 – 2008 for 17 European countries utilising both EFFIS and GFED datasets for model benchmarking. We suggest improving the original model by modifying the fire probability function reflecting fuel moisture. This modification allows for a dramatic improvement of accuracy in modelled <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> {{for a range of}} European countries. We also explore in detail a pixel-level parametrisation of firefighting efficiency in SFM along with modifications of the biomass map. In comparison with the aggregated country-level approach, the advantages of the finer calibration are quite minor for the most recent version of the GFED dataset. Overall, the annual <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> modelled by this improved SFM version are in good agreement with historical observations...|$|R
