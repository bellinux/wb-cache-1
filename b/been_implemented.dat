5|$|Despite serious {{discussion}} among lawyers, scholars, legislators, and others about various reform proposals, none have <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> and no consensus exists about which remedy, if any, {{would be the}} most appropriate and effective.|$|E
5|$|On May 13, 2010, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov {{claimed that}} {{ninety percent of}} {{decisions}} taken by the second Tymoshenko government had not <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> in Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Some clock-shift {{problems}} {{could be avoided}} by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity and has never <b>been</b> <b>implemented.</b>|$|E
3000|$|... 2 <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> on the {{operation}} sequence vector {{and the machine}} assignment vector successively. IPOX <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> on {{the operation}} sequence vector and MPX <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> on the machine assignment vector.|$|R
50|$|Total failure: the {{initiative}} <b>was</b> never <b>implemented,</b> <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> but immediately abandoned, or <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> but achieved {{none of its}} goals.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sexual and}} asexual {{reproduction}}s <b>are</b> <b>implemented.</b> Asexual reproduction <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as producing the offspring's genome (the gene network) by directly copying the parent's genome. Sexual reproduction <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as the recombination {{of the two}} parents' genomes.|$|R
5|$|The FLOW-MATIC {{language}} was particularly influential {{because it had}} <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> and because AIMACO was a derivative of it with only minor changes.|$|E
5|$|After iodine {{fortification}} {{programs such}} as iodisation of salt have <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> some cases of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism have been observed (so-called Jod-Basedow phenomenon). The condition seems to occur mainly in people over forty, and the risk appears higher when iodine deficiency is severe and the initial rise in iodine intake is high.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meteorological}} surveys alert about hurricanes {{or severe}} storms, {{in the areas}} where the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there are specific storm surge warnings. These have <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> for instance, in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Because {{digital systems}} {{need not be}} causal, some {{operations}} can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in the digital domain that cannot <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> using discrete analog components. Digital filters that require finite numbers of future values can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> while the analog counterparts cannot.|$|R
50|$|Most context models <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> as hash tables. Some small {{contexts}} <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> {{as direct}} lookup tables.|$|R
50|$|Most of TRIPOS <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> in BCPL. The kernel and device drivers <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> in {{assembly}} language.|$|R
5|$|At the time, floating-point {{division}} was generally expensive compared to multiplication; the fast inverse square root algorithm bypassed the division step, giving it its performance advantage. Quake III Arena, a first-person shooter video game, used the fast inverse square root algorithm to accelerate graphics computation, but the algorithm has since <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> in some dedicated hardware vertex shaders using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>{{implemented}}</b> in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for a freeway {{passing through a}} downtown area, charging by the distance traveled. Congestion pricing has been used since 2007 during rush hours {{in order to maintain}} reasonable speeds within the city core.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing in {{the form}} of {{variable}} tolls by time-of-the-day have also <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> in bridges and tunnels providing access to the central business districts of several major cities. In most cases there was a toll already in existence.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Digital {{radiology}} <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> system wide; and one electronic {{medical record}} <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> at all Billings Clinic locations.|$|R
5000|$|The dominant-strategy revelation-principle {{says that}} every social-choice {{function}} that can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in dominant-strategies can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> by a DSIC mechanism.|$|R
30|$|The {{functions}} (link, format, button, {{and page}} title) that can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> through markup language {{should not only}} <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> through Java script because if they only depend on it, the link, format, button, and page title may not <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> {{in an environment where}} such implementation is impossible.|$|R
5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|Historian Adrian R. Lewis postulates that American {{casualties}} {{would have}} been greatly reduced if a longer barrage had <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> although the First Infantry Division Chief of Staff stated that the Division {{would not have been}} able to move off the beach without effective naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Northern Territory Government's Department of Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts (now defunct) {{proposed}} {{a plan for}} management of the trade in eggs and nestlings of C. b. macrorhynchus. To date the plan has not <b>been</b> <b>implemented.</b>|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, {{the main}} model of Land Reforms that <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the}} Market-led Agrarian Reform (MLAR) approach. Within the MLAR, the {{strategic}} partnership (SP) model <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> in seven claimant communities in Levubu in the Limpopo province. The SP model <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> between 2005-2008 that {{ended up in a}} fiasco leading to creation of conflict between several interested parties.|$|R
5000|$|Provides {{interfaces}} for the C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB, Octave, and Ruby programming languages. The C and C++ interfaces <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> natively; the C#, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby interfaces <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> using SWIG, the Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator; and the MATLAB and Octave interfaces <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> through custom hand-written code.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{recommendations}} <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> by the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958 and Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992; others <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> by administrative practice.|$|R
5|$|In {{the inner}} city, {{motorised}} traffic is highly regulated, larger parts are pedestrianised {{and in the}} 2000s, a system of roads prioritised for cyclists have <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> connecting to suburban areas. Aarhus Light Rail, a system of electric tram-trains and {{the first of its}} kind in Denmark, is expected to open at some point in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has a reputed 2 million {{trees and}} was once {{described}} as the greenest city in Europe, however since Sheffield City Council signed a controversial 25 year PFI contract with Amey plc in 2012 an aggressive programme of highway tree felling has <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> across the city, resulting in widespread local protests.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5000|$|Avoid {{duplication}} in the code: {{the general}} workflow structure <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> {{once in the}} abstract class's algorithm, and necessary variations <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> in the subclasses.|$|R
50|$|The country’s {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>implementing</b> {{health care}} reform by focusing on surgery, and a WHO toolkit <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> at medical institutions to help.|$|R
30|$|Three feature extractors <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> and {{included}} in the O-FIm framework herein. All features <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> to normalize the computed values in the interval [0, 1].|$|R
5|$|The field-map {{navigation}} system is largely unchanged from Final Fantasy X; {{it is still}} dominantly three dimensional with mostly continuous locations. A few upgrades have <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> providing the player with extended interaction with the environment through jumping, climbing and rotating camera angles.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} proved successful, {{according to}} Alberts, when the released head-started iguanas reacted to predators, foraged for food, and behaved like their wild-born counterparts. This strategy has <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> {{with great success}} with other critically endangered species of Cyclura and Ctenosaura throughout the West Indies and Central America, notably the Jamaican iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana, Ricord's iguana, Allen Cays iguana, Acklins ground iguana, and Anegada iguana.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} measures have <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> including site access restrictions, {{the collection and}} cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that not all {{sequential}} circuits can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> using the Mealy model. Some sequential circuits can only <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> as Moore machines.|$|R
50|$|The dominant-strategy revelation-principle {{says that}} every social-choice {{function}} that can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in dominant-strategies can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> by a dominant-strategy-incentive-compatible (DSIC) mechanism (introduced by Allan Gibbard).|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the use of}} an {{adjusted}} algorithm can improve the performance of a nested query execution containing join operations. Apart from the equijoin, the union, Cartesian product, Θ-join, and intersection operations can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in a pipelining way. The difference, however, cannot <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in this way. The proposed algorithms <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> in PRISMA/D...|$|R
