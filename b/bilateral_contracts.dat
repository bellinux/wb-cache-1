25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through <b>bilateral</b> <b>contracts</b> on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E

40|$|Problem Statement: Deregulation {{power systems}} have been force to change their structures, from {{vertically}} integrated to open market systems. Each generation company (Genco) is required to compete with rivals through bidding in a pool market and making a <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> with a distribution company (Disco) or consumers to maximize its own profits. A unit commitment becomes responsible for each Genco and difficult for Genco that have one generation plant or small generation capacity. The objective of a Genco is to maximize its profits with makes a decision submit bidding price function to the Independent System Operator (ISO). In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary and important for a small Genco to build optimal bidding strategies considering a <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> and a unit commitment with constraints in time periods for possibilities to get a discontinuous dispatch that could reduce total profits. Approach: The proposed methodology employs an optimization method like Lagrange Relaxation to solve the optimal bidding problem. The solution procedure is applied in the study case and change the market condition to show the effect of <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> to marginal clearing price (MCP), generation output and total profit for a small Genco. Result: The result of the proposed method shows that a Genco can build optimal bidding strategies to maximize total profit considering unit commitment and <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract.</b> Simulation results of a numerical example have demonstrated the <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> reduced the hourly MCP. The <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> will guarantee the Genco getting continuous dispatch during time periods. Conclusions/Recommendations: The proposed method for building optimal bidding strategies in a day-ahead electricity market to maximize total profit considering unit commitment and <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> is helpful for a Genco to make decision in submit bidding to an ISO...|$|R

Experiments support predictions on the emergence of nonlinear pricing, but not those concerning efficiency. Coordination problems are the culprit.

This is good for the firm, but can be bad for competitors and downstream entities (such as distributors or consumers). A monopoly is the most extreme case, where prices might be raised to the monopoly price instead of the lower equilibrium price. An oligopoly is another potentially undesirable situation in which limited competition may allow higher prices than a market with more participants.|$|E

40|$|In an {{electricity}} market, generation companies (Gencos) face price risks due to {{the high}} fluctuation of the spot energy price. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> market provides an efficient way for Gencos to hedge the price risk. Therefore, making appropriate trading strategy and allocating energy between spot and <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> markets can help Gencos to achieve their trading objective of maximizing profits and minimizing risks to a large extent. Based on the mean-variance criterion, a trading decision model is proposed in which price characteristics of each trading interval during the planning period are considered and different trading strategy is made for different trading interval. Based on the historical data of the USA PJM market, simulation results confirm the rationality and efficiency of the proposed model. An analytical approach for Gencos to make trading strategies is developed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|A {{real estate}} {{contract}} is a contract between parties {{for the purchase}} and sale, exchange, or other conveyance of real estate. The sale of land is governed by the laws and practices of the jurisdiction in which the land is located. Real estate called leasehold estate is actually a rental of real property such as an apartment, and leases (rental contracts) cover such rentals since they typically do not result in recordable deeds. Freehold ("More permanent") conveyances of real estate are covered by real estate contracts, including conveying fee simple title, life estates, remainder estates, and freehold easements. Real estate contracts are typically <b>bilateral</b> <b>contracts</b> (i. e., agreed to by two parties) and should have the legal requirements specified by contract law in general and should also be in writing to be enforceable.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to study the risk of {{long-term}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> in the deregulated power system. A model for long-term <b>bilateral</b> <b>contract</b> pricing with risks of congestion is presented. The negotiated income, variable fuel cost, investment depreciation, and congestion payment during the whole contract period are involved in this model. Based on the principle of noarbitrage, the negotiated income is derived. The congestion payment is modeled as a random variable to take into account the fluctuation and uncertainties of load demand. For each operating scenario, the congestion charge is evaluated by AC OPF approach. A numerical method so-called 2 n-concentration scheme is proposed to obtain the statistical characteristic of congestion charge instead of Monte Carlo simulation. Comparing with the Monte Carlo simulation, this method is less computation time consuming with acceptable numerical precision. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed method. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|State {{renewable}} portfolio standard (RPS) policies require {{utilities and}} load-serving entities (LSEs) to procure renewable energy generation.

However, policymakers and regulators in several states are beginning to explore the use of alternatives, namely feed-in tariffs (FITs) and auctions to procure renewable energy supply. This report evaluates four procurement strategies (competitive solicitations, <b>bilateral</b> <b>contracting,</b> FITs, and auctions) against four main criteria: (1) pricing; (2) complexity and efficiency of the procurement process; (3) impacts on developers access to markets; and (4) ability to complement utility decision-making processes.
