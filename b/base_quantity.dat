50|$|Another {{theory is}} that the Babylonians {{subdivided}} the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system. The earliest trigonometry, used by the Babylonian astronomers and their Greek successors, was based on chords of a circle.

A supplemental agreement added a further 1,449 vehicles (plus an option for 363 vehicles) to the second HEMTT contract in April 1989; the contract option was exercised. The third HEMTT production {{contract was}} awarded mid-1994 and when deliveries under this concluded over 14,000 HEMTTS had been produced.

50|$|If {{the force}} {{equation}} defines B, where q or I have been previously defined, then the flux equation defines ΦB, since B {{has been previously}} defined unambiguously. If the flux equation defines B, where ΦB, the force equation may be a defining equation for I or q. Notice the contradiction when B both equations define B simultaneously and when B is not a base quantity; the force equation demands that q or I be defined elsewhere {{while at the same}} time the flux equation demands that q or I be defined by the force equation, similarly the force equation requires ΦB to be defined by the flux equation, at the same time the flux equation demands that ΦB is defined elsewhere. For both equations to be used as definitions simultaneously, B must be a <b>base</b> <b>quantity</b> so that F and ΦB can be defined to stem from B unambiguously.|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} {{physical}} dimension {{of a physical}} quantity was introduced by Joseph Fourier in 1822. By convention, physical quantities are organized in a dimensional system built upon <b>base</b> <b>quantities,</b> {{each of which is}} regarded as having its own dimension.|$|R

50|$|Later science {{developments}} {{showed that}} either electric charge or electric current {{could be added}} to extend the set of <b>base</b> <b>quantities</b> by which many other metrological units could be easily defined. (However, electrical units are not necessary for such a set. Gaussian units, for example, have only length, mass, and time as <b>base</b> <b>quantities,</b> and the ampere is {{defined in terms of}} other units.) Other quantities, such as power and speed, are derived from the base set: for example, speed is distance per unit time. Historically a wide range of units was used for the same type of quantity: in different contexts, length was measured in inches, feet, yards, fathoms, rods, chains, furlongs, miles, nautical miles, stadia, leagues, with conversion factors which were not powers of ten. Such arrangements were satisfactory in their own contexts.|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of angles within the SI is anomalous {{compared with other}} quantities, {{and there is a}} case for removing this anomaly by declaring plane angle to be an additional <b>base</b> <b>quantity</b> within the system. It is shown that this could bring several benefits in terms of treating angle on an equal basis with other metrics, removing potentially harmful ambiguities, and bringing SI units more in line with concepts in basic physics, but at the expense of significant upheaval to familiar equations within mathematics and physics. This paper sets out {{the most important of these}} changes so that an alternative unit system containing angle as a <b>base</b> <b>quantity</b> can be seen in the round, irrespective of whether it is ever widely adopted. The alternative formulas and units can be treated as the underlying, more general equations of mathematical physics, independent of the units used for angle, which are conventionally simplified by implicitly assuming that the unit used for angle is the radian.

40|$|It {{is shown}} here that five base {{quantities}} (and the corresponding five base units) of nature are sufficient to define all derived quantities (and their units) and to describe all natural phenomena. The base quantities (and their base units) are: length (m), mass (kg), time (s), temperature (K) and electric charge (C). The {{amount of substance}} (mole) is not taken as a <b>base</b> <b>quantity</b> {{of nature and the}} Avogadro constant is not considered as a fundamental constant of nature, as they are both based on an arbitrary definition (due to the arbitrary value of 0. 012 kg for the mass of 1 mole of C- 12 isotope). Therefore, the amount of substance (mole) is moved from the list of base quantities to the category of the supplementary units (to be re-created after its abrogation in 1995). Based on its definition, the luminous intensity (cd) is not a <b>base</b> <b>quantity</b> (unit), therefore it is moved to the list of derived quantities (units). The ampere and coulomb are exchanged by places in the list of base and derived units, as ampere is a speed of coulombs (but SI defines meter, not its speed as a base unit). The five base quantities are re-defined in this paper by connecting them to five fundamental constants of nature (the most accurately known frequency of the hydrogen atom, the speed of light, the Planck constant, the Boltzmann constant and the elementary charge) with their numerical values fixed in accordance with their CODATA 2006 values (to be improved by further experiments) ...|$|E
