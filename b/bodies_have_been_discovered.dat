5|$|The {{principal}} {{locations where}} bog <b>bodies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> are the Northern European countries of Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and especially Denmark. The oldest of these bodies dates to about 8000 BC, {{although the majority}} of specimens in Denmark are from the Pre-Roman Iron Age to Roman Iron Age era (about 500 BC to 400 AD). As of 2006, more than 700ancient <b>bodies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in these sites, although other estimates have placed the number in the thousands. It is difficult for scientists to ascertain a precise number because many of the bodies have been lost or destroyed. Before archaeologists began actively searching for bog bodies, the bodies were discovered mostly during the routine extraction of peat, and then reburied or discarded. After the discovery that systematic conservation of Iron Age bodies was attributable to the acidic anaerobic environs, major excavations have occurred in Jutland. Other bog bodies recovered on the Jutland peninsula which have undergone as extensive an analysis as the Haraldskær Woman include Tollund Man, Grauballe Man, Elling Woman, Huldremose Woman and the Borremose Woman.|$|E

5000|$|Reception to Browne's claims {{has been}} mixed. John Suthers, Colorado {{politician}} and former state Attorney General, {{has stated that}} Browne's story is credible. Journalist Dave Herrera, in contrast, has expressed skepticism about Browne's claims of being a serial killer. Herrera notes that no <b>bodies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> or definitely linked to Browne and only seven of his confessions are detailed enough for even a tentative link to an unsolved crime. Herrera argues that Browne is motivated by a desire for attention and/or better medical care, and further describes previous journalistic investigation of Browne's claims as [...] "surprisingly slipshod" [...] and uncritical of his story.|$|E
40|$|In {{this new}} Millennium, NASA will expand its {{presence}} in space. Many new planetary <b>bodies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered,</b> and some previously known bodies are now believed to have oceans. We now know of 66 moons in our own Solar System, one with an atmosphere, 16 with water ice or oceans, and 5 with both. In addition, we now know of 20 extra-solar planets. In order to expand our presence in space and explore in a cost effective manner, we need a repertoire of new types of planetary exploration vehicles to explore both atmospheres and oceans. To address this need a spectrum of new classes of vehicles are being developed. These include aerobots and hydrobots, and incorporate Department of Defense miniaturization developments and smart materials. This paper outlines: the remarkable miniaturization developments applicable to robotic vehicles for the exploration of planetary atmospheres and oceans; Aerobots, the vehicles designed for planetary atmospheric exploration; Hydrobots, those designed for planetary ocean exploration; planetary atmospheric data; and Europa ocean exploration missions...|$|E

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Dionne Espinoza, Mohammed Abed, Michael Soldatenko, Bianca GuzmanFemicide, Feminicide, Foucault, Juarez, Postcolonial, VictimSince 1993 women's violated, {{mutilated}} {{and murdered}} <b>bodies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> {{in and around}} Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Initially, these murders went unnoticed by the general public, unreported by mainstream press, and uninvestigated by authorities. Since the late 1990 's feminist scholars, journalists, activists, and artists have intervened to raise awareness about the violence and build a body {{of knowledge about the}} murders now termed a feminicide. Making use of analytical models from Michel Foucault, Uma Narayan and Chandra Mohanty, I apply a Foucaldian archaeological postcolonial feminist analysis to a sample of North American feminist texts on the feminicide. I reveal how discourses on victims problematically rely on, and implicitly support, sexist identities of women. These identities are illustrated by female cultural icons. I evaluate the dangers in countering normative identities for material women and explore the potential to resist binding identities in cultural iconography...|$|E

He and his mate, worrying round with a rake, had drawn up pieces of torn clothing, and this, of course, had led to the pond being properly dragged. Otherwise the discovery might never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made.|$|R

5000|$|The {{body was}} sent for {{forensic}} examination by Prof. James Webster.

From the measurement of the trunk in which the <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered,</b> he also deduced that she must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> placed there [...] "still warm" [...] after the killing, as she could not have fit once rigor mortis had taken hold.|$|R
50|$|On the {{day that}} Cave's <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>{{discovered}},</b> Colton Pitonyak and Laura Hall escaped from the United States, using Hall's automobile.

The Mexican law enforcement drove the two to the Mexico-United States border. There, U.S. Marshals arrested Pitonyak. Hall was allowed to leave by herself.|$|R
50|$|Tetley {{was never}} able to raise enough money to {{completely}} outfit the new boat. Though showing no outward signs of stress or depression, he went missing on 2 February 1972. His body was found three days later, hanging from a tree in woods near Dover, England. Three weeks later, at the coroner's inquest, it was revealed that the <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> clothed in lingerie and the hands were bound behind the back.

That evening the papers teemed with glaring Jack-the-Strangler headlines, denouncing the brutality of the deed and complaining about the laxity of the police.
