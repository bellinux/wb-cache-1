40|$|It {{is shown}} that, {{in the context}} of globalization, {{improved}} credit support for strategic sectors of the economy (for example, shipbuilding) can be achieved through the creation of a <b>banking</b> <b>consortium</b> based around leasing. A dialectical method of resolution of system tasks is selected as the methodological approach. Methods used include: comparative cost analysis of the strategic lending industry supporting the formation and development of a banking consortium; integrated method at the condition modeling of making and implementation of a lease agreement, which allowed to accommodate the interests for both parties of such agreement; optimization method to select the conditions of a lease agreement; classification and analytical method to clarify the classification of lease. The study proved and developed a plan of creation a <b>banking</b> <b>consortium,</b> including options of interaction of such consortium with potential customers based on a lease agreement. The process of functioning of the lease agreement in order to optimize it for both a bank consortium-lessor and a lessee is modeled. The significant advantages of leasing compared to the traditional lending for both parties of leasing, especially when ensuring long-term projects are summarized. The results of the research can be applied in the strategic lending industries development and can reduce the level of banking risks. Applying the results of the research in the social aspect can maintain and increase the number of jobs including the banking sector. The value of the work leis {{in the fact that the}} author has developed a new approach to achive the credit support for strategic sectors of the economy through the creation of the <b>banking</b> <b>consortium</b> based around leasing, which allows to protect the interests of both parties...|$|R
40|$|Marking the 30 th {{anniversary of}} the {{formation}} of Orion Bank in 1970, financial historian Richard Roberts has written a history of Orion and the rise and decline of the <b>consortium</b> <b>banking</b> movement. <b>Consortium</b> <b>banks</b> were formed as joint ventures to enable banks to operate in the booming Euromarkets, with virtually every major international bank participating in a <b>consortium</b> <b>bank</b> during their heyday in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Orion Bank was one of the leading players in the Euromarkets in those decades: its shareholders were six of the biggest banks in the world from the three major trading blocks: Chase Manhattan, Royal Bank of Canada, NatWest, Westdeutsche Landesbank, Credito Italiano and Mitsubishi <b>Bank.</b> Like other <b>consortiums</b> <b>banks,</b> Orion Bank was prominent in Eurocurrency syndicated lending, but more unusually, it was also a top Eurobond lead manager. The story of Orion exemplifies the tensions inherent in the joint venture approach to business development and the strategic dilemmas facing <b>consortium</b> <b>bank</b> managements and shareholders. Richard Roberts uses primary archival papers and interviews with former Orion executives and other bankers prominent in <b>consortium</b> and investment <b>banking</b> to present an authoritative case study with great topical relevance as today's European banking industry continues to integrate across borders. Take Your Partners is also an invaluable source of reference for anyone with an interest in the Euromarkets and the development of international banking...|$|R
