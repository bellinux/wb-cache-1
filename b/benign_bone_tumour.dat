40|$|Osteochondroma, {{also known}} as osteocartilaginous exostosis, is the most {{frequent}} <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumour</b> of the skeletal system. Despite its preference for long bones (tibia and femur), osteochondroma may occur in some short bones developing endochondral ossification. Seventy-five {{percent of the patients}} present only with a single lesion, whereas 25 % have multiple lesions; this last clinical condition, defined as osteochondromatosis (disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance) shows a high risk of malignant transformation (about 11 %). In the craniofacial area this tumour is very rare. The sites of predilection are the coronoid process and mandibular condyle, even though osteochondromas arising {{from the base of the}} skull, maxillary sinus and zygomatic arch have been previously described. However, an osteochondroma originating from the frontotemporosphenoidal suture has not been reported before in the literature.

30|$|Ilizarov {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} induction of local bone formation with a minimally invasive procedure, the process he called distraction osteogenesis (DO) [8]. DO has been used widely to treat traumatic bone loss, nonunion, osteomyelitis, malunion, limb-length discrepancy and to correct deformity [9, 10, 11, 12]. The method embraces biomechanical stability, minimally invasive surgery, regeneration of new bone with gradual lengthening of the soft tissues [5]. There are few studies of its use {{in the treatment of}} <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumours</b> [13, 14]. In this study we describe our experience of the use of external fixators to correct deformity, limb-length discrepancy, contractures and similar problems related to the primary treatment of <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumours</b> or for the secondary complications of other primary treatment.|$|R
40|$|Osteoid osteoma is a <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumour</b> with {{self-limiting}} {{growth potential}} occurring in {{any part of}} the body.

This article also reviews the cases of osteoid osteoma of the craniofacial complex reported in the English-language literature to date. Although the clinical presentation of osteoid osteoma in the jaw differs from that of osteoid osteoma in the more common locations, the radiographic features are similar. In both cases presented, computed tomography revealed a small round osseous lesion with sharp margins in the TMJ. Bone scintigraphy was performed in order to differentiate the lesions from other osseous lesions. Both patients underwent surgical excision of the lesion with immediate relief of the pain. The importance of early recognition of the clinical and imaging characteristics of an osteoid osteoma of the TMJ is emphasized, in order to prevent misdiagnosis and avoid discouraging therapies...|$|E
40|$|Osteoid osteoma is a {{relatively}} frequent <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumour,</b> consisting of osteoid and woven bone, and surrounded by a halo of reactive sclerotic bone, with an average size of the nidus less than 1. 5 cm.

Nestin protein was mainly restricted to prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes in osteo-chondroma. Nestin levels were significantly higher in osteochondromas in adolescents (age range 4 – 18 years, n = 32) than in osteochondromas in young adults (age range 20 – 28 years, n = 11), and significantly higher in osteochondromas in young adults than in those in older adults (age range 40 – 77 years; n = 5). Nestin protein was not present in normal growth plates.

40|$|Osteoid osteoma is a {{relatively}} common <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumour,</b> always small in size (less than 2 cm) and painful. It occurs mainly in children and young adults. The basic radiological element is a distinctive small rounded area of osteolysis, the ‘nidus’, which consists of osteoid tissue surrounded by a halo of hyperostosis on radiographs or signal intensity on MRI. MRI and Radio-isotope bone scanning always reveals a rounded area of intense increased uptake and dynamic-contrast CT can distinguish it from osteomyelitis. The clinical feature of the lesion is local pain, typically more severe at night and often promptly responding to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The reconstruction procedures included eight prosthetic replacements, four devitalised tumorous bone grafts, three osteoarticular allografts, two autogenous fibular grafts, one intramedullary cemented nail, three Tikhoff-Linberg procedures, two replantation of shortened arms, and four humeral head suspensions. Six partial scapulectomies and two lateral clavicectomies needed no bone reconstruction.

40|$|Surgical navigation, though well-established, {{is often}} {{associated}} with extra effort for both patient and surgeon, and with additional exposure to radiation {{as a result of the}} necessary extra imaging. Osteoblastoma is a <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumour,</b> malignant transformation of which is rare but possible, and so resection is indicated. The orbit with surrounding structures is a challenging region for accurate three-dimensional reconstruction. A virtual plan based on the patient's mirrored anatomy realised by intraoperative navigation can assist in achieving perfect results. An 8 -year-old boy presented with a huge osteoblastoma of the frontal and temporal skull. The tumour had extracranial and intracranial parts, and reached into the orbital roof and the sphenoid and ethmoid bones. The ethmoid sinus was involved, the eye was displaced, and he had functional problems. Virtual planning and navigation were prepared without the need for any additional imaging. The tumour was resected through a coronal approach, and immediately reconstructed with an autologous calvarial split graft, designed and positioned under navigation with a preoperative plan that was based on the mirrored healthy side. Surgical navigation based on a virtual plan can achieve symmetrical results, particularly when dealing with complex three-dimensional anatomy. Navigation does not necessarily mean additional procedures or imaging. We think that virtual planning and navigation are useful for selected cases...|$|E
40|$|Osteochondroma is {{the most}} common <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumour.</b> They most {{commonly}} affect the long tubular bones and almost half of osteochondromata are found around the knee. Osteochondroma arising from the distal metaphysis of the tibia typically result in a valgus deformity of the ankle joint secondary to relative shortening of the fibula. This case describes the use of Ilizarov technique for fibular lengthening following excision of a distal tibial osteochondroma. A 12 -year-old girl presented with a 3 -year history of a large swelling affecting the lateral aspect of the right distal tibia. Plain radiographs confirmed a large sessile osteochondroma arising from the postero-lateral aspect of the distal tibia with deformity of the fibula and 15  mm of fibular shortening. The patient underwent excision through a postero-lateral approach and subsequent fibular lengthening by Ilizarov technique. The patient made excellent recovery with removal of frame after 21  weeks and had made a full recovery with normal ankle function by 6  months. The Ilizarov method is a commonly accepted method of performing distraction osteogenesis for limb inequalities; however, this is mainly for the tibia, femur and humerus. We are unaware of any previous cases using the Ilizarov method for fibular lengthening. This case demonstrates the success of the Ilizarov method in restoring both fibular length and normal ankle anatomy...|$|E
30|$|There are {{advantages}} of using distraction osteogenesis {{in the treatment}} of problems and sequelae after primary treatment for <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumours.</b> The risks for recurrence of shortening and deformity in young patients may be minimized with overcorrection or over-lengthening. There appears to be no increased risk of malignant degeneration from osteotomy through diseased bone or there being low-quality regenerate bone at the distraction site. We believe that external fixation is an effective technique for treating defects, problems and complications related to <b>benign</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tumours</b> or the effects arising from wide excision of the primary lesion. It offers a good alternative to other conventional methods of management. There are some disadvantages to this technique such as pin track infection, the bulk and encumbrance of the fixator and the prolonged treatment period. The choice of external fixator is dictated by the complexity of problem and the anatomical location but, in general, the circular fixators are more suitable than the unilateral fixators for the simultaneous treatment of deformity and limb-length discrepancy.|$|R
