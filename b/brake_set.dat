As one of auxiliary <b>brake</b> <b>sets</b> eddy current retarder had good braking performance and braking stability, and it is automotive and maintain constant speed by its continual braking. In this paper, key technologies of eddy current retarder, such as braking torque, working volt and current, magnetic circuit, material of rotor plate and iron, heat dissipation performance of rotor plate, match between eddy current retarded and automobile, and effect of temperature rise on its braking performance were presented and discussed in detail. Meanwhile, advantage and disadvantage of eddy current retarder were analyzed...|$|R

5000|$|A peculiarly British {{practice}} was the [...] "loose-coupled" [...] freight train. This used three-link chain couplings with {{no means of}} drawing the wagons together: since such trains were not fitted with an automatic through-train braking system there were no pipes to connect between the vehicles. The couplings in the train were kept taut by the last vehicle of the train being a heavily ballasted guard's van with its <b>brakes</b> <b>set</b> slightly on. This helped prevent snapped couplings. Such trains travelled at low speeds and were phased out in the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|Street biased riders tend {{to choose}} disk brakes more often. Part {{of this is}} that disks are almost {{invariably}} better at controlling the speed of a bike while it is rolling, that is they can take more energy per unit time from the rider (i.e. they have more power, which is why they dominate all other off-road cycling disciplines), but most disks will not hold a wheel locked as firmly as a rim brake, making them less desirable for competition trials. Rim <b>brakes</b> <b>set</b> up for trials tend to squeal or howl if they are pulled while the wheel is turning, occasionally leading to trials riders attracting undesirable attention or being considered a nuisance for noise pollution.|$|R

In such cases, excessive braking at the rear axle might induce instability. We present and compare two predictive control approaches, where the objective is maximizing the regenerative braking and distributing the friction braking at the four wheels, while (i) delivering the braking force requested by the driver, (ii) preserving vehicle stability and (iii) fulfilling system constraints (e. g., bounds on regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>set</b> by the hybrid powertrain). We present simulation results in combined braking and cornering scenarios, showing that the proposed approaches are able to distribute the requested braking at the four wheels in order to counteract undesired effects, on vehicle stability, introduced by regenerative braking...|$|R

Eddy current {{retarder}} was a retarder <b>braking</b> <b>set</b> {{used in an}} automobile, and it {{can transform}} kinetic energy or mechanical energy of the automobile into heat energy, and heat energy was emitted around environment by the blades founded in the rotor of eddy current retarder, so flow field within the blade had direct effect on heat elimination and braking performance. In this paper two styles of 2 D computational model for the rotor had been established. The flow field between and out of blades were analyzed by using RNG Κ-ε model and energy equation. The velocity distribution, pressure distribution between blades, static pressure on work face and rear face of the blade along radial direction all were accepted. The pressure, velocity and air flux for two styles of the blades had been compared. Numerical analysis of flow field {{was in favor of}} improved structure design for the blade...|$|R
5000|$|A car {{should be}} allowed to come to a {{complete}} stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open inhibitor switch (sometimes called a [...] "neutral safety switch") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot brake applied before the transmission can be taken out of park. The Park position is omitted on buses/coaches (and some road tractors) with automatic transmission (on which a parking pawl is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the air-operated parking <b>brakes</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R

50|$|Before {{leaving the}} cab, the {{engineer}} applied the locomotive's independent air brake. During mainline operation, {{he would also}} have applied the automatic air <b>brake,</b> <b>setting</b> the <b>brakes</b> {{in each of the}} train's cars. But, as is normal for intra-yard movements, the air brakes of the train were disconnected from the locomotive, and thus were not functional. Furthermore, applying the locomotive's brakes disabled the train's dead man's switch, which would otherwise have applied the train brakes and cut the engine power. The engineer also tried to apply the locomotive's dynamic brake, but failed to do so. He then set the throttle for the traction motors at 100%. If the dynamic brakes had been selected as intended, this throttle setting would have caused the train to slow down. However, since dynamic braking was not engaged, the setting caused the train to accelerate. Therefore, the only functioning brake was the air brake on the locomotive, and this was not enough to counteract its engine power.|$|R
50|$|In many Japanese {{passenger}} and freight trains, an EB {{reset switch}} is provided which is activated by sounding a buzzer and {{lighting up the}} EB reset switch when the driver does not operate the controls within 60 seconds of last operation (30 seconds on Aonami Line, 40 seconds on JR Kyushu lines). If the EB switch is not pressed (reset) within 5 seconds of being activated, it will trigger an emergency brake application so as to prevent accidents due to driver error or when the driver is incapacitated. Also, a red button and/or an emergency <b>brake</b> <b>setting</b> on the levers are provided in the driver's cab so the driver can manually activate the emergency brake; these can also be activated (like a dead man's handle) when the driver feels unwell or is incapacitated in trains without the EB reset switch.

50|$|One of the then-innovative {{features}} {{to be used}} by the V-1000 was its adoption of the Rolls-Royce Conway engine, the world's first turbofan engine. During takeoff, the Conway's power was to have been boosted by water-methanol injection, of which the aircraft was to carry 550 gallons within the inner wing root. Additionally, uprated versions of the Conway engine were under development, which would have been available for use on the V-1000. The flying controls of the wing consisted of multiple flaps, the inner set of which being single-slotted and the outer pair being double-slotted, two-section independently operated ailerons, and multi-section dive <b>brakes</b> <b>set</b> across various locations of the upper and lower wing surfaces. The tail surfaces were conventional and adopted a similar shape to that used for the wing; the tailplanes had a pronounced dihedral to keep them clear of the jet exhaust. The elevators were split into four separate sections while the rudder was divided into three separately-controlled pieces.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} braking is {{important}} in automotive performance, which impacts the safety of traffic. Several parameters of braking can be determined on stationary test stands, however, more accurate data {{that can be used}} in a more simple way in practise are gained by doing tests on the road. Based on EU legal documents on determining parameters of braking, a research methodology has been elaborated and approbated for determining parameters of braking for automobiles in road tests. To determine the parameters of braking, scientific radar Stalker ATS transferring data to a computer were used. Road tests were done for automobiles of various age groups and constructions, determining the period, distance, and deceleration rate of braking. According to the research data, the parameters of braking of the used automobiles comply with the standard for parameters of <b>braking</b> <b>set</b> by the EU. The effectiveness of parameters of braking does not mostly depend on the age of automobiles, but on the technical condition of the brake system.
