2500|$|To {{shape the}} science of the film, Boyle and Garland hired {{scientific}} advisers, including NASA employees and astrophysicists. Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester, was hired to advise {{the cast and crew}} after the director had seen Cox on the science TV series Horizon. Cox gave regular lectures to the film's cast members about solar physics, and also advised the filmmakers to scale down the nuclear device in the film from the mass of the Moon to the size of Manhattan. In the film's backstory, a Q-ball enters and is caught in the Earth's Sun, and begins to eat it away. According to Cox, the Sun would not be dense enough in real life to stop a Q-ball, but filmmakers took creative licence in writing the backstory. Cox noted in the DVD commentary that several inaccuracies were permitted to allow for plot. He also dismissed criticisms of the film by scientists: [...] "Sunshine is not a documentary. It's trying to just, in an hour and forty minutes, get across a feeling of what it's like – not only to be a scientist, <b>because</b> <b>obviously</b> there's much more in it than that.

But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion. If we cannot or will not defend that principle with a full throat, then we deserve to choke on whatever jihadists of all stripes can force down our throats." [...] Gillespie asserted, [...] "Our Draw Mohammed contest is not a frivolous exercise of hip, ironic, hoolarious sacrilege toward a minority religion in the United States (though even that deserves all the protection that the most serioso political commentary commands). It's a defense of what {{is at the core of}} a society that is painfully incompetent at delivering on its promise of freedom, tolerance, and equal rights." [...] As May 20, 2010, came closer, Molly Norris stated she was staying away from being directly involved in the protest movement. Norris told Dave Ross, [...] "I'm against my own concept becoming a reality.... If I had wanted to be taken seriously, I would be thrilled, but now I'm horrified because people did take it as an actual day.

6000|$|The fact is, as Frege points out, that no number, {{not even}} 1, is {{applicable}} to physical things, {{but only to}} general terms or descriptions, such as [...] "man," [...] "satellite of the earth," [...] "satellite of Venus." [...] The general term [...] "man" [...] is applicable to {{a certain number of}} objects: there are in the world so and so many men. The unity which philosophers rightly feel to be necessary for the assertion of a number is the unity of the general term, and it is the general term which is the proper subject of number. And this applies equally when there is one object or none which falls under the general term. [...] "Satellite of the earth" [...] is a term only applicable to one object, namely, the moon. But [...] "one" [...] is not a property of the moon itself, which may equally well be regarded as many molecules: it is a property of the general term [...] "earth's satellite." [...] Similarly, 0 is a property of the general term [...] "satellite of Venus," [...] because Venus has no satellite. Here at last we have an intelligible theory of the number 0. This was impossible if numbers applied to physical objects, <b>because</b> <b>obviously</b> no physical object could have the number 0.
