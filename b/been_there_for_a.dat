25|$|On 30 August, Sergeant Barry Weston of 42 Commando, Royal Marines, {{was killed}} {{outright}} by a legacy ordnance blast in the Nahr-e-Saraj district of Helmand Province.

25|$|Developments in {{the field}} of {{economics}} are often expressed and legitimized in Kuhnian terms. For instance, neoclassical economists have claimed “to be at the second stage , and to have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very long time – since Adam Smith, according to some accounts (Hollander, 1987), or Jevons according to others (Hutchison, 1978).” In the 1970s, Post Keynesian economists denied the coherence of the neoclassical paradigm, claiming that their own paradigm would ultimately become dominant.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, July 9, 1956, {{a worker}} tearing down the Spring Lake Park School found men's {{clothing}} with dark red stains {{in the attic}} under a table scarf with the same stains. The school was located across the railroad tracks near the scene where Martin's car was found. The clothing {{was sent to the}} state laboratory in Austin, Texas by Texas city police to determine if the stains were human blood. The clothing had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time because they were deteriorating. The clothing consisted of white linen trousers and a white linen shirt and undershirt.|$|E

25|$|On February 21, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Crabtree sustained a Jones fracture in his left foot, which would require surgery to insert a screw and would leave him unable to perform for the next six to ten weeks including the NFL Combine and Texas Tech's pro day. Doctors found that the injury had happened recently, and possibly during his training for the combine. However, Crabtree stated that the stress fracture had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year and did not cause him pain. On March 1, Crabtree stated he would have surgery and forgo the workout at Texas Tech's pro day on March 26.|$|E
25|$|The entire Early Dynastic {{period is}} {{generally}} dated to 2900–2350 BC {{according to the}} Middle Chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the Short Chronology. The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia {{by the middle of}} the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It is hard to tell where the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. The Sumerian language is identifiable from its initially logographic script which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E

500|$|It {{was like}} a hunting cabin. The {{back of the house}} had a porch that was built out over a manmade lake that was maybe five or six acres. It was a cabin made out of old pinewood, and it had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time.... The Allman Brothers used it as a {{rehearsal}} facility — that and a place to go maybe to consume a little something that wasn't quite legal. There were parties out there." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 April, {{pathology}} experts {{announced that}} Knut's immediate {{cause of death}} was from drowning. [...] The bear's apparent seizure was due to his suffering from Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, a swelling of the brain likely triggered by an infection. [...] It is unknown what infection caused the swelling, but pathologists believe it was a virus. Although Knut showed no symptoms of being ill, pathologists believe that [...] "this suspected infection must already have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time... at least several weeks, possibly months." ...|$|E

From the 10th century, the coastal areas have been populated and visited by ethnic Norwegians, and Finnmark became part of the kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|About {{adjusting}} to the NFL, Ringer said [...] "It's definitely {{a lot more complicated}} than in college, definitely. But mainly it's just the play calling, it's a lot longer than what it was in college, but all-in-all it's just learning a whole new terminology, some things are similar, but it's the words that they use are different. So it's all about adjustment. A lot of intelligence out there, they don't make mistakes. They are pretty mature on what they are doing. I am trying to build up to that, because {{a lot of them are}} veterans and have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. They understand what is going on, and I am just trying to keep up and not make them look bad." ...|$|E

50|$|For example, modular curves are compactified by the {{addition}} of single points for each cusp, making them Riemann surfaces (and so, since they are compact, algebraic curves). Here the cusps <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good reason: the curves parametrize a space of lattices, and those lattices can degenerate ('go off to infinity'), often {{in a number of ways}} (taking into account some auxiliary structure of level). The cusps stand in for those different 'directions to infinity'.|$|R
