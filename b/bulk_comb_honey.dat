5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the honey extractor almost all honey produced was in the form of <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> Today, most honey is produced for extraction but <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and for combining with extracted honey to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing <b>comb</b> <b>honey,</b> which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of extracted honey. Because of the more demanding labor involved, <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> has greater retail value than extracted honey. ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and yellow clover. Wooded areas are not as suitable for <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> more difficult. This problem has been largely circumvented with the adoption of specialized frames, such as the Ross Round frame, which prevent accumulation of propolis on saleable units.|$|R
50|$|Taylor made {{significant}} contributions to beekeeping. He owned three hundred hives of bees and, from 1970, produced mostly <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> He explained his management techniques in several books, including The <b>Comb</b> <b>Honey</b> Book and The Joys of Beekeeping.|$|R
50|$|Populous {{honey bee}} colonies are usually reduced to single hive bodies at the {{beginning}} of the honey flow when one or more <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> supers are added. <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> can either be produced in wooden sections, shallow frames, or Ross Rounds. The successful production of <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> requires that the hive remain crowded without inducing swarming. Young prolific queens help rapid colony population expansion with less likelihood of swarming. Caucasian honey bees are often preferred for their tendency to keep a constricted brood nest and for their production of white wax cappings, making more attractive <b>honey</b> <b>combs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> {{production}} requires many of {{the same}} techniques that are required for the production of extracted honey. In addition, the colony must be very strong and have comb building traits. Honeycomb for direct consumption as <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> is always created the same year it is harvested.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> {{is still}} in the honeybees' wax comb. It is {{traditionally}} collected using standard wooden frames in honey supers. The frames are collected and the comb is cut out in chunks before packaging. As an alternative to this labor-intensive method, plastic rings or cartridges can be used that do not require manual cutting of the comb, and speed packaging. <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> harvested in the traditional manner is also referred to as [...] "cut-comb honey".|$|R

50|$|<b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> is honey {{intended}} for consumption {{which is still}} contained within its original hexagonal-shaped beeswax cells, called honeycomb. It is eaten as produced by honey bees and has received no processing, filtering, or manipulation.|$|R
50|$|Some {{hobbyist}} beekeepers and beekeepers {{in developing}} countries, especially keepers of top-bar hives, cut the whole <b>honey</b> <b>comb</b> {{out of the}} frame, and use it directly as cut <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> To extract liquid <b>honey,</b> the <b>comb</b> can be crushed to release the honey and strained to remove the wax and other impurities. Alternatively, cut comb is put into a honey press to squeeze out the honey.|$|R
50|$|The {{small hive beetle}} can be a {{destructive}} pest of honey bee colonies, causing damage to <b>comb,</b> stored <b>honey</b> and pollen. If a beetle infestation is sufficiently heavy, they may cause bees to abandon their hive. Its presence {{can also be a}} marker in the diagnosis of Colony Collapse Disorder for honey-bees. The beetles can also be a pest of stored <b>combs,</b> and <b>honey</b> (in the <b>comb)</b> awaiting extraction. Beetle larvae may tunnel through <b>combs</b> of <b>honey,</b> feeding and defecating, causing discoloration and fermentation of the honey.|$|R

50|$|Beginning as {{an amateur}} {{beekeeper}} {{as the result of}} a swarm that his wife hived into a sugar barrel when it landed on their porch in 1861, Miller expanded his business steadily. By 1878, Miller made his living from keeping bees. He eventually settled in Illinois. Miller expanded his honey farm to over 300 colonies of bees, and became North America's largest producer of <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b>|$|R
50|$|C(harles) C. Miller (10 Jun. 1831-4 Sept. 1920) was an American {{practical}} commercial beekeeper that {{specialized in}} <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> production. He was originally a physician, but gave up that profession to keep bees {{and to write}} about beekeeping. His books include A Thousand Answers to Beekeeping Questions and Fifty Years Among the Bees. For many years {{he was also a}} popular advice columnist for the American Bee Journal.|$|R
50|$|Many insects, notably {{honey bees}} and some wasps, collect and store liquid for use {{at a later}} date. However, these insects store their food within their nest or in <b>combs.</b> <b>Honey</b> ants are unique in using their own bodies as living storage, used later by their fellow ants when food is {{otherwise}} scarce. When the liquid stored inside a honeypot ant is needed, the worker ants stroke the antennae of the honeypot ant, causing the honeypot ant to regurgitate the stored liquid from its crop.|$|R
50|$|For centuries, the {{historical}} basket or heath beehive produced honey and beeswax on the Lüneburg Heath. In the Middle Ages heather honey was a sought-aftern commodity. Beekeeping was {{common in the}} core areas of the former heath, so that almost every farmstead had a Bienenzaun. The farmers employed special beekeeping hands for this purpose. The town of Celle on the Südheide was a major trading centre for heather honey. As early as the 16th century there was a professional apiculture centre. It declined {{during the second half}} of the 19th century for a number of reasons, which led to the retreat of the areas of heathland. As a result of land consolidation there were no areas of common land with their wide range of nectar-producing plants. The introduction of artificial fertiliser enabled better harvest yields from heath soils and so areas of heath were turned into arable land. Marshland soils with buckwheat cultivation were turned into meadows for cattle. In addition, large areas of heath were reforested with fast-growing pines. Today there are only a very few apiaries left on the Lüneburg Heath which keep bees in {{the historical}} way. These also produce <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> which is a speciality today due to its rarity. <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> is a honeycomb filled with heather honey.|$|R
50|$|Heather honey is {{a highly}} valued product in moorland and {{heathland}} areas, with many beehives being moved there in late summer. Not always as valued as it is today, it was dismissed as mel improbum by Dioscurides. Heather honey has a characteristic strong taste, and an unusual texture, for it is thixotropic, being a jelly until stirred, when it becomes a syrup like other honey, but then sets again to a jelly. This makes the extraction of the <b>honey</b> from the <b>comb</b> difficult, and it is therefore often sold as <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most beekeepers produce {{commodities}} (farm products) for sale. Honey is {{the most}} valuable commodity sold by beekeepers. Honey-producer beekeepers try to maintain maximum-strength colonies of bees in areas with dense nectar sources. They produce and sell liquid and sometimes <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> Beekeepers may sell their commodities retail, as self-brokers, or through commercial packers and distributors. Beeswax, pollen, royal jelly, and propolis may also be significant revenue generators. Taiwanese beekeepers, for example, export tonnes of royal jelly, the high-nutrition food supplement fed to queen honeybees. Modern beekeepers seldom keep honeybees exclusively for beeswax production. Beeswax is harvested along with honey and separated for sale.|$|R
50|$|Named {{for their}} inventor, Rev. Lorenzo Langstroth, Langstroth hives {{are not the}} only hives of this style, but the most common in North America. Langstroth {{patented}} his design in 1852 originally for <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> production; it has become the standard style hive for many of the world's beekeepers. This class of hives includes other styles, which differ mainly in the size and number of frames used. These include Smith, British National, Segeberger Beute (German), D.E. hive, Frankenbeute (German), Normalmass (German), Langstroth hive, Modified Commercial, and Modified Dadant (developed in USA in 1920 from the Dadant-Blatt hive, a variant of the Dadant hive), plus regional variations.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is used as}} a bee repellant. [...] A {{small amount}} of benzaldehyde-containing {{solution}} is placed on a fume board near the <b>honey</b> <b>combs.</b> The bees promptly move away from the <b>honey</b> <b>combs</b> {{to get away from the}} fumes. [...] Benzaldehyde allows the beekeeper to remove the honey frames from the bee hive with greater safety to both bees and the beekeeper.|$|R
50|$|Mature worker bees secrete beeswax from glands {{on their}} abdomen, {{using it to}} form the walls and caps of the <b>comb.</b> When <b>honey</b> is harvested, the wax can be {{collected}} for use in products like candles and seals.|$|R
50|$|Hive {{bodies and}} hive supers are four-sided boxes with {{standardized}} inside dimensions. There are generally four different sizes. Outside box dimensions {{vary depending on}} the type of material used. Polystyrene boxes have much larger outside dimensions than boxes made out of wood. Deep and medium hive bodies are provided to serve as the brood chamber, the part of the hive where the queen lays eggs and the bees care for the larvae. Medium, shallow and <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> supers are used for honey stores and to harvest the honey. The inside width is 14-11/16 inches (373 mm) and the inside length is 18-5/16 inches (465 mm). The frames rest on a rabbeted side along both ends of each box.|$|R

50|$|A new {{railroad}} extension {{into the}} area did not reach the young community, so in 1924, Milo {{was moved to the}} side of the train tracks. Most of the buildings were pulled to the new location. The town hall was too large and was dismantled in sections and rebuilt at its new location. Village status was achieved in 1931. A new community hall was built in 1985 and the curling rink expanded and renovated in 1998. Since 2000, developments along the shores of McGregor Lake have attracted cottagers and vacationers from Calgary. The original site of the village - the Aasgards' farmstead and store - are now part of Canada's largest <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> beekeeping farm, owned by Don and Ron Miksha.|$|R

50|$|Tutin is a {{poisonous}} plant derivative {{found in the}} New Zealand tutu plant (Coriaria arborea, Coriaria genus, several different species). It acts as a potent antagonist of the glycine receptor, and has powerful convulsant effects. It is used in scientific research into the glycine receptor, and is also sometimes associated with outbreaks of toxic honey poisoning when bees feed honeydew exudate from the sap-sucking insect {{commonly known as the}} passion vine hopper, when these vine hoppers (Scolypopa australis) have been feeding on the sap of tutu bushes. Toxic honey is a rare event and is more likely to occur when <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> is eaten directly from a hive that has been harvesting honeydew from passion vine hoppers feeding on tutu plants.|$|R
