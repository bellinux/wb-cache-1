500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, competitors of the American Window Glass trust used a different approach to gain a technological advantage. The machines used by American Window Glass replaced glass blowers, but still used the same blowing and cutting process used in the 1880s—although the company was constantly working to make the process more efficient. Competitors such as American inventor Irving W. Colburn began working on a machine that produced window glass using a different process. Colburn patented his work during {{the first decade of the}} 20th century. Although he filed for bankruptcy in 1912, his patents were purchased by Edward Drummond Libbey and Michael J. Owens—who hired Colburn to continue work on the machine. [...] Owens was the creator of the Owens Bottling Machine that revolutionized the glass <b>bottle</b> <b>industry.</b> [...] Working with Colburn, Owens improved the window glass machine enough that it began being used for production in 1921. By 1926, Libbey-Owens had gained a window glass market share of 29 percent, while American Window Glass's share was 59 percent. During the 1920s, Pittsburgh Plate Glass also developed a new process for making window glass, creating even more competition in the window glass industry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company had}} {{a policy of}} using skilled glassworkers from Europe, who would train the local employees—resulting in a {{superior}} workforce. [...] Former employees of the glass works became the talent that established many of the region's glass factories, and many were company president or plant manager. [...] Perhaps the one former Hobbs employee that had the biggest influence on the industry was Michael Owens. [...] Owens revolutionized the glass <b>bottle</b> <b>industry</b> by inventing a machine that would make bottles at high speed and low cost with consistency in size and shape. [...] Not only did Owens' invention lower costs, it also opened new markets where low cost bottles with consistent size {{could be used as}} containers for products that previously had limited distribution. [...] Owens was also involved with improving a machine for producing window glass, which changed the way window glass was produced. [...] He was involved with the formation of the Toledo Glass Company, the Owens Bottle Machine Company, and the Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to coal, {{the area around}} Streator contained rich clay and shale, which gave rise to Streator's brick, tile and pipe industries. In time, these supplanted coal as Streator's leading exports, but Streator was {{best known for its}} glass <b>bottle</b> <b>industry.</b> In the early 20th century Streator held the title of [...] "Glass Manufacturing Capital of the World." [...] Streator continued to flourish for much of the early 20th century. Ultimately the demand for coal was replaced with the growing needs for gas and oil. Many of the underground mines in Streator closed during the 1920s. The last of the mines shut down in 1958. While other areas of LaSalle County continued to grow, Streator's population peaked at about 17,000 residents in 1960 and has since declined. Many of the original downtown buildings have been demolished, but few have been replaced. Another reason for static growth in Streator is its distance from any major Interstate Highway. When the federal highway system started in the 1950s and 1960s no interstate was built near the city. Streator is 23 mi from Interstate 55, 16 mi from Interstate 80 and Interstate 39.|$|E

The defective bottle products are caused by several factors, such as human error, compositions, faults in temperature and machinery setting.

40|$|In {{the hollow}} glass industry, more {{specifically}} in the luxury perfume glass <b>bottle</b> <b>industry,</b> {{the success of the}} forming process depends on controlling the thermal exchange at the glass/mold interface to prevent defects on the glass surface. This study concerns a new way to analyze the impact of lubrication on the glass/tool thermal exchanges. It combines the thermal analysis on the experimental Glass/Tool Interaction (GTI) platform in the TEMPO Laboratory (Valenciennes, France) and the Physico-Chemical measurements on the glass samples by the BCR Center (Mons, Belgium). Part B presents the analysis of the flint glass pressing cycles using different punch lubrication conditions (i. e., bare punch, swabbed punch, coated punch, and coated/swabbed punch). The thermal analysis permits us to rank the lubrication conditions in terms of their capacity to limit the thermal exchange at the punch/glass interface. We defined a new lu- bricating paste composition based on the Physico-Chemical observations of the lubrication transfer on the pressed glass. The GTI platform results proves that the new composition does not affect the insulating power of the lubricating paste and permits us to eliminate defects on the glass samples that are not accepted in industrial situations...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of a {{population}} in a country can contribute to high production of waste. Municipal waste and industrial waste can bring unhealthy and unpleasant environment or even diseases to human beings if the wastes are not managed properly. With increasing concerns over waste {{and the need for}} 'greener' products, it is necessary to carry out Life Cycle Assessments of products and this will help manufacturers take the first steps towards greener designs by assessing their product's carbon output. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a process to evaluate the environmental burdens associated with a product, process or activity by identifying and quantifying energy and materials used and wastes released to the environment, and {{to assess the impact of}} those energy and material used and released to the environment. The aim of the study was to use a life cycle assessment approach to determine which waste disposal options that will substantially reduce the environmental burdens posed by the Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottle. Several important observations can be made. 1) Recycling of the PET bottle waste can significantly reduce the energy requiredacross the life cycle because the high energy inputs needed to process the requisite virgin materials greatly exceeds the energy needs of the recycling process steps. 2) Greenhouse gases can be reduced by opting for recycling instead of landfilling andincineration. 3) Quantity of waste emissions released from different disposal options was identified. 4) Recycling is the environmentally preferable disposal method for the PET <b>bottle.</b> <b>Industry</b> can use the tools and data in this study to evaluate the health, environmental, and energy implications of the PET bottle. LCA intends to aid decision-makers in this respect, provided that the scientific underpinning is available.
