5|$|In 1214 John {{began his}} final {{campaign}} to reclaim Normandy from Philip. John was optimistic, {{as he had}} successfully <b>built</b> <b>up</b> alliances with the Emperor Otto, Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders; he was enjoying papal favour; and he had successfully <b>built</b> <b>up</b> substantial funds {{to pay for the}} deployment of his experienced army. Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps. John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by William Longespée, marched south-west from Flanders.|$|E

Having <b>built</b> <b>up</b> a 20–5–1 record over three seasons as coach, Saban drew interest from the professional ranks, and the Boston Patriots of the newly formed American Football League (AFL) hired him as head coach before the circuit's inaugural season in 1960.|$|E
