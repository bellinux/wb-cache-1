25|$|An RFID reader transmits an encoded {{radio signal}} to {{interrogate}} the tag. The RFID tag receives {{the message and}} then responds with its identification and other information. This may be only a unique tag serial number, or may be product-related information such as a stock number, lot or <b>batch</b> <b>number,</b> production date, or other specific information. Since tags have individual serial numbers, the RFID system design can discriminate among several tags that might be {{within the range of}} the RFID reader and read them simultaneously.|$|E

5000|$|Debate about weapons {{evidence}} in the Ergenekon investigation has focused in particular on the grenades, which can be uniquely identified by the fuse type (fünye grubu) and <b>batch</b> <b>number</b> (kafile numarası). According to police officials, [...] "HGR DM 41" [...] indicates German origin, SPLITTER denotes a fragmentation grenade, [...] "COMP-B" [...] means composition B, [...] "LOS" [...] indicates European production up to NATO standards, while the number following [...] "FMP" [...] indicates the batch. The NATO standard, Makine ve Kimya Endüstrisi Kurumu (MKE) grenades have serial numbers like TAPA M 204 A 2/KF-MKE-91 12-77. The part before the slash denotes the fuse type, while the part after it denotes the <b>batch</b> <b>number.</b> For example, the <b>batch</b> <b>number</b> of the first entry means 'batch 91, December 1977'. The army bought 8800 such grenades from the MKE in 1978.|$|E

50|$|Again, {{as part of}} {{the major}} {{refurbishment}} scheme of the Class 37 locomotives in the 1980s, another freight dedicated fleet of 44 Class 37s was created; the Class 37/7 subclass which was very similar to the 37/5 subclass except for plating over of a bodyside window and the addition of a ballast weight to give extra 'pulling power' when hauling heavy freight trains such as the metals trains in South Wales. Again, like the 37/5s, there were two batches completed; from phase 1 and phase 2 Class 37/0 locos. The <b>batch</b> <b>numbered</b> 37701 upwards were from phase 1 build locos and have the flush front ends and the <b>batch</b> <b>numbered</b> from 37899 downwards were rebuilds from phase 2 locos, having the central headcode box (plated over). A further complication was created; locos numbered 37796-37803 had a different type of electrical equipment fitted as part of a trial and differ from the other locos in the subclass internally.|$|R

50|$|Orders for {{the first}} eight {{locomotives}} in the Class were placed on 22 March 1911.
