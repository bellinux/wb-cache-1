25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. <b>Blow-by</b> gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|E

40|$|A short-range, easily {{deployable}} {{data communication}} system enables numerous highway work zone applications. The Kansas Department of Transportation is currently funding {{a project to}} develop a delay notification system in rural construction zones. The objective of the project is to estimate the expected delay until {{the return of the}} pilot car and communicate that delay to motorists waiting in the queue. Since most rural construction zones are outside existing commercially available communications, such as cellular coverage, success of the project hinges primarily on the acquisition of a low-cost, easily deployable work zone data communication system. The prototype system relies on 900 -Mhz radio transceivers integrated with GPS receivers and a microprocessor. These devices mount to signs, vehicles, and relay points and are programmed according to their function in the overall system. This low-cost approach not only enables the delay notification system, but also opens the door for other value-added applications within the work-zone. The same architecture can support construction vehicle tracking, notification of <b>blow-bys</b> (when vehicles fail to yield to traffic control), and field construction data reporting to centralized construction management systems. This paper reviews the communication architecture developed for the delay notification project and then casts that same communication system into scenarios to support value-added applications. Key words: global positioning system—wireless communications—work zone...|$|R
50|$|If {{an engine}} is damaged or enters old age, gaps can form between the {{cylinder}} walls and pistons, resulting in larger amounts of <b>blow-by</b> than the {{crankcase ventilation system}} can handle. The gaps cause power loss, and ultimately mean that the engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced. Symptoms of excessive <b>blow-by</b> include oil being pushed {{up into the air}} filter, out the dipstick, or out the PCV valve. In rare cases of serious piston or ring damage, the oil filter housing's sheet metal can even burst at its seam.|$|E
50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century {{through the early}} 20th, <b>blow-by</b> gases from {{internal}} combustion were allowed {{to find their own}} way out to the atmosphere past seals and gaskets. It was considered normal for oil to be found both inside and outside an engine, and for oil to drip to the ground in small but constant amounts. The latter had also been true for steam engines and steam locomotives in the decades before. Even bearing and valve designs generally made little to no provision for keeping oil or waste gases contained. Sealed bearings and valve covers were for special applications only. Gaskets and shaft seals were meant to limit loss of oil, but they were usually not expected to entirely prevent it. On internal combustion engines, the hydrocarbon-rich <b>blow-by</b> gases would diffuse through the oil in the seals and gaskets into the atmosphere. Engines with high amounts of <b>blow-by</b> (e.g., worn out ones, or ones not well built to begin with) would leak profusely via those routes.|$|E
50|$|All the EF7 {{variants}} {{have passed}} the NVH tests successfully on their head cylinder & cylinder block.Also, the engines have a <b>Blow-by</b> system which does ventilation for the Crankcase and Oil Pan.|$|E
50|$|This vacuum {{can also}} be used to draw any piston <b>blow-by</b> gases from the engine's crankcase. This is known as a {{positive}} crankcase ventilation system, in which the gases are burned with the fuel/air mixture.|$|E

50|$|After World War I, the Marvel Carburetor Company (Marvel-Schebler Carburetors since 1928) {{produced}} carburetors for {{automobiles and}} aircraft. Some of these encountered problems with clogged jets, prompting Pierce {{to formulate a}} blend of chemicals and petroleum to clean and maintain them. Marvel claims the oil creates a top ring seal producing higher compression, preventing <b>blow-by</b> on power strokes, resulting in more power.. Supporting evidence is not provided.|$|E
50|$|The {{main issue}} {{is with the}} buildup of oil inside the intake piping and manifold. During the normal {{operation}} of an engine the excess <b>blow-by</b> and oil vapors from the crank case are allowed to enter the intake system. The oil mist cools and layers {{the inside of the}} intake piping and manifold. Over time this layer can build up and thick sludge can accumulate.|$|E
50|$|STS-2 was {{the first}} shuttle flight where O-ring <b>blow-by</b> was observed. After the damage was discovered, another O-ring was {{intentionally}} damaged to a further degree. It was then put through a flight simulation at three times the flight pressure. It survived the test, and was endorsed as flightworthy. This same problem would occur on fourteen more shuttle flights, before contributing {{to the loss of}} orbiter Challenger in 1986.|$|E
50|$|This is {{necessary}} because internal combustion inevitably involves {{a small but}} continual amount of <b>blow-by,</b> which occurs {{when some of the}} gases from the combustion leak past the piston rings (that is, blow by them) to end up inside the crankcase, causing pressure to build up in the crank case. For control of the pressure inside it, a PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve is used to vent the crankcase.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} address the {{deficiencies}} of the air-cooled Norton Wankel engine, Garside went on to develop SPARCS (Self-Pressurising-Air Rotor Cooling System); [...] a system that utilises self-pressurising <b>blow-by</b> gases as a cooling medium, absorbing higher levels of heat from the engine core and dispersing the heat {{by means of an}} external heat exchanger. This system would go on to provide superior heat rejection than standard air cooling methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{aluminum}} eggs {{featured a}} streamlined design which reduced air resistance. Streamlining {{was effective in}} enabling the installation of fifteen instruments used in testing. These included a <b>blow-by</b> meter, which measured the gas which escaped to the auto's crankcase, having passed by thepistons and piston rings. Another instrument employed was an exhaust gas analyzer. This gauge measured the combustion efficiency of the engine. A viscometer {{was used to test}} the body thickness of crankcase oil.|$|E
5000|$|J. Mike O'Dwyer, an Australian inventor, {{observed}} that these methods did not eliminate {{the problem of}} unintended propellant ignition caused by highly pressurized hot gases [...] "leaking" [...] past the remaining projectiles in the barrel (<b>blow-by)</b> and igniting their charges. J. Mike O'Dwyer's original Metal Storm patents demonstrated a method whereby projectiles placed in series {{along the length of}} a barrel could be fired sequentially and selectively without the danger associated with unintended propellant ignition.|$|E
50|$|Boisjoly's {{investigation}} {{showed that}} the amount of damage to the O-ring depended on the length of time it took for the ring to move out of its groove and make the seal, and {{that the amount of}} time depended on the temperature of the rings. Cold weather made the rubber hard and less flexible, meaning that extrusion took more time and more <b>blow-by</b> took place. He determined that if the O-rings were damaged enough they could fail.|$|E
5000|$|After the 1984 {{launch of}} STS-41-D, flown by Discovery, the first {{occurrence}} of hot gas [...] "blow-by" [...] was discovered beyond the primary O-ring. In the post-flight analysis, Thiokol engineers {{found that the}} amount of <b>blow-by</b> was relatively small and had not impinged upon the secondary O-ring, and concluded that for future flights, the damage was an acceptable risk. However, after the Challenger disaster, Thiokol engineer Brian Russell identified this event as the first [...] "big red flag" [...] regarding O-ring safety.|$|E
5000|$|This design uses oil seals {{to prevent}} the {{pollution}} from the combustion chamber (created by piston ring <b>blow-by</b> in four-strokes and just combustion in two-strokes) from polluting the crankcase oil, extending {{the life of the}} oil as it is used slowly for keeping the rings full of oil to hold and use to lubricate. Oil was shown to be used slowly by the dropfull as needed, but checking the quantity and cleanness of it was still recommended by Russell Bourke, its creator.|$|E
5000|$|While {{extrusion}} {{was taking}} place, hot gases leaked past (a process called [...] "blow-by"), damaging the O-rings until a seal was made. Investigations by Morton-Thiokol engineers {{determined that the}} amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. (The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the Challenger accident used an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating <b>blow-by.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The piston {{might be}} a fairly loose fit in the cylinder. If it were a tight fit, it would expand as it got hot and might stick tight in the cylinder. If a piston sticks (seizes) it could cause serious damage to the engine. On the other hand, if {{there is too much}} {{clearance}} between the piston and cylinder walls, much of the pressure from the burning gasoline vapour will leak past the piston (a condition known as <b>blow-by)</b> and into the crankcase, and the push on the piston from combustion will be much less effective in delivering power.|$|E

5000|$|The mission lasted 7 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes, 55 seconds, with landing {{taking place}} on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base at 6:37 am PDT on 5 September 1984. During STS-41-D, Discovery {{traveled}} a total of 2490000 mi and made 97 orbits. The orbiter was transported back to KSC on 10 September. Ominously, STS-41-D was the first Shuttle mission in which <b>blow-by</b> damage to the SRB O-rings was discovered, {{with a small amount}} of soot found beyond the primary O-ring. Following the Challenger tragedy, Morton Thiokol engineer Brian Russell called this finding the first [...] "big red flag" [...] on SRB Joint and O-ring safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} slow loading of rifles caused by barrel fouling was solved by the Minié ball, which {{was invented in}} the 1840s by French {{inventor}} Claude-Étienne Minié. Despite its name, the Minié ball was not a round ball at all - it was long and conical, with an expanding skirt {{at the rear of}} the bullet. The skirt allowed the minié ball to be smaller than the barrel's bore, so it would slip in as easily as the ball of a smoothbore. When the weapon was fired, the skirt expanded to fit tightly against the inside of the rifle barrel, with less energy wasted in <b>blow-by</b> around the projectile and insuring that the rifling lands and grooves would impart a stabilizing spin to the minié ball.|$|E
5000|$|Originally Keith {{specified}} a meplat {{that was}} 65% of the bullet caliber, but later increased it to a 70% meplat. The other distinguishing {{characteristics of a}} [...] "Keith-style" [...] SWC are a double radius ogive, beveled crimp groove, three equal width driving bands, wide square bottomed grease groove, and a plain base with sharp corners. The wide forward driving band helps keep the bullet aligned as it jumps across the cylinder gap. Because of the three wide equal width driving bands, the total bearing surface is greater than half the overall length of the bullet. This large bearing surface helps the Keith-style SWC to be an inherently accurate bullet, and minimizes leading from gas <b>blow-by.</b> The wide square bottom grease groove holds ample lubricant.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{exactly a}} year after STS-51-C, Space Shuttle Challenger was {{destroyed}} with all hands on board during the STS-51-L mission including Ellison Onizuka, a crew member on both flights. As part of {{the investigation into the}} disaster, it was reported to the Rogers Commission that during the launch of STS-51-C, the worst solid rocket booster (SRB) <b>blow-by</b> effects of any mission prior to STS-51-L occurred, indicating conclusively that the Viton O-rings were not sufficiently sealing the hot gases inside the combustion chambers of the SRBs while firing. After they were recovered post-flight, the O-rings in both the right and left SRBs showed some degree of charring, but analysis of the center field joint of the right SRB showed an unprecedented penetration of the primary O-ring and heavy charring on the secondary O-ring.|$|E
50|$|The V12's new {{management}} system {{was designed by}} Nippon Denso. The top aluminium cover in the engine's valley was redesigned to house two packs of three coils each, with each coil having two high-tension terminals {{for a total of}} twelve. These coilpacks were driven by two Denso ignition modules, which are very similar to Ford EDIS-6 units. The crankshaft in the V12 was switched from a forging to a chill casting. A visibly significant chromed pipe connecting {{the left and the right}} banks of the V12 in the XJ40 platform (intended to vent and route the crankcase <b>blow-by</b> gas to the intake plenum) was changed with the introduction of the X300 to an almost invisible design at the top center of the engine underneath a plastic cover that also hides fuel rails and coilpacks.|$|E
50|$|The first {{refinement}} in {{crankcase ventilation}} was the road draft tube, {{which is a}} pipe running from a high location contiguous to the crankcase (such as {{the side of the}} engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of the crankcase. The high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to the crankcase, called the breather and often incorporated into the oil filler cap, meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through the crankcase to clear out the <b>blow-by</b> gases.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{several days}} of lengthy delays, Challenger finally lifted off at 16:38:00 UTC on 28 January 1986. Her three main engines were ignited at T-6.6 seconds, and at T-0 the solid rocket {{boosters}} were ignited, lifting the shuttle stack off launchpad 39-B at Kennedy Space Center. Almost immediately, cameras recording the launch registered the presence of smoke at the field joint next to the attachment strut on the right-hand SRB, indicating {{the failure of the}} O-rings that were supposed to seal the joint against the [...] "blow-by" [...] of hot gases from the boosters. However, sometime at around T+2 seconds, a piece of solid fuel from inside the booster moved inside the joint and provided a temporary seal against the <b>blow-by,</b> allowing the launch to proceed normally for around forty seconds.|$|E
50|$|The early {{generation}} 1JZ-GTEs {{combined the}} inherent smoothness of an inline 6-cylinder engine with the revving capacity of its short stroke and early power delivery of its small, ceramic wheeled turbochargers. The ceramic turbine wheels {{are prone to}} delamination {{in the setting of}} high impeller rpm and local temperature conditions, usually a result of higher boost. The first generation 1JZs were even more prone to turbo failure due to there being a faulty one-way valve on the head, specifically on the intake cam cover causing <b>blow-by</b> gases to go into the intake manifold. On the exhaust side, a decent amount of oil vapor flows into the turbos causing premature wear on the seals. The later second generation engines had this problem fixed and in Japan there was actually a recall in order to repair the first generation engines, though that does not apply to 1JZs imported to other countries. The fix is simple, and involves replacement of the PCV valve (2JZ); all parts are available through Toyota.|$|E
50|$|For certain {{applications}} {{the valve}} stem and disk {{are made of}} different steel alloys, or the valve stem may be hollow and filled with sodium to improve heat transport and transfer. Although a better heat conductor, an aluminium cylinder head requires steel valve seat inserts, where a cast iron cylinder head would often have employed integral valve seats in the past. Because the valve stem extends into lubrication in the cam chamber, it must be sealed against <b>blow-by</b> to prevent cylinder gases from escaping into the crankcase, even though the stem to valve clearance is very small, typically 0.04-0.06 mm, so a rubber lip-type seal is used to ensure that excessive oil is not drawn in from the crankcase on the induction stroke, and that exhaust gas does not enter the crankcase on the exhaust stroke. Worn valve guides and/or defective oil seals can often be diagnosed by a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe on releasing the accelerator pedal after allowing the engine to overrun, when there is high manifold vacuum. Such a condition occurs when changing gear.|$|E
50|$|The O-rings {{were two}} rubber rings that formed a seal between two {{sections}} of the SRBs. The {{sections of the}} boosters were joined using tang and clevis joints and the rings were intended to seal the joint, while allowing for the inevitable movement between the sections under flight conditions. By design, pressure from within the booster was to push a fillet of putty into the joint, forcing the O-ring into its seat. The system never functioned as designed. The rings were supposed {{to sit in a}} groove and seal the joint between the sections of the booster. It was found, however, that flight dynamics caused the joints in the SRBs to flex during launch, opening a gap through which rocket exhaust could escape. As the joints flexed, the rings would come out of their grooves and move to a new position in the joint, a process called extrusion. The extruded ring would form a seal in this new position, but during the time it took for the ring to shift, the joint was unsealed and hot gases could escape, a process called <b>blow-by.</b> These hot gases would damage the rings until the seal was achieved.|$|E
50|$|The pistons {{are short}} {{cylindrical}} parts which seal {{one end of}} the cylinder from the high pressure of the compressed air and combustion products and slide continuously within it while the engine is in operation. The top wall of the piston is termed its crown and is typically flat or concave. Some two-stroke engines use pistons with a deflector head. Pistons are open at the bottom and hollow except for an integral reinforcement structure (the piston web). When an engine is working the gas pressure in the combustion chamber exerts a force on the piston crown which is transferred through its web to a gudgeon pin. Each piston has rings fitted around its circumference that mostly prevent the gases from leaking into the crankcase or the oil into the combustion chamber. A ventilation system drives the small amount of gas that escape past the pistons during normal operation (the <b>blow-by</b> gases) out of the crankcase so that it does not accumulate contaminating the oil and creating corrosion. In two-stroke gasoline engines the crankcase is part of the air-fuel path and due to the continuous flow of it they do not need a separate crankcase ventilation system.|$|E
50|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497 cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1.

5000|$|When fitting new {{piston rings}} or {{breaking}} them in within an engine, {{the end gap}} is a crucial measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the [...] "grooves" [...] of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by putting the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring with a feeler gauge. End gap should be within recommended limits for size of bore and intended [...] "load" [...] of engine. Metals expand with a rise in temperature, so too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, a small ring gap may lead to ring gap closure, ring breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of <b>blow-by</b> gases or oil consumption. When being measured in a used bore, it may indicate excessive bore wear or ring wear. (Radial wear on ring face reduces thickness of used/worn ring (face wear in bore) essentially decreasing face circumference of ring and thereby increasing size of ring end gap.) ...|$|E
