5|$|Looking to <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{success of}} his 2014 season, Hughes went into the 2015 season as the Twins ace. Hughes had lost {{velocity}} in his fastball, dropping from 93MPH to 92MPH. His 2015 season was marred with inconsistency and injury as he only started 25 times while appearing 2 times out of the bullpen. Despite going 11-9, his ERA was 4.40 and he served up 29 home runs in only 155.1 innings.|$|E

5|$|Tamar was proclaimed heir and co-ruler by her reigning father George III in 1178, but {{she faced}} {{significant}} {{opposition from the}} aristocracy upon her ascension to full ruling powers after George's death.

Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury {{and the other to}} suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1959 Rohm and Haas, {{the first}} private {{investor}} to <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Independence Mall, first commissioned Philadelphia-based George M.

Ewing's design {{was met with}} a poor response from the City Art Commission, and Rohm and Haas decided on using a leading architect and approached Pietro Belluschi. At the time the dean of architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Belluschi worked with George M. Ewing Co. to redesign Ewing's original plan. The new design was completed {{in a few months}} and was approved by Rohm and Haas, the City Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Authority, and the City Art Commission. Construction began in 1963 and was completed in 1964, costing close to US$10 million. Rohm and Haas moved from their old Washington Square headquarters into the new building in 1965.|$|E

Alabama was victorious by a final score of 32–13. The following day, final Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings were unveiled. No.1 ranked Alabama would meet No.2 ranked Texas for the BCS National Championship.

5|$|Planning began for {{the third}} U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight to <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched {{on the morning of}} October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E

5|$|The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the {{original}} fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, attempted to <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> character, {{and a number of}} scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character. Buck and his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna’s struggle is external, Elsa’s is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.|$|E
5|$|Thief II was {{designed}} to <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foundation of its predecessor. In response to feedback from players of Thief, the team placed a heavy focus on urban stealth in the sequel, and they minimized the use of monsters and maze-like levels. The game was made with the third iteration of the Dark Engine, which had been used previously to develop Thief and System Shock 2. Thief II was announced at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo, {{as part of an}} extended contract between Looking Glass and Eidos to release games in the Thief series. Looking Glass neared bankruptcy as the game was developed, and the company was kept running by advances from Eidos.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1984, Cherry made the two key signings of central defender Dave Evans and right winger John Hendrie to <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} season's high finish. McCall {{was an integral part}} of the team as City won the Division Three championship in 1984–85, during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever-present players. The title was assured in the penultimate game when McCall scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers. The league title was paraded before the final game of the season on 11 May 1985 at home to Lincoln City. However, the club's title was overshadowed when 56 people died in the Bradford City stadium fire when the Valley Parade ground's main stand caught fire after 40 minutes of play, during which McCall's father, who was with other family members, was badly injured. After the fire, McCall, still in his kit, spent several hours driving from the ground to his sister's house, then to Bradford Royal Infirmary and Pinderfields Hospital trying to find his father. His father had suffered severe burns and needed skin grafts on his hands and head and was in hospital for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|The diverse {{linguistic}} and religious ethnicities that are native to Karnataka, combined with their long histories, have contributed immensely to the varied cultural {{heritage of the}} state. Apart from Kannadigas, Karnataka is home to Tuluvas, Kodavas and Konkanis. Minor populations of Tibetan Buddhists and tribes like the Soligas, Yeravas, Todas and Siddhis also live in Karnataka. The traditional folk arts cover the entire gamut of music, dance, drama, storytelling by itinerant troupes, etc. Yakshagana of Malnad and coastal Karnataka, a classical dance drama, {{is one of the}} major theatrical forms of Karnataka. Contemporary theatre culture in Karnataka remains vibrant with organisations like Ninasam, Ranga Shankara, Rangayana and Prabhat Kalavidaru continuing to <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foundations laid by Gubbi Veeranna, T. P. Kailasam, B. V. Karanth, K V Subbanna, Prasanna and others. Veeragase, Kamsale, Kolata and Dollu Kunitha are popular dance forms. The Mysore style of Bharatanatya, nurtured and popularised by the likes of the legendary Jatti Tayamma, continues to hold sway in Karnataka, and Bangalore also enjoys an eminent place as one of the foremost centres of Bharatanatya.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford {{proposals}} faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was {{an eastern}} bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; {{pass to the}} east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT's preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and a revelation that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not <b>build</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path of the proposed bypass. In response to the payment scheme, Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the MillsboroSouth area.|$|E
