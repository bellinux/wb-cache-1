Often the requirement is to encourage insects or plants or recreational use of such areas.

Copper, chromium and nickel total aqueous metal concentrations, although low, have been consistently removed (maximum efficiencies of 67. 3, 69. 8 and 87. 0 % respectively in the constructed wetland), particularly in the summer. Zinc showed the highest aqueous metal concentrations and the generally positive removal by the constructed wetland system (maximum efficiency of 60. 6 %) correlates with the expected metal uptake by Typha latifolia and Phragmites australis. Sediment levels for these metals and for lead progressively decreased over the one year monitoring period. For the two storm events monitored in the constructed wetland system, all metals showed evidence of removal (removal efficiencies of 24. 2 to 99. 4 %) except for copper. Lead and cadmium demonstrated the highest removal efficiencies followed by nickel and zinc.

This work was conducted between 26 th April and 14 th May 1999, as part of a programme of archaeological investigation along the line of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. An east/west aligned ditch discovered in the south-west corner of the site contained 64 sherds of late Iron Age/ early Romano-British pottery. A gully running parallel to the south, and two shallow ditches running parallel to the north, all produced contemporary material though in smaller quantities (9 sherds, 2 sherds and 10 sherds respectively). Two shallow scoops of uncertain function were cut by these linear features but contained the same type of pottery. A small cluster of shallow, charcoal-rich pits in the south east corner of the site contained the remains of at least four in situ cremation burials within late Iron Age/ early Romano-British pots, though these were much truncated by later ploughing. In addition to the cremation urn, one of these features contained several other smashed pots apparently representing grave goods. Two large north-east/south-west aligned ditches which ran continuously through the west half of the site were cut through a buried soil horizon which overlay the Iron Age/ Romano-British features. The only finds recovered from these features consisted of a few small fragments of post-medieval tile and glass. These two ditches, and a cobbled surface which appeared to be contemporary with this later phase of activity, were almost certainly associated with the adjacent former medieval manor house or later post-medieval garden (Boys Hall Moat Scheduled Ancient Monument, Kent SAM 146).

40|$|Lakes {{and ponds}} cover only about 4 % of the Earth’s non-glaciated surface 1, yet they {{represent}} disproportionately large sources of methane {{and carbon dioxide}} 2, 3, 4. Indeed, very small ponds (for example, < 0. 001 [*]km 2) may account for approximately 40 % of all CH 4 emissions from inland waters 5. Understanding how greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems will respond to global warming is therefore vital for forecasting biosphere–carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we present findings on {{the long-term effects of}} warming on the fluxes of GHGs and rates of ecosystem metabolism in experimental ponds. We show that shifts in CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes, and rates of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, observed in the first year became amplified over seven years of warming. The capacity to absorb CO 2 was nearly halved after seven years of warmer conditions. The phenology of greenhouse gas fluxes was also altered, with CO 2 drawdown and CH 4 emissions peaking one month earlier in the warmed treatments. These findings show that warming can fundamentally alter the carbon <b>balance</b> of small <b>ponds</b> over a number of years, reducing their capacity to sequester CO 2 and increasing emissions of CH 4; such positive feedbacks could ultimately accelerate climate change...|$|R
40|$|In the Canadian Western Boreal Plain (WBP), {{wetlands}} (ponds and peatlands) comprise up to 50 % of {{the landscape}} and represent unique habitat where summer precipitation is often outpaced by evapotranspiration and hillslope groundwater position does not follow topography. In this sub-humid location, groundwater fluxes and stores in riparian peatlands influence pond water levels and root zone moisture sources for forested uplands. To accurately describe the transport and retention of water in peat, {{it is important to}} consider peat subsidence. This paper quantifies the amount and effect of seasonal subsidence in a riparian peatland in the Utikuma Lake region in north-central Alberta, Canada. Results demonstrate that the deep and poorly decomposed peat deposits are resistant to compression, and that thick (and persistent) ground frost hinders pore collapse (shrinkage) above the water table until late summer when the ground has thawed. Even then, subsidence is still limited to the top 50 cm and is not closely related to changes in peatland water table or pond water level. Thus the water <b>balance</b> of these <b>ponds</b> and riparian areas appears to be less sensitive to peat volume changes than it is to the persistence of a substantial frost layer well into the snow-free period...|$|R

An accurate sediment profile of the soft-watery layer that includes several important parameters can only be determined by using an adequate sampling technique.

This research advances previous {{efforts to develop}} a model of mass and energy <b>balance</b> for supraglacial <b>ponds</b> by applying a free-convection approach to account for energy exchanges at the subaqueous bare-ice surfaces. We develop the model using field data from a pond on Lirung Glacier, Nepal, that was monitored during the 2013 and 2014 monsoon periods. Sensitivity testing is performed for several key parameters, and alternative melt algorithms are compared with the model. The pond acts as a significant recipient of energy for the glacier system, and actively participates in the glacier’s hydrologic system during the monsoon. Melt rates are 2 - 4 cm d- 1 (total of 98. 5 m 3 over the study period) for bare ice {{in contact with the}} pond, and < 1 mmd- 1 (total of 10. 6 m 3) for the saturated debris zone. The majority of absorbed atmospheric energy leaves the pond system through englacial conduits, delivering sufficient energy to melt 2612 m 3 additional ice over the study period (38. 4 m 3 d- 1).

40|$|The general over-development of {{aquaculture}} had profound disturbance on {{the surrounding}} ecosystem, affecting, not only fisheries, but aquaculture itself through release of effluent loaded with nutrients into open waters leading to eutrophication and deterioration of water quality. Shrimp aquaculture {{is one of}} the fastest growing economic activities in the Asia-Pacific region, where almost 80 % of the world production of farmed shrimp occurs, but has slowed down recently for a number of reasons. These include eutrophication of coastal waters, mangrove destruction, stock losses due to disease outbreaks, primarily as a result of unrestricted expansion and environmental problems from mismanagement and over intensification (Phillips et al., 1993).

The project included travel to Honduras in January 2009 for a field survey of these facilities. In addition, the students undertook more focused individual work on various facets of sustainable wastewater treatment. Robert McLean examined options for enhancing performance of an existing Imhoff tank. Mahua Bhattacharya investigated sludge handling practices and alternatives including a study of sludge resource value and potential reuse.

This thesis presents a summary of this investigation including a Honduran national and water sector background, and trends based upon site visits and observations. With {{the context of the}} sanitation sector thus defined, a detailed investigation of wastewater stabilization ponds follows. This study explores hydrodynamic changes and water quality improvements attainable through various modifications in maintenance and operation of these facilities. Extensive use of flow modeling is employed to demonstrate the quantifiable impact of the modifications discussed. (cont.) Analytical calculations of ideal pond performance are compared to computer numerical flow modeling results, computed using the INTROGLLVHT modeling software. This comparison examines the sensitivity of pond performance to a number of variable factors including sludge accumulation and distribution, pond outlet geometry, and inlet flow symmetry. The largest effect and greatest sensitivity was found for unbalanced, asymmetric flows, yielding greatly reduced pond efficiency. Sludge accumulation had a significant effect on final effluent quality due to reduced pond volume and residence time. However, the distribution of a given volume of sludge and the spacing of pond outlets both had minimal effect on effluent quality. Recommendations for pond maintenance developed from this analysis include a careful <b>balance</b> of <b>pond</b> flow and strict adherence to a scheduled desludging routine. by Lisa Kullen.

An experimental solar pond pilot plant was constructed in central Catalonia (NE part of the Iberian Peninsula). The body of the pond is a cylindrical reinforced concrete tank, with 3 m height, 8 m diameter and total area of 50 m 2. The lateral tank wall has been insulated with 60 mm of rock wool. The gradient in the solar pond was settled and maintained since 30 September 2009 to date. The developed tool was validated by comparing simulation results to experimental data collected from the experimental solar pond from November 2009 until August 2011. The resulting first-order differential equations describing the overall energy <b>balance</b> in the <b>pond</b> were solved numerically using a finite-difference method. The temperature profiles of the pond were properly described, especially at lower subzones of the non-convective zone (NCZ) and the lower convective zone (LCZ).

Once validated, successfully, the model was used to predict the thermal performance of pre-industrial solar pond to be constructed and operated in Granada, SW of Spain. The thermal profiles predicted temperature differences between surface and bottom of around 40 °C during summer time, with a maximum temperature of 75 °C.

We derived present-day weathering flux estimates for soil minerals in a forested watershed in central New Hamp-shire using a geochemical mass <b>balance.</b> The Cone <b>Pond</b> watershed is characterized by low-alkalinity surface waters and acidic Spodosols developed on a thin mantle of locally derived till, making it susceptible to continued inputs of acid precipitation. Weathering reactions were developed {{on the basis of}} observed pat-terns of mineral abundance in the soil profile and measured mineral chemistry. The dissolu-tion of approximately 171 mol ha– 1 yr– 1 of pla-gioclase feldspar is the predominant weather-ing reaction at Cone Pond. Weathering fluxes of hornblende, biotite, chlorite, and potassium feldspar ranged from 3 to 20 mol ha– 1 yr– 1, an order of magnitude lower. When normalized to their abundances in the soil, however, horn-blende and chlorite had the fastest weathering rates, as measured by cation release. Chemical weathering, mainly of plagioclase, resulted in the neutralization of only 52 % of incoming acidity. Furthermore, silicate weathering could only account for the release of about 53 mol ha– 1 yr– 1 of Ca, compared to the observed net output (stream loss minus bulk precipita-tion input) of 75 mol ha– 1 yr– 1. On the basis of these observations and a companion study, we conclude that current acid inputs exceed the ability of Cone Pond soils to neutralize hydro-gen ion, and that depletion of approximately 22 – 53 mol ha– 1 yr– 1 of Ca from labile soil pools is occurring in this area. The rate of Ca deple-tion is one-third to one-eighth of the rate esti-mated for a more base-rich watershed nearby...|$|R

This thesis describes an ecological assessment performed to provide baseline information on salt ponds on St. John, U. S. Virgin Islands, to recommend a range of indicators to determine the water quality of a salt pond, and to suggest areas of further research to help maintain the value that salt ponds provide to the island. Quantitative and {{qualitative data were collected}} for fifteen ponds on the island. These data consist of a descriptive habitat assessment including pond classification, shore characteristics, water characteristics, biota characteristics, specific pond descriptions, as well as macro-invertebrates and chlorophyll a levels sampled in each of the ponds. Findings are presented by salinity, housing density, nitrate levels, dissolved oxygen, macro-invertebrates, species richness, and chlorophyll a. To determine correlation between variables measured, data are then analyzed by pair regression analysis. Multivariate regression results are presented for three independent variables: species richness, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen. In the multivariate regression analysis of species richness, the most significantly correlated factors are berm height, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate levels; chlorophyll is significantly related to temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate levels, and salinity levels; and dissolved oxygen is significantly correlated with depth, berm height, temperature, and pH. The results of this study seem to contradict the original hypothesis-that salt pond health is adversely affected by human development. A series of recommendations are proposed including monitoring sentinel species and metrics, beginning an ongoing salt pond measurement program, performing a nitrogen <b>balance</b> for the <b>ponds,</b> conducting sediment studies on the ponds, and considering the implementation of buffer zones around the ponds. by Alexa Gangemi.

This thesis uses remote sensing and field methods to assess the distribution of supraglacial ponds in the Langtang Valley of Nepal, then develops and applies numerical models of <b>pond</b> surface energy <b>balance</b> to determine energy receipts at the pond, glacier, and basin scales. 172 Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes are analysed to identify thawed supraglacial ponds for the debris-covered tongues of five glaciers for the period 1999 - 2013. There is high variability in the incidence of ponding between glaciers, and ponds are most frequent in zones of low surface gradient and velocity. The ponds show a pronounced seasonality, appearing rapidly in the pre-monsoon as snow melts, reaching a peak area in the monsoon of about 2 % of the debris-covered area, then declining in the post-monsoon as ponds drain or freeze. The satellite observations are supplemented by diverse field observations on Lirung Glacier in the Langtang Valley made in 2013 and 2014, confirming that overall pond area is markedly higher in the pre-monsoon than post-monsoon. Four ponds are observed in detail showing pond drainage, stability, and growth. The thesis then advances efforts to develop a model of mass and energy <b>balance</b> for supraglacial <b>ponds,</b> using field data from a small pond on Lirung Glacier. Sensitivity testing is performed for several key parameters and alternative melt algorithms. The pond acts as a significant recipient of energy, and participates in the glacier’s local hydrologic system during the monsoon. The majority of absorbed energy leaves the pond via englacial conduits, delivering sufficient energy to melt 2612 m 3 of ice (~ 5. 3 m ablation for the pond area). Energy receipts for all Lirung Glacier ponds for 2014 are then determined, using the full model and simpler approaches based on data availability. The partition of absorbed energy between pond-proximal and englacial melt is inconsistent between ponds, and the shortwave energy balance alone is not adequate to represent pond energy absorption. The model results suggest that ponds absorbed sufficient energy to account for ~ 10 % of Lirung Glacier’s ablation in 2014. Finally, a simplified pond surface energy-balance model is applied to assess pond energy absorption for the entire Langtang catchment, using local meteorological data for 2013 and mean monthly pond distributions from the Landsat observations. Supraglacial ponds are found to absorb sufficient atmospheric energy to account for 5 - 16 % (mean ~ 12 %) of the debris-covered area’s volume loss in 2013 (equivalent to 0. 11 m thinning for this area). Less absorption occurs in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon than in the monsoon due to decreased latent heat exchange. Altitude is an additional control, but seasonal surface energy balance remains positive at the ELA of 5400 m. This research suggests that due to the efficiency of supraglacial ponds as vectors of atmospheric energy to the glaciers’ interior, they may account for a considerable portion of the debris-covered area’s ablation (~ 10 %) in spite of their low aerial coverage (1 - 2 %), and ponds must be accounted for in studies of debris-covered glacier ablation and evolution...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{accelerated}} climatic warming {{during the}} past fifty years, interest and concerns have been growing about changes in the ecological integrity of shallow freshwater ponds that dominate {{the landscape of the}} Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL). Climatic warming is altering the hydrological processes that influence the water <b>balances</b> in these <b>ponds,</b> but knowledge remains insufficient to determine the effects these changes have on ecological conditions in the ponds. To address this knowledge gap, this study examines the relations between current hydrological and limnological conditions and recently deposited sedimentary assemblages of diatoms and photosynthetic pigments in 23 shallow ponds in the HBL. The knowledge from the contemporary studies will be used to inform paleolimnological reconstructions using multiple proxies at two ponds to assess how hydroecological conditions have changed {{during the past}} several centuries in response to climatic variations. Water samples were collected three times in 2010 to explore the relations between current hydrological and limnological conditions. The climatic conditions in 2010 provided an excellent opportunity to assess the effects that continued climate warming may exert on hydrolimnological conditions in the study ponds as the warm, dry conditions during the early thaw-season (May- mid-July) followed by extremely wet conditions {{for the remainder of the}} thaw-season are likely representative of future climate scenarios. The analysis revealed that the water chemistry in the ponds evolved along one of four different ‘trajectories’ throughout the thaw-season in 2010. These seasonal patterns of limnological conditions closely aligned with similar patterns identified in a study of contemporary hydrological conditions (Light, 2011; Wolfe et al., 2011). The patterns identified in both the hydrological and limnological studies were attributed to differences among ponds in catchment characteristics and hydrological connectivity with adjacent basins. Surface sediment samples were collected in 2010 to determine if hydrolimnological conditions are reflected in the distribution of recently deposited diatom and pigment communities. It was determined that diatom community composition was most highly influenced by the availability of microhabitat in the ponds which did not appear to be controlled by hydrological conditions. Nitrogen availability was determined to be indirectly influencing diatom community composition as the nitrogen-limited conditions in the ponds favoured the proliferation of N 2 -fixing cyanobacterial mats that provided a large amount of epiphytic habitat in the majority of the study ponds. This resulted in the complete domination of diatom assemblages by one diatom specie that was closely associated with these algal mats in the surface sediments of most ponds. Aphanizophyll, a photosynthetic pigment representative of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, was also in the highest concentration in most of the study ponds as a result of the nitrogen-limiting conditions that allowed these organisms to dominate. Ponds located in the tundra ecozone were also found to have the highest overall pigment concentration which was related to a longer growing season due to the small size of these ponds that resulted in earlier ice-off conditions. The longer growing season of ponds in the tundra ecozone may also be due to high winds that cause a decrease in snow cover, lower surface albedos and an earlier onset of the spring thaw. The paleolimnological reconstruction of two of the ponds revealed similar shifts in diatom community composition in the stratigraphic record even though patterns of past change in their basin hydrology, as explored though the analysis of the δ 18 OPW record archived in the aquatic cellulose contained in the pond sediments, was very different. The water balance of “Left Lake” was found to be highly influenced by increased evaporation associated with recent warming trends as it is a relatively small basin that becomes hydrologically isolated after the melt period. However, “Erin Lake” was not as susceptible to evaporation during the recent warming trend due to its larger catchment and hydrological connections to other ponds. Both of these ponds experienced marked changes in the diatom assemblages. The changes were characterized by a shift from assemblages containing both small, adnate, benthic taxa that prefer mineral grain substrates and epiphytic taxa that are associated with the cyanobacterial mats covering the pond bottoms to assemblages entirely dominated by epiphytic taxa. The shift in diatom community composition occurred ~ 1820 in Left Lake, but the timing cannot be determined with any degree of confidence in Erin Lake as no diatoms are observed in the sediment record during the period when the change occurred (~ 1550 to 1850) due to preservation issues. Analysis of fossil pigments indicates that nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have been important to the ecology of the ponds over the entire sediment record. However, there is a trend towards lower concentrations of pigments representative of N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria in the most recent sediments. The trend in cyanobacterial pigment concentrations coincides with inferred changes in nitrogen availability from the geochemical analysis of the pond sediments by Light (2011). This recent shift in nutrient status may be the result of a number of factors including the increased atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically-derived nitrogen or changes in biogeochemical cycling in the ponds...|$|R
