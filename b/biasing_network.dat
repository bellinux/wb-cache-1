[...] The model was re-designated as the FZ-1a, keeping the same wedge shaped enclosure as the FZ-1. [...] In 1968, an updated model with a different look and sound was introduced, with a circuit designed by Robert Moog using a 9 volt power supply and alternatively 2 or 4 silicon transistors, and labelled the Maestro FZ-1B. It went through 3 circuit revisions. [...] In the 1970s Maestro came out with the The FZ-1S Super-Fuzz, which had a distinctly different look and sound than previous models.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{wireless}} communication systems transmit complex modulated signals with high {{peak to average ratio}} {{in order to}} deliver high data rates. It demands wide bandwidth and rigorous efficiency performance for power amplifiers. Today’s conventional RF power amplifiers have relatively poor operating efficiency and require more power and area for operation. Therefore, more research on high efficiency power amplifier is crucial to the growth of the wireless industry. Until recent days, WiMAX systems are using technology processes such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and Si LDMOSFET to obtain the performance. Although they are providing the required functional performance, they do not optimize cost and/or size. The primary focus of this thesis is to enhance the efficiency and output power of a compact microwave Power Amplifier suitable for a WiMAX base station. To achieve this goal, this thesis explores the highly efficient switched mode Class E microwave power amplifier using the Gallium Nitride on Silicon Carbide HFET (GaN-on-SiC) technology. The smallest gate length (0. 15 µm) device recently released by NRC is used in this design. It provides higher performance at lower cost and area than the alternative Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) technology. Importance is given in designing the bias network of the device. The <b>biasing</b> <b>network</b> has a great impact on efficiency of power amplifiers. Many new techniques of Class E design have been presented to date, but there is not significant improvement related to the <b>biasing</b> <b>network.</b> A highly efficient Class E power amplifier for WiMAX base station transmitter was developed in this thesis for 2. 5 GHz application.

30|$|As {{the signal}} {{bandwidth}} gets wider, {{such as in}} WCDMA, mobile WiMAX and 3 GPP LTE and LTE-advanced (up to 100 MHz bandwidth, five component carriers of carrier aggregation), PAs begin to exhibit memory effects. This {{is especially true for}} those high PAs used in wireless base stations. The causes of the memory effects can be attributed to thermal constants of the active devices or components in the <b>biasing</b> <b>network</b> that have frequency-dependent behaviors. As a result, the current output of the PA depends not only on the current input, but also on past input values. In other words, the PA becomes a nonlinear system with memory. For such a PA, memoryless predistortion can achieve only very limited linearization performance. Therefore, digital predistorters must need to have memory structures [7].|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} non-contact bio-potential sensor which can quickly respond to input transient events, is insensitive to mechanical disturbances, and operates with a bandwidth from 0. 04 Hz – 20 kHz, with input voltage noise spectral density of 200 nV / √Hz at 1 kHz. Initial investigations {{focused on the}} development of an active biasing scheme to control the sensors input impedance in response to input transient events. This scheme was found to significantly reduce the settling time of the sensor; however the input impedance was degraded, and the device was sensitive to distance fluctuations. Further research was undertaken, and a circuit developed to preserve fast settling times, whilst decreasing the sensitivity to distance fluctuations. A novel amplifier <b>biasing</b> <b>network</b> was developed using a pair of junction field effect transistors (JFETs), which actively compensates for DC and low frequency interference, whilst maintaining high impedance at signal frequencies. This <b>biasing</b> <b>network</b> significantly reduces the settling time, allowing bio-potentials to be measured quickly after sensor application, and speeding up recovery when the sensor is in saturation. Further work focused on reducing the sensitivity to mechanical disturbances even further. A positive feedback path with low phase error was introduced to reduce the effective input capacitance of the sensor. Tuning of the positive feedback loop gain was achieved with coarse and fine control potentiometers, allowing very precise gains to be achieved. The sensor was found to be insensitive to distance fluctuations of up to 0. 5 mm at 1 Hz, and up to 2 mm at 5 kHz. As a complement to the non-contact sensor, an amplifier to measure differential bio-potentials was developed. This differential amplifier achieved a CMRR of greater than 100 dB up to 10 kHz.
