40|$|ABSTRACT: Drug {{efficacy}} {{does not}} always increase sigmoidally with concentration, which has puzzled the community for decades. Unlike standard sigmoidal <b>curves,</b> <b>bell-shaped</b> concentration− response <b>curves</b> suggest more complex biological effects, such as multiple-binding sites or multiple targets. Here, we investigate a physical property-based mechanism for <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curves.</b> Beginning with the observation that some drugs form colloidal aggregates at relevant concentrations, we determined concentration−response curves for three aggregating anticancer drugs, formulated both as colloids and as free monomer. Colloidal formulations exhibited <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curves,</b> losing activity at higher concentrations, while monomeric formulations gave typical sigmoidal curves, sustaining a plateau of maximum activity. Inverting the question, we next asked if molecules with <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curves,</b> reported in the literature, form colloidal aggregates at relevant concentrations. We selected 12 molecules reported to have <b>bell-shaped</b> concentration− response <b>curves</b> and found that five of these formed colloids. To understand the mechanism behind the loss of activity at concentrations where colloids are present, we investigated the diffusion of colloid-forming dye Evans blue into cells. We foun...|$|R

2500|$|Oystercatcher mussel feeding {{provides}} an example of how the optimal diet model can be utilized. [...] Oystercatchers forage on mussels and crack them open with their bills. The constraints on these birds are the characteristics of the different mussel sizes. While large mussels provide more energy than small mussels, large mussels are harder to crack open due to their thicker shells. This means that while large mussels have a higher energy content (E), they also have a longer handling time (h). The profitability of any mussel is calculated as E/h. [...] The oystercatchers must decide which mussel size will provide enough nutrition to outweigh the cost and energy required to open it. In their study, Meire and Ervynck tried to model this decision by graphing the relative profitabilities of different sized mussels. They came up with a <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curve,</b> indicating that moderately sized mussels were the most profitable. However, they observed that if an oystercatcher rejected too many small mussels, the time it took to search for the next suitable mussel greatly increased. This observation shifted their bell-curve to the right (Figure 4). [...] However, while this model predicted that oystercatchers should prefer mussels of 50–55mm, the observed data showed that oystercatchers actually prefer mussels of 30–45mm. Meire and Ervynk then realized the preference of mussel size did not only depend on the profitability of the prey, but also on the prey density. After this was accounted for, they found a good agreement between the model's prediction and the observed data.|$|E

LCAO, as PSAO, was substantially more reactive than BSAO with aliphatic diamines and histamine. The k(cat) and k(cat) /K-m for putrescine were four and six order of magnitude higher, respectively. Differences were smaller with some aromatic monoamines. The plot of k(cat) versus hydrogen ions concentration produced <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curves,</b> the maximum of which was substrate dependent, shifting from neutral pH with putrescine to alkaline pH with phenylethylamine and benzylamine. The latter substrates made the site more hydrophobic and increased the pK(a) of both enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product adducts. The plot of k(cat) /K-m versus hydrogen ion concentration produced approximately parallel <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curves.</b> Similar pK(a) couples were obtained from the latter curves, in agreement with the assignment as free enzyme and free substrate pK(a).

Here the classical view represented by the Gompertz function (GF) approach was challenged using two novel approaches based on parametric generalized linear models (GLMs) and data-driven generalized additive models (GAMs). These three approaches (GFs, GLMs, and GAMs) were used to describe seasonal changes in cell numbers {{in each of the}} xylem differentiation phases and to calculate the timing of cell development in three conifer species [Picea abies (L.), Pinus sylvestris L., and Abies alba Mill. ]. GAMs outperformed GFs and GLMs in describing intra-annual wood formation dynamics, showing two left-skewed <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curves</b> for division and enlargement, and a right-skewed bimodal curve for thickening. Cell residence times progressively decreased through the season for enlargement, whilst increasing late but rapidly for thickening. These patterns match changes in cell anatomical features within a tree ring, which allows the separation of earlywood and latewood into two distinct cell populations. A novel statistical approach is presented which renews our understanding of xylogenesis, a dynamic biological process in which the rate of cell production interplays with cell residence times in each developmental phase to create complex seasonal patterns...|$|R

However, they may possess possible pro-oxidative effects, which could be based on their reducing potential. The aims of this study were to evaluate the ability of 26 flavonoids to reduce ferric ions at relevant pH conditions and to find a possible relationship with potentiation of hydroxyl radical production. A substantial ferric ions reduction was achieved under acidic conditions, particularly by flavonols and flavanols with the catecholic ring B. Apparently corresponding <b>bell-shaped</b> <b>curves</b> displaying the pro-oxidant effect of flavonols quercetin and kaempferol on iron-based Fenton reaction were documented. Several flavonoids were efficient antioxidants at very low concentrations but rather inefficient or pro-oxidative at higher concentrations. Flavonols, morin and rutin were progressively pro-oxidant, while 7 -hydroxyflavone and hesperetin were the only flavonoids with dose-dependent inhibition of hydroxyl radical production. Conclusively, administration of flavonoids may lead to unpredictable consequences with few exceptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
