30|$|To detect closest shops is less trivial. We cannot use a {{straight}} <b>line</b> <b>distance</b> as done in [2], {{because it is}} unrealistic {{and it will not}} represent well the actual distance from the customer to the shop. Moreover, the straight <b>line</b> <b>distance</b> does not help us in evaluating our temporal definition of distance. Since we have the addresses of both the shop and the customer, we systematically query the Google Directions APIs of Google Maps. 1 Querying all possible 544, 225 × 125 combinations is infeasible, so we decided to submit a query for a customer-shop pair only if their straight <b>line</b> <b>distance</b> is 25 kilometers or less. With this filter, each customer has only up to 5 - 6 alternative shops, with most customers having 3 shops or less.|$|R

40|$|Most {{multimodal}} optimization algorithms use the {{so called}} niching methods mahfoud 1995 niching {{in order to promote}} diversity during optimization, while others, like Artificial Immune Systems de 2010 conceptual try to find multiple solutions as its main objective. One of such algorithms, called dopt-aiNet de 2005 artificial, introduced the <b>Line</b> <b>Distance</b> that measures the distance between two solutions regarding their basis of attraction.
