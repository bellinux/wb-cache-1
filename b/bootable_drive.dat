40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Collective, {{a system that}} delivers managed desktops to personal computer (PC) users. System administrators {{are responsible for the}} creation and maintenance of the desktop environments, or virtual appliances, which include the operating system and all installed applications. PCs run client software, called the virtual appliance transceiver, that caches and runs the latest copies of appliances locally and continuously backs up changes to user data to a network repository. This model provides the advantages of central management, such as better security and lower cost of management, while leveraging the cost-effectiveness of commodity PCs. With a straightforward design, this model provides a comprehensive suite of important system functions including machine lockdown, system updates, error recovery, backups, and support for mobility. These functions are made available to all desktop environments that run on the x 86 architecture, while remaining protected from the environments and their many vulnerabilities. The model is suitable for managing computers on a LAN, WAN with broadband, or even computers occasionally disconnected from the network like a laptop. Users can access their desktops from any Collective client; they can also carry a <b>bootable</b> <b>drive</b> that converts a PC into a client; finally, they can use a remote display client from a browser to access their desktop running on a remote server. We have developed a prototype of the Collective system and have used it for almost a year. We have found the system helpful in simplifying the management of our desktops while imposing little performance overhead. ...|$|E

50|$|Fees {{are usually}} charged for {{distribution}} on compact discs and <b>bootable</b> USB <b>drives,</b> or for services of installing or maintaining {{the operation of}} free software. Development of large, commercially used free software is often funded {{by a combination of}} user donations, corporate contributions, and tax money. Depending on the license type, free software can be embedded in commercial products, too. The SELinux project at the United States National Security Agency {{is an example of a}} federally funded free software project.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, USB {{flash drive}} {{installations}} {{can be used}} to boot Ubuntu and Kubuntu in a way that allows permanent saving of user settings and portability of the USB-installed system between physical machines (however, the computers' BIOS must support booting from USB). In newer versions of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Live USB creator {{can be used to}} install Ubuntu on a USB drive (with or without a live CD or DVD). Creating a <b>bootable</b> USB <b>drive</b> with persistence is as simple as dragging a slider to determine how much space to reserve for persistence; for this, Ubuntu employs casper.|$|R
50|$|Newer {{versions}} of EasyBCD also support creating bootable USB disks, by deploying BOOTMGR and the BCD onto a removable disk and performing the necessary actions {{to make the}} <b>drive</b> <b>bootable,</b> after which it can be loaded into EasyBCD to add and remove the various supported entry types {{in order to create}} bootable repair USB sticks.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to install and run Windows Vista or Windows 7 on the earlier model laptop. In high-end versions appearing during 2009, Windows Vista is pre-installed. The lack of a DVD-ROM drive requires creating a <b>bootable</b> USB flash <b>drive</b> (the on-board card reader slots are not bootable) using a USB external DVD drive or PXE boot network install.|$|R
50|$|Windows To Go is {{a feature}} {{exclusive}} to the Enterprise version of Windows 8 which allows an organization to provision <b>bootable</b> USB flash <b>drives</b> with a Windows installation on them, allowing users to access their managed environment on any compatible PC. Windows 8.1 updates this feature to enable booting from a USB composite device with a storage and a smart card function.|$|R
5000|$|Finnix can be run {{completely}} within RAM, {{provided the}} system has at least 192 MiB RAM available. If a [...] "toram" [...] option is passed to Finnix, most {{of the contents of}} the CD are copied to a RAM disk, and the CD is ejected, freeing the CD-ROM drive for other purposes. [...] Finnix can also be placed on a <b>bootable</b> USB thumb <b>drive,</b> or installed permanently on a hard drive (though still functioning {{as if it were a}} LiveCD).|$|R
5000|$|... ext2 {{is still}} {{recommended}} over journaling file systems on <b>bootable</b> USB flash <b>drives</b> and other solid-state drives. ext2 performs fewer writes than ext3 {{because there is}} no journaling. As the major aging factor of a flash chip is the number of erase cycles, and as erase cycles happen frequently on writes, decreasing writes increases the life span of the solid-state device. Another good practice for filesystems on flash devices is the use of the noatime mount option, for the same reason.|$|R
50|$|BackTrack (Kali's predecessor) {{contained}} a mode known as forensic mode, which was carried over to Kali via live boot. This mode {{is very popular}} for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a <b>bootable</b> Kali USB <b>drive</b> or CD, and this option {{makes it easy to}} apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled. However, the developers recommend that users test these features extensively before using Kali for real world forensics.|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{emissions}} {{of thousands of}} animal houses is needed to obtain representative emission factors and relevant categories of animal farms for emission inventories. This scale is also necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of all facotrs that influence ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions at the farm scale. A robust and low-cost method was developed in France to measure emissions from poultry, bovine and swine houses. A database and associated software is presented here that helps to apply this method to {{a large number of}} houses, while protecting the data when the database is used by different companies or institutions. It is based on freeware: an Ubuntu system, OpenOffice for testing equations, PostgreSQL and PgAdmin for database management with “user-only” or “project-only” restricted access to data, and C++ with CodeBlocks and wxWidgets for the calculation and interface modules developed. As for typical Ubuntu software, all messages in the interfaces developed can be translated into several languages using PoEdit. All systems, software and data can be stored on a <b>bootable</b> USB flash <b>drive</b> or SD card with at least two partitions, one for the system (FAT 32) compressed into a squashfs file, and one for the modified files (EXT 2). The data are divided into three categories: national references (e. g. manure composition), farm references (e. g. specific house characteristics), and observations (e. g. gas concentrations). Training is recommended to begin using the software more quickly. Further development is required to adapt this tool to monitor the results of mitigation strategies and improve their efficiency...|$|R
