5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge {{has begun}} to panic over being unable to {{communicate}} with Homer, as she knows nothing of his undercover work and cannot get any information on his whereabouts. She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories. Fit Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as Fit Fat Tony and then simply Fat Tony - now physically indistinguishable from the original.|$|E
25|$|On 28 February 1793 {{there was}} a clash at Levens in which Biron's 12,000 Frenchmen {{defeated}} 7,000 Sardinians under the Count of Saint-André. Both sides suffered 800 casualties while the Sardinians also lost two of their six artillery pieces. At this period, the Sardinians were more familiar with mountain warfare while the French columns, moving separately, often lost themselves in the forests, rough terrain and foggy valleys. Biron's offensive was helped when the Army of the Alps took responsibility over the Barcelonette valley and the County of Beuil. Moving east, the French overran the lower Var and Vésubie valleys and occupied Sospel. In March the Army of Italy counted 17,000 troops present for duty in 25 infantry battalions and two cavalry squadrons. Already a rising star, André Masséna had charge of five battalions. In its strange policy of moving commanders around before they could master their armies, the French government transferred Biron to lead the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle on 4 May 1793. Though the duke was loyal to the French Revolution, the Jacobins planned to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> {{because he was a}} prominent aristocrat. They finally succeeded and Biron went to the guillotine on 31 December 1793.|$|E

500|$|In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner {{writes that}} Bob {{is built into}} a highbrow snob and {{conservative}} Republican so that the writers can continually hit him with a rake and <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> He represents high culture while Krusty, one of his archenemies, represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart {{is a product of}} a [...] "mass-culture upbringing" [...] and thus is Bob's enemy.|$|E
500|$|This story occurs {{some time}} after {{the events of the}} kinetic novel, as human civilization struggles in a losing battle against the {{poisonous}} rain. Three of the last inhabitants of a nearly abandoned underground fallout shelter—named Levi, Ruth, and Job—find a quaint old man collapsed in the snow outside the bunker. When they <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> they are surprised to hear the adults calling him [...] "Man of the Stars". The children grow quite interested about his strange nickname, as well as {{the fact that they have}} never seen a visitor from the outside world. The old man recovers a bit and has the children help him in putting together a portable planetarium projector. This story offers an ultimate conclusion to the story in the kinetic novel.|$|E
500|$|HIStory {{received}} generally positive reviews. Arguably Jackson's most angry, raw, emotional album, the new {{tracks on}} HIStory revealed a musician worn and torn {{by years of}} superstardom, now reportedly reacting against people who tried to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> This reaction is what some people say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It {{has been a long}} time since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with you into a fight." [...] Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described [...] "This Time Around", [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "D.S." [...] as [...] "superb slices of organic funk that will fuel many of the summer's busiest dance floors".|$|E

500|$|As well {{as trying}} to take over Lassiter's, Diana also wants to [...] "settle a score with Paul Robinson". Paul stands in her way of {{achieving}} her goal as his place within the company is secure for life as Diana's boss, Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), is Paul's aunt. Badler explained that Diana resents Paul as she is not part of his family and knows that she cannot ever be at the top. Further to that, Paul and Diana were once lovers and Diana fell in love with him, but he walked out on her and broke her heart. Stefan Dennis said that Paul and Diana's relationship came at a time when Paul was [...] "a philandering playboy and didn't care." [...] Paul became one of a few men that Diana has ever fallen in love with and because he treated her badly, she decides to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> Badler said that Diana has been keeping an eye on Paul and knows everything about what he has been up to. Following her arrival, Diana begins to make Paul's life [...] "a nightmare" [...] and Badler said [...] "Diana's back to force him {{to fall in love with}} her again, or destroy him – whichever comes first".|$|E
500|$|Garibay {{said that}} [...] "Judas" [...] sounded similar {{to many of}} Gaga's {{previous}} singles, like [...] "Poker Face", [...] "LoveGame", [...] "Bad Romance", and [...] "Alejandro". According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, [...] "Judas" [...] finds Gaga in a similar territory music-wise but vocally she is in completely new territory; according to Popjustice, in the verses and pre-chorus, Gaga hurls herself into a decadent half-sung, half-rapped Jamaican Patois style." [...] Jason Gregory of Gigwise called the song a [...] "heavy slice of electro-house of the highest order". The song contains three hooks, and begins with Gaga singing the line [...] "Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm in love with Judas", accompanied by building synths. This {{is followed by a}} thumping electronic beat, as Gaga sings, [...] "Judahhh/ Juda-a-ah/ Gaga". The utterance of these words are reminiscent of the opening verse in [...] "Bad Romance". Gaga's vocals are partially spoken, and at times have a Caribbean accent. The first verse follows as: [...] "When he comes to me I am ready/ I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs/ Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain/ Even after three times, he betrays me/ I'll <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> a king with no crown." [...] The tone lightens up on the song's chorus, which is influenced by '80s pop in its melody, as the beat picks up a bit and Gaga sings, [...] "I'm just a holy fool/ Oh, baby, it's so cruel/ But I'm still in love with Judas, baby." ...|$|E

In Act 4, Scene 6, after Warwick has successfully deposed Edward, Henry says to him, [...] "Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,/I here resign my government to thee" [...] (l.24). Finally, upon meeting Richmond (the future Henry VII), Henry proclaims, [...] "His head by nature framed to wear a crown,/His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself/Likely in time to bless a regal throne" [...] (ll.72–74).|$|E
2500|$|The {{main effect}} of Capone's {{conviction}} was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but {{those involved in the}} jailing of Capone portrayed it as considerably undermining the city's organized crime syndicate. Far from being smashed, the Chicago Outfit continued without being troubled by the Chicago police, but at a lower-level and without the open violence that had marked Capone's rule. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once Prohibition was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down,</b> to the extent that {{there is a lack of}} consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead [...] "front boss". Prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 1950s, FBI agents discovered an organization led by Capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld.|$|E

She continued saying that Silas [...] "gets off" [...] {{on the idea that}} Lynsey is trying to prevent him from killing again as it makes his game more interesting. Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove) portrays her murdered sister, India (Beth Kingston), in a reconstruction of India's death. The actress {{explained that}} during the campaign Lynsey notices Silas is smiling and [...] "his eyes are full of glee while Texas is clearly in turmoil" [...] reconfirming her earlier suspicions that Silas killed India. Lynsey steals India's necklace from Texas and plants it on Silas before calling the polie with an anonymous tip-off. Hassan revealed that Lynsey does this in the hope that Silas' lies will unravel, explaining that now Lynsey has [...] "entered into this game of cat-and-mouse with Silas, she'll get deeper and deeper".|$|E
2500|$|While Krusty {{represents}} low culture, Sideshow Bob represents high culture. He {{began his}} career as the non-speaking sidekick on Krusty the Clown's television show. Frustrated by his early role as the target of [...] "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that [...] "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." [...] He also tries to [...] "manipulate the tastes of the masses" [...] by becoming a criminal mastermind. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a [...] "mass-culture upbringing" [...] and thus is Bob's enemy. Turner writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative Republican so that the writers can continually hit him with a rake and <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Howell's The Second Part of Henry the Sixt {{was based}} on the folio text rather than the quarto; however, it {{departed}} from that text in a number of places. For example, numerous lines were cut from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include; in Act 1, Scene 1, both of Gloucester's references to Bedford are absent (ll. 82–83, 95–96), as is the reference to Suffolk's demands that he be paid for escorting Margaret from France (ll. 131–133), and York's allusion to Althaea and Calydon in his closing soliloquy (ll.231–235). Absent in Act 2, Scene 1 is Gloucester's question to Winchester [...] "Is your priesthood grown peremptory?Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?" [...] (ll.23–24), as are lines 173–180, where Winchester taunts Gloucester about Eleanor's arrest and Gloucester calls off their duel. York's outline of Edward III's seven sons is absent from Act 2, Scene 2 (ll.10–17), as is Salisbury's reference to Owen Glendower (l.41). Suffolk's accusation that Gloucester was involved in necromancy with Eleanor is omitted from Act 3, Scene 1 (ll.47–53), as is Gloucester's outline of how he dealt with criminals during his time as Protector (ll.128–132). Also absent from 3.1 are the comments by Winchester, Suffolk and Margaret after Gloucester accuses them of conspiring to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>down</b> (ll.172–185), and York's references to how he fought alongside Cade in Ireland (ll.360–370). In Act 4, Scene 1, all references to Walter Whitmore's name as Gualtier are absent (ll.38–39). The entirety of Act 4, Scene 5 (a brief scene showing Scales and Gough on patrol at the Tower of London) is absent. In Act 5, Scene 1, some of the dialogue between Clifford and Warwick is absent (ll.200–210).|$|E
