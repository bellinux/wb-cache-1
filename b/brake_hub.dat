5000|$|... m/42 - The most {{well-known}} Swedish military bicycle. It {{was produced by}} several large Swedish bicycle manufacturers (Rex, Husqvarna, Monark, Nymans) from the 1940s to the 1950s with a maximum of interchangeable parts. [...] It uses a rear, one-speed Novo C coaster <b>brake</b> <b>hub,</b> and a Husqvarna-produced front drum brake (chain-operated by an integrated right-hand lever). In addition, it has a large, sturdy rack with a tool box and storage tube for a short frame pump. Weight: up to 26 kg (57 lb.) ...|$|E
5000|$|... m/30 - This bicycle {{was very}} similar to the later issued m/42, except the pump was frame-mounted, the tools were stored in a frame-mounted leather bag, the carrier was the same sans the tool box, and {{although}} equipped with a front drum <b>brake</b> <b>hub,</b> there was no provision to use it. On the civilian model, the front drum brake was actuated by a brake cable connected to a brake handle. It differed noticeably from the German m/30, a spoon brake-equipped, balloon-tired roadster, though often mistaken for it. The Swedish m/30 was built according to specs established by an agreement with several large Swedish manufacturers regarding the interchangeability of parts, with most being assembled by Nymans (Hermes). Wheel size was 26 × 1½ inch (584 mm) and was equipped with a rear coaster-brake hub. Weight: ca. 23.5 kg (52 lb.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{instruments}} {{developed in}} the evolution of steelpan were Tamboo-Bamboos, tunable sticks made of bamboo wood. These were hit onto the ground and with other sticks in order to produce sound. Tamboo-Bamboo bands included percussion of a (gin) bottle and spoon. By the mid-1930s, bits of metal percussion were being used in the tamboo bamboo bands, the first probably being either the automobile <b>brake</b> <b>hub</b> [...] "iron" [...] or the biscuit drum [...] "boom". The former replaced the gin bottle-and-spoon, and the latter the [...] "bass" [...] bamboo that was pounded on the ground. By the late 1930s their occasional all-steel bands were seen at carnival, and by 1940 it had become the preferred carnival accompaniment of young underprivileged men. The 55-gallon oil drum was used to make steelpans from around 1947. The Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra (TASPO), formed to attend the Festival of Britain in 1951, was the first steelband whose instruments were all made from oil drums. Members of TASPO included Ellie Mannette and Winston [...] "Spree" [...] Simon. Hugh Borde led the National Steel Band of Trinidad & Tobago at the Commonwealth Arts Festival in England, as well as the Esso Tripoli Steel Band, which played at the World's Fair in Montreal, Canada, and later toured with Liberace. They were featured on an album with him.|$|E

40|$|The 4 "t"h meeting aims to {{exchange}} {{the experience and}} knowledge of engineers during several presentations and discussions about new developments required for a reliable, time and cost reducing validation of the wheel/hub assembly. Tremendous development of the wheel performance, described by {{the ratio of the}} rated load (kg) versus the wheel weight (kg) had taken place during the last 5000 years. Starting from the ratio of 3 for wooden 2 -piece-disc-wheels in Mesopotamia it needed nearly 1000 years to increase the ratio to approx 5 at light-weight spoke wheels for fighting carriages, found in the grave of king Tutenchamon in Egypt. Modern light alloy wheels of commercial vehicles reach values up to 160 kg/kg. Additionally the comlex design of the modern systems for cars and commercial vehicles comprising wheel, <b>brake,</b> <b>hub,</b> bearing, spindle and hub carrier, including different materials and their treatment, fasteners, press-fits, require an appropriate testing procedure. The variable loading conditions, caused by operational wheel forces, brake and torque moments including heating, may result in changing tolerances and press-fits during operation and consequently in different damage mechanisms. This can be simulated in the Biaxial Wheel Test Machine, whereby corresponding load programs are necessary. An overview about all biaxial test machines in usage at the end of 1999 is shown in the introduction. The total number is 17 for cars, 7 for commercial vehicles and 1 for trains. The six presentations of this meeting were consequently concentrated on: (a) recommendations for a standardization of load programs of the German Wheel Committee, (b) the simulation of brake and torque events and (c) the possibility for a numerical stress analyses and fatigue life assessment.

50|$|Velorbis {{bicycles}} {{typically have}} weather-resistant drum <b>brakes</b> and <b>hub</b> gears, {{as well as}} powder-coated frames. This is {{so that they can}} be used throughout the year, including during Scandinavian winters.|$|R
2500|$|Coaster-brake {{bicycles}} {{are generally}} {{equipped with a}} single cog and chain wheel and often use ⅛ in (3.2mm) wide chain. [...] However, {{there have been several}} models of coaster <b>brake</b> <b>hubs</b> with dérailleurs, such as the Sachs 2x3. These use special extra-short dérailleurs which can stand up to the forces of being straightened out frequently and do not require an excessive amount of reverse pedal rotation before the brake engages. Coaster brakes have also been incorporated into hub gear designs - for example the AWC and SRC3 from Sturmey-Archer, and the Shimano Nexus 3-speed. They can have up to eight gears, like the Nexus inter-8.|$|R
50|$|Chains come in 3/32 in, 1/8 in, 5/32 in, or 3/16 in roller widths, the {{internal}} width between the inner plates. 1/8 in chains are typically used on bikes {{with a single}} rear sprocket: those with coaster <b>brakes,</b> <b>hub</b> gears, fixed gears such as track bicycles, or BMX bikes. Chains with 3/32 in wide rollers are generally used on bikes with derailleurs such as racing, touring, and mountain bikes. Fixed sprockets and freewheels are also available in 3/32 in widths so fixed-gear and single-speed bikes {{can be set up}} to use the narrower and lighter 3/32 in chains. Finally, chains with 5/32 in wide rollers are used on freight bicycles and tricycles.|$|R

25|$|In 1956, {{around a}} year after West Germany joined NATO, Messerschmitt was allowed to {{manufacture}} aircraft again and lost interest in Fend's microcars. Messerschmitt sold the Regensburg works to Fend who, with <b>brake</b> and <b>hub</b> supplier Valentin Knott, formed Fahrzeug- und Maschinenbau GmbH Regensburg (FMR) to continue production of the KR200 and his other vehicles.|$|R
50|$|While a chain tool is {{required}} to shorten simple chains on a bicycle, and as described above, can often be used to reconnect them, there are fast-release chain links that allow repeated making and breaking of a chain. They are connected by hand pressure but often need a pair of needle-nosed pliers for removal. These links invariably replace a pair of outside plates on a chain, so joining two sets of inside plates. Bicycles with a single front chainring and rear sprocket (for example bicycles with hub gears or coaster <b>brake</b> <b>hubs)</b> may have a master link on the chain which holds the pin in place with an easily removable c-clip. Some master links are bevelled on top, and can interfere with the smooth operation of a derailleur system. Some derailleur suppliers have produced a chain with a fast-release link, made with straight plates to suit their derailleur products.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1949 season, the 125 cc, or {{ultra light}} weight class, gained new prestige. More {{motorcycle}} manufacturers were {{competing in the}} inaugural world championships that were held in Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. The Mondial 125 cc DOHC design dominated the 1949 season. The MV riders placed ninth and tenth in the final standings. In 1950, Arturo Magni and Piero Remor joined the company after working with Gilera. Magni was the chief mechanic and Remor was chief designer. [...] The 1950 season and 1951 season were development years, as the company adopted the 125 Dohc four-stroke engine. Racing efforts only produced a fifth-place finish at the Dutch TT in 1950. The 1951 results were only slightly better.The 1952 season saw the introduction of telescopic forks, full width alloy <b>brake</b> <b>hubs</b> and a sleek fuel tank on the 125 race bike. Power was [...] @ 10800 rpm. Britain's Cecil Sandford piloted the new MV 125 to a 1952 Isle of Man TT victory {{and went on to}} win MV Agusta's first world championship.|$|R
5000|$|... "Shimano Nexus" [...] - Shimano's {{family of}} {{internally}} geared hubs. Available in 3-, 7- and 8-speed {{with or without}} a coaster <b>brake.</b> The Nexus <b>hubs</b> are comparable in range to a full 16-20 speed system.|$|R
50|$|Carva uses {{standard}} bicycle brakes like: rim brakes, {{in which}} friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; internal <b>hub</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{in which the}} friction pads are contained within the wheel hubs; or disc brakes, with a separate rotor for braking.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{began in}} an old flour store in Devon Street, New Plymouth. The aim was to make 120 {{machines}} a year, but demand was higher after a flurry of articles in magazines and newspapers about the bike. Some were sold to Borneo and the New Hebrides. [...] Problems soon arose with the government refusing to issue an import licence for the engines and <b>brake</b> <b>hubs.</b> While negotiations continued between Callender and the government, Callender sent {{a photo of the}} bike along with Hillary, Mulgrave, and himself to Suzuki in Japan. Suzuki turned the photo into a giant poster on their Tokyo Motor Show stand along with a replica of the bike. In 1966 the government issued the import licence to allow enough parts to build the 120 bikes per year. By that time Callender had decided to sell the business to Motor Components of Waitara. Motor Components planned to sell 1,000 bikes per year, but by then Suzuki had commenced production of its own specialised machine. They in turn were followed by the other major Japanese motor cycle manufacturers. Production at the Waitara plant stopped in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Columbia mopeds {{were the}} first mopeds ever {{assembled}} in the United States, even though the motor and some parts were outsourced.

50|$|The Panda has a 'grip-locking' {{clutch lever}} and a {{carburettor}} set-up {{that provides a}} very reliable and steady tick-over. The rear brake comprises a back pedal Perry Coaster hub and a conventional bicycle-type <b>hub</b> <b>brake,</b> handlebar lever operated for the front brake.|$|R
25|$|Either type could {{potentially}} fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface {{on either side}} of the brake disc between the wheel <b>hub</b> and <b>brake</b> disc <b>hub</b> before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic Rim <b>Brakes</b> use the <b>hub,</b> or preferably, a bolt {{on metal}} disc as the braking surface for {{hydraulically}} operated brake mechanisms that push polyurethane blocks against the braking surface. Advantages include good braking power, and good modulation. Disadvantages include possible damage to bearings.|$|R
