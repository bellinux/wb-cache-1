40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} two experiments into the fluctuating characteristics of windinduced pressures on buildings in a built-up environment. The experiments {{have been carried out}} independently in Iceland and The Netherlands and can be considered to represent two separate cases of <b>building</b> <b>geometries</b> (HffiB and HoB). The results from both experiments show similar trends. Spectra of wind-induced pressures are related to the upstream wind velocity spectrum by the wind induced pressure admittance and the mean pressure coefficient. The velocity–pressure admittance plots for the windward sides show a conventional behaviour. Empirical models for the along-wind velocity–pressure admittance at the windward side are proposed in accordance with well-established methodology. These models, which are modifications of models previously available in the literature, are validated by the current experiments. Although more experimental research is needed for further validation, the results suggest that a model representing a broad range of <b>building</b> <b>geometries</b> can be developed for along-wind velocity–pressure admittance at the windward facade...|$|R
40|$|Current wind {{codes and}} {{standards}} have load provisions dealing with low buildings of common configurations. Large buildings, say 100 m long, had not been considered when these provisions were established. As a result, the interaction between wind and <b>buildings</b> of such <b>geometries</b> should be investigated {{for the assessment of}} current wind provisions in terms of their applicability to such configurations. The present wind tunnel study examines nine large low-rise buildings 5, 7. 5 and 10 m high for several wind directions ranging from 0 ° to 90 ° at increments of 15 °. The buildings have square plans with full-scale horizontal dimensions ranging from 60 to 180 m. Results show that building plan sizes have significant effects on the generated wind loads on building roofs. Also, application of current provisions on <b>building</b> <b>geometries</b> of large roofs and low height may lead to considerably conservative and uneconomic design. An exception for very large low buildings, as far as the determination of the sizes of roof edge and corner zones is concerned, has been recommended to rectify the deficiency of wind code and standard provisions for these <b>building</b> <b>geometries...</b>|$|R
40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is {{becoming}} more and more important for building sustainability evaluation. However, in architectural practice LCA is not carried out in early design stages although the consideration of the environmental life cycle performance (LCP) is essential for creating sustainable buildings and early design stages offer the highest potential for optimization. The main focus in these design stages lies on the definition of the <b>building</b> <b>geometry.</b> However, conducting an LCA only based on <b>building</b> <b>geometry</b> is impossible due to missing information about materials and HVAC systems. Therefore, in this paper we propose a method for assessing the potential LCP (PLCP) that a <b>building</b> <b>geometry</b> offers. PLCP describes the probability of a specific <b>building</b> <b>geometry</b> to achieve a certain LCP in later design stages. This measure can serve to optimize designs according to life cycle aspects. The application of the method is exemplified for the evaluation of six geometric variants of a residential building.

40|$|Airflow network (AFN) model {{embedded}} in building energy simulation (BES) {{tools such as}} EnergyPlus is extensively used for prediction of cross-ventilation in buildings. The noticeable uncertainty in the measurement of the surface pressure, discharge coefficient, and simplifications applied to the orifice-based equation result in considerable discrepancies in the prediction of the cross-ventilation airflow rate values. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) provides more accurate results comparing to the orifice-based equations although with an excessive computational cost. The {{aim of this study}} is, therefore, to improve the accuracy of the orifice-based model by development of an adaptive correlation for the discharge coefficient using CFD. Hence, a validated CFD model for the cross-ventilation of an unsheltered building is firstly developed using an experimental study. In the next step, by exploiting Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) approaches, a large CFD dataset of 750 scenarios for different <b>building</b> <b>geometries</b> (i. e. square cube, cuboid and long corridor) is generated; the dataset is then coupled to the AFN crossventilation model to obtain an adaptive correlation for the discharge coefficient {{as a function of the}} openings’ geometries and location using response surface (RSM) and radial basis function (RBF) models. Results show that the newly developed adaptive correlation successfully increases the accuracy of AFN model for the cross-ventilation modeling of unsheltered buildings as the relative errors for the airflow rate prediction of different <b>building</b> <b>geometries</b> are significantly decreased up to 28...|$|R
