30|$|AR {{running on}} {{handheld}} devices {{can be used}} for displaying content in big environments. Handheld AR has gained attention in the field of educational technology because of its advantages when applied in ubiquitous learning (Dede 2011), situated cognition (Specht et al. 2011), and collaboration (Li et al. 2011). Billinghurst and Duenser (2012) explain that handheld AR technology is already mature for this application. AR software can already run on mobile phones equipped with fast processors, <b>big</b> <b>display</b> screens, data connections, built-in cameras, and other sensors. Billinghurst and Duenser (2012) call for more interdisciplinary research to ground AR applications in learning theories. For our experiments, we designed AR applications for learning Filipino and German words by applying the principles of multimedia learning theory (Mayer 2009) and its related research. Moreover, we considered some feedback from teachers and school administrators {{in order to make a}} practical AR application.|$|E

40|$|Consortium Doctoral de IHM 2016 High {{resolution}} wall-dispays {{are more}} and more used in research contexts in order to visualize, explore and study big dataset. They provide a huge visual space to display data, physical navigation rather virtual, which leads to a more natural pan and zoom, and finally an easy way to collaborate due to their large shared space. Their use in a more operational context like control rooms is more limited, they are most of the time considered as just a <b>big</b> <b>display</b> with which you interact with mice and keyboards. During this PhD, we would like to study how we could embrace the benefits of a wall-display in command and control contexts. To answer this question, we first analyzed the activities in a control room in general, and then focus in a specific use case: road traffic control. In this specific context, we are now working on an experiment to compare the use of a wall-display and several workstations. Then we focussed on collaboration, and study the use of a wall display to perform multi user exploration of graphs, a data structure commonly used in command and control centre. Finally, we studied the use of the capacity of a high resolution wall to help operators assess the impact of their action...|$|E
3000|$|Visual Analytics {{combines}} both visualization {{and data}} analysis [12 – 14]. In data visualization, {{a variety of}} techniques are commonly used by data scientists. A table is the simplest and the easiest data representation technique. The information is structured in rows and columns. Rows represent variables and columns represent records with a set of values [15]. The role of the table is the essential part of research and data analysis [10]. Next, pie charts, which is a circle divided into number of slices. Each of the slices describe a numerical proportion. Pie chart visualization could be difficult when comparing different sections of different pie charts. The next category is 2 D/ 3 D representations. This category includes various types of graphs and bar charts [16], histograms, and line charts. Bar charts represent a single data series, and related data points are grouped in one series [10]. Histograms, which are commonly used in statistics, represent an accurate distribution of numerical data. Line charts represent information in connected points or “markers” by straight line segments. Line charts are often used to visualize a trend in data over time intervals [10]. These techniques however, offer some limitation when complex data structures need to be visualized. Next, there is geometric transformation techniques which include the scatter plot and parallel coordinate plot. Scatter plot is a graphical display of a set of data using Cartesian coordinates to display the relationship between two variables for a set of data. Typically, one of the variables represents the horizontal axis, and the second variable represents the vertical axis of the data points. These plots are useful to determine trends in data and to identify outliers easily [10, 17]. The parallel coordinate plot helps the user to visualize multi-dimensional data [18]. Next, we have hierarchical image plots, which is a great method to visualize hierarchical structure data [19]. Finally, we have methods that focus on pixels, which is a visualization technique that focuses on the pixels [20]. The main purpose of this technique is display a single value per pixel. In our case, this is an excellent technique to visualize large data sets using the <b>big</b> <b>display</b> walls such as the Hiperwall (see [...] "Visual and data analytics with Hiperwall").|$|E
40|$|Silva Sweden AB has {{developed}} a new compass transducer module, {{that will be used}} for OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) business as well as in Silva´s own products. In order to market the module, the company has decided to develop a number of products around this module. The aim with the master thesis work is to develop two new products that are based around the new compass module that Silva Sweden AB {{has developed}}. As the two products differ from each other, the thesis work will be divided into two projects, referred to as Project 1 and Project 2. The aim with Project 1 is to incorporate the new compass module in a hand- held electronic navigation instrument. The development process will consist of designing the shell of the product, finding relevant features to incorporate in the product, and to design the user interface of the instrument: which includes button and display design. The aim with Project 2 is to develop a tactical compass made for use on dinghies. The development process will consist of designing the shell of the product, finding relevant features to incorporate in the product, and to design the user interface of the instrument: which includes button and display design. Also a mounting bracket for compass-attachment on the boat will be designed. Both of the projects are defined to be at a conceptual stage, whereby no drafting or preparation for manufacturing will be produced. To approach the projects in a systematic and structured way, a number of methods for product development have been used. Different methods have been used mixed together, but the general structure applied is taken from a method described by Ulrich and Epplinger in the book “Product design and development”. To gather data and get information about navigation and sailing two web surveys in the form of inquiries were conducted, one for each project. The inquiries together with, mind maps, product specifications and the question method served {{as the basis for the}} problem investigation and provided a good start for the concept development for both projects. To solve problems brainstorming sessions were held and different ideas was brought up. The ideas were continuously discussed and evaluated with Mr. Jan Silfvén, Product manager at Silva Nexus Marine. Criteria’s were formulated and weighted against each other. With the criteria’s ant the prior work ultimately final concepts were developed. The final concept for project 1 is a handheld device that is designed to be used in both outdoor and marine environments. To be as functional as possible in these environments, the compass is made very portable, but yet has a relatively <b>big</b> <b>display.</b> The main function of the product is to serve as an electronic compass made for both map-aligned navigation and sighting. In its standard version, the compass will also feature a built-in watch and stop-watch with included alarm function. The compass will also come as a hi- end version, which will have the following additional features: altimeter, thermometer/ barometer, time/date/alarm/stop-watch. The compass is also made so that it can be mounted vertically on e. g. a boat. To make the compass more compatible with a map, a rotatable bezel is placed on the top surface of the compass. The bezel has meridian lines printed on the top surface of it, which furthermore simplifies the map-alignment. On the top of the bezel, two sights that make up a gun-sight are also placed. A ruler used as a tool for map-alignment is integrated in the compass. The ruler is retractable, which means that it can slide in and out of the compass. The final concept for project 2 is a tactical compass with two separate displays that are united through a centre part. Both of the displays are hinged together to the centre part, which makes the angle between the displays adjustable. The adjustable angle between the displays makes the compass more versatile as it permits the compass to be viewed from a wider range of different angles, and more portable as the displays are foldable behind the centre part. To ensure that the compass is water tight it is wrapped up in a rubber bellow that is glued onto the surfaces of the compass. This also gives the compass a more united feeling, as it looks more like one part instead of three parts hinged together. To be able to mount the compass onto the mast, and to ensure that the displays can be adjusted to the same angle every time the compass is used, a mounting bracket was developed. The bracket is strapped onto the mast with a Velcro- strap. Once the bracket is strapped to the mast, the mounting, and demounting of the compass is done easily. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

In order to test and evaluate such device capabilities, prototypes must be built. However physical prototypes elaboration remains a complex, time consuming and expensive process due to the multiple new technologies involved. This thesis addresses this issue by allowing the creation of virtual rather that physical prototypes. It is achieved by developing UIFolder, a software tool allowing {{the definition of the}} prototype physical structure, folding capabilities and user interactions techniques. An extension of the Yoshizawa-Randlett origami notation system is proposed to graphically represents the prototype characteristics.
