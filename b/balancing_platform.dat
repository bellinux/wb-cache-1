While postural sway is often used {{as a measure of}} balance ability and to evaluate the efficacy of such programs to improve postural balance, there is little research regarding the measurement of sway while standing on foam pads. Balance training has become common in therapeutic exercise routines for rehabilitation, injury prevention, and fall prevention. Unstable surfaces such as foam pads are commonly used in these purportedly to improve balance. While postural sway is often used as a measure of balance ability and to evaluate the efficacy of such programs to improve postural balance, there is little research regarding the measurement of sway while standing on foam pads. PURPOSE: To compare measures of postural sway from a clinical <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> against a mobile application. METHODS: Two devices were used to obtain the postural dynamics of static balance for each subject: 1) a <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> (Biodex <b>Balance</b> System SD) and 2) a mobile application (SWAY Balance) that utilizes the built-in tri-axial accelerometer within an iPhone or iPod Touch to measure balance. The mobile device is held against the chest so data collection on both devices can be collected simultaneously. 57 participants (28 male; 29 female) aged 24. 3 ± 6. 8 yr completed the study in which they stood bilaterally and then unilaterally on a firm surface and then on foam pads using both devices to evaluate postural sway. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences between}} the two devices as measured on the firm surface. However, there was a difference (p< 0. 05) when standing on foam (<b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> = 3. 775; mobile application = 5. 659) between the two devices. Unilateral stance on foam (9. 887) was higher (p< 0. 05) than unilateral stance on the solid surface (4. 862) with only the mobile application. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, the mobile application is a valid and useful clinical tool for the evaluation of balance as results did not differ with the <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> when measuring <b>balance</b> on the stable surface. However, given that postural sway did not differ between unilateral stance on firm versus foam surfaces with the <b>balance</b> <b>platform,</b> it appears that the <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> strain gauges do not effectively measure sway while standing on foam. Therefore, this mobile application may be a better tool for quantification of sway while standing on foam...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Various {{disciplines}} {{have benefited}} from the advent of high-performance computing in achieving practical solutions to their problems, and the area of health care is no exception to this. Non-linear signal-processing tools have been developed to understand the hidden complexity of the time series, and these will help clinicians in diagnosis and treatment. Postural study helps the elderly and people with a balancing problem due to various pathological conditions. In elderly subjects, falls are common and may result in injury. Correct postural balance is basic to well-being and it influences our daily life significantly. These postural signals are non-stationary; they may appear to be random in the time scale {{and it is difficult to}} observe the subtle changes for the human observer. Hence, more hidden information can be obtained from the signal using non-linear parameters. In this paper, ten young normal subjects are subjected to the <b>balancing</b> <b>platform</b> whose acceleration is gradually increased from 1 m/s 2 to 5 m/s 2 to study the postural response. The ankle front–back acceleration and ankle pitch angular velocity sensor data were studied using the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). The results show that for higher acceleration of the platform the ankle movement follows a particular rhythm, resulting in a lower Lyapunov exponent. During lower acceleration of the <b>balancing</b> <b>platform,</b> this value is higher because of the random movement of the ankle. In this work, the pattern of the body response was studied using LLE values for different accelerations using ankle data as the base signal for the normal subjects...|$|E

We introduce a functional-to-functional autoregressive model {{that is used to}} forecast future demand/offer functions, and estimate the model via the minimization of a penalized mean squared error of prediction, with a penalty term based on the Hilbert–Schmidt squared norm of autoregressive lagged operators.

40|$|Mobile robotic {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} prevalent in several fields of academia, industry, and everyday life. This dissertation outlines {{the development of}} several means of locomotion for such systems and the tools created and used to design them. Novel mechanical designs with minimal actuators are combined with advanced control systems to create dynamic locomotion behavior. A single, unified Lagrangian dynamics architecture is used to represent a variety of robotic systems, derived from first principles and applied programmatically. Model-based control methods are heavily used {{to take advantage of}} the known dynamics and are also applied programmatically for the automatic generation of control laws and gain scheduling lookup tables. Improvements to encoder velocity estimation across a wide velocity range are described in detail. A number of key hardware advances in different fields are exploited to create low-cost, but capable, mobile robotic systems: additive manufacturing (3 D printing), powerful embedded microprocessors (Arduino, ARM, FPGA), solid state sensors (MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes), and inexpensive brushed DC motors. This dissertation presents both notable results and tactical details of implementation that will be useful to those designing similar systems. Several novel robotic systems are presented in this dissertation. First, two incarnations of a mobile <b>balancing</b> <b>platform</b> with two coaxial wheels with the center of mass above the center of rotation are presented. Active feedback control is required to stabilize the system. Next, Switchblade is a patent pending treaded inverted pendulum designed for maximum mobility over a wide range of terrain including tight spaces and significant obstacles (e. g. stairs). Multiple variants of the design are explored, which shows that the vehicle concept is broadly applicable across different length scales and use cases. SkySweeper is an under-actuated robotic system designed for multimodal locomotion along wires and cables.

The cerebellum serves as an integrative structure for balance control and is also involved in cognition, including timing and anticipatory regulation. Cerebellar development may be delayed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and inconsistent reaction time is commonly seen in ADHD. We hypothesized that dynamic balance deficits would be present in children with ADHD and they would correlate with attention and cerebellar functions. Methods: Sixty-two children with ADHD and no other neurological conditions and 62 typically developing (TD) children were examined with five trials of the Phyaction Balance Board, an electronic <b>balancing</b> <b>platform.</b> Cerebellar clinical symptoms were evaluated using an international ataxia rating scale. Conners’ Continuous Performance Test was used to evaluate patterns of reaction. Results: Children with ADHD had poorer performance on balancing tasks, compared to TD children (P< 0. 001). They exhibited significantly greater sway amplitudes than TD children (P< 0. 001) in all of the five balancing trials. The effect size of the difference between the groups increased continuously from the first to the last trial. Balance score in both groups was related to the variation in the reaction time, including reaction time standard error (r = 0. 25; P= 0. 0409, respectively, r = 0. 31; P= 0. 0131) and Variability of Standard Error (r = 0. 28; P= 0. 0252, respectively, r = 0. 41; P< 0. 001). The burden of cerebellar symptoms was strongly related to balance performance in both groups (r = 0. 50, P< 0. 001; r = 0. 49, P= 0. 001). Conclusion: This study showed that ADHD may be associated with poor dynamic balance control. Furthermore, we showed that maintaining balance correlates with neuropsychological measures of consistency of reaction time. Balance deficits and impaired cognitive functioning could reflect a common cerebellar dysfunction in ADHD children.

However, it is also a challenging technology, which is not always easy to implement and maintain. This article sheds light on SPL practices in today's software industry. Members from five different organizations have formed a workgroup that over a period of two years and a half have investigated and compared their SPL practices. The companies are as different as a global IT vendor (Hewlett-Packard), a leading supplier of automotive electronics (Robert Bosch GmbH), a large supplier of industrial energy solutions (represented by RWTH), a small company that develops software for the on-line management of stock market information (Market Maker Software AG, this knowledge was provided by Fraunhofer IESE, a longstanding cooperation partner of the company) and a renowned software house (sd&m AG). Moreover, most workgroup members have contributed experience from more than one product family or business department allowing a rather broad overview of the state of software product line development in industrial practice. In the remainder of the article, company references are omitted to preserve anonymity of sensitive information.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate static postural control after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction combined with medial meniscus (MM) suture, comparatively to healthy controls. HypothesisBody balance is adversely affected 2 months after ACL reconstruction combined with MM suture. Patients and methodsFifteen patients (12 males and 3 females) aged 20 to 35 years (mean, 26. 4 ± 6. 0 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction with MM suture were compared to 20 healthy, physically active controls (16 females and 4 males) aged 19 to 23 years (mean, 21. 1 ± 1. 8 years), most of whom were physiotherapy students. Mean age was not significantly different between the patients and controls. A <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> was used to estimate static postural control parameters. Each participant performed four tests, two in normal bipedal stance and two in tandem stance; in each stance, one test was done with the eyes open and the other with the eyes closed. We analysed global scores on a standardised 100 -point scale and mean centre of pressure (COP) displacement velocity in the sagittal and frontal planes. ResultsBody balance was impaired 2 months after ACL reconstruction with MM suture. Thus, the patients had lower global scores and higher mean COP velocities in both the coronal and sagittal planes. ConclusionsProprioception is impaired after ACL reconstruction with MM suture. Lack of visual control significantly decreases the ability to maintain <b>balance.</b> A <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> is a useful diagnostic tool for patients with ACL reconstruction and MM suture.

The latest smartphones have built-in motion sensors called tri-axial accelerometers, which are an ideal choice for evaluating variability {{of movement and}} balance providing a non-invasive, portable method of measurement. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the balance assessment measures from a mobile device application (iPod) utilizing accelerometric motion sensors against the balance assessment measures of a clinically valid and reliable <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> (BIODEX <b>Balance</b> System SD). METHODS: 75 healthy college-aged individuals (37 male, 38 female; average age = 24. 2 ± 6. 8 yr) performed a series of balance tasks over two visits (Study 1 and Study 2). During Study 1, 8 balance tests were assessed, beginning with two feet on ground (baseline) and progressively becoming more difficult and repeating them over three trials. iPod Touches with a software application to measure balance was used to assess sway. During Study 2, participants completed 4 balance assessments using a clinically validated <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> and the iPod Touches, at the same time. RESULTS: Data showed that the iPod Touches were consistent with expect outcomes, based off of normative data; the more unstable the assessment the higher the balance score compared to baseline or standing with feet together eyes open without foam. Analyses of the 3 trials suggest that a familiarization test should be performed when using the iPod Touch balance application and this is consistent with other devices. Results from Study 2 showed no significant difference between the two devices when measuring without foam, but a significant difference was found between the two while balancing on foam. CONCLUSION: Balance scores measured by accelerometers within an iPod appear to be a valid and consistent method of measuring human balance...|$|R
40|$|AIAA Paper No. 2003 - 6549, San Diego, California, Sept. 2003. Live {{demonstration}} of the MAV in a nearby parkIn this paper the development and flight testing of flapping-wing propelled, radio-controlled micro air vehicles are described. The vehicles consist of a fixed-wing {{and a pair of}} flapping wings immediately downstream of the fixed-wing which flap in counterphase to provide a mechanically and aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>platform</b> and increased efficiency. The models weigh as little as 13 grams, with a 27 cm span and 18 cm length and will fly for about 20 minutes on a 135 mAh Li-Poly battery. Stable flight at speeds between 2 and 5 m/s has been demonstrated, and the models are essentially stall-proof while under power due to the flow-entrainment effect of the flapping-wing pair...|$|R

40|$|AIAA Paper No. 2003 - 0418, Reno, Nevada, Jan. 2003. In {{this paper}} the {{development}} and flight testing of a radio-controlled micro air vehicle propelled by flapping wings is described. The vehicle consists of a 30 cm-span, 14. 5 cm-chord fixed-wing, with two flapping wings immediately downstream of the fixed-wing. The flapping wings, with a 25 cm-span and 4 cm-chord, are arranged in a biplane configuration and flap in counterphase, providing a mechanically and aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>platform.</b> Flight tests {{have shown that the}} configuration is particularly well suited for low speed flight, due to the inherent resistance to flow separation facilitated by flow entrainment from the flapping wing pair. The 14 gram model has demonstrated stable flight at speeds between 2 and 5 m/s, and the model exhibits a very rapid stall recovery under power, due to the flow entrainment effect...|$|R

In the research participated 30 healthy subjects and 15 subjects with stroke. At the same time two experimental measurements were performed – postural balance was measured using <b>balance</b> <b>platform</b> and oscillations of the centre of mass were observed using two-axial accelerometer. It was noted, that amplitudes of subjects with stroke were larger almost two times than control group’s of healthy subjects. It was find out, that ratios of pressure distribution on both left and right legs are in range from 1 to 0. 9 for healthy subjects, and ratios below 0. 9 are common for subjects with stroke. When subjects were standing with eyes closed, sway amplitudes were higher and the ratios of load distribution on left and right legs were lower. Article in Lithuanian</p...|$|R

The challenge this week, moderated by Michelle Aguilar, involves contestants <b>balancing</b> on a <b>platform</b> above a swimming pool, with each platform supported by 40 ropes. The ropes are cut one by one, with the last person still <b>balancing</b> on their <b>platform</b> the winner. The prize is a one-pound advantage at weigh-in. Nicole, who has immunity, will instead win a one-pound penalty for the person of her choice. Sione, inspired by Bob, wins.|$|R
