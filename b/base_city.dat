2500|$|On 1 January 1912 Sun Yat-sen {{became the}} first President of the Republic of China in Nanjing. Yuan Shikai, {{operating}} out of Beijing, sent other northern military commanders a series of telegrams, advising them to oppose Sun's administration.

50|$|The {{expansion}} adds {{several new}} dimensions to aquatic gameplay. Unlike land <b>based</b> <b>cities,</b> or even ocean cities in previous iterations of the game, aquatic <b>based</b> <b>cities</b> can move. Movement, rather than culture, {{is the way}} aquatic cities expand their borders. Aquatic cities produce less unhealth, produce more energy and culture, and can create naval units much faster than land <b>based</b> <b>cities.</b> However, they are much harder to defend, and are less efficient at producing land and air units as land <b>based</b> <b>cities</b> would. On top of these differences several wonders and buildings are exclusive to either land or aquatic cities. Workers in RT can build farms on aquatic tiles, and they have an expanded number of aquatic tile types they can improve. When viewing at ocean tiles, water is transparent rather than blue allowing players to see the ocean floor. This graphical enhancement allows for players to see resources under the ocean.|$|R
