5|$|The {{seat was}} made more {{competitive}} in the 1997 boundary review by {{the formation of the}} North West Cambridgeshire seat, which incorporated the rural land outside Peterborough and several Conservative-inclined wards from the city. Since its formation, North West Cambridgeshire {{has been one of the}} safest Conservative seats in the country, whilst Peterborough was ranked 93rd in the Conservatives's one hundred most vulnerable seats (the ones which the other parties must take if there is to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> of government) and 73rd on Labour's target list; these factors led Mawhinney to stand in North West Cambridgeshire instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, during {{a night out}} with Dr. Whale (David Anders), Mary Margaret (Goodwin) tries {{to make a little}} {{conversation}} with him; however, he is busy ogling Ruby (Meghan Ory), prompting Mary Margaret to leave the cafe by herself. As she walks back to her apartment, she notices Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) in her car reading a newspaper and searching for a place to stay. Mary Margaret offers Emma a spare room at her apartment. The following day, Mary Margaret notices Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) looking at the comatose John Doe (Dallas) while they are setting up decorations at the hospital. Henry believes that John Doe is Prince Charming and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Henry asks her to read to Charming from the storybook, convinced that it will wake him up. Emma persuades Mary Margaret to go along with Henry's wishes so that they can prove the stories aren't real. At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the stories to the patient, until his hand grabs hers, shocking Mary Margaret. She tells Dr. Whale that Charming might be waking up, but the doctor does not believe her. After she leaves, Dr. Whale calls Regina (Parrilla), as he had been instructed to do should there <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in John Doe's state, revealing that he had been lying to Mary Margaret.|$|E

This revealed problems plaguing the aging mainland Chinese healthcare system, including increasing decentralization, red tape, and inadequate communication.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} balance method for an oil field uses an equation that relates {{the volume of}} oil, water and gas that has been produced from a reservoir and the change in reservoir pressure to calculate the remaining oil. It assumes that, as fluids from the reservoir are produced, there will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the reservoir pressure {{that depends on the}} remaining volume of oil and gas. The method requires extensive pressure-volume-temperature analysis and an accurate pressure history of the field. It requires some production to occur (typically 5% to 10% of ultimate recovery), unless reliable pressure history can be used from a field with similar rock and fluid characteristics.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{personal}} best (PB) scores, i.e. the highest scores a skater or couple has achieved over their entire career, {{in terms of}} combined total and segment scores. However, PB scores are not completely comparable if achieved in different seasons because the ISU modifies requirements and rules between seasons. In different seasons, there may be different requirements to achieve a certain level or different elements may be required. New elements may become allowed (for example, two quads in the short program were permitted starting in the 2010–11 season). There may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in point values. For example, the values of quads were increased after the 2010 Olympics and a second step sequence in men is no longer assigned a level. As a result, the ISU now places more weight on SB.|$|E
25|$|Initially, in May 2001, it {{was noted}} that since the opera house was a Heritage building, it could not be redeveloped but only restored. Even for restoration, funds needed to be found. With these two basic aspects in view, the {{planning}} dictum followed was that: The historicity of the building and its architecture will be lost if it is not used as a theatre and there should not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> of user. The initial plan proposed was to convert a part of the open plot to be developed commercially to generate funds, which could self sustain the expenditure involved in the restoration and maintenance of the existing heritage building. To proceed further with this plan, it was also considered essential to negotiate with the existing owner Maharaja Vikramsinghji Bhojraji of Gondal to get his consent to the incentive plan.|$|E

2500|$|In thalassemia, an additional, {{contiguous}} length or a discontinuous {{fragment of}} non-coding instructions {{are included in}} the mRNA. This happens because the mutation obliterates the boundary between the intronic and exonic portions. Because all the coding sections may still be present, normal hemoglobin may be produced and the added material, if it produces pathology, instead disrupts regulatory functions enough to produce anemia.Hemoblogin's normal alpha and beta subunits each have an iron-containing central portion (heme) that allows the protein chain of a subunit to fold around it. Normal adult hemoglobin contains 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits. Thalassemias typically affect only the mRNAs for production of the beta chains (hence the name).
