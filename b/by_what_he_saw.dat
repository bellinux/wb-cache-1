5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Shankar {{conceived}} {{the film in}} mid-2003 during the post-production period of his previous film, Boys. He based the film on his own life experiences during his formative years when he was disturbed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> around him, and his eventual displeasure with society. Pre-production for Anniyan began in November 2003 and principal photography in March 2004. The making of the film, which included numerous production delays, took 14 months. The film was shot at Hyderabad, Thanjavur, Villupuram and Chennai, and the song sequences were filmed in Amsterdam, Mumbai, Malaysia and Tenkasi. The film was notable for its recreation of the Tyagaraja Aradhana music festival and the extensive use of time slice photography in an action sequence.|$|E
5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff {{of the first two}} courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation. On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E

5|$|For his {{services}} in Siberia, Eichelberger {{was awarded the}} Army Distinguished Service Medal, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1919. Graves prevented him from receiving the British Distinguished Service Order and the French Legion of Honor, as had {{other members of the}} Inter-Allied Military Council. Eichelberger did, however, receive the Japanese Imperial Order of Meiji, Order of the Sacred Treasure and Order of the Rising Sun. Siberia gave Eichelberger a chance to observe the Japanese Army at first hand, and he was impressed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> of their training and discipline. He concluded that, if properly led, they would be more than a match for American troops. The American Expeditionary Force Siberia was withdrawn in April 1920.|$|E
5|$|Moving to Northern California, McNallen began {{a career}} as a school teacher; during the summer {{vacations}} he travelled the world as a military journalist, writing articles for Soldier of Fortune magazine. Concerned <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the growth of liberal, universalist ideas in Heathenry, he returned to active involvement in the Heathen movement in the mid-1990s, establishing the Asatrú Folk Assembly, which was headquartered in Grass Valley, California. In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite. He brought greater attention to his group after they became involved in the debate surrounding the Kennewick Man, arguing that it constituted evidence for a European presence in prehistoric America. In the 21st century he became more politically active, becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and a group promoting the rights of European Americans.|$|E
5|$|George {{was deeply}} devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was {{not shared by}} his brothers. George was appalled <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer, and the {{following}} year Cumberland married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession. George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying {{without the consent of}} the Sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.|$|E

5000|$|Buchanan's own program, however, {{differed}} from these generally empiricist, positivist, or pragmatist movements <b>by</b> stressing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{as the need}} for reforms in the mathematical symbolism employed in modern science. Buchanan's first book, published in 1927, stated that science is [...] "the greatest body of uncriticized dogma we have today" [...] and even likened science to the [...] "Black Arts". For the rest of his career, Buchanan pondered ways to mitigate the variety of threats to humanity that he perceived in the unmanaged and unsupervised growth of modern science and technology.|$|R
5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He {{may also have been}} encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Loxton's {{record was}} less spectacular despite playing {{in all but}} one of Victoria’s matches. He hit 77 and 35 not out in the opening match of the summer against the Indian tourists, and was rewarded with selection in an Australian XI to play the visitors ahead of the Tests. In what was effectively a Test trial, the uncapped all-rounder failed to impress with the bat, making a duck and six. He bowled extensively, sending down 47 overs and taking a total of 4/113 as the Australians fell to a defeat. Loxton was passed over for Test selection and returned to domestic competition, scoring 53 and taking a total of 4/56 in the next match against New South Wales, which the Victorians won by nine wickets. He then went into an unproductive sequence, failing to pass 31 and taking only three wickets in his next four matches over a two-month period. His seven wickets in the Sheffield Shield games cost almost 49 runs each. Despite this, the Australian captain Don Bradman had been impressed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> of Loxton at domestic level, and the Victorian all-rounder was chosen for the Fifth and final Test against India. With the series already convincingly won 3–0, Australia decided to rest several players in order to trial up and coming cricketers ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Len Johnson, Loxton and fellow Victorian Ring were thus given their Test debuts.|$|E
50|$|Ephraim the Syrian wrote polemics against Jews in the 4th century, {{including}} the repeated accusation that Satan dwells among {{them as a}} partner. The writings were directed at Christians who were being proselytized by Jews. Ephraim feared that they were slipping back into Judaism; thus, he portrayed the Jews as enemies of Christianity, like Satan, to emphasize {{the contrast between the}} two religions, namely, that Christianity was Godly and true and Judaism was Satanic and false. Like John Chrysostom, his objective was to dissuade Christians from reverting to Judaism <b>by</b> emphasizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the wickedness of the Jews and their religion.|$|R
50|$|Martin's primary {{approach}} to assessing cults was {{to focus on}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as doctrinal issues, particularly those concerning the person, nature and work of Jesus Christ.

What came to mind was {{the concept of a}} famous detective and his assistant, in the manner of Sherlock Holmes. From this idea, he created Professor Layton and his young apprentice, Luke Triton. The English setting of the games was also inspired by these mystery stories. Professor Layton was also derived in part from Phoenix Wright. Hino examined <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed to be Wright's good and bad points, and designed Layton <b>by</b> overcoming <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as Wright's bad points.|$|R
25|$|These intrigues were a {{preamble}} to the Guard's Legionary Rebellion, of January 1941. The attempted coup {{was crushed}} by the Conducător, who acted with authorization from Adolf Hitler. The triumphant Antonescu ordered Lecca to contact Manfred Freiherr von Killinger, the new German Ambassador, and inform him about Geißler's dissent. Lecca accomplished his task, but did so with noted reluctance. Killinger was pleasantly impressed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as Lecca's cooperative stance. The two became friends, and Killinger even helped advance Lecca's career.|$|E
25|$|The {{essay was}} very {{carefully}} worded: Hynek never stated that UFOs were an extraordinary phenomenon, {{but it is}} clear that, whatever his own views, Hynek was increasingly distressed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the superficial manner in which most scientists looked at UFOs. In 1953, Hynek was an associate member of the Robertson Panel, which concluded that there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and that a public relations campaign should be undertaken to debunk the subject and reduce public interest. Hynek would later lament that the Robertson Panel had helped make UFOs a disreputable field of study.|$|E
25|$|The Bolsheviks {{started a}} new workers-oriented {{newspaper}} in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912, and also called it Pravda. Trotsky was so upset <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913 {{he wrote a letter}} to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the letter was intercepted by the Russian police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.|$|E
5000|$|In Men, Morals and Society (1973 ?), Flugel charted a {{movement}} from egocentrism to social awareness <b>by</b> way of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as {{a hierarchy of}} expanding loyalties.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Adodo {{undertook}} his fist study on how people survive {{based on what}} they have: indigenous knowledge. Traveling around Nigeria at the time, <b>he</b> was amazed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> observed. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> native traditional healers and how they struggled but also how they healed and cured people. Adodo said, he felt called to preserved their knowledge. They were not documenting their knowledge and what they know was too valuable to lose. He made a commitment to start documenting herbal remedies. Adodo said he explained to the traditional healers he encountered that this was the only way their knowledge would survive. The time had come to move indigenous knowledge from implicit knowledge, passed {{from one generation to the}} next orally, to explicit knowledge that was documented and shared more widely. That in doing so, more people could build on it. Indigenous medicinal knowledge has a unique place in healing and well-being.|$|R

Mozilo agreed to pay $67.5 million in fines, and accepted a lifetime ban from serving as an officer or director of any public company. It is the largest settlement by an individual or executive connected to the 2008 housing collapse.

25|$|Viguié's {{interest}} in the motion picture industry came about in 1901, after viewing the first silent film, an Eduardo Hervet presentation, exhibited in Teatro La Perla in Ponce. During a trip to Paris, France, he witnessed Auguste and Louis Lumière's first public motion picture exhibition at the Caf-Les Capucinos. Upon his return to Puerto Rico he found {{a job as a}} movie projectionist at the Teatro Habana in his hometown. Viguié was inspired <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> and decided {{that he would like to}} make movies himself.

25|$|The {{following}} month, Charles Phillips of Cambridge University heard rumours {{of a ship}} discovery. He {{was taken}} to Sutton Hoo by Mr Maynard, the Ipswich Museum curator, and was staggered <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> Within a short time, following discussions with the Ipswich Museum, the British Museum, the Science Museum, and Office of Works, Phillips had taken over responsibility for the excavation of the burial chamber. Initially, Phillips and the British Museum instructed Brown to cease excavating until they could get their team assembled, but he continued working, something which may have saved the site from being looted by treasure hunters. Phillips' team included W.F. Grimes and O.G.S. Crawford of the Ordnance Survey, Peggy and Stuart Piggott, and other friends and colleagues.|$|E

The people at the station were so impressed with her that they hired her on the spot. She attended the Central High School of Santurce where she actively participated in her school plays. On one occasion when she was 14 years old, Juan Ramón Jiménez, the Spanish Nobel Prize winner, was present for one of her presentations.

He wrote [...] "Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by Microscope" [...] in 1646, stating [...] "who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms." [...] He also noted that putrid material is full of innumerable creeping animalcules. He published his Scrutinium Pestis (Examination of the Plague) in 1658, stating correctly that the disease was caused <b>by</b> microbes, though <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> was most likely red or white blood cells rather than the plague agent itself.|$|R

Production of the film was ordered by the Psychological Warfare Division (PWD) which was {{a unit of the}} Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). The PWD was responsible for the political activities in Germany of the British Ministry of Information and its U.S. counterpart, the Office of War Information.

25|$|For a {{long time}} Sundar Singh had wanted to visit Britain, and the {{opportunity}} came when his father, Sher Singh, who was converted too gave him the money for his fare to Britain. He visited the West twice, travelling to Britain, the United States and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. He was welcomed by Christians of many traditions, and his words searched the hearts of people who now faced the aftermath of World War I and who seemed to evidence a shallow attitude to life. Singh was appalled <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the materialism, emptiness and irreligion he found everywhere, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God, no matter how limited that might be.

25|$|After the insurrection of 10 August, Roland was {{reinstated}} as Interior Minister, but {{was dismayed}} <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as {{the lack of}} progress made by the Revolution. As a provincial, he opposed the Montagnards who aimed at supremacy not only in Paris but in the government as well. His hostility to the Paris Commune prompted him to propose transferring the government to Blois; and his attacks on Robespierre and his associates made him very unpopular. After failing to seal the armoire de fer (iron chest) found in the Tuileries Palace, containing documents that indicated Louis XVI's relations with corrupt politicians, {{he was accused of}} destroying some of the evidence within. Finally, during the trial of the king, he and the Girondists demanded that the sentence should be decided by a poll of the French people rather than the National Convention. Two days after the king's execution, he resigned his office.|$|E

Determined to rebuild the Guild, Ezio convinces Machiavelli that he has what it takes to lead while assembling a Brotherhood powerful enough to destroy the Templars and his new nemesis, Cesare.|$|E
60|$|As Mark sat there, on {{that rock}} of {{concrete}} ashes, he speculated on the probable {{extent of the}} shoals and reefs by which he was surrounded. Judging <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> then <b>saw,</b> and recalling the particulars of the examination made from the cross-trees of the ship, he supposed that the dangers and difficulties of the navigation must extend, in an east and west direction, at least twelve marine leagues; while, in a north and south, the distance {{seemed to be a}} little, and a very little less. There was necessarily a good deal of conjecture in this estimate of the extent of the volcanic mountain which composed these extensive shoals; but, from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> from the distance the ship was known to have run amid the dangers before she brought up, her present anchorage, the position of the island, and all the other materials before him to make his calculation on, Mark believed himself rather to have lessened than to have exaggerated the extent of these shoals. Had the throes of the earth, which produced this submerged rock, been a little more powerful, a beautiful and fertile island, of very respectable dimensions, would probably have been formed in its place.|$|R

50|$|As {{described}} in Secret Knowledge, in January 1999 {{during a visit}} to the National Gallery, London, Hockney conceived of the idea that optical aids were the key factor in the development of artistic realism. He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and became convinced that Ingres had used a camera lucida or similar device. From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of optical aids in earlier paintings, creating <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called the Great Wall in his studio by organizing images of great realistic art <b>by</b> time period. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney-Falco thesis.|$|R
