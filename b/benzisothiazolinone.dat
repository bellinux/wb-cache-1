40|$|Bacteria {{from the}} Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are {{encountered}} as industrial contaminants, and {{little is known}} about the species involved or their mechanisms of preservative resistance. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that multiple Bcc species may cause contamination, with B. lata (n = 17) and B. cenocepacia (n = 11) dominant within the collection examined. At the strain level, 11 of the 31 industrial sequence types identified had also been recovered from either natural environments or clinical infections. Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) preservative concentrations varied across 83 selected Bcc strains, with industrial strains demonstrating increased tolerance for dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin (DMDMH). <b>Benzisothiazolinone</b> (BIT), DMDMH, methylisothiazolinone (MIT), a blend of 3 : 1 methylisothiazolinone-chloromethylisothiazolinone (M-CMIT), methyl paraben (MP), and phenoxyethanol (PH), were all effective anti-Bcc preservatives; benzethonium chloride (BC) and sodium benzoate (SB) were least effective. Since B. lata was the dominant industrial Bcc species, the type strain, 383 T (LMG 22485 T), was used to study preservative tolerance. Strain 383 developed stable preservative tolerance for M-CMIT, MIT, BIT, and BC, which resulted in preservative cross-resistance and altered antibiotic susceptibility, motility, and biofilm formation. Transcriptomic analysis of the B. lata 383 M-CMIT-adapted strain demonstrated that efflux played a key role in its M-CMIT tolerance and elevated fluoroquinolone resistance. The role of efflux was corroborated using the inhibitor l-Phe-Arg-β-napthylamide, which reduced the MICs of M-CMIT and ciprofloxacin. In summary, intrinsic preservative tolerance and stable adaptive changes, such as enhanced efflux, play a role in the ability of Bcc bacteria to cause industrial contamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{emergence of}} resistance to commonly used therapies has placed a huge strain on the prevention and control of malaria; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antimalarial agents. The aim {{of this research was}} to design and synthesise a library of potent antimalarial compounds, with desirable pharmacokinetic profiles, in order to identify a drug candidate suitable for preclinical development. This research was divided into two main sections: x The synthesis of compounds deigned to inhibit IspD, a novel target in antimalarial drug discovery x The late stage development of a series of endoperoxide-based antimalarials, which are derived from the structure of artemisinin A library of <b>benzisothiazolinone</b> compounds was generated to target the IspD enzyme. Many of these compounds displayed low micromolar inhibitory activity against both enzymatic and phenotypic assays in vitro and an investigation into structure-activity relationships around the core of these benzisothiazolinones was also conducted. The most potent compound to emerge, a CH 2 linked benzisoselenazolone, had an IC 50 of 0. 17 μM against PfIspD and 5. 54 μM against Pf 3 D 7. These compounds represent a novel class of IspD inhibitor, which have the potential for further development as antimalarial agents. A number of 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetraoxane analogues were also prepared in order to develop an antimalarial agent suitable for a single-dose cure. The most potent analogue, N 205, had an IC 50 of 1. 3 nM and an average mouse survival of 26. 3 days (66 % cure rate) following a single dose. A less than optimal stability profile for N 205 led to the further development of another potent tetraoxane analogue, E 209. Optimisation of the synthetic pathway led to the generation of E 209 in a series of five high-yielding steps that are suitable for large-scale production. E 209 represents the first 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetraoxane that is comparable, in terms of both efficacy and PK/PD profiles, to OZ 439, and is a candidate for pre-clinical development...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{cannabis}} {{has been}} known for ages but breakthroughs in the knowledge of its components and the complex architecture of what is named nowadays endocannabinoid system have just been made in the last decades. Its main actors, anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol are endogenous lipids known as endocannabinoids that are produced to modulate a series of pathways in the central nervous system {{as well as in the}} periphery. However, their action at specific receptors named cannabinoid receptors, are rapidly disrupted since they are respectively hydrolyzed by two major enzymes, the fatty acid amide hydrolase and the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). In order to extend the duration of the pharmacological effects of 2 -arachidonoylglycerol, we designed new tools to prevent the hydrolytic action of MAGL. In these lines, we describe three different strategies to achieve our goal: in a first time, starting from the pharmacomodulations of 2 -oleoylglycerol, we developed a series of substrate analogues with micromolar activity on MAGL. The second part of the project was the pharmacomodulation of the N-phenylmaleimide scaffold. While few maleimides had been previously shown to inhibit MAGL, we developed a series of compounds and explored the structure-activity relationships of this family. We further characterized their mechanism of action and designed a new lead. We then improved the initial template, using the <b>benzisothiazolinone</b> scaffold as a new guide-structure. We proposed a series of modifications to evaluate this structure and validated the template. Finally, we characterized the mechanism of action on MAGL for two compounds, and unravelled the targeted amino-acids. In the last part of this work, we investigated the pharmacological potential of compounds belonging to the second series of inhibitors, based on the maleimide scaffold. Since the involvement of MAGL in the proliferative processes and the aggressiveness of cancer cells has been demonstrated, we tested some of maleimide derivatives on both topoisomerase and MAGL, as N-methyl and N-ethylmaleimide had been previously shown as type-II topoisomerase inhibitors too. Exploring both the medicinal chemistry and the pharmacology sides of a med chem project, this thesis presents three families of MAGL inhibitors with different pharmacological profiles (from reversible to irreversible inhibitors) and their potential implication in cancer related phenomena.

40|$|Burkholderia cepacia complex {{bacteria}} can contaminate and {{survive in a}} variety of antimicrobial and preserved industrial products. Contamination may lead to economic loss for manufacturers and also potentially pose a risk to the health of vulnerable consumers. Understanding the interaction between Bcc bacteria and preservatives, and the molecular basis for their resistance, is essential in order to better target these organisms and to facilitate the implementation of improved preservative strategies which target resistance mechanisms. In the present study, multi-locus sequence typing analysis of a collection of 67 Bcc isolates from environmentalindustrial sources was used to expand the current knowledge of Bcc species diversity within this niche and identified B. lata (n= 17) and B. cenocepacia (n= 11) as predominant species groups. The relationship between Bcc species diversity, isolation source and preservative susceptibility was investigated using a collection of 83 genetically diverse Bcc strains from clinical, environmental and environmental-industrial isolation sources. Susceptibility to eight preservatives was not related to Bcc taxonomy, as susceptibility profiles varied both between and within species groups. However, Bcc isolates from environmental-industrial sources had a significantly higher minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC and MBC) for the formaldehyde releasing agent DMDM hydantoin. This suggests that for this preservative agent, susceptibility was related to source and that the selection of highly tolerant Bcc bacteria had occurred within the niche. Isothiazolone, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol and methyl paraben preservatives were observed to be highly efficacious against Bcc bacteria when evaluated in growth medium at the maximum concentration regulated for use in rinse-off personal care products in EU-regulated countries. Benzethonium chloride and sodium benzoate preservatives had the weakest anti-Bcc activity at these levels but were effective against several strains. Combinations of preservatives, and preservatives with potentiating agents, were evaluated for synergistic anti- Bcc activity. The greatest anti-Bcc activity was observed when isothiazolone preservatives were combined with EDTA or phenoxyethanol, with each combination resulting in an additive effect. The competency of Bcc bacteria to adapt to preservatives was explored via the progressive sub-culture of B. lata strain 383 in subinhibitory preservative concentrations. This genome sequence strain represented a Bcc species commonly encountered in the environmental-industrial niche. Stable adaptive-resistance to isothiazolone and benzethonium chloride preservatives was developed. Phenoxyethanol, DMDM hydantoin and methyl paraben preservatives were recalcitrant to B. lata strain 383 adaptation. The preservative and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the adapted B. lata strain 383 derivatives differed, suggesting the induction of agent-specific adaptive-resistance mechanisms had occurred. The B. lata 383 -CMIT,-BIT, derivatives (adapted respectively to chloromethylisothiazolinone and <b>benzisothiazolinone),</b> demonstrated cross-resistance to isothiazolone preservatives and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Sequence analysis of the topoisomerase genes in these derivatives revealed fluoroquinolone resistance was not mediated by target modification. Preservative-induced adaptive resistance was not associated with overall increased multi-drug resistance. The molecular basis for resistance to DMDM hydantoin and isothiazolone preservatives was investigated via the random transposon mutagenesis of B. lata strain 383 using pTnModOTp’. Several genetic pathways were identified as putative preservative resistance determinants, suggesting that resistance is multi-factorial. These included the detoxification of formaldehyde via a glutathione-dependent pathway; a type II general secretory system (A 3244 _A 3233 genes); a homologue of an ABC-type efflux system involved in resistance to organic solvents (A 3512 _A 3517 genes); homologues of multi-drug RND-type efflux systems EmrB/QacA-Emr-TolC; and bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. A transcriptomic microarray-based approach was used to profile global gene expression of B. lata strain 383 in response to sub-MIC of 0. 00162 % DMDM hydantoin and 0. 00001498 % of a methylisothiazolinone and CMIT blend, as well as isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance. With a 1. 5 -fold change and P < 0. 05 confidence level criterion applied, few significant changes were observed after a single sub-MIC exposure, and the differential expression of putative resistance determinants identified by transposon mutagenesis was not induced at these concentrations. Isothiazolone-induced adaptive-resistance involved a greater number of significant gene expression changes that were stable irrespective of the presence of the priming agent, with 126 up-regulated and 90 down-regulated genes. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance was multi-factorial in nature, and identified active efflux as a putative key resistance mechanism. A novel role for a RND-type efflux system (B 1004 _B 1006 genes) was identified, and the up-regulation of the ABC-efflux system (A 3512 _A 3517 genes) and bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress corroborated the transposon mutagenesis findings. B. lata strain 383 -CMIT demonstrated a four-fold reduction in MIC for the priming preservative (2. 81 E- 04 %) in the presence of 512 mg/L of the efflux inhibitor PAβN. Resistance mechanism targeted preservative strategies such as using efflux inhibitors may work to improve preservation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing or fracking has enabled {{the recovery of}} natural gas from low permeable shale formations. In addition to water, these fracking fluids employ proppants and up to 38 different chemical additives to improve {{the efficiency of the}} process. One important class of additives used in hydraulic fracturing is biocides. When applied appropriately, they limit the growth of harmful microorganisms within the well, saving energy producers 4. 5 billion dollars each year. However, biocides or their harmful daughter products may return to the surface in produced water, which must then be appropriately stored, treated and disposed of. Little is known about the effect of mineral-fluid interactions on the fate of the biocides employed in hydraulic fracturing. In this study, we employed laboratory experiments to determine changes in the persistence and products of these biocides under controlled environments. While many minerals are present in shale formations, pyrite, FeS 2 (s) is particularly interesting because of its prevalence and reactivity. The FeII groups on the face of pyrite may be oxidized to form FeIII phases. Both of these surfaces {{have been shown to be}} reactive with organic compounds. Chlorinated compounds undergo redox reactions at the pyrite-fluid interface, and sulfur-containing compounds undergo exceptionally strong sorption to both pristine and oxidized pyrite. This mineral may significantly influence the degradation of biocides in the Marcellus Shale. Thus, the overall goal of this study was to understand the effect of pyrite on biocide reactivity in hydraulic fracturing, focusing on the influence of pyrite on specific functional groups. The first specific objective was to demonstrate the effect of pyrite and pyrite reaction products on the degradation of the bromine-containing biocide, DBNPA. On the addition of pyrite to DBNPA, degradation rates of the doubly brominated compound were found to increase significantly. DBNPA is proposed to undergo redox reactions with the pyrite surface, accepting two-electrons from pyrite, and thus becoming reduced. The primary product is the monobrominated analogue of DBNPA, 2 -monobromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide (or MBNPA). The surface area-normalized first-order initial degradation rate constant was found to be 5. 1 L. m- 2 day- 1. It was also determined that the dissolution and oxidation products of pyrite, FeII, S 2 O 32 - and SO 42 - are unlikely to contribute to the reduction of the biocide. Taken together, the results illustrate that a surface reaction with pyrite has the ability to reduce the persistence of DBNPA, and as a consequence change the distribution of its reaction products. The second objective was to quantify the influence of water chemistry and interactions with pyrite on the degradation of the sulfur-containing biocide. Dazomet readily hydrolyzes in water due to the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide (OH-) anions. Thus the half-life of dazomet during the shut-in phase of hydraulic fracturing will decrease with increasing pH: 8. 5 hours at pH 4. 1 to 3. 4 hours at pH 8. 2. Dazomet degradation was rapidly accelerated upon exposure to the oxidized pyrite surface, reacting five times faster than hydrolysis in the absence of pyrite at a similar pH. The products measured were identical to those identified on hydrolysis (methyl isothiocyanate and formaldehyde) and no dissolved iron was detected in solutions. This suggests that the dithiocarbamate group in dazomet was able to chemisorb onto the oxidized pyrite surface, shifting the electron density of the molecule which resulted in accelerated hydrolysis of the biocide. The third objective explored the reactivity of various biocide functional groups due to the addition of pyrite. Several elimination mechanisms were identified, and tied to the reactivity of the specific functional group involved. The addition of pyrite led to accelerated degradation of dibromodicyanobutane. This is because the bromine (-Br) group is easily reduced. For methylene bis(thiocyanate), hydrolysis was a noteworthy elimination mechanism since the thiocyanate (-SCN) functionality is a good leaving group. <b>Benzisothiazolinone</b> and methyl isothiazolinone were stable at low pH due to the stabilizing donor-acceptor interactions between the organic biocides’ carbonyl (–C=O) groups and salts in the solution. This body of work has illustrated that pristine pyrite can undergo redox reactions with brominated biocides used in hydraulic fracturing, reducing their persistence and altering the product distribution. This will change the efficacy and the risks associated with the use of these biocides in shales containing pyrite, particularly at lower pH where organic compounds are more stable to hydrolysis. However, at higher pH hydrolysis becomes more important, and additional studies will need to be conducted to investigate the pyrite contribution under these conditions. Conversely, the FeIII surface groups on oxidized pyrite can catalyze the hydrolysis of dazomet and may do so for other labile, sulfur-containing biocides as well. Overall, this research has shown that the physicochemical properties (such as the acid dissociation constant and the standard reduction potential) that govern the environmental reactivity of a molecule can be used to anticipate its reactivity in hydraulic fracturing...|$|E
