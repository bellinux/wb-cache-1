5000|$|Every {{variety of}} atrocity was devised to stimulate {{flagging}} interest. At one time, a bear and a <b>bull,</b> <b>chained</b> together, rolled in fierce combat {{across the sand}} ... Four hundred bears {{were killed in a}} single day under Caligula 12-41 ... Under Nero 37-68, four hundred tigers fought with bulls and elephants. In a single day, at the dedication of the Colosseum by Titus 39-81, five thousand animals perished. Under Trajan 53-117 ... lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, giraffes, bulls, stags, even crocodiles and serpents were employed to give novelty to the spectacle ... So intense was the craving for blood, that a prince was less unpopular if he neglected the distribution of corn than if he neglected the games.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a long}} barn indeed. Rollo {{thought he}} had never seen so large a building. On each side was a long range of stalls for cattle, facing towards the middle, and great {{scaffolds}} overhead, partly filled with hay and with bundles of straw. They walked down the barn floor, and in one place Rollo passed a large <b>bull</b> <b>chained</b> by the nose in one of the stalls. The bull uttered a sort of low growl or roar, as Rollo and his father passed, which made him a little afraid; but his attention was soon attracted to some hens, a little farther along, which were standing {{on the edge of the}} scaffolding over his head, and cackling with noise enough to fill the whole barn.|$|R

5000|$|English translation: [...] "It {{happened}} like this: I took (the <b>bull)</b> by the <b>chain.</b> It pushed {{its head}} into {{my back and}} drove me from a wall to another. I grabbed its horn {{with one hand and}} its other horn with another, and it knocked me down." ...|$|R
5000|$|Variations {{involved}} {{other animals}} being baited, especially bulls. Bull-baiting was a contest which {{was similar to}} bear baiting in which the <b>bull</b> was <b>chained</b> to a stake by one hind leg or by the neck and worried by dogs. The whipping of a blinded bear was another variation of bear-baiting. [...] Also, on one curious occasion, a pony with an ape tied to its back was baited; a spectator described that [...] "...with the screaming of the ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony, is very laughable".|$|R

25|$|Another gold artifact, {{from the}} Tabon Caves {{in the island}} of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The {{discovery}} of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves {{has been linked to}} those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam. These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi - the sacred <b>bull,</b> linked <b>chains,</b> inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities.|$|R
2500|$|Legend {{has it that}} Klagenfurt {{was founded}} {{after a couple of}} brave men had slain the abominable [...] "Lindwurm", [...] a winged dragon in the moors {{adjoining}} the lake, the staple diet of which {{is said to have been}} virgins, but which did not spurn the fat <b>bull</b> on a <b>chain</b> that the men had mounted on a strong tower. The feat is commemorated by a grandiose 9-ton Renaissance monument in the city centre.|$|R
6000|$|The two {{automobiles}} stood side by side, {{about three}} yards apart. Between {{them was a}} big and angry-looking bull, tramping the ground and snorting viciously. The <b>bull</b> had a <b>chain</b> around his neck, and {{to the end of}} this was a small-sized tree stump, which the animal had evidently pulled from the ground in his endeavor to get away from his pasture. The tree stump had become entangled in the wheel of one of the automobiles, and the bull was giving vicious jerks, first one way and then another, causing the machine to [...] "slew around" [...] in an alarming fashion.|$|R
50|$|Another German tale {{from the}} 13th century {{tells of a}} lindwyrm that lived near Klagenfurt. Flooding {{threatened}} travelers along the river, {{and the presence of}} a dragon was blamed. The story tells that a Duke offered a reward for anyone who could capture it; so some young men tied a <b>bull</b> to a <b>chain,</b> and when the lindworm swallowed the bull, it was hooked like a fish and killed. The head of a 1590 lindwyrm statue in Klagenfurt is modeled on the skull of a wooly rhinoceros found in a nearby quarry in 1335. It has been cited as the earliest reconstruction of an extinct animal.|$|R
40|$|In France, {{the young}} bulls sector {{has a very}} complex {{organization}} where beef calves areraised by a cow-calf producer and then sold to a fattener through numerous middle men. Thisorganization is in favour of an increased incidence of respiratory diseases in fattening units,and thus increased use of antibiotics. No study allows a holistic understanding of the young bulls' value chain, in France or in othercountries. This {{would lead to a}} better apprehension of the influence of stakeholders to controlbovine respiratory diseases (BRD) and of the possible lever to improve the existing situation. In this research, we aimed at (i) describing the functioning of the French young <b>bulls</b> value <b>chain</b> and the different roles of stakeholders and institutions, (ii) understanding how the present organization influences the risk to develop BRD in fattening units, (iii) observing the existing strategies of stakeholders to control the risk of BRD and discussing some possible alternative methods. We collected information from cow-calf producers, middle men, and fatteners relying on qualitative semi-structured interviews and on observations on field conducted in major beef cattle regions in France. The main findings first confirmed the expected complexity of different existing commercial paths in the value chain and the role of this vertical organization in increasing risks factors for BRD. Second, there was a preventive and quasi systematic use of antibiotics which sharply reduced (i) the potential effects of technical and sanitary interdependency between the cowcalf producer and the fattener, (ii) the risk to develop BRD, when there were an increased number of middle men before fattening. Finally, main opportunities to improve sanitary health status of animals would be to (i) reduce the number of intermediaries and (ii) the number of farms of origin in weanling batches, (iii) increase the use of vaccination by cowcalf producers...|$|R
