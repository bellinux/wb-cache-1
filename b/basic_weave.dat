5000|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>weave</b> {{is called}} [...] "three-beat" [...] because each poi spins {{three times in}} a cycle: once {{on the same side of}} the body (e.g. left hand poi on left side) and twice on the {{opposite}} side.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the weaving performance and the visual perception abilities of primary school children. The sample population consisted of 50 first-graders, 26 boys and 24 girls. A measure was developed to test weaving performance; the children participated in a weaving lesson and then their products were evaluated by the author on a seven criterion evaluation form. To test visual perception abilities, the Marianne Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception was administered to the children. A Pearson Product-moment correlation coefficient was used to study the relationship of the variables. The findings reveal that the learning of <b>basic</b> <b>weaving</b> techniques was significantly related to two visual perception abilities: Figure-Ground perception (r = 0. 294) and Spatial Relationship (r = 0. 314) but not to Eye-Motor Coordination (r = 0. 271), Constancy of Shape (r = 0. 071), or Position in Space (r = 0. 111); neither was the <b>Basic</b> <b>Weaving</b> Score significantly related to the Perceptual Quotient (r = 0. 271) nor to the children's chronological age (r = 0. 164). The findings provide insight as to two of the factors, Figure- Ground perception and Spatial Relationships, which may be involved in the learning of <b>basic</b> <b>weaving</b> techniques. However, these correlations are very low which might indicate that there are other factors which may be more significantly related to weaving performance than visual perception abilities...|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of damask {{was one of}} the five <b>basic</b> <b>weaving</b> techniques—the others being tabby, twill, lampas, and tapestry—of the Byzantine and Islamic weaving centres of the early Middle Ages. Damasks derive their name from the city of Damascus—in that period a large city active both in trading (as part of the silk road) and in manufacture. Damasks became scarce after the 9th century outside of Islamic Spain, but were revived in some places in the 13th century.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{example of}} Shoowa {{textiles}} is the Ceremonial Panel. This piece dates from 1885-1910, and is 17" [...] × 59" [...] (41.91 cm × 149.86 cm) in size. This ancient cloth {{is composed of}} two pieces joined across the center; and bordered by pompoms, a technique reported for textiles on the Kongo coast in the seventeenth century. The <b>basic</b> <b>weave</b> is typical for Shoowa with close warps and weft of similar thickness and even distribution. The designs are shaped by two embroidery techniques: lines of stem stitching and cut-pile. To create the plush effect, an embroiderer twists a strand of raffia into an iron needle which she inserts between the warp and weft, leaving a short tuft. After pulling the fiber strand through to about two milimeters in height, she cuts it with a narrow knife held vertically in the same hand and brushes both ends.|$|E

40|$|Virtual {{performance}} tests of filter media help {{to speed up}} development cycles and to quickly find customer tailored product solutions. In order to achieve virtual filter testing methods with high predictive quality, great care {{has to be taken}} to accurately capture the essence of the structure (geometry) and the physical processes. Consequently, we develop models, algorithms and software implementations related to virtual structure generation, geometric structure analysis, fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. To avoid parameter uncertainties, all methods operate on the microstructure of the filter media. In the present paper, we perform a basic study of weave patterns subject to deformation using our software suite GeoDict and the new elasticity module FeelMath. More precisely, we consider <b>basic</b> <b>weave</b> patterns like plain and twill weave and compute their structural behavior under tension, compression, shear and bending forces. Having undeformed and deformed weaves as computer models, pore morphology changes, permeability and filter performance are computed and analyzed. The results provide fundamental insights into the governing mechanisms on the micro scale and their influence to the filter media scale...|$|E
40|$|Digital Jacquard {{textiles}} {{have been}} introduced through various approaches to the capability enhancement of color expression and novel design proposition in modern weaving. Because of its a wide scope of weave colors with {{a small number of}} fillings, the <b>basic</b> <b>weave</b> structure of satin is widely adopted in the creation of shaded weave series, as they are highly reliable in presenting the natural color shading with maximized luster. However, its surface texture is limited with consistent traverse lines attributed to regular stitching points in their structure combination. Therefore, a new silhouette of shaded weave series is proposed and explored with twills to enlarge and vary the woven texture effects. The shading effect with single twills will be presented in a linear and contrasting way; when small twill lines are cut and replaced, the converted format will enable the creation of a varied surface touch. By finding the base marks where the total interlacement of a repeat is proportionally divided, small twill lines are transformed by adding interweaving points to build into a series. Furthermore, the basic principles received from satin-based shaded series are applied to the achievement of gradient shading effects. In terms of weave pattern design, each color layer is individually designed with levels of grayscales and defines each color region and color density to achieve a high-quality color presentation, as well as a unique texture.

50|$|The main Aleut {{method of}} basketry was false {{embroidery}} (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the <b>basic</b> <b>weaving</b> surface, {{to obtain a}} plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women. Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is qiigam aygaaxsii. One Aleut leader recognized by the State of Alaska for her work in teaching and reviving Aleut basketry was Anfesia Shapsnikoff. Her life and accomplishments are portrayed in the book Moments Rightly Placed(1998).|$|R
40|$|Fabrics {{are unique}} {{materials}} which consist of various properties affecting their performance and end-uses. A computerized fabric property evaluation and analysis method plays {{a crucial role}} not only in textile industry but also in scientific research. An accurate analysis and measurement of fabric property provides a powerful tool for gauging product quality, assuring regulatory compliance and assessing the performance of textile materials. This thesis investigated the solutions for applying computerized methods to evaluate and intelligently interpret the texture and material properties of fabric in an inexpensive and efficient way. Firstly, a method which allows automatic recognition of <b>basic</b> <b>weave</b> pattern and precisely measuring the yarn count is proposed. The yarn crossed-areas are segmented by a spatial domain integral projection approach. Combining fuzzy c-means (FCM) and principal component analysis (PCA) on grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature vectors extracted from the segments enables to classify detected segments into two clusters. Based on the analysis on texture orientation features, the yarn crossed-area states are automatically determined. An autocorrelation method is used to find weave repeats and correct detection errors. The method was validated by using computer simulated woven samples and real woven fabric images. The test samples have various yarn counts, appearance, and weave types. All weave patterns of tested fabric samples are successfully recognized and computed yarn counts are consistent to the manual counts. Secondly, we present a methodology for using the high resolution 3 D surface data of fabric samples to measure surface roughness in a nondestructive and accurate way. A parameter FDFFT, which is the fractal dimension estimation from 2 DFFT of 3 D surface scan, is proposed as the indicator of surface roughness. The robustness of FDFFT, which consists of the rotation-invariance and scale-invariance, is validated on a number of computer simulated fractal Brownian images. Secondly, in order to evaluate the usefulness of FDFFT, a novel method of calculating standard roughness parameters from 3 D surface scan is introduced. According to the test results, FDFFT has been demonstrated as a fast and reliable parameter for measuring the fabric roughness from 3 D surface data. We attempt a neural network model using back propagation algorithm and FDFFT for predicting the standard roughness parameters. The proposed neural network model shows good performance experimentally. Finally, an intelligent approach for the interpretation of fabric objective measurements is proposed using supported vector machine (SVM) techniques. The human expert assessments of fabric samples are used during the training phase in order to adjust the general system into an applicable model. Since the target output of the system is clear, the uncertainty which lies in current subjective fabric evaluation does not affect the performance of proposed model. The support vector machine {{is one of the best}} solutions for handling high dimensional data classification. The complexity problem of the fabric property has been optimally dealt with. The generalization ability shown in SVM allows the user to separately implement and design the components. Sufficient cross-validations are performed and demonstrate the performance test of the system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new micromechanical model to predict biaxial tensile moduli of {{plain weave fabric}} (PWF) composites by considering {{the interaction between the}} orthogonal interlacing strands. The two orthogonal yarns in micromechanical unit cell (UC) were idealized as curved beams with a path depicted by using sinusoidal shape functions. The biaxial tensile moduli of PWF composites were derived by means of the minimum total complementary potential energy principle founded on micromechanics. Biaxial tensile tests were conducted on the RTM-made EW 220 / 5284 PWF composites at five biaxial loading ratios of 0, 1, 2, 3 and ∞ to validate the new model. Predictions from the new model were compared with experimental data. Good correlation was achieved between the predictions and actual experiments, demonstrating the practical and effective use of the proposed model. Using the new model, the biaxial tensile moduli of plain weave fabric (PWF) composites can be predicted based only on the properties of <b>basic</b> <b>woven</b> fabric...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sadum {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} cloths of the Batak people in North Sumatra. It is woven on a back strap loom with supplementary weft technique. Sadum is a warp faced weaving made of cotton and beads woven into the cloth. Ritually it is used as a shoulder cloth, gifts exchanges, and in dances. It also bears the symbol of good tidings and blessings for the receiver. The cloth has change during times in technique, color, patterns, as well as in functions. But the use as a ritual cloth stays the same. The <b>basic</b> <b>weaving</b> techniques and equipments used to create it hasn’t change, but its material and added techniques has made this cloth become more rich in color, pattern, and texture. Most changes began when the Europeans came to Indonesia and introduced new material such as synthetic fibers and colors. In the 70 s traditional cloth of Indonesia got its boost when the government declared batik as Indonesian national attire. This encourages other traditional weavings to develop into contemporary clothing. Later, new techniques and material were introduced to the Sadum weavings including embroidery, silk and golden threads which were never used before...|$|R
