5|$|The entire theatre {{staff was}} laid off in December 1996 once it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> that the Brars were seriously {{considering}} purchasing the theatre, and the theatre’s projectionists began {{what would be a}} six-month strike when it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> the Brars would not respect a recently signed two-year contract with the Old Strathcona Foundation.|$|R
5|$|After {{graduation}} {{the four}} go their separate ways, but they remain in contact through letters and regular visits, although their letters are {{read by the}} Securitate. They take menial jobs: Kurt works in a slaughterhouse as a supervisor, for instance; and the narrator translates German manuals in a factory. A fifth member, Tereza, befriends the narrator even as it <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that she is acting partly on Pjele's orders.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends with}} Walter {{watching}} {{a video of}} Olivia as a child, apparently taken while she was being administered Cortexiphan. Walter's voice is heard on the tape, as is William Bell's. Both are trying to calm little Olivia while she sits, huddled amidst a debris-strewn room of equipment. It <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> Olivia has caused this chaos in Walter and Bell's lab, presumably with her Cortexiphan-induced abilities.|$|E
5|$|At a waterfall, {{another girl}} commits suicide by drowning. The girl, Carlin, looks {{identical}} to Lauren. Andrews performs an autopsy on Carlin as well, finding the same astrological symbol. It also <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the two}} girls are related—identical twins, born seven years apart. The girls are clones, produced using a technique {{similar to that used}} to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes theory, that someone is breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000.|$|E

5|$|Atticus {{does not}} want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is {{available}} on the main floor, so by invitation of the Rev. Sykes, Jem, Scout, and Dill watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is Atticus', when the hapless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.|$|E
5|$|Back in San Francisco, {{dental records}} matched to teeth {{found in the}} ashes lead to a young {{immigrant}} who vanished six months prior, having joined a doomsday cult. Elsewhere, this cult is seen operating as telemarketers, working in a large assembly hall as propaganda slogans are projected onto the walls around them. One of the members is apprehended by Black, and during his interrogation it <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that the cult, fronting as Gehenna Industries, is brainwashing its terrified members, incinerating those who disobey.|$|E
5|$|Doggett interrogates Dwight, and Scully interrogates Randall. Randall repeats Dwight's {{words as}} he reads his lips through a wall. Randall replies {{that he and}} Dwight are just exterminators. Later, Tammi returns home and meets up with Randall, and the two go to the bus station. It <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that they intend to run away together, but that Tammi must go get her stash of money. Meanwhile, Doggett finds phone records that show that Tammi and Chase had back and forth phone calls, late at night. Doggett and Scully search Tammi's apartment, and Doggett redials Tammi's phone, getting the bus station.|$|E

At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} public pressure {{to resolve the}} problem. It <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> to the British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point {{turns out to be the}} disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|One of Yaponchik's victims is {{identified}} as a restorer of Russian icons. Her home is searched, and {{it is found that}} she had uncovered Yaponchik's identity and attempted to appease him by sending him several icons. Black feels Yaponchik is killing in order to perpetuate the legends surrounding him by instilling fear in those who believe them. Watts and Black visit the Russian Embassy to find the man the icons were being mailed to—Sergei Stepanovich, identifiable as Yaponchik. Stepanovich is protected by diplomatic immunity; however, it <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that Surova, Medikov and an Orthodox priest who aided the investigation have all been stalking Stepanovich, who they believe to be the Antichrist.|$|E
50|$|During her {{interviews}} with the victim, it <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> to Byron that the victim did not completely understand {{what had happened to}} her, so she would not have known she could say no.

5|$|The player {{initially}} must {{enter their}} name into the device, which then displays {{a series of}} past lives the player has lived. The name is converted into its numerological equivalent. Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called Kether and Malchut respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task. The motivations of the two organizations represented by the faces are murky, although it <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> they are acting in opposition to each other. Both masks refer to the player by their assigned number.|$|E

Through Sam he discovers Carry's whereabouts, and resolves to rescue her if he can. He finds her a temporary home, but it <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> to him that the only permanent solution must involve bringing her back into the Brattle family, which means winning her father's forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|When {{discussing}} the Eurasian Economic Union, Vladimir Putin said the Eurasian Economic Union would include closer coordination {{of economic and}} monetary policy, {{including the use of}} a common currency in the future. Although the creation of a monetary union was not envisaged in the Eurasian Economic Union Treaty, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called for the introduction of a common currency for the Eurasian Economic Union. Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma's CIS committee, backed Medvedev's proposal to start discussions on the creation of a monetary union. Slutsky said it could be introduced shortly after 2015, when the union's structure <b>becomes</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E

5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|It soon <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that MacPherson {{is being}} poisoned. Nikola {{believes}} that Brandt is responsible, {{because of his}} recent disappearances, but is proven wrong. After MacPherson dies, Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri. Walker sends Nikola, disguised as a pirate, on an espionage mission to discover the traitor's identity. Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford, who, when confronted, boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a docking bay. The squad continues the war, and the Hegemony is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher. The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it. Following its defeat, the Hegemony denies involvement in the war, declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system. While angered by the announcement, Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
