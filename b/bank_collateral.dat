40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} roles of bank asset fire sales and recourse to central bank credit to ensure banks' funding liquidity and solvency. Both asset liquidity and central bank haircuts are modelled as power functions within the unit interval. Funding stability is captured as strategic bank run game in pure strategies between depositors. Asset liquidity, the central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> framework and regulation determine jointly {{the ability of}} the banking system to deliver maturity transformation and financial stability. The model also explains why banks tend to use the least liquid eligible assets as central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> and why a sudden non-anticipated reduction of asset liquidity, or a tightening of the collateral framework, can destabilize short term liabilities of banks. Finally, the model allows discussing how the collateral framework can be understood, beyond its essential aim to protect the central bank, as financial stability and non-conventional monetary policy instrument...|$|E

The model also illustrates that the credit riskiness of counterparties and issuers is endogenous to the central bank's credit policies and related risk control framework. Finally, the model allows identifying the circumstances under which the counterintuitive case arises in which a relaxation of the central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> policy may reduce its expected losses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{implications}} of central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> {{requirements for the}} {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} and the working of the money market have often been neglected. Such implications, however, have clearly manifested {{during the course of the}} 2007 - 2009 crisis. As liquidity was vanishing in the interbank market, banks started to use (and abuse of) central bank funding more intensively, in order to cover their short-term financing needs. As a result, central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> eligibility criteria have become even more relevant than the short-term rate as a factor of monetary policy transmission as well as a driver of liquidity in the interbank market. Thus, in the light of a retrospective analysis of some major events affecting monetary policy in the Euro area in the last two years, this study intends to properly formulate the problem related to the choice of ‘optimal ’ collateral requirements, by illustrating their interrelations with other central bank policy tools and targets. Ultimately, this approach allows us to derive a non-exhaustive set of recommendations for collateral and interest rate policies, as well as for central banks ’ exit strategies from the current unconventional measures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} inform about {{a feature of}} {{monetary}} policy that is largely overlooked, yet occupies {{a central role in}} modern monetary and financial systems, namely central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> frameworks. Their importance can be understood by the observation that the money at the core of these systems, central bank money, is injected into the economy on terms, not defined in a market, but by the collateral frameworks and interest rate policies of central banks. Using the collateral framework of the Eurosystem as a basis of illustration and case study, the paper brings to light the functioning, reach, and impact of collateral frameworks. A theme that emerges is that collateral frameworks may have distortive effects on financial markets and the wider economy. They can, for example, bias the private provision of real liquidity and thereby also the allocation of resources in the economy as well as contribute to financial instability. Evidence is presented that the collateral framework in the euro area promotes risky and illiquid collateral and, more generally, impairs market forces and discipline. The paper also emphasizes the important role of ratings and government guarantees in the Eurosystem’s collateral framework...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters on housing and credit markets. Chapter 1 tests the "housing lock hypothesis": the conjecture that homeowners with limited or negative home equity, low levels of financial assets and restricted opportunities to borrow are unable to move. It employs unique, administrative population data on residential location, home-ownership, family structure, and household balance sheets from the Netherlands. The rapid rise in Dutch house prices during the 1995 - 2008 period, and their substantial decline thereafter, has generated large variation in the home equity of buyers who bought homes a few years apart. Buyers in the cohorts that purchased homes around the peak have higher Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratios than earlier buyers, and also have much lower mobility rates in every year after purchase. A decline in home equity is associated with large and statistically significant reductions in household mobility. A rise in the LTV ratio from 90 to 115 % {{is associated with a}} 30 % decline in household mobility. The reduction in mobility is observed both within and across labor markets. The mobility effects of falling home equity are substantially larger for households with low financial asset holdings. These results emerge from comparisons of mobility rates from different purchase cohorts after removing time and region effects, as well as from an analysis of homebuyers whose purchase timing was determined by arguably exogenous changes in family structure. Since Dutch mortgages are full recourse, which rules out strategic default behavior, the findings provide new support for the "housing lock hypothesis". Chapter 2, co-authored with François Koulischer, studies the role of collateral in liquidity provision by central banks. Should central banks lend against low quality collateral? We characterize efficient central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> policy in a model where a bank borrows from the interbank market or the central <b>bank.</b> <b>Collateral</b> has favorable incentive effects but is costly to transfer to lenders who value the collateral less because of imperfect collateral quality. We show that a fall in the quantity or the quality of the bank's collateral can increase interest rates in the economy even with a constant policy rate. A looser central <b>bank</b> <b>collateral</b> policy can reduce the spread, alleviate the credit crunch and increase output. Chapter 3 studies the effects of LTV limits, Payment-To-Income (PTI) limits and the mortgage interest deduction on mortgage debt exploiting a series of policy changes in the Netherlands. As intended, regulatory loan limits reduce mortgage leverage ratios and they also induce bunching at the loan limits. Loan limits and restrictions of the mortgage interest deduction trigger large declines in mortgage volumes. The leverage and volume responses are larger for young, borrowing-constrained households. The repeal of the mortgage interest deduction for non-amortizing mortgages decimates the market for non-amortizing mortgages. The PTI tightening is also associated with a substantial rise in the fraction of mortgages that have very short periods during which the interest rate is fixed. This unintended risk-shifting pattern to quasi- adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) may increase income risk. The reform of the mortgage interest deduction, which boosts amortization, is also associated with a significant decline in principal amounts at origination. These findings highlight the distributional effects as well as the unintended potential consequences of macroprudential and fiscal policies aiming to reduce mortgage debt. This thesis tries to cast light on the effects of shocks to the value of housing and other types of collateral on the broader economy. This work suggests that the combination of imperfections in credit markets and shocks to asset prices can exert a substantial, non-linear and heterogeneous influence on household and firm outcomes, such as residential mobility (Chapter 1) and business investment (Chapter 2). This thesis also investigates the role for monetary, macroprudential and fiscal policies to alleviate or prevent the negative spill-over effects to the real economy, both before (Chapter 3) as well as after (Chapter 2) the occurrence of financial shocks.
