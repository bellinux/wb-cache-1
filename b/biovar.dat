40|$|Yersiniosis {{caused by}} Yersinia enterocolitica has been {{reported}} from all continents. The bacterial species is divided into more than fifty serovars and six <b>biovars</b> viz. 1 A, 1 B, 2, 3, 4 and 5 which differ in geographical distribution, ecological niches and pathogenicity. Most Y. enterocolitica strains harbor chromosomal genes for two β-lactamases, blaA an Ambler class A penicillinase and blaB an Ambler class C inducible cephalosporinase. In the present study, susceptibility to b-lactam antibiotics and β-lactamase inhibitor was studied for Y. enterocolitica strains of <b>biovars</b> 1 A, 1 B, 2 and 4. We observed that β-lactamases were expressed differentially among strains of different <b>biovars.</b> To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying such differential expression, the sequences of genes and promoters of blaA were compared. Also, the variants of blaA present in different <b>biovars</b> were modeled and docked with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. The mRNA secondary structures of blaA variants were also predicted in-silico. Our findings indicated that neither variations in the promoter regions, nor the secondary structures of mRNA contributed to higher/lower expression of blaA in different <b>biovars.</b> Analysis of H-bonding residues of blaA variants with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid revealed that if amino acid residues of a β-lactamase interacting with amoxicillin and the clavulanic acid were similar, clavulanic acid was effective in engaging the enzyme, accounting for {{a significant reduction in}} MIC of amoxicillin-clavulanate.

The isolates were tested for in vitro antagonism toward the plant-pathogenic microfungi Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani in three different plate test media. Mechanisms of fungal inhibition were elucidated by tracing secondary-metabolite production and cell wall-degrading enzyme activity in the same media. Most <b>biovars</b> expressed a specific mechanism of antagonism, as represented by a unique antibiotic or enzyme production in the media. A lipopeptide antibiotic, viscosinamide, was produced independently of medium composition by P. fluorescens bv. I, whereas the antibiotic 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol was observed only in glucose-rich medium and only in P. fluorescens bv. II/IV. Both pathogens were inhibited by the two antibiotics. Finally, in low-glucose medium, a cell wall-degrading endochitinase activity in P. fluorescens bv. I, III, and VI was the apparent mechanism of antagonism toward R. solani. The viscosinamide-producing DR 54 isolate (bv.

Rhizobium galegae strains were isolated from nodules of wild Galega orientalis and Galega officinalis in the Caucasus, the center of origin for G. orientalis. All 101 isolates were characterized by genomic amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting and by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the rRNA intergenic spacer and of five parts of the symbiotic region adjacent to nod box sequences. By all criteria, the R. galegae bv. officinalis and R. galegae bv. orientalis strains form distinct clusters.

40|$|Brucella {{constitutes}} a single genomic species (B. melitensis); however, for epidemiological studies, methods {{are needed for}} discriminating strains within this genomic species. DNA samples from 112 Brucella strains were cleaved by restriction endonucleases and the fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes. When the DNA fragments on the membranes were probed with P- 32 -labelled 16 + 23 S rRNA from Escherichia coli, a single rRNA gene restriction pattern was obtained after cleavage with all endonucleases tested (HindIII, EcoRI, SmaI, and XhoI) except BamHI. This indicated high genomic homogeneity within the single Brucella species. Of 30 probes consisting of random Brucella DNA fragments cloned into lambda-EMBL 3, 20 yielded a single BamHI restriction pattern per probe when applied to 112 Brucella DNA tested. However, 7 probes yielded 3 to 12 different patterns among DNA tested. These patterns more-or-less correlated with the classification of strains into biogroups (Melitensis, Abortus, Suis, Neotomae, Ovis and Canis) and <b>biovars</b> (18 <b>biovars</b> represented). Probe A was capable of separating biogroup Melitensis from the other biogroups. Probe C separated the set of biogroups Melitensis-Abortus-Ovis from the other biogroups. By reference to the patterns obtained using 1 to 7 probes, the most frequently occurring <b>biovars</b> (Melitensis 1, Melitensis 3, Abortus 1, Abortus 3, Suis 2 and Ovis) could be distinguished from each other. Eight <b>biovars</b> showed more than one pattern with 1 to 7 probes.

5000|$|Three biovars of Y. pestis were {{originally}} thought {{to correspond to}} one of the historical pandemics of bubonic plague.

However, calculations of Y. pestis evolutionary age, found using the number of synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in conjunction with molecular clock rates, date the emergence of the biovars prior to any of the historical epidemics due to the length of time needed to accumulate such mutations. Additional evidence against this hypothesis includes the fact that Y. p. mediaevalis is likely too young to have produced the Black Death due to its recent divergence from Y. p. orientalis.|$|E

Among 74 V. anguillarum isolates from diseased fish, 63 carried only a 67 -kb plasmid (pJM 1), 9 carried an additional 98 -kb plasmid, and 1 isolate carried only the 98 -kb plasmid. Only one isolate was without plasmids. In V. anguillarum serovar O 1 from nondiseased fish (mucus and gills), plasmids of the same sizes were present in 29 isolates (58 %), whereas 21 isolates (42 %) were plasmid free. Based on hemagglutination and biochemical properties, V. anguillarum serovar O 1 isolates were divided into eight <b>biovars.</b> The plasmid-carrying strains (102 isolates) all fell within <b>biovars</b> 1 and 2, whereas the 23 strains of <b>biovars</b> 3 to 8 were without plasmids.
