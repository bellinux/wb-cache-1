Several of the effects, as, for instances, {{those with}} helices(1066.), with {{according}} or counter currents (1097. 1098.), {{and those on}} the production of lateral currents (1090.), appeared to indicate that a current could produce an effect of induction in a neighbouring wire more readily than in its own carrying wire, in which case it might be expected that some variation of result would be produced if a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> were used as a conductor instead of a single wire. In consequence the following experiments were made. A copper wire one twenty-third of an inch in diameter was cut into lengths of five feet each, and six of these being laid {{side by side in}} one bundle, had their opposite extremities soldered to two terminal pieces of copper. This arrangement {{could be used as a}} discharging wire, but the general current could be divided into six parallel streams, which might be brought close together, or, by the separation of the wires, be taken more or less out of each other's influence. A somewhat brighter spark was, I think, obtained on breaking contact when the six wires were close together than when held asunder.|$|E

50|$|The motor {{construction}} begins when a robot unspools and winds over 1/2 mi <b>of</b> copper <b>wire</b> per motor. It then pulls the copper wire into a stack. The motor has three phases and so requires three coils of copper. A worker then lengthens and straightens each <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> and inserts the hydraulic lift {{to transfer the}} motor to the next station.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{computer}} buses were <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> that attached {{computer memory}} and peripherals. Anecdotally termed the [...] "digit trunk", they were named after electrical power buses, or busbars. Almost always, {{there was one}} bus for memory, and one or more separate buses for peripherals. These were accessed by separate instructions, with completely different timings and protocols.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{wrapping}} {{comes from}} the tradition of rope splicing. Early wire wrapping was performed manually; a slow and careful process. Wire wrapping was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge wires and other wire rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter wire wrapped around a larger wire or <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b> Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.|$|E
50|$|An {{electrical}} connection is {{made between the}} tractor and the trailer through a cable {{often referred to as}} a pigtail. This cable is a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> in a single casing. Each wire controls one of the electrical circuits on the trailer, such as running lights, brake lights, turn signals, etc. A straight cable would break when the rig went around corners, so a coiled cable is used which retracts these coils when not under tension. It is these coils that cause the cable to look like a pigtail.|$|E
50|$|In this process, a wire (or <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires)</b> is {{preheated}} {{to above}} the glass transition or melting {{temperature of the}} polymer coating {{that is to be}} applied. This is to ensure adhesion of the new coating. Next, this preheated bare wire is pulled very rapidly through a die which places a thin coating of polymer around the wire. Due to the geometry of the dies used, relatively high extrusion rates are possible while still avoiding melt fracture. The newly coated wire is then drawn through an air or gas flame to smooth the surface of the coating, and finally a water bath to fully cool the coated wire. Coated wires are now spooled to prepare for further processing, if desired.|$|E

When the magnetically soft layers <b>of</b> the <b>wires</b> were reversed by an applied external magnetic field, a pulse voltage, owing {{to a large}} Barkhausen jump, was induced in a search coil wound around the wires. The output did {{not depend on the}} exciting frequency of the applied field for the bundled wires with n (number <b>of</b> <b>bundled</b> <b>wires)</b> < 5. The frequency dependence for n = 10 was attributed to the demagnetizing Held in the thicker shape <b>of</b> the <b>bundle.</b> The <b>bundled</b> <b>wires</b> <b>of</b> n = 25 exhibited dispersed peaks in output waveform due to a self-biasing effect, which was advantageous for obtaining a rectangular output waveform...|$|R
50|$|Molecular wires can be {{incorporated}} into polymers, enhancing their mechanical and/or conducting properties. The enhancement of these properties relies on uniform dispersion <b>of</b> the <b>wires</b> into the host polymer. MoSI wires have been made in such composites, relying on their superior solubility within the polymer host compared to other nanowires or nanotubes. <b>Bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> can be used to enhance tribological properties of polymers, with applications in actuators and potentiometers. It has been recently proposed that twisted nanowires could work as electromechanical nanodevices (or torsion nanobalances) to measure forces and torques at nanoscale with great precision.|$|R
5000|$|There {{may also}} be a memory address {{register}} and a memory data register, used to access the main computer storage. Together, these elements form an [...] "execution unit". Most modern CPUs have several execution units. Even simple computers usually have one unit to read and write memory, and another to execute user code. These elements could often be brought together as a single chip. This chip comes in a fixed width that would form a [...] "slice" [...] through the execution unit. These are known as [...] "bit slice" [...] chips. The AMD Am2900 family {{is one of the best}} known examples of bit slice elements.

5000|$|In {{register}} transfer logic, binary {{numbers are}} stored in groups of flip flops called registers. The outputs of each register are a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> called a [...] "bus" [...] that carries that number to other calculations. A calculation is simply a piece of combinational logic. Each calculation also has an output bus, and these may {{be connected to the}} inputs of several registers. Sometimes a register will have a multiplexer on its input, so that it can store a number from any one of several buses. Alternatively, the outputs of several items may be connected to a bus through buffers that can turn off the output of all of the devices except one. A sequential state machine controls when each register accepts new data from its input.|$|E

At this point the wires broke, the two modules separated, and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude. Gagarin telegraphed [...] "Everything is OK" [...] despite continuing gyrations; he later reported {{that he did not want}} to [...] "make noise" [...] as he had (correctly) reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission (and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module). As Gagarin continued his descent, he remained conscious as he experienced about 8 g during reentry. (Gagarin's own report states [...] "over 10 g".) ...|$|E

50|$|Without {{a matrix}} circuit, a 61-key {{keyboard}} for a synthesizer, electronic organ, or digital piano would require 62 wires to connect (one for each note, and a ground)—an awkwardly thick <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wiring.</b> With a matrix circuit, any of 61 notes {{can be determined}} with only 16 wires. This is drawn schematically as a matrix of 8 columns and 8 rows <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> with a switch at every intersection. The keyboard controller scans the columns. If a key has been pressed, the controller scans the rows — and in a manner analogous to the board game Battleship!, the controller determines the row-column combination at which a key has been pressed, and generates a note corresponding to that key. This process occurs so quickly that the performer is unaware of any delay.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAircraft {{design and}} {{development}} is a continuous process over the decades. In many design objectives drive airplane development. One main driver is the aircraft's bulkhead design, while retaining safety, function and performance. As extensive measurement campaigns have revealed, bulkhead can be saved in existing but having big holes for passing the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> is main drawback. If any problem with electrical systems constitutes a serious fire hazard and also may cause the destruction of electric wiring and damage to units of electrical equipment when we are allowing that <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> passing through bulkhead holes. Secondly, losing strength of bulkheads. In other hand aircraft's electrical system plays more essential role in aircraft. Certain requirements have been established for the electrical systems of both civil and military aircraft. Electrical systems must be free of hazards in themselves, in their method of operation, and in their effects of {{other parts of the}} aircraft; and they must be installed in such a manner but in existing that they are adequately unprotected from damage by making holes over bulkheads and allowing n number of bundles through it, that may affect both bulkhead design as well as neighborhood systems.

Particularly, after a general presentation of the geometrical model of the random bundle and the frequency response of voltages induced at terminal loads (between each wire and ground), the analysis focuses on the lower portion of the frequency spectrum, where the bundle behaves as an electrically short multiconductor transmission line. In this frequency range, it is shown that the induced voltages are normally distributed. Special properties of the expected value and standard deviation are derived via numerical simulations and analytical closed-form expressions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study numerically the {{mechanical}} behaviour of wire ropes, particularly {{the influence of}} the geometrical configuration on the overall stiffness of the cables. Modelling the behaviour of a cable is a difficult problem, given the complexity of the geometrical layout, contact phenomena occurring among wires and possible yielding of the material. For this reason we pursue a “hierarchical beam approach”, to substitute recursively, at each cabling stage, the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> with an equivalent single strand, having the characteristics computed from the previous level. We consider the first two levels of the bundle hierarchy and investigate the case of longitudinal stretching, as a representative application of the method for the problem at hand. To this aim, we perform a certain number of numerical experiments on a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> by varying their twist pitches. In this way we compose a set of data to train suitable Artificial Neural Networks, so that, given the twist pitches and the applied longitudinal displacement in input, the ANNs give us the longitudinal reaction force, the bundle axial rotation or the overall axial stiffness. These results can be used “directly” to search for geometrical configurations that offer a significant improvement in stiffness, assuming that a higher stiffness will reduce strand bending and wires breakage. Furthermore, they can be used to obtain the characteristics of the single, equivalent beam that we need for our approach...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} ordering and sizing parallel wires in a single metal layer within an interconnect channel of a given width, such that crosscapacitances are optimally shared for circuit timing optimization. Using an Elmore delay model including cross capacitances for a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> we show that an optimal wire ordering is uniquely determined, such that best timing {{can be obtained by}} proper allocation of wire widths and inter-wire spaces. The optimal order, called BMI (Balanced Monotonic Interleaved) depends only on the size of drivers {{for a wide range of}} cases. Heuristics are presented for simultaneous ordering, sizing and spacing of wires. Examples for 90 -nanometer technology are analyzed and discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{interconnections}} among electronic devices are performed by means of randomly twisted <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> particularly for transport and industrial applications.

It allows the wires' meandering degree to be tuned simply {{by means of a}} parameter (the fractal dimension). It also allows for a statistical analysis of crosstalk because it can simulate independent different realizations of the same interconnection. An efficient multifactor prediction method known as "Kriging" is applied in order to describe the crosstalk {{as a function of the}} input factors (cable loads, cable height above the ground plane, etc.) of the cable model.
