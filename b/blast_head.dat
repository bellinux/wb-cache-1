40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to improve the}} productivity and lower the expense of existing vacuum blasting technology. This technology is used to remove radioactive contamination, PCBs, and lead-based paint and provides worker protection by continuously recycling the material and dust for the decontamination tasks. The proposed work would increase the cleaning rate and provide safe and cost-effective decontamination of the DOE sites. This work focuses on redesigning and improving existing vacuum blasting technology including <b>blast</b> <b>head</b> nozzles, ergonomic handling of the <b>blast</b> <b>head</b> by reducing its weight; brush-ring design, vacuum level regulator, efficiency of the dust separator, and operational control sensors. The redesign is expected to enhance the productivity and economy of the vacuum blasting system by at least 50 % over current vacuum blasting systems. There are three phases in the project. Phase I consists of developing and testing mathematical models. Phase II consists of pre-prototype design and fabrication and pre-prototype unit testing. Phase III consists of prototype design and field verification testing. In phase I, mathematical models are developed and analyzed for the nozzle, <b>blast</b> <b>head,</b> wind curtain, and dust separator, first as individual devices and then combined as an integrated model. This allows study of respective airflow and design parameters. The Contractor shall, {{based on the results of}} the mathematical modeling studies, design experimental models of the components and test these models. In addition, the Contractor shall develop sensors to detect the relationship of the <b>blast</b> <b>head</b> to the blast surfaces and controls to minimize the dependency on an operator's skill and judgment to obtain optimum positioning, as well as real-time characterization sensors to determine as the <b>blast</b> <b>head</b> is moving the depth to which coatings must be removed, thereby improving production and minimizing waste. In phase II, the Contractor shall design and construct a pre-prototype of the nozzle, <b>blast</b> <b>head</b> with wind curtain, sensors, and dust separator and test this system to assess the performance of the new design under controlled conditions at the contractor's facility. In phase III, the Contractor shall design and construct a prototype of the High Productivity Vacuum Blasting System, based on the results of the pre-prototype design and testing performed. This unit will be a full-scale prototype and will be tested at a designated Department of Energy (DOE) facility. Based on the results, the system performance, the productivity, and the economy of the improved vacuum blasting system will be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The LTC 1073 Vacuum Blasting Machine uses a high capacity, direct {{pressure}} {{blasting system}} incorporating a continuous feed for the blast media. The blast media cleans the surface within the contained brush {{area of the}} <b>blast</b> <b>head.</b> A vacuum system removes dust and debris from the surfaces as it is blasted. After cleaning the surface, the abrasive, together with the rust or coating that {{was removed from the}} surface, is vacuumed into the machine through the suction hose. The dust separator contains angled steel collision pads, working with the force of gravity, to allow any reusable abrasive to fall back into the pressure vessel. The filters are manually back flushed to prevent clogging. After back flushing, dust is dumped from the dust chamber into the dust collection bag or drum by operation of the bellows valve. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other safety and health issues found were ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, lockout/tagout, and arm-hand vibration...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of blast related mild {{traumatic brain injury}} (mTBI) in recent military conflicts, attributed in part to an increased exposure to improvised explosive devices (IEDs), requires further understanding to develop methods to mitigate the effects of primary blast exposure. Although general blast injury has been studied extensively since the 1950 ’s, many aspects of mTBI remain unclear, including specific injury mechanisms and injury criteria. The purpose of this work was to develop finite element models to investigate primary blast injury to the head in the loading regimes relevant to mTBI, to use the models to determine {{the response of the}} brain tissue, and ultimately to investigate the effectiveness of helmets on response mitigation. Since blast is inherently a wave dominated phenomena, finite element models require relatively small elements to resolve complex pressure wave transmission and reflections in order to accurately predict tissue response. Furthermore, mesh continuity between the tissue structures is necessary to ensure accurate wave transmission. The computational limitations present in analyzing a full three dimensional <b>blast</b> <b>head</b> model {{led to the development of}} sagittal and transverse planar models, which provide a fully coupled analysis with the required mesh resolution while remaining computationally feasible. The models consist of a single layer of solid hexahedral elements, and include all of the relevant tissues in the head including the skin, muscle, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain. The sagittal and transverse models were validated using head kinematics against experimental data on Hybrid III head-forms exposed to free-field blast. The peak head accelerations of the models was in close agreement to the experimental data, and the HIC 15 predictions were in reasonable agreement. In addition, the models were validated for intracranial pressure using experimental data from cadaveric heads exposed to shock tube loading. The intracranial pressures predicted by the sagittal and transverse models was in good agreement at the frontal, temporal, and parietal locations, and in fair agreement at the occipital location. A simplified three dimensional ellipsoid study was undertaken to verify that sagittal and transverse planar models are capable of representing a three dimensional shape. This investigation confirmed that the pressures predicted by the planar models are accurate at the frontal, temporal, and parietal locations, although underpredicted at the occipital location due to three dimensional wave superposition that becomes significant at the occipital region. The sagittal and transverse models were run at three representative blast load cases, corresponding to 5 kg of C 4 at 3, 3. 5, and 4 m standoff distances, and the resulting intracranial strains and pressures were investigated. The sagittal and transverse models report peak principal strains of 0. 035 – 0. 062 and 0. 053 – 0. 087 respectively. In comparison to the available threshold values of principal strain in the literature, the strains predicted by the models are generally low. While the strains reported by the models in primary blast are small, the strain rates are significantly greater (ranging from 226 – 571 s- 1) than those seen in typical automotive or blunt impact scenarios. Furthermore, the models report that significant levels of intracranial pressure, on the order of several atmospheres, can be generated in the brain tissue during primary blast exposure. The peak pressures in the brain tissue for both models typically exceeded the existing injury thresholds for intracranial that are available in the literature. However, these existing criteria were generally developed for automotive crash scenarios, so may not be suitable for the short durations inherent to blast. The magnitudes of intracranial pressure increased significantly with increasing blast load severity, while changes in principal strain were relatively small, and peak strains were low in all three load cases, suggesting that pressure may be a more appropriate injury response metric for blast injury. The sagittal and transverse models were outfitted with various military helmet configurations and materials to investigate the influence of helmet visors, foam lining presence and density, and Kevlar material stiffness on the protective properties of the helmet. The peak head accelerations and intracranial pressures were compared for low and high intensity blast loads. In general, the presence of a helmet resulted in reduced peak head accelerations, and a greater reduction was reported with the addition of a half-visor and full-visor. The presence of a visor significantly reduced positive intracranial pressures in all cases, although increased the maximum negative pressures in some cases. The effects of the foam lining material was not as significant to the model response as the helmet visor configurations, but in general, a lower density foam provided better load mitigation. In cases where there was no foam lining, pressure wave reflections in the air gap between the helmet and head were found to cause greater intracranial pressures in adjacent brain tissue, although the magnitudes of these increased pressures were generally lower than the incident compressive pressures caused by the initial wave impact...|$|E

Disease phenotyping experiments were conducted in growth chamber, greenhouse, and field environments. Among 418 cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), those with 2 NS had 50. 4 to 72. 3 % less <b>head</b> <b>blast</b> than those without 2 NS when inoculated with an older MoT isolate under growth chamber conditions.

40|$|Blast, {{also known}} as leaf spot, caused by Pyricularia grisea [teleomorph: Magnaporthe grisea], is a serious disease {{affecting}} both forage and grain production in foxtail millet in India. For the identification of new and diverse sources of blast resistance, a foxtail millet core collection comprising 155 accessions was evaluated against Patancheru isolate (Fx 57) of M. grisea. In a field screen during 2009 and 2010, 21 accessions were identified with neck and <b>head</b> <b>blast</b> resistance against Fx 57. In a greenhouse screen, 11 of the 155 accessions exhibited seedling leaf blast resistance to the same isolate. Further evaluation of the selected 28 accessions (found resistant to neck and <b>head</b> <b>blast</b> under field conditions during 2009 and 2010, and/or leaf blast in the greenhouse screen) against four M. grisea isolates Fx 57, Fx 58, Fx 60 and Fx 62 from Patancheru, Nandyal, Vizianagaram and Mandya, respectively, led to the identification of 16 accessions with leaf, sheath, neck and <b>head</b> <b>blast</b> resistance {{to at least one}} isolate.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if the sensor technology and the decontamination technology will face problems once integrated, a feasibility study (see Appendix B) was produced in which the effect of motion on the efficiency of a radiation sensor was measured. It was found that the effect is not negligible; however, it is not catastrophic, and if the sensors are properly calibrated, this obstacle can be overcome. During the first year of this project, many important tasks have been accomplished. The search for radiation sensors provided knowledge on the technologies commercially available. This, in turn, allowed for a proper assessment of the properties, limitations, different methods of measurement, and requirements {{of a large number of}} sensors. The best possible characterization and data collection instrument and decontamination technologies were chosen using the requirement information in Appendix A. There are technical problems with installing sensors within the <b>blasting</b> <b>head,</b> such as steel shot and dust interference.

These factors are expected to be negligible and can be revisited at the time of prototype production. Factors that need to be addressed are the vibrations of the blasting unit and how to isolate the sensor array from these. In addition, an electromagnetic survey must be performed to ensure there will be no interference with the electronic component that will be integrated.
