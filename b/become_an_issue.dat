The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners {{the right to vote}} has not yet <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Apple's App Store, which {{provides}} iPhone and iPad applications, imposes censorship of content, which has <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> for book publishers and magazines seeking {{to use the}} platform.

5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E

While speaking with reporters, Davis expressed confidence in the way marriage licenses were now being issued by her office in Morehead, Kentucky. However, Davis warned that should the current situation <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> she was prepared to return to jail.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} {{shortage of}} coinage {{in all of}} the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on May 27, 1652, and begin production of coins from its silver reserves. This act solved a practical problem, but the colony had no authority to do so from the crown. Although this did not <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E

25|$|As vitamin C enhances iron absorption, iron {{overload}} may <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> {{to people}} with genetic iron overload disorders, such as haemochromatosis.

25|$|With the {{increasing}} use of plastic, human influence has <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> as many types of plastics do not biodegrade. Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to fish, seabirds, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, as well as to boats and coasts. Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste all contribute to this problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{poor quality}} of food {{provided}} to inmates has <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> as {{over the last}} decade corrections officials looking to cut costs have been outsourcing food services to private, for profit corporations such as Aramark, A'Viands Food & Services Management, and ABL Management. A prison riot in Kentucky has been blamed on the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.|$|E

Truman had initially tried to create a media blackout about the test—hoping it would not <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in the upcoming presidential election—but on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the development of the hydrogen bomb to the world as hints and speculations of it were already beginning to emerge in the press.|$|E
25|$|As {{the quality}} of health care has {{increasingly}} <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality {{is one of the}} most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission from the USA, the Trent Accreditation Scheme from Great Britain, and Haute Authorité de santé (HAS) from France.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Byrd {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives for West Virginia's 6th congressional district, {{succeeding}} E. H. Hedrick, who retired from the House to make an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for Governor. Byrd was re-elected to the House twice, serving from January 3, 1953 to January 3, 1959. Byrd defeated Republican incumbent W. Chapman Revercomb for the United States Senate in 1958. Revercomb's record supporting civil rights had <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> playing in Byrd's favor. Byrd was re-elected to the Senate eight times. He was West Virginia's junior senator for his first four terms; his colleague from 1959 to 1985 was Jennings Randolph, who had been elected on the same day as Byrd's first election in a special election to fill the seat of the late Senator Matthew Neely.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May 1916 {{a meeting}} {{took place at}} Rosyth between Jellicoe, Beatty and First Sea Lord Jackson to discuss {{the future of the}} battlecruiser fleet. Australia was out of action {{following}} a collision with New Zealand, while it was decided that the three ships of the 3rd Battle Cruiser Squadron should be sent to Scapa Flow to practice gunnery, following reports of poor gunnery for all the battlecruisers, at least partly {{due to the lack of}} a practice range at Rosyth. It was decided that the 5th Battle Squadron (BS) would be temporarily attached to the battlecruisers to make up their numbers. Although the battlecruisers used different standing orders to the Grand fleet, Beatty did not meet with Evan-Thomas, nor send him copies of their standing orders. This was to <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> later, when the ships took part as one unit in the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
25|$|Corruption: According to the 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index of {{countries}} published by Transparency International, Portugal had the 32nd {{lowest level of}} corruption out of 180 countries. In 2012 it had slumped to a three-way tie for 33rd place. (By comparison, in the same years, the United States ranked 18th and 19th). Nevertheless, corruption has <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of major political and economic significance for the Portuguese. The responsible authorities and many civic associations and think tanks are trying to combat corruption before it increases further. Many abusive lobbies and corruption schemes are related to concessions, unclear approvals to contractors and economic groups, or job creation for and commercial agreements {{with friends and family}} members, mainly involving the huge public sector and companies. Some cases are well known and were widely reported in the media, such as the affairs in several municipalities involving local town hall officials and businesspersons, {{as well as a number}} of politicians with wider responsibilities and power. Notable criminal cases include the Face Oculta, the Oeiras Municipality Mayor Isaltino Morais scandal, the Apito Dourado and the Saco Azul de Felgueiras.|$|E
