5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, {{and are still}} major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (<b>Bolivia),</b> <b>and</b> Hackett River (Canada).

5|$|Hergé's next Tintin story, The Broken Ear (1935–37), was {{the first}} for which the plot {{synopsis}} had been outlined from the start, being a detective story that took Tintin to South America. It introduced the character of General Alcazar, and also saw Hergé introduce the first fictional countries into the series, San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico, two republics based largely on <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 1879, Chilean forces entered Antofagasta to {{the welcome}} {{of most of}} the local population, {{beginning}} the War of the Pacific against <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> Peru.

5|$|The Congress was {{especially}} notable {{for bringing the}} International into much closer contact with Trotskyist groups from across the globe.

5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is found from {{southern}} Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru to the Madre de Dios region and east through extreme northwestern <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> into western Amazonian Brazil.

Korea, Liechtenstein, and Turkey returned after having missed the 1952 Winter Olympics, while Argentina, Denmark, New Zealand, and Portugal did not compete at these Games, after having participated in the previous edition. Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany, an arrangement that would continue for the following two Olympiads.|$|E
5|$|Between 2004 and 2007, ground {{inflation}} {{began in}} the volcanic field, indicating the intrusion of a sill beneath it. The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as Uturunku in <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> Yellowstone in the United States and {{has been accompanied by}} anomalies in soil gas emission and seismic activity. This pattern has created concern about the potential for impending large-scale eruptive activity.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{native to}} {{tropical}} northern and central South America.

The countries in which it is found include Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, Brazil, <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> Paraguay. The range of this species is rather larger than that of the sympatric smooth-fronted caiman, as it extends into Paraguay and includes a larger area of Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{victories}} of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, {{relations between}} <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> the U.S. improved slightly, and in November 2009 the countries entered negotiations to restore diplomatic relations. After the U.S. backed the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya by NATO forces, Morales condemned Obama, calling for his Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked. The two nations restored diplomatic relations in November 2011, although Morales refused to allow the DEA back into the country.|$|E

One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest volcano. This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such volcano to the south is Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° southern latitude.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{theories}} considered by investigators was that Flight 2511 {{was involved in a}} collision with another airliner, given the crash site's proximity to Wilmington Airport. Investigators reviewed the flight plan and other documents to determine if other aircraft were in the area. There was no record of any other aircraft, or of any military missiles having been fired. Furthermore, wreckage of Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations: the primary crash scene near <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> the secondary scene in Kure Beach. All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC-6.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{became a}} member on 18 September 1934, and was {{expelled}} on 14 December 1939 for invading Finland. In expelling the Soviet Union, the League broke its own rule: only 7 of 15 members of the Council voted for expulsion (United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, South Africa, and the Dominican Republic), short of the majority required by the Covenant. Three of these members had been made Council members {{the day before the}} vote (South Africa, <b>Bolivia,</b> <b>and</b> Egypt). This was one of the League's final acts before it practically ceased functioning due to the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in <b>Bolivia</b> <b>and</b> Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E
