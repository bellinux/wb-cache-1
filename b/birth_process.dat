In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the <b>birth</b> <b>process.</b> The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E

25|$|Brain {{trauma in}} the {{developing}} human is a common cause (over 400,000 injuries {{per year in the}} US alone, without clear information as to how many produce developmental sequellae) of neurodevelopmental syndromes. It may be subdivided into two major categories, congenital injury (including injury resulting from otherwise uncomplicated premature birth) and injury occurring in infancy or childhood. Common causes of congenital injury are asphyxia (obstruction of the trachea), hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) and the mechanical trauma of the <b>birth</b> <b>process</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|Carl Sagan (1977) and Barbara Honegger (1983) {{wrote that}} the OBE {{experience}} may {{be based on a}} rebirth fantasy or reliving of the <b>birth</b> <b>process</b> based on reports of tunnel-like passageways and a cord-like connection by some OBErs which they compared to an umbilical cord. Susan Blackmore (1978) {{came to the conclusion that}} the OBE is a hallucinatory fantasy as it has the characteristics of imaginary perceptions, perceptual distortions and fantasy-like perceptions of the self (such as having no body). Ronald Siegel (1980) also wrote that OBEs are hallucinatory fantasies.|$|E

40|$|This multi-disciplinary {{collection}} of essays from the Cambridge Socio-Legal Group {{is concerned with the}} varying circumstances, manner, timing and experiences of birth. It contains essays {{from a wide range of}} disciplines including law, medicine, anthropology, history, and sociology, examining birth from the perspectives of mother, doctor, midwife and father. Questions considered in the book include: Who has power during the <b>birthing</b> <b>process?</b> How has the experience of birth changed over time? Should birth mark a significant change in the legal status of the foetus? What is the proper role of birth registration? What role, if any, do fathers have in the <b>birthing</b> <b>process?</b> What legal rights should the woman have to refuse treatment during the <b>birthing</b> <b>process?</b> And what is the significance of changes of the age at which women give birth? This stimulating {{collection of}} papers provides new insights into one of life's most momentous moments...|$|R

2500|$|The gynaecoid pelvis is the {{so-called}} normal female pelvis. [...] Its inlet is either slightly oval, with a greater transverse diameter, or round. [...] The interior walls are straight, the subpubic arch wide, the sacrum shows an average to backward inclination, and the greater sciatic notch is well rounded. [...] Because this type is spacious and well proportioned {{there is little or}} no difficulty in the <b>birth</b> <b>process.</b> [...] Caldwell and his co-workers found gynaecoid pelves in about 50 per cent of specimens.|$|E
2500|$|A new tragic {{experience}} persuaded me {{that air}} could also carry decaying organic matter. In November {{of the same}} year, an individual was admitted with a discharging carious left knee. [...] the ichorous exhalations of the carious knee completely saturated the air of her ward. In this way the other patients were exposed and nearly all the patients in that room died. [...] The ichorous particles that saturated {{the air of the}} maternity ward penetrated the uteruses already lacerated in the <b>birth</b> <b>process.</b> The particles were resorbed, and childbed fever resulted.|$|E

2500|$|An example {{given by}} Tambiah relates to adoption: among some American Indians {{when a child}} is adopted, his or her adoptive mother will pull the child through some of her clothes, symbolically {{representing}} the <b>birth</b> <b>process</b> and thereby associating the child with herself, thereby 'becomes' hers emotionally even though their relationship is not biological. As Claude Lévi-Strauss put it the birth [...] "would consist, therefore, in making explicit a situation originally existing on the emotional level and in rendering acceptable to the mind pains which the body refuses to tolerate...the woman believes in the myth and belongs to a society which believes in it." ...|$|E

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends this practice, with minimal disruption for babies that don't require life support. [...] The baby's head must be dried immediately after birth and then the baby is placed with a hat on the mother's chest. [...] Measurements, etc. are performed after the first feeding. [...] According to the US Institute of Kangaroo Care, healthy babies should maintain skin-to-skin contact method for about 3 months so that both baby and mother are established in breastfeeding and have achieved physiological recovery from the <b>birth</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Semmelweis's key {{claim was}} that {{physicians}} contaminated their hands with [...] "cadaveric particles" [...] {{in the morgue}} while conducting autopsies. [...] He pointed out that ordinary washings with soap did not remove these particles, because the hands could retain a stench for several days in spite of such washings. [...] When physicians later carried out gynaecological examinations, the cadaveric particles were absorbed by the patient, in particular if they {{came into contact with}} the freshly exposed uterus, or with genital tract lesions caused by the <b>birth</b> <b>process.</b> [...] Semmelweis was convinced that every case of childbed fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. [...] With this etiology, Semmelweis identified childbed fever as purely an iatrogenic diseasethat is, one caused by doctors. (Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels took personal offense at this, and never forgave Semmelweis for it—Scanzoni remained one of the most ardent critics of Semmelweis.) ...|$|E
