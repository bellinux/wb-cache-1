Comparison between the experimental spectrum and the theoretical results reveals a two-dimensional (2 D) global minimum with a triangular lattice containing a tetragonal defect (I) and two low-lying 2 D isomers (II and III), each with a hexagonal vacancy. All three 2 D isomers have 16 peripheral boron atoms and 11 inner boron atoms. Isomer I is shown to be mainly responsible for the observed photoelectron spectrum with isomers II and III as minor contributors. Chemical bonding analyses of these three isomers show that they all feature 16 localized peripheral B–B σ-bonds. Additionally, isomer I possesses 16 delocalized σ bonds and nine delocalized π bonds, while isomers II and III each contain 17 delocalized σ bonds and eight delocalized π bonds.

Thermodynamic analysis of the calorimetric results demonstrated that at a constant pyrolysis temperature, adding boron makes the materials energetically less stable. While the B-containing glasses pyrolyzed at 1000 degrees C were energetically less stable than the competitive crystalline components, increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 1200 degrees C led to their enthalpic stability.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{following}} {{our work}} on the two-state outer neighbor mixed bonding model of water, it is proposed that polar groups promote {{the formation of the}} low density ice Ih-type bonding in their neighborhood, whereas nonpolar groups tend to promote the higher density ice II-type structure. In a protein, because of the large numbers of exposed polar and nonpolar groups, large changes in the neighboring water structure can occur. These changes, of course, depend on whether the protein is in its native or its unfolded state and will be shown here to have a direct impact on the thermodynamics of protein unfolding at both high and low temperatures. For example, it is known that the polar hydration entropies become rapidly more negative with increasing temperature. This very unusual behavior can be directly related to the promotion in the outer bulk liquid of the more stable Ih-type <b>bonding</b> at the <b>expense</b> of II-type <b>bonding</b> by polar groups of the protein. In contrast, nonpolar groups have an opposite effect on the thermodynamics. It is the delicate balance created by these outer hydration contributions, mixed with ordinary thermodynamic contributions from the inner hydration shell and those from hydrogen-bond and van der Waals forces within the protein molecule itself that is responsible for both heat and cold denaturation of proteins...|$|R

Since both polypeptides showed the same N-terminal amino acid sequence and Southern analyses indicate the presence of only one gene coding for cDPGS in M. fervidus, the two polypeptides originate from the same gene but differ by a not yet identified modification.

The films have ben deposited from mixtures of SiH 4, O- 2 and N- 2, using the electron cyclotron resonance-chemical vapor deposition technique, with substrate temperature ranging from room temperature (50 degrees C) to 200 degrees C. When substrate temperature is increased, a slight decrease in both Si-H and N-H bond concentration is detected. A small shift (10 - 17 cm(- 1)) in the dominant Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption peak (Si-O/Si-N stretching band) seems {{to be associated with}} a decrease in the N-H bond concentration. This behavior is attributed to the formation of Si-N <b>bonds</b> at the <b>expense</b> of N-H <b>bonds,</b> with no significant change in the film composition.

From an aging M to the limited role of the Bond Girl and the characterization of Miss Moneypenny as a defunct field agent, Skyfall develops the legacy of <b>Bond</b> at the <b>expense</b> of women. Since Casino Royale (2006) and its sequels Quantum of Solace (2008) and Skyfall constitute a reboot of the franchise, it is time to question whether there is a place for women in the new world of James Bond and what role they will play in the future of series.

This academic study constitutes the first book-length anthology on femininity and feminism in the Bond series.

These exhibit zigzag chains of Tr that link puckered sheets (I/II) or chains (III) of gold tetrahedra condensed through shared vertices. The segregation of Au and Tr components is striking relative to the evidently stronger and preferred Au−Tr bonding in neighboring gold- and alkali-metal-poorer triel phases. The close packing of K/Rb (A) about the gold tetrahedra gives each A and Au 4 component 7 − 10 and 10 neighbors of the other type, respectively. Tight-binding−linear-muffin-tin-orbital−atomic sphere approximation band structure calculations show that the title phases lie near or at electronic pseudogaps.

It is difficult to disentangle the possible meaning of this perverse recording—is it another kind of remembering? Or is it a form of malignant bonding {{between past and present}} experience? Not only there are notorious cases from the media such as Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, called The Moor murderers in the 60 s in the UK and later on the West Family. These are examples of both extra family and interfamily malignant bonding but I have also been able to corroborate these in my own clinical findings, which I have termed the concept of "the malignant bonding". This couple these two different persons, have felt, as from the moment of their first meeting, in almost automatic pilot mode, very close and united together not knowing exactly why. However, this great sense of wonder starts fading away when the union is to be in some way "contrived" or coercive from within. Now, the taboo elements is no longer present and the sense of excitement is gone. What happens next? The purusing of the transgressing has become the compelling element and as such the using and exploiting, including sexual abuse of children may start. There is an irrepressible need to continue succumbing to these transgressive actions because, just like in pornography, it makes them feel alive. They feel really dead inside themselves and their own way {{to make sure they are}} still alive is by exerting this enormous sense of power and control over their children. This power has an added element of libidinizing the interaction between the couple. This can be initiated and even stimulated not only by the man but also by the woman in the couple. We are longer talking of who is the victim of perpetrator within the couple. They have both become partners with equal participation in the designing and the execution of their actions against their own severe very early traumatic experiences...|$|R
