Keith {{receives}} {{the police report}} of Dean O’Dell’s death, but he doesn’t find anything useful in it. Keith interrogates the Lilith house girls, who admit to egging his office, but seem to have alibis for the Dean’s death. However, Keith later informs Veronica that Nish’s alibi doesn’t check out for the Dean’s car <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> likely true for Mindy’s car, putting her under suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mechanical malfunction.|$|E

In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|Lusa is a pampered {{black bear}} {{living in the}} Bear Bowl, a zoo in Canada. Despite knowing that the {{wilderness}} is harsh, Lusa has dreams about one day escaping and living outside. Her father, King, once lived in the wild and is strongly against Lusa's idea. One day, Toklo's mom is brought into the Bear Bowl. She talks with Lusa about how much she regretted abandoning her cubs, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late and that she couldn't find them. Hearing this, Lusa decides to bring a message to Toklo about how sorry his mother is. Although Lusa succeeds in escaping, she realizes {{the dangers of the}} wild.

5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E

5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E
5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{population}} of the city was massacred during the sack; Theodosios writes that among the notables alone, over 4,000 were killed. The Arab commander, Abu Ishaq, had the commanding patrikios executed a week later, while the seventy men left with him along with other prisoners were reportedly taken out of the city and beaten to death with stones and clubs. One of the defenders, Niketas of Tarsos, who during the siege had insulted Muhammad daily, was taken apart and tortured to death. Only a few Mardaites from the Peloponnese along with some soldiers of the garrison were able to escape and, reaching Greece, inform admiral Adrianos of the events. The city itself was pillaged and practically destroyed. According to Ibn al-Athir, the Arabs remained there for about two months after the sack, before returning to their base, leaving the city in ruins. Ibn al-Athir also claims that a Byzantine squadron appeared before the city, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> driven off after a battle in which the Byzantines lost four ships.|$|E

5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E
