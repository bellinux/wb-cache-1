40|$|Purpose. The {{development}} of the free-piston diesel engine-and-hydraulic pump for the continuously variable hydrostatical transmission of mobile power vehicles. Methodology. For a long time engine builders have been interesting in the problem of developing free piston engines, which have much bigger coefficient of efficiency (40 … 80 %). Such engines don’t have the conversion of reciprocating motion for inner combustion engine piston into rotating motion of crankshaft, from which the engine torque is transferred to the power machine transmission. Free-piston engines of inner combustion don’t have the crank mechanism (CM) that significantly reduces mechanical losses for friction. Such engines {{can be used as}} compressors. Free-piston engine compressor (FPEC) – is a free-piston machine in which energy received from engine’s cylinder is being transferred direct to compressor’s pistons connected with operational pistons of engine without crank mechanism. Part of the pressed air is being consumed for engine cylinder drain and the other part is going to the consumer. Findings. The use of free-piston engines-and-hydraulic pumps as power-transmission plants of power vehicles (diesel locomotives, combine harvester, tractors, cars and other mobile and stationary power installations) with the continuously variable transmissions allows cost effectiveness improvement and metal consumption reduction of these vehicles, since the cost effectiveness of FPE is higher by 25 - 30 %, and the metal consumption is lower by 40 - 50 %. Originality. One of the important advantages of the free-piston engines is their simplicity and engine balance. As a result of the crank mechanism absence their construction is much simplified and the vibrations, peculiar to the ordinary engines are eliminated. In such installation the engine pistons are directly connected through the rod to compressor pistons and therefore there are no losses in the <b>bearing</b> <b>bushes.</b> Practical value. The free-piston engines are now used only as gas generators and diesel compressors, and the hydraulic transmission is arranged with the ordinary heat-engine, which operates the hydraulic pumps...|$|E

Hybrids of Corylus avellana, C. americana and C. cornuta, are proposed {{as an alternative}} crop for the Upper Midwest. Current nitrogen (N) recommendations for European hazelnut production are based on research from Oregon {{and may not be}} applicable to hybrids in Minnesota due to differing soils, climate, genetics, and growing systems. In 2003, I initiated three years of N rate trials on three new plantings and on four young established plantings, from four to seven years old, using N rates of 0, 2. 75, 5. 5, 11, 22, 33, and 44 g N·plant- 1. I observed a strong negative linear effect on survival when new transplants were fertilized within the first year of transplanting. Survival was not affected when fertilization was postponed one year, but even then these hybrid hazelnuts responded only to low N rates relative to those recommended in Oregon. Leaf N concentrations were within the expected ranges established for European hazelnuts in Oregon, suggesting that Oregon standards may be applied to hybrid hazelnuts, except that 2. 2 % leaf N should be considered adequate, rather than a threshold to sufficiency. In another experiment conducted at two sites with young <b>bearing</b> <b>bushes,</b> I used 15 N-labeled ammonium nitrate to compare N uptake efficiency (NUE) from soil applications in mid-April, late April, late May, early August, and mid-September 2005. N uptake was slow before bud-break. N applied in the spring after bud-break was quickly translocated to plant parts with the greatest near-term demand for N: first to leaves, then to nuts and catkins. Nitrogen applied in August and September appeared in new shoots the following April, showing that N applied late in the season may be stored below ground over the winter. NUE was highest for August and September applications at one site and August and mid-April applications at the other, suggesting that summer is generally the best time to apply N for most efficient uptake. However, overall NUE was low, only 9 % for the treatment with the highest efficiency, supporting our conclusion that hybrid hazelnuts have a low demand for N during establishment and early maturity. Nitrogen requirements may, however, increase with nut production...|$|E
