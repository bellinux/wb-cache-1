40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the research work {{carried out in}} Germany and in Italy about the fatigue strength of joints between <b>bulb</b> <b>plate</b> profiles, typically applied by the shipbuilding industry. Fatigue tests of different joint configurations were carried out and several local approaches were applied. The paper focuses on the fatigue assessment approaches based on the notch stress intensity factor, which assume that fatigue is governed by the singular stress field at notch tips. Two approaches, referring to either the local strain energy density or to the peak stress value, are presented and applied. Additionally, a sensitivity investigation regarding the geometry of the weld seam of butt joints {{was performed on the}} basis of strain energy density approach. Comparisons with test data and with assessments of other common approaches offer a critical review about where the pros and the limitations of each approach are...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the fatigue {{strength}} assessment of attachments of <b>bulb</b> <b>plate</b> stiffeners (Holland profile), typical of ship structures, applying local approaches proposed by the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and in open literature. The application of these methods in the captioned cases is not always straightforward nor sometimes possible, neither effective. Difficulties in following the suggestions of IIW for the finite element (FE) modelling of relatively complex geometries are shown. Basically, the bulb itself is a three-dimensional component interacting with two-dimensional shells surrounding it: the three-dimensional versus two-dimensional mismatch is {{the main source of}} complexity. Since a reference thickness of the bulb cannot be identified, even the identification of stress points in post-processing of FE analyses is difficult, often being a cause of scatter and/or disagreement among different approaches. Comparisons among approaches and with available experimental data of tests carried out in the Ship Structures Laboratory of the University of Genova and in the Institute of Ship Structural Design and Analysis of the Hamburg University of Technology provide a general view of this topic and offer a critical review of the application of local approaches in rather challenging test cases, evaluating, as far as possible, effects of weld geometry on fatigue strength...|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, straight-forward {{statistical method}} is presented here {{to assess the}} probability of reduction of geometrical properties of aged ship structural profiles. These rolled profiles such as <b>bulb</b> <b>plate,</b> tee bar, flat bar etc. begin to shrink mainly due to corrosion wear following the breakdown of protective coatings. Geometrical properties may include the stiffener cross-sectional area {{with or without the}} attached plating, moment of inertia, section modulus etc. among many others. The first set of inputs includes the statistical data about the dimensions or scantlings of the structural profiles usually collected by the manufacturers. For example, the mean and coefficient of variation (c. o. v.) of the web height, web plate thickness etc. The second set of inputs for this analysis is the evenly distributed corrosion wear; the mean wear and the c. o. v. or standard deviation of wear. Based on certain assumptions the mean and variance of the geometrical properties may be derived statistically from these basic inputs. The outputs may be used to address the following issue. The Classification Societies set up Renewal Criteria for the stiffeners/profiles in ship hull structures when they do not meet the requirements which may be, for example, cross-sectional area falling below 90 % of the original nominal value. However, the means and variances of the geometrical properties as functions of age have many other useful applications...|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} head conformation (brachycephalic, mesaticephalic, and dolichocephalic) on olfactory bulb angle and orientation in dogs by use of in vivo MRI. Animals— 40 client-owned dogs undergoing MRI for diagnosis of conditions that did not affect skull conformation or olfactory bulb anatomy. Procedures—For each dog, 2 head conformation indices were calculated. Olfactory bulb angle and an index of olfactory bulb orientation relative {{to the rest of the}} CNS were determined by use of measurements obtained from sagittal T 2 -weighted MRI images. Results—A significant negative correlation was found between olfactory bulb angle and values of both head conformation indices. Ventral orientation of olfactory bulbs was significantly correlated with high head conformation index values (ie, brachycephalic head conformation). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Low olfactory bulb angles and ventral olfactory bulb orientations were associated with brachycephalia. Positioning of the olfactory <b>bulbs,</b> cribriform <b>plate,</b> and ethmoid turbinates was related. Indices of olfactory bulb angle and orientation may be useful for identification of dogs with extremely brachycephalic head conformations. Such information may be used by breeders to reduce the incidence or severity of brachycephalic-associated diseases...|$|R
5|$|This set of {{characters}} was identified by Le Loeuff in {{his description of}} Ampelosaurus to distinguish it from all other genera: teeth that weakly spatulate; a laterally widening distal extremity of neural spines on the dorsal vertebrae; neural arch of the dorsal vertebrae inclining strongly towards the rear; {{the lack of a}} distal expansion on the scapular blade; the presence of a light, ventral crest on top of the scapula; the presence of <b>plate,</b> <b>bulb,</b> and spine shaped osteoderms; and, in 2005, Le Loeuff added that the constriction of the neural spine on the dorsal and cervical vertebrae was also probably a characteristic of Ampelosaurus.|$|R

40|$|Embellisia allii {{results in}} the {{formation}} of a bulb canker and black soot on the surface of different alliums and it has been frequently detected on garlic bulbs together with the spoilage fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, which causes <b>bulb</b> basal <b>plate</b> rot. In this study, the influence of water activity (aw) and temperature on mycelial growth of E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae, conidial size and sporulation of E. allii, interactions between E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae, Index of Dominance (ID), and in situ virulence on garlic were examined. Mycelial growth of E. allii was optimal (5. 97 mm/day) at 0. 995 aw and 25 °C, slower at 30 °C. However, almost no growth occurred at 0. 937 aw/ 30 °C. F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae grew faster than E. allii, (6. 3 – 7. 4 mm/day) at 30 °C. Interactions between E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae were influenced by aw and temperature. Sporulation of E. allii was more abundant on PDA than on MEA, especially at high aw (0. 995) and low temperature (20 °C), but almost no sporulation occurred at 30 °C regardless of nutritional medium or aw level. The spore length of E. allii was longer on PDA than MEA, and was significantly influenced by water availability. F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae was competitive against E. allii and had a higher ID value in comparison with E. allii especially at a higher temperature (30 °C). In situ virulence tests showed that E. allii was weakly virulent on the garlic bulb cloves while that of F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae was highly dependent on aw...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{parenchyma}} of {{the brain}} does not contain lymphatics. Consequently, it has been assumed that arachnoid projections into the cranial venous system are responsible for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. However, recent quantitative and qualitative evidence in sheep suggest that nasal lymphatics have the major role in CSF transport. Nonetheless, the applicability of this concept to other species, especially to humans has never been clarified. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the CSF and nasal lymph associations in human and non-human primates with those observed in other mammalian species. Methods Studies were performed in sheep, pigs, rabbits, rats, mice, monkeys and humans. Immediately after sacrifice (or up to 7 hours after death in humans), yellow Microfil was injected into the CSF compartment. The heads were cut in a sagittal plane. Results In the seven species examined, Microfil was observed primarily in the subarachnoid space around the olfactory <b>bulbs</b> and cribriform <b>plate.</b> The contrast agent followed the olfactory nerves and entered extensive lymphatic networks in the submucosa associated with the olfactory and respiratory epithelium. This is the first direct evidence of the association between the CSF and nasal lymph compartments in humans. Conclusions The fact that the pattern of Microfil distribution was similar in all species tested, suggested that CSF absorption into nasal lymphatics is a characteristic feature of all mammals including humans. It is tempting to speculate that some disorders of the CSF system (hydrocephalus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension for example) may relate either directly or indirectly to a lymphatic CSF absorption deficit. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Roth's first {{commercial}} job was helping a friend print a yellow shirt with green ink that said “Fed on Zinke’s Corn.” Roth {{went on to}} print thousands of shirts with homemade equipment, primarily the designs of his friend Ken Brown. His first popular print were caricatures by Brown. One was called [...] "Ike and Tina" [...] but it was Eisenhower and Tina Turner and another was [...] "Steve and Idi" [...] Steve Lawrence and not Edie Gorme, but rather Idi Amin. He hand stretched screens, made an exposure unit from a light <b>bulb</b> and pie <b>plate,</b> and printed by eye {{without the benefit of}} even a handpress. He eventually went to work at the Somerville Media Action Project (SMAP), a youth program that also did simple screenprinting. Roth went on to work with Mel King as Project Manager of the Youth Entrepreneurial Development Project (YEDP). At night he would still print shirts on the simple equipment at SMAP. Eventually he left YEDP and when SMAP closed its doors they eventually sold him its screen printing equipment. Upon buying the equipment, Roth formed the company Mirror Image with one employee. When it grew to three workers the workers, with encouragement from Roth, signed a contract with the United Auto Workers and remain unionized to this day. The name of the company Mirror Image was actually chosen by the first employee. After 11 months their landlord sold the building they occupied in Somerville, MA and they moved to an old steel warehouse in Cambridge.|$|R
