5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The <b>brickwork</b> was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative <b>brickwork</b> and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the <b>brickwork</b> at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E

50|$|During this period, <b>Brickworks</b> Limited gained {{full control}} of Austral Bricks, {{becoming}} one of the largest brick manufacturing companies in Australia. Towards the end of the decade, <b>Brickworks</b> purchased Rochedale <b>Brickworks</b> for only 29 500 pounds, allowing the company to enter the Queensland market. In 1959, <b>Brickworks</b> acquired large numbers of land and property to ensure the company had an abundance of raw materials and supply of resources for brick manufacturing.|$|R
5|$|Caversham Baptist {{church is}} located at the corner of South Road and Surrey Street, close to Caversham School. Unusual among Dunedin buildings, this church has a formal Classical style, with its <b>brickwork</b> {{augmented}} by pediments and square columns. The foundation stone for the building was laid in 1906. The former Baptist Church, in Playfair Street, is now used as a Gospel Hall.|$|E
5|$|Greek-style homes {{gave way}} to Gothic Revival in the 1830s, which {{emphasized}} pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas, verandas, ornamental <b>brickwork,</b> or corner quoins. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.|$|E

5000|$|A {{second major}} <b>brickworks</b> {{was set up}} at Beenup, north of Cardup, in 1913. This {{industry}} was a State Government initiative aimed at reducing the cost of worker housing. Like the <b>brickworks</b> operating at Cardup and Armadale, this one also exploited the shale deposits of the escarpment to produce high quality pressed brick and used the railway to transport the finished product to customers. The State <b>Brickworks</b> at Byford closed down in 1964, {{due in part to}} its operations being eclipsed by a new <b>brickworks</b> in Armadale. [...] The Cardup <b>brickworks</b> closed in 2012, but much of the infrastructure is still extant.|$|R
50|$|Porth Wen <b>brickworks</b> was {{designated}} as a scheduled monument by Cadw in 1986 and classified as a post-medieval industrial <b>brickworks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Newton Longville <b>Brickworks</b> {{were located}} on land between Bletchley, Buckinghamshire and Newton Longville, Buckinghamshire and were {{made up of}} two sites - Jubilee <b>Brickworks</b> and Bletchley Works. Brickmaking started onsite circa 1890's and has now ceased. The <b>Brickworks</b> has {{subsequently}} been demolished, {{and is in the}} process of being redeveloped as Newton Leys, a mixed use development including new homes, a school, employment and leisure uses. Nothing remains of the original <b>brickworks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The church's {{community}} building, a non-contributing structure {{within the}} historic boundary, is {{southwest of the}} church. The building is a venue for Sunday school classes and community gatherings. The front gable building, completed in 1961, is sheathed in <b>brickwork.</b> Similar to the church, the building is built into a gently sloping bank with its one-story elevation at grade facing west toward WV 259. Its two-story eastern elevation is {{at the foot of}} the hillside.|$|E
5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the <b>brickwork</b> and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{building in}} Sale is Eyebrow Cottage. Built around 1670, {{it was originally}} a yeoman farmhouse {{and is one of}} the earliest brick buildings in the area.

5|$|Thornham Marsh, {{immediately}} west of Titchwell, {{was used}} between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range. Some <b>brickwork</b> on Titchwell Marsh {{is all that}} remains of a military hospital dating from that period. A First World War concrete building along the west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} {{the fabric of the}} College of Arms. Although it had survived the Blitz, structural problems with the roof and <b>brickwork</b> forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley {{was unable to}} pay for the upkeep of the castle and, {{concerned}} about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the <b>brickwork,</b> re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E
50|$|A <b>brickworks</b> was {{established}} in 1870, producing bricks, tiles, and pipes, from the high grade Portarlington clay, for local use, and was soon exporting to Geelong and Melbourne. When the flour mill closed down in 1874, the <b>brickworks</b> moved into the building. The <b>brickworks</b> seems to have ceased production during the depression in the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Originally Hobsonville {{was mainly}} an {{agricultural}} and horticultural area. During {{the early history}} of Auckland, large clay- and <b>brickworks</b> operated in the area such as in Limeburners Bay and at the Clark's <b>Brickworks.</b> The <b>brickworks</b> clay piping production was used to reticulate much of the new Auckland city centre, bringing in much of Clark's wealth.|$|R

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1932, {{but due to}} a {{shortage}} of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later. The design featured façades of load-bearing <b>brickwork</b> faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the station's twin towers, {{which had}} been Grade II listed in 1972, were {{restored}} in a project costing £242,000 (now £). The works revealed that the east tower still contained a large water tank which was used during the days of steam traction to replenish locomotives and to power the station's hydraulic systems. The <b>brickwork</b> was repaired, cleaned and repointed, and the weather vanes gilded to complement the dome of nearby St Paul's Cathedral. This work {{was one of the}} Railway Heritage Trust's first projects and coincided with an exhibition held in the station in August of the same year to mark its 150th anniversary.|$|E
