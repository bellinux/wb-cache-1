Many of Grainger and Miller's lines had <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gauge of 4ft6in; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) had been at 4ft6½in (1,384mm) and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, authorised in 1836, was to be 5ft6in (1,676mm). Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the gauge, but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the gauge of the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard gauge, 4ft8½in (1,435mm).|$|E

Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006. The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual, in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of the film was unprecedented and cinemas played the film for longer runs than usual, often to packed houses, while some arranged additional screenings to meet demand. The film {{is thought to have}} achieved attendance figures of twenty million in its first six weeks of release. The film also attracted more middle-class audiences, some of whom had never <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cinema before. William Jury, as the film's booking director, initially charged exhibitors £40, with the fee decreasing by £5 a week; after two months, a reduced fee of £6 for three nights put the film within the price range of village halls wishing to show the film. By October 1916, the film had been booked by more than two thousand cinemas in Britain, earning over £30,000.|$|E
25|$|Among LGBT-identifying individuals, {{transgender}} individuals face especially significant {{barriers to}} treatment. Many countries {{still do not}} have legal recognition of transgender or non-binary gender individuals leading to placement in mis-gendered hospital wards and medical discrimination. Seventeen European states mandate sterilization of individuals who seek recognition of a gender identity that diverges from their birth gender. In addition {{to many of the}} same barriers {{as the rest of the}} LGBT community, a WHO bulletin points out that globally, transgender individuals often also face a higher disease burden. A 2010 survey of transgender and gender-variant people in the United States revealed that transgender individuals faced a significant level of discrimination. The survey indicated that 19% of individuals experienced a healthcare worker refusing care because of their gender, 28% faced harassment from a healthcare worker, 2% encountered violence, and 50% saw a doctor who was not able or qualified to provide transgender-sensitive care. In Kuwait, there have been reports of transgender individuals being reported to legal authorities by medical professionals, preventing safe access to care. An updated version of the U.S. survey from 2015 showed little change in terms of healthcare experiences for transgender and gender variant individuals. The updated survey revealed that 23% of individuals reported not seeking necessary medical care out of fear of discrimination, and 33% of individuals who had <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> doctor within a year of taking the survey reported negative encounters with medical professionals related to their transgender status.|$|E
