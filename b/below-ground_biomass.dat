50|$|Forest soils {{constitute}} a large pool of carbon. Anthropogenic {{activities such as}} deforestation cause releases of carbon from this pool, which may significantly increase the concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries must estimate and report GHG emissions and removals, including changes in carbon stocks in all five pools (above- and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass,</b> dead wood, litter, and soil carbon) and associated emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry activities, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's good practice guidance. Tropical deforestation represents nearly 25 percent of total anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide. Deforestation, forest degradation, and changes in land management practices can cause releases of carbon from soil to the atmosphere. For these reasons, reliable estimates of soil organic carbon stock and stock changes are needed for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and GHG reporting under the UNFCCC.|$|E
50|$|After {{extensive}} research, Aphalara itadori {{has been}} shown to defoliate knotweed species substantially. The psyllid individuals feed on the knotweed's meristem. As a result of this feeding the leaves are left twisted and bound together. The deformity caused by Aphalara itadori feeding reduces the photosynthetic rate, competitive ability, growth, and total leaf area. They deplete the energy supply of knotweed reducing the growth and root storage. This damage prevents the knotweed from growing back. Studies have indicated that A.itadori release would result in extensive Fallopia spp. defoliation on above and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass.</b> Grevstad et al., 2013, showed more than a 50% reduction in biomass after 50 days on F. sachalinensis and F. x bohemica. However, A release would not be entirely risk free. Some individuals of A. itadori displayed characteristics of an ability to adapt and grow on non-target plants. However, the fitness level of these individuals was near zero and may result in behavioral avoidance instead. Knotweed poses a much larger risk to environments than the potential threats of Aphalara itadori and should not rule out the potential benefits the psyllid has shown to have on reducing knotweed biomass, and the overall success of invasions.|$|E

5000|$|Historically {{the ocean}} and {{terrestrial}} forest ecosystems have been the major natural carbon (C) sinks. New research {{on the role of}} vegetated coastal ecosystems have highlighted their potential as highly efficient C sinks, and led to the scientific recognition of the term [...] "Blue Carbon". [...] "Blue Carbon" [...] designates carbon that is fixed via ocean and coastal ecosystems, rather than traditional land ecosystems, like forests. Although the ocean’s vegetated habitats cover less than 0.5% of the seabed, they are responsible for more than 50%, and potentially up to 70%, of all carbon storage in ocean sediments. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses make up the majority of the ocean’s vegetated habitats but only equal 0.05% of the plant biomass on land. Despite their small footprint, they can store a comparable amount of carbon per year and are highly efficient carbon sinks. Seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes can capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by sequestering the C in their underlying sediments, in underground and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass,</b> and in dead biomass. In plant biomass such as leaves, stems, branches or roots, blue carbon can be sequestered for years to decades, and for thousands to millions of years in underlying plant sediments. Current estimates of long-term blue carbon C burial capacity are variable, and research is ongoing. Although vegetated coastal ecosystems cover less area and have less aboveground biomass than terrestrial plants they have the potential to impact longterm C sequestration, particularly in sediment sinks. One of the main concerns with Blue Carbon is the rate of loss of these important marine ecosystems is much higher than any other ecosystem on the planet, even compared to rainforests. Current estimates suggest a loss of 2-7% per year, which is not only lost carbon sequestration, but also lost habitat that is important for managing climate, coastal protection, and health.|$|E

Niklas has received numerous awards, including awards for teaching (e.g., he received the SUNY Chancellor's Award for teaching in 1995). He {{is a member of the}} Botanical Society of America and served as its President (2008 - 2009) and Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Botany (1995 - 2004).Niklas was the first botanist to tabulate the temporal distributions of plant species in the fossil record to quantify land plant diversification patterns throughout the Phanerozoic, and he was among the first to use factor analysis to identify major floristic changes and turnover patterns in the fossil record. Niklas is also the only person to construct a computer generated morphospace for early land plants to quantify how each simulated plant intercepts sunlight, copes with mechanical forces, conducts fluids, and sheds reproductive propagules. Using a search algorithm, he was able to simulate patterns of morphological change that mimicked in all respects patterns observed in the fossil record. Another facet of his work was the use of fluid mechanics to understand how wind pollinated plants trap airborne pollen grains. Niklas’ more recent work has continued to focus on using physics, chemistry, and mathematics to quantify how physical factors dictate the spatial and temporal distributions of extant plants. His books on biomechanics and plant allometry have stimulated a renaissance in the use of engineering and scaling principles to understand diverse phenomena, ranging from the relationship between plant growth rates and body mass and the effects of wind on the mechanical stability of trees to the distributions of above- and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> in forested communities.

Location Northern China, in diverse grassland types spanning temperate grasslands in arid and semi-arid regions to alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. Methods We investigated above-ground and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> in China's grasslands by conducting five consecutive sampling campaigns across {{the northern part of}} the country during 2001 - 05. We then documented the root : shoot ratio (R/S) and its relationship with climatic factors for China's grasslands. We further explored relationships between above-ground and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> across different grassland types. Results Our results indicated that the overall R/S of China's grasslands was larger than the global average (6. 3 vs. 3. 7). The R/S for China's grasslands did not show any significant trend with either mean annual temperature or mean annual precipitation. Above-ground biomass was nearly proportional to <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> with a scaling exponent (the slope of log-log linear relationship between above-ground and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass)</b> of 1. 02 across various grassland types. The slope did not differ significantly between temperate and alpine grasslands or between steppe and meadow. Main conclusions Our findings support the isometric theory of above-ground and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> partitioning, and suggest that above-ground biomass scales isometrically with <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> at the community level...|$|E
40|$|Aims Recent {{studies have}} {{recognized}} the alpine grasslands on the Qing-hai–Tibetan plateau as a significant sink for atmospheric CO 2. The carbon-sink strength may differ among grassland ecosystems at var-ious altitudes because of contrasting biotic and physical environ-ments. This study aims (i) to clarify the altitudinal pattern of ecosystem CO 2 fluxes, including gross primary production (GPP), daytime ecosystem respiration (Redaytime) and net ecosystem produc-tion (NEP), during the period with peak above-ground biomass; and (ii) to elucidate the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the altitudinal variation of ecosystem CO 2 fluxes. Methods Ecosystem CO 2 fluxes and abiotic and biotic environmental factors were measured in an alpine grassland at four altitudes from 3600 to 4200 m along a slope of the Qilian Mountains on the northwestern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau {{during the growing season}} of 2007.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{small-scale}} fragmentation on the above-ground plant biomass was examined in nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands {{in the northern}} Swiss Jura mountains in three successive years. In the same field experiment, the fragmentation effect on the <b>below-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> was evaluated in I year. Additionally, species richness and abundance of plants were recorded. The experimental set-up consisted of 12 blocks with 48 fragments (24 small, 12 medium and 12 large) and 48 corresponding control plots distributed over three study sites. Fragmentation was maintained by frequently mowing the area between the fragments. Three to 5 years after {{the beginning of the}} experiment, plant biomass was harvested in all fragments and control plots in late autumn every year. In general, fragments contained more above- and <b>below-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> than control plots. The increase in above-ground plant biomass was partly due to an increased density of plants, and partly due to a change in species composition in fragments. In particular, a competitive shift of dominance towards tall grasses and forbs at the expense of smaller forbs was observed. Beside the main fragmentation effect on above-ground plant biomass, interactive effects with year of investigation, study site and plot size were found. This indicates that the observed fragmentation effect is a combined result of various factors acting to a different extent at different sites and plot sizes. The fragmentation-related increase in plant productivity could affect higher trophic levels such as herbivore and predator communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

During the eleven weeks of the experiment, we recorded the survival, growth and dry biomass of both seedlings and juveniles. Every week, we removed a group of ten seedlings and ten juveniles from submerged conditions {{and put them in}} drained conditions. We measured the leaf production rate and variation in total leaf area of both seedlings and juveniles. We measured the final above and <b>below-ground</b> dry <b>biomass</b> for both seedlings and juveniles. The seedlings started to die from week- 2, while juveniles started to die from week- 7. Fifty percent of seedlings died over a six weeks period, while fifty percent of juveniles died over a ten-week period. Beyond seven weeks and nine weeks for seedlings and juveniles respectively, total submersion stopped growth, and delayed leaf production and the increase of the total leaf area. Above-ground dry biomass significantly decreased from 30 g to 10 g for seedlings and from 30 g to 25 g for juveniles, according to flood duration. <b>Below-ground</b> dry <b>biomass</b> percentage increased from 60 % to 80 % between week- 4 and week- 7 for seedlings. <b>Below-ground</b> dry <b>biomass</b> of juveniles decreased from 80 % to 50 % between week- 4 and week- 9. Our study showed that flood-prone plant species have a different response to flood conditions according to the developmental stage. The higher sensitivity to submersion of seedlings is due to its lower survivorship, lower leaf production, lower growth and more important dry biomass decrease than juveniles. This statement {{can be seen as a}} threat for population viability in the long term since human activities, such as construction of heavy industrial infrastructures and roads, induces too long flood duration that would compromise the persistence of L. girardianum populations...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims The {{latitudinal}} {{differences in}} the growth characteristics of Typha are largely unknown, although {{a number of studies}} have pointed out the effects of climate on the growth and productivity of Typha. Therefore, a dynamic growth model was developed for Typha to examine the effects of latitudinal changes in temperature and radiation on partitioning of the total biomass during the growing season into rhizomes, roots, flowering and vegetative shoots, and inflorescences. Methods After validating the model with data from growth studies of Typha found in past literature, it was used to investigate the dynamics of above- and below-ground biomasses at three latitudes: 30, 40 and 50. Key Results Regardless of the initial rhizome biomass, both above- and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> values converged to a latitude-specific equilibrium produced by the balance between the total production and respiration and mortality losses. Above-ground biomass was high from 10 to 35 latitude with sufficient radiation, despite high metabolic losses; however, it decreased markedly at higher latitudes due to a low photosynthetic rate. <b>Below-ground</b> <b>biomass,</b> on the other hand, increased with latitude up to 40 due to decreasing metabolic losses, and then markedly decreased at higher latitudes. Above-ground biomass was enhanced with an increasing number of cohorts regardless of latitude.

The biomass of S. senanensis in the canopy-gap area was twice that at the closed-canopy area. It equated to 12 % of total biomass above ground but 41 % below ground in the stand. The concentrations of NO 3 − and NH 4 + in the soil solution and soil respiration rates did not significantly change between cut and control plots, indicating that gap creation {{did not affect the}} C or N dynamics in the soil. Root-length density and PAI of S. senanensis were significantly greater at the cut plots, suggesting the promotion of S. senanensis growth following tree cutting. The levels of soil temperature and soil moisture were not changed following tree cutting. These results show that S. senanensis is a key component species in this cool-temperate forest ecosystem and plays significant roles in mitigating the loss of N and C from the soil following tree cutting by increasing its leaf and root biomass and stabilizing the soil environment...|$|R
40|$|We tested how the {{conditions}} resulting from alternative management strategies addressed to mitigate abiotic and biotic limitations to plant establishment affect {{the performance of}} planted Quercus coccifera seedlings. This species is a xerophytic and heliophillous Mediterranean shrub, of interest {{for the restoration of}} abandoned farmland. We hypothesised that release from herb competition by clipping would allow Q. coccifera seedlings to cope more efficiently with water shortage by adjusting their mass allocation pattern. We established three environments of herb competition: absence of competition (AC), reduced competition by clipping (RC), and total competition (TC); and applied two irrigation treatments: low and high irrigation. We measured soil moisture at different depths, above- and <b>below-ground</b> herb <b>biomass,</b> and evaluated seedling responses, such as mortality, growth, biomass allocation, and morphological and physiological features. The TC treatment reduced water availability more than the RC treatment, in agreement with the highest water stress of seedlings under TC conditions. Irrigation increased above- and <b>below-ground</b> herb <b>biomass,</b> whereas clipping reduced herb production. Release of herb competition by clipping increased seedling survivorship by one order of magnitude and resulted in a growth rate comparable to the absence of competition. This growth was mostly related to carbon gain allocated to roots. The competition intensity imposed by treatments was related to a parallel reduction in total plant leaf area, biomass allocated to leaves and shoot:root ratio, and an increase in biomass allocated to roots and leaf mass area. The negative effects of herbs on Q. coccifera seedlings seem the result of competition for both water and light, in contrast with previous research with more mesic Quercus species, for which competition is primarily for water. Clipping of herbs is a feasible technique that greatly improved seedling performance, and thus a valuable alternative to herbicide application, common in native plantations aimed at restoring Mediterranean farmland...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{water is}} one of the {{critical}} limiting factors in achieving sustainable revegetation. Soil infiltration capacity plays a vital role in determining the inputs from precipitation and enhancing water storage, which are important for the maintenance and survival of vegetation patches in arid and semi-arid areas. Our study investigated the effects of different artificial grasslands on soil physical properties and soil infiltration capacity. The artificial grasslands were Medicago sativa, Astragalus adsurgens, Agropyron mongolicum, Lespedeza davurica, Bromus inermis, Hedysarum scoparium, A. mongolicum + Artemisia desertorum, A. adsurgens + A. desertorum and M. sativa + B. inermis. The soil infiltration capacity index (SICI), which was based on the average infiltration rate of stage I (AIRSI) and the average infiltration rate of stage III (AIRS III), was higher (indicating that the infiltration capacity was greater) under the artificial grasslands than that of the bare soil. The SICI of the A. adsurgens + A. desertorum grassland had the highest value (1. 48) and bare soil (0. 59) had the lowest value. It was evident that artificial grassland could improve soil infiltration capacity. We also used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine that the main factors that affected SICI were the soil water content at a depth of 20 cm (SWC 20), the <b>below-ground</b> root <b>biomasses</b> at depths of 10 and 30 cm (BGB 10, BGB 30), the capillary porosity at a depth of 10 cm (CP 10) and the noncapillary porosity at a depth of 20 cm (NCP 20). Our study suggests that the use of Legume-poaceae mixtures and Legume-shrub mixtures to create grasslands provided an effective ecological restoration approach to improve soil infiltration properties due to their greater root biomasses.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of N 2 -fixing white clover (Trifolium repens) in grassland is a management measure that {{may contribute to}} sustainable grassland systems by making them less dependent on inorganic fertilizers. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of this measure on soil biota and ecosystem services. We investigated earthworms, nematodes, bacteria and fungi in an experiment in which white clover-only and a mixture of grass and white clover without fertilization were compared with grass-only with and without fertilization. In comparison with grass-only, white clover-only had a lower total root biomass and a lower C/N-ratio in the above- and <b>below-ground</b> plant <b>biomass.</b> These plant characteristics resulted in a lower bacterial biomass, a lower fungal biomass, a higher proportion of bacterivorous nematode dauerlarvae, a lesser proportion of herbivorous nematodes and a greater abundance of earthworms in clover-only. The quantity and quality (C/N-ratio) of the above- and <b>below-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> in the mixture of grass and white clover (20 – 30 % clover in the DM) was comparable with grass fertilized with 150 kg N ha- 1 of inorganic fertilizer. Differences between these treatments might show specific clover effects in the grass–clover mixture on soil biota other than quantity and C/N-ratio of the litter. However, the only differences were a higher proportion of bacterivorous nematode dauerlarvae and a different nematode community composition in grass–clover. The soil structure in white clover-only showed a higher proportion of angular blocky elements, a lower penetration resistance, a higher number of earthworm burrows, a higher potential N-mineralization and respiration than the soil in grass-only. This suggests that clover stimulates the ecosystem services of water infiltration and supply of nutrients, but is less conducive to soil structure maintenance. The grass–clover mixture differed from grass-only in a higher respiration and from clover-only in a higher percentage of soil crumbs. We suggest that when clover is introduced in grassland to reduce the reliance on inorganic fertilizer, the mixture of grass and clover maintains the positive impact of grass roots on soil structure and increases the supply of nutrients via the soil food web.

Re- sults of the four-year experiment suggest that dry mass of below-ground plant parts was aﬀected signiﬁcantly by treatments and time. A lower amount of pre- cipitation resulted in a decrease of the dry mass of below-ground plant parts. A de- creasing tendency {{in the amount of}} below-ground plant matter was recorded af- ter reduction of precipitation during four years. The greatest diﬀerences between treatments (statistically signiﬁcant) were found in the third year (2008) when 1571 and only 1 172 g. m− 2 of total below-ground dry mass was respectively accumulated in wet and dry treatments. Thus our results indicate that the reduced amount of rainfall can result in the lower accumulation of <b>below-ground</b> plant <b>biomass</b> in some mountain meadows...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{the range}} of biomass apportioned to below-ground {{components}} by year 5 was 23 – 41 %, not dissimilar to that of 12 early colonising indigenous species at the same age with a <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> of between 24 and 44 % (Marden et al. 2005) or for 3 -year-old Eucalyptus fastigata (33 %), Sequoia sempervirons (29 %), Acacia melanoxylon (37 %) and Pinus radiata (36 %) trialled at the same site (Phillips et al. 2015). Although the <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> of each of five different 5 -year-old clones of Pinus radiata (~[*] 22 %) established on steep hill country (Marden et al. 2016) is {{at the lower end}} of this range, it is nonetheless consistent with that established for similar-aged pines planted at a range of sites in New Zealand (Watson and Tombleson 2002, 2004) and likely reflects harsher site and edaphic and climatic factors.|$|E
30|$|Tree {{allometric}} equations {{are critical}} tools for determining tree volume, biomass and carbon stocks. However, {{there is a}} lack of species-specific biomass equations for juvenile trees of many of New Zealand’s indigenous species. The aim of this study was to provide allometric equations for total above- and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> and total root biomass and length for eight common evergreen conifer and broadleaved species.|$|E
40|$|The biomass of Pinus radiata (D. Don) {{root and}} shoot systems was {{measured}} {{in a number of}} studies to determine the effect of stand age and environmental factors on the root/shoot ratio. These and other published studies were carefully assessed to determine firstly those which provide unbiased data for estimating <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> from shoot data and, secondly, the precision of the root/shoot ratios. Because previous studies were designed for a number of different purposes they were assessed in relation to the methodological requirements that we considered had to be met in order to provide accurate root/shoot biomass information. New data from an effluent irrigation trial at Whakarewarewa Forest near Rotorua, designed {{to assess the impact of}} water and nutrient additions on tree growth at stand age 5 years, showed that both the above- and <b>below-ground</b> <b>biomass</b> approximately doubled relative to untreated controls. Consequently, the root/shoot ratio was not significantly affected by effluent type o...|$|E
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol {{requires}} separate {{reporting of}} carbon (C) stock changes associated with land-use change (Article 3. 3) and forest management (Article 3. 4). National C accounting systems must therefore provide {{the capability to}} identify lands subject to different accounting rules and to track C stock changes on these lands. A spatially explicit approach to forest C accounting provides a framework for integration of spatial data and modelling tools so that the accounting requirements of the Kyoto Protocol can be met. A spatially explicit approach was tested on a 1. 4 million-ha landscape in Canada using a spatially explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS 3). CBM-CFS 3 estimates C stocks and stock changes in above- and <b>below-ground</b> living <b>biomass,</b> dead wood, litter, and soil organic matter. The spatially explicit modeling approach used in the CBM-CFS 3 enables detailed mapping of lands that {{are subject to the}} accounting rules in Article 3. 3 and Article 3. 4. Carbon stock changes can be estimated following Approach 3 for representing land areas (spatially explicit observations), as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in th...|$|R
40|$|Plantations are {{important}} REDD+strategies for increasing carbon sequestration while enhancing local livelihoods. Reforestation along roads and highways under participatory forest management in southwestern Bangladesh {{could contribute to}} REDD+. This study assessed the diversity and structure of roadside plantations {{in order to develop}} a basal area based generalized allometric model for estimating above- and <b>below-ground</b> tree <b>biomass</b> carbon in Southwestern Bangladesh. All woody plants with d. b. h. ⩾ 2 cm were identified and their diameters measured in 108 systematically selected zigzag plots of equal size (2 × 10 m). A total of 36 species in 17 families were recorded. Leguminosae accounted for 28 % of species and 94 % of the total estimated biomass carbon. We estimated a mean stem density of 4528 ha− 1, basal area of 52. 6 m 2 ha− 1 and biomass carbon of 192. 80  Mg ha− 1. Samanea saman, Dalbergia sissoo, Acacia nilotica, and Leucaena leucocephala accounted for most density, basal area, and carbon. We developed and validated three allometric models with equal strength (R 2 0. 94 – 0. 98) using generalized linear regression. Roadside plantations in Bangladesh can now surely participate in the UNFCCC’s carbon mitigation and adaptation mechanism, but challenges to their long-term sustainability must be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Globally, many {{terrestrial}} {{ecosystems are}} experiencing a rapid loss of biodiversity. Continued improvements {{in our understanding}} of interrelationships between plant diversity and soil microbes are critical to address the concern over the consequences of the decline in biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and services. By removing forbs, or grasses, or, to an extreme scenario, both forbs and grasses in a steppe vegetation in Inner Mongolia, we studied how plant functional group (PFG) loss affects soil microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and litter decomposition using a litter-bag method. PFG loss significantly decreased above- and <b>below-ground</b> plant <b>biomass,</b> soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN), but had no effect on the ratio of SMBC to SMBN. Although the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs remained unaffected, PFG loss significantly reduced the amount of bacterial, fungal, and total PLFAs. PFG loss decreased litter monthly mass loss and decay constant, and such decrease was significant when both forbs and grasses were removed. Our results provide robust evidence that PFG loss in grassland ecosystem can lead to a rapid response of soil microbial activity which may affect litter decomposition and soil nutrient cycling, suggesting that the assessment of plant–microbe interactions in soils is an integral component of ecosystem response to biodiversity loss...|$|R
