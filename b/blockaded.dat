5|$|The JNA 5th Military District command {{instructed}} OG-1 {{to relieve}} <b>blockaded</b> JNA garrisons in the Karlovac and Zagreb areas. During {{the first stage}} of the advance, OG-1 intended to reach the Kupa River via Turanj (breaking through the ZNG positions) while the second stage relieved JNA garrisons <b>blockaded</b> in Karlovac. On 2 November OG-1 began artillery bombardment in the Karlovac area, forcing the 2nd Battalion of the 110th Infantry Brigade to abandon its positions in Turanj the following day. The abandoned defences were occupied by elements of the brigade's 1st Battalion.|$|E

While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly <b>blockaded</b> and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September, the ZNG and the Croatian police <b>blockaded</b> and cut {{utilities}} to all JNA facilities located in Croatian-controlled territory, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. The move <b>blockaded</b> 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts, weapons and ammunition storage depots. The blockade forced the JNA to amend its planned campaign in Croatia {{to accommodate the}} new development. The same day, a coastal artillery battery on the Žirje Island was captured by Croatian forces, after JNA Senior Sergeant Željko Baltić, battery commanding officer, switched his allegiance. The battery consisted of twelve Ansaldo 90/53 guns which were once armament of the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Battalion of the ZNG's 110th Infantry Brigade <b>{{blockade}}d</b> {{the barracks}} on 19 September {{to contain the}} JNA and prevent the removal of weapons. The blockade was poorly organised, allowing a pair of tanks to leave the barracks and raid a nearby settlement two days later; however, according to Croatian sources one tank was destroyed during the raid. To relieve <b>blockaded</b> garrisons in the Karlovac area the JNA redeployed the 169th Motorised Brigade from Loznica and three detachments of the TO from Vojnić, assigning them to Operational Group 1 (OG-1). OG-1 attacked Croatian defences on 4 October, reaching the east bank of the Korana River on 8 October. The 169th Motorised Brigade collapsed due to inadequate manpower, {{and was replaced by}} the 9th Motorised Brigade (brought in from Serbia) on 15 October.|$|E

40|$|Rats were {{injected}} intravenously {{with various}} particulate materials {{with and without}} the addition of various stabilizing agents. One hour after the injection of the <b>blockading</b> colloid, a tracer dose of similar or different colloidal material was injected. A half-time clearance rate of the tracer dose greater than 4 minutes was taken as evidence of <b>blockade</b> of the RES. <b>Blockade</b> of the tracer dose occurred when the surface properties of the particles in both <b>blockading</b> and tracer doses were identical. Different particles stabilized by the same agent behaved as identical particles and identical particles stabilized by different agents behaved as different particles. The opsonization of a tracer dose of gelatin-stabilized colloid in vitro by a specific globulin fraction obtained from heterologous and homologous plasma prevented its <b>blockade,</b> while opsonization of both <b>blockading</b> and tracer doses with the same proteins resulted in <b>blockade.</b> However, when both <b>blockading</b> and tracer doses were opsonized with isologous globulins, <b>blockade</b> did not occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of "reticuloendothelial blockade" were studied in living rabbits and isolated, perfused rabbit livers utilizing gelatin as a <b>blockading</b> agent and Au 198 stabilized in gelatin as a tracer. Employing the above experimental model, the following observations were made. (a) RES <b>blockade</b> was specific and {{dependent on the}} surface properties of the particle under study. (b) RES <b>blockade</b> was not caused by saturation of hepatic removal mechanisms. (c) RES <b>blockade</b> was not caused by depletion of demonstrable serum opsonins. (d) RES <b>blockade</b> appeared to correlate with high circulating levels of the <b>blockading</b> agent, per se. Thus, under the conditions employed, the term "reticuloendothelial blockade" was a misnomer. Although specificity of liver macrophage-particle interaction was evident and deserves further study, the data suggest that <b>blockade</b> as usually studied is a laboratory phenomenon induced by the continuing circulation of the <b>blockading</b> agent...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> {{combined}} with sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> {{has been reported}} to be an effective treatment regimen for postoperative analgesia following lower extremity surgery. Saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> is an alternative to femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> for postoperative analgesia in knee arthroplasty surgeryand the level and quality of analgesia that either technique provides patients have been reported to be equivalent. This study compared the postoperative analgesic properties of combined femoral and sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> with those of combined saphenous and sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> in patients that underwent foot and ankle surgery. Method: All patients received general inhalational endotracheal anesthesia and were administered lateral popliteal sciatic nerve <b>blockade</b> by a combined nerve stimulator and ultrasound guidance technique in the postoperative recovery area. During {{the first six months of}} the study femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> was simultaneously administered employing combined nerve stimulation and ultrasound guidance. During the second six month interval saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> was administered using ultrasound guidance. Continuous nerve block catheters were inserted if patients were admitted over 24 hours. Breakthrough pain was treated with hydro-morphone patient controlled analgesic infusions. Postoperative pain scores, opioid analgesic consumption and lower extremity movement in the immediate recovery period and at 24 hours after nerve <b>blockade</b> were recorded. Results: 167 patients were enrolled. Femoral nerve <b>blockade</b> was administered to 45 patients and 122 received a saphenous nerve <b>blockade.</b> Immediate pain scores were lower for opioid naïve females that were administered saphenous nerve <b>blockade.</b> All groups that received saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> had lower opioid requirements in the immediate postoperative period. Differences in pain scores and opioid requirements were noted between opioid naïve and tolerant patient groups. Conclusion: Combined popliteal sciatic and saphenous nerve <b>blockade</b> resulted in lower immediate postoperative pain scores in opioid naïve females and reduced immediate postoperative rescue opioid analgesic dosages in all patient groups. Differences in pain scores and analgesic requirements were not present 24 hours postoperatively. Opioid tolerant patients with effective nerve <b>blockade</b> 24 hours postoperatively required elevated rescue opioid analgesic medication dosages...|$|R
5|$|By 1809, the Napoleonic Wars {{were six}} years old and the British Royal Navy was {{dominant}} at sea. <b>Blockaded</b> in their home ports by British squadrons, French warships, merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and, as a result, the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France. These colonies were also closely <b>blockaded</b> themselves and, as a result, their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed, resulting in economic collapse, severe food shortages and social unrest. Messages warning of the deteriorating situation in the colonies had been sent {{during the summer of}} 1808, particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. In response supplies had been sent from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn. The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island, and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London, who had ordered Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane to assemble a force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them.|$|E
