Each configuration has different characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The Early {{effect in}} <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> {{is named after}} Jim Early, who first {{characterized}} it and published a paper on it in 1952. The Early effect in <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> is due to an effective decrease in the base width because of the widening of the base-collector depletion region, resulting {{in an increase in}} the collector current with an increase in the collector voltage. The same type of length modulation in MOSFETs is also commonly referred to as Early effect.|$|R

25|$|A <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>{{transistor}}</b> (bipolar transistor or BJT) {{is a type}} of transistor {{that uses}} both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of charge carrier. For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and p-type.|$|E
25|$|Nanofuidic triode is a {{three-terminal}} {{double junction}} nanofluidic device composed of positive-charged alumina and negative-charged silica nanochannels. The device {{is essentially a}} three-terminal <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistor.</b> By controlling the voltage across emitter and collector terminals, one can regulate the ion current from base terminal {{to one of the}} other two terminals, functioning as an ionic single-pole, double-throw switch.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E

25|$|The bipolar {{point-contact}} transistor {{was invented}} in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain {{under the direction of}} William Shockley. The junction version known as the <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948, was for three decades the device of choice in the design of discrete and integrated circuits. Nowadays, the use of the BJT has declined in favor of CMOS technology in the design of digital integrated circuits. The incidental low performance BJTs inherent in CMOS ICs, however, are often utilized as bandgap voltage reference, silicon bandgap temperature sensor and to handle electrostatic discharge.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET's {{advantages}} in digital circuits do not translate into supremacy in all analog circuits. The {{two types of}} circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior. Digital circuits switch, spending {{most of their time}} either fully on or fully off. The transition {{from one to the other}} is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required. Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to Vgs can modulate the output (drain) current. The MOSFET and <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> (BJT) is preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher transconductance and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistor,</b> {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a {{symmetrical}} device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped {{is to increase the}} emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the emitter.|$|E
50|$|By the 1960s the {{improved}} switching speed of <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> had allowed for high frequency DC/DC converters. In 1976 power MOSFETs became commercially available. In 1982 the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Fig. 3 shows {{a working}} example with {{component}} values. Instead of <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors,</b> other active components such as field effect transistors or vacuum tubes, {{capable of producing}} gain at the desired frequency, could be used.|$|R
50|$|A {{solid-state}} H {{bridge is}} typically constructed using opposite polarity devices, such as PNP <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> (BJT) or P-channel MOSFETs {{connected to the}} high voltage bus and NPN BJTs or N-channel MOSFETs connected to the low voltage bus.|$|R
500|$|A further {{detail that}} {{may be seen in}} this kind of {{amplifier}} is the presence of taps on the transformer windings. [...] These are used for the input and output connections of the transformer rather than the top of the windings. [...] This is done for impedance matching purposes; <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> amplifiers (the kind shown in the circuit) have a quite high output impedance and a quite low input impedance. [...] This problem can be avoided by using MOSFETs which have a very high input impedance.|$|E
