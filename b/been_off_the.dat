5|$|Although Star Trek has <b>been</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air since 2005, CBS and Paramount {{pictures}} {{have allowed}} fan-produced shows to be created. While not officially {{part of the}} Star Trek universe, several veteran Star Trek actors, actresses, and writers have contributed their talents to many of these productions. While none of these films have been created for profit, several fan productions have turned to crowdfunding from sites, such as Kickstarter to help with production costs.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> force {{for more than a year}} to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only <b>been</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E

5|$|Several {{television}} translators transmit their {{signals from}} two small towers {{located in the}} center of Wilkins Peak. Additionally, the religious television network TBN has a translator known locally as K35CN, broadcasting from the mountain. Prior to 2009, K22BK, the local PBS television translator, carried its signal from Wilkins Peak. K22BK was moved across the interstate to White Mountain to the same tower as its digital counterpart. In late 2009, a new television station signed on the air from the peak. It is known as K33IX-D on channel 33 (UHF) and carries programming from EICB TV, a Christian religious broadcast and production company, based in Cedar Hill, Texas. K35CN and K22BK have <b>been</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air since the digital television transition in the year 2009.|$|E

25|$|Season twenty-three {{eventually}} {{aired in}} the autumn of 1986. Production of the new season was complicated by various factors. Although the episode length had been reverted to 25minutes, the number of episodes was reduced to fourteen, just over half the length of most previous seasons. The series was still up against The A-Team and, having <b>been</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air for eighteen months, found it hard to regain viewers who had turned to ITV. Saward and Nathan-Turner had decided on an overarching storyline for the entire season entitled The Trial of a Time Lord, but its complexities proved confusing to both writers and viewers, with the season drawing viewing figures of only four to five million.|$|E

25|$|On 5 May Hutchinson {{now with}} 8,000 British troops marched {{along the banks}} of the Nile towards the {{position}} of General Lagrange at El Aft accompanied on the river by a division of British and Ottoman gun boats. Meanwhile, Sir William Sidney Smith in HMS Tiger with Commander James Hillyar were expecting the arrival of Rear Admiral Joseph Antoine Ganteaume upon the coast in support of the French land forces. The French squadron under Gantheaume consisting of four ships of the line - a frigate, a corvette and five transports had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast for some days. The men of war had between three and four thousand troops on board all. however Gantheaume fearing the approach of Sydney's ships which was in search of him cut his cables and stood off to sea. The five transports were empty of troops having been transferred to the ships. but the only occupants being many civilians were taken by Sydney's ships on the 7th and brought into Abu Qir Bay. The British took all the provisions and stores on board the transports and with the retreat of their fleet the French thus abandoned El Aft and retreated towards Er-Rahmaniyeh on May 7. On the same evening allied troops entered El Aft and thus commenced the Cairo campaign.|$|E
500|$|Owing to {{the rush}} to {{complete}} the film, The Motion Picture was never screened before test audiences, something Wise later regretted. The director carried the fresh print of the film to the world premiere, held at the K-B MacArthur Theater in Washington, D.C. Roddenberry, Wise, and the principal cast attended the function, which also served as an invitational benefit for the scholarship and youth education fund of the National Space Club. While thousands of fans were expected to attend, rain reduced fan turnout to around 300. The premiere {{was followed by a}} black-tie reception at the National Air and Space Museum. More than 500 people—consisting of the cast and crew, working members of the space community, and the few [...] "hardcore Trekkies" [...] who could afford the $100 admission price—filled the museum. The film was the first major Hollywood adaptation of a television series that had <b>been</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air for nearly a decade to retain its original principal cast.|$|E
