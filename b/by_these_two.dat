5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|During the {{previous}} night, the German and Ottoman force evacuated Katia and was moving towards Oghratina when Chauvel ordered the Anzac Mounted Division {{to continue the}} attack. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades and the 5th Mounted Brigade were ordered to capture Oghratina. Despite attempts <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> brigades to turn the enemy flank, {{they were forced to}} make a frontal attack on strongly entrenched rearguards in positions which favoured the defenders and which were supported by carefully positioned artillery. Meanwhile, the two infantry divisions moved to garrison Katia and Abu Hamra and Lawrence moved his headquarters forward from Kantara to Romani. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right advanced towards Badieh, but could only make small progress, against positions securely held by German and Ottoman forces.|$|E

5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to explore Jupiter was Pioneer 10, which flew past {{the planet in}} December 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 twelve months later. Pioneer 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. The information gathered <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E

Protestant church-related and other altruistic organizations generally supported social welfare and housing reforms, but they were usually less successful in getting their reforms enacted.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} impedance in AC circuit is justified by {{the fact that there are}} two additional impeding mechanisms to be taken into account besides the normal resistance of DC circuits: the induction of voltages in conductors self-induced by the magnetic fields of currents (inductance), and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between conductors (capacitance). The impedance caused <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> effects is collectively referred to as reactance and forms the imaginary part of complex impedance whereas resistance forms the real part.|$|E
25|$|The 'style wars' of the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s (where lindy hoppers debated the {{relative}} merits of different eras and dancers) resulted in terms such as Savoy-Style Lindy Hop (generally associated with original New York City African American dancers) and Hollywood-Style Lindy Hop (based on the Lindy Hop of white dancers in Hollywood films).

Out of the ten titles from this decade, América won five of them and Millonarios won two. In the 1982 final, América de Cali defeated Millonarios in El Campín, reaching the second title in the club's history. This game was known to paralyse the entire country and they fought the 1989 title shoulder to shoulder, until it was cancelled.|$|E

25|$|In late July 2008, {{human rights}} lawyer Francis Boyle {{recommended}} that the Iranian government should sue the United States and Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{in order to get}} an Order of Provisional Measures of Protection (the equivalent of a temporary restraining order in national or local law), against military action against Iran <b>by</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> states. Boyle previously aided Bosnia in filing a similar lawsuit at the ICJ against Serbia on 19 March 1993, and obtained this on 8 April 1993. Boyle points out that he also helped file a lawsuit of this type against the United States in early 1992, and claims that this helped to provide a diplomatic solution to threats of a United States military attack on Libya in relation to the Lockerbie dispute.|$|E
