40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} a much debate about the {{relative}} importance of the determination of phytoplankton crops by nutrients (bottom-up control) or by zooplankton grazing (top-down control). Wide acceptance of the importance of nutrient concentrations in water quality deterioration has brought about external nutrient control by which eutrophication is, to some extent, reversible, and which has been proved its effectiveness mostly in deep lakes. In shallow lakes its effectiveness has not been as pronounced, owing to internal nutrient loading. Because the non-linearity of responses of biological systems is much more accentuated in small and shallow lakes. The use of profound effects of lop level consumers, such as fish, is called biomanipulation and is generally regarded as a feasible technique in aquatic management, specifically for the control of algal biomass through the trophic pyramid in addition to external nutrient control. However, in deep and large lakes, biomaniplation is less likely to result in improved water quality than in shallow lakes owing to the weakened top-down effect near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> food <b>web.</b> In shallow lakes, if increased water clarity through fish removal was associated with redevelopment of dense macrophytes, sustainable water quality improvement would be achieved due to clear water stabilizing mechanisms of macrophytes...|$|R

40|$|The University of Connecticut and the Connecticut Department of Transportation have {{established}} a long-term bridge health monitoring system to monitor critical vulnerabilities {{in a group of}} bridges throughout the state. This research focuses on a three-span, simply supported composite steel girder bridge carrying three lanes of highway traffic.

Four damage measures including natural frequency, peak strain, strain distribution, and neutral axis location, will be presented and the changes in these damage measures for five different damage scenarios will be examined to identify the specific damage measures best suited to identify each particular type of damage. In order to incorporate these damage measures into the automated bridge monitoring system of this bridge, the anticipated changes in the damage measures must be compared to the inherent variability of actual bridge measurements to determine the minimum level of damage that can be detected by the system. The uncertainty of each damage measure is evaluated and its sensitivity to damage compared with the anticipated changes identified by the finite element model.

40|$|Many human {{influences}} on the world’s ecosystems have their largest direct impacts at either the top or the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the food <b>web.</b> To predict their ecosystem-wide consequences we must understand how these impacts propagate. A long-standing, but so far elusive, problem in this endeavour is how to reduce food web complexity to a mathematically tractable, but empirically relevant system. Simplification to main energy channels linking primary producers to top consumers has been recently advocated. Following this approach, we propose a general framework {{for the analysis of}} bottom-up and top-down forcing of ecosys- tems by reducing food webs to two energy pathways originating from a limiting resource shared by com- peting guilds of primary producers (e. g. edible vs. defended plants). Exploring dynamical models <b>of</b> such <b>webs</b> we find that their equilibrium responses to nutrient enrichment and top consumer harvesting are determined by only two easily measurable topological properties: the lengths of the component food chains (odd-odd, odd-even, or even-even) and presence vs. absence of a generalist top consumer reconnecting the two pathways (yielding looped vs. branched webs). Many results generalise to other looped or branched web structures and the model can be easily adapted to include a detrital pathway...|$|R

Openings are made in the <b>web</b> <b>of</b> beams to pass services pipes {{from one side of the}} building to another, when these openings are made in the beams, the shear and moment capacity at this section will be reduced. This will increase stresses at this section of the beam and will subsequently affect the stress distribution in the beam with web opening. Longitudinal stiffeners are placed at the top and <b>bottom</b> edges <b>of</b> the <b>web</b> opening to increase both moment and shear capacity at the section with web opening. Four samples were used in this study; a solid wide flange beam, a wide flange beam with web opening and two beams with reinforced web openings.

40|$|Senior thesis {{written for}} Oceanography 444 [Author's Abstract] Nutrients {{in the ocean}} are used by {{plankton}} at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the food <b>web,</b> which act as food for progressively larger organisms. In particular, nitrogen based nutrients are often in short supply, limiting {{the growth of the}} plankton. The process of denitrification converts these nutrients into nitrogen gas which escapes into the air, preventing them from being used. Denitrification can be broken into two processes, known as heterotrophic denitrification and the anammox reaction, which are both driven by bacteria. This study focused on these two processes in attempt to show which of them removes more nitrogen from the water. To do so, each nutrient was tagged with an isotope tracer and injected into bags of seawater. As the nutrients incubate in the bag, the bacteria inside converted the tagged nutrients into tagged nitrogen gas, which was measured using a mass spectrometer. The amount of nitrogen gas produced from each process is an indicator of the rates of heterotrophic denitrification and the anammox reaction. This information allows for an interpretation of each process’ contribution to nitrogen removal in the ocean...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} ecological {{function of}} plants {{is that they}} produce organic compounds for herbivores in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the food <b>web.</b> A large number of plant traits, from thorns to chemical defenses, {{can be related to}} the intensity of herbivory. Large herbivores can also have many effects on vegetation. These include removing selected species, creating gaps for regeneration of new individuals, recycling nutrients, and dispersing seeds. Certain ecosystem types, such as grasslands, may be dominated by the effects of large herbivores, although fire is also an equally important factor in this biome. In few cases, herbivores are capable of nearly removing all the vegetation at a site (for example, geese in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Canada, and nutria in the marshes of Louisiana) but normally herbivores have a more selective impact, particularly when large predators control the abundance of herbivores. The usual method of studying the effects of herbivores is to build exclosures, where they cannot feed, and compare the plant communities in the exclosures to those outside over many years. Often such long term experiments show that herbivores have a significant effect upon the species that make up the plant community.|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean Sea {{has been}} defined "under siege" because of intense {{pressures}} from multiple human activities; yet there is still insufficient information on the cumulative impact of these stressors on the ecosystem and its resources. We evaluate how the historical (1950 - 2011) trends of various ecosystems groups/species have been impacted by changes in primary productivity (PP) combined with fishing pressure. We investigate the whole Mediterranean Sea using a food web modelling approach. Results indicate that both changes in PP and fishing pressure {{played an important role}} in driving species dynamics. Yet, PP was the strongest driver upon the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem. This highlights the importance of bottom-up processes in controlling the biological characteristics of the region. We observe a reduction in abundance of important fish species (similar to 34 %, including commercial and noncommercial) and top predators (similar to 41 %), and increases of the organisms at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the food <b>web</b> (similar to 23 %). Ecological indicators, such as community biomass, trophic levels, catch and diversity indicators, reflect such changes and show overall ecosystem degradation over time.

40|$|The {{issues of}} food quality and food {{quantity}} are crucial for trophic interactions. Although most research has focussed on the primary producer – herbivore link, {{recent studies have}} shown that quality effects at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the food <b>web</b> propagate to higher trophic levels. Negative effects of poor food quality have almost exclusively been demonstrated at higher food quantities. Whether these negative effects have the same impact at low food availability in situations where the majority if not all of the resources are channelled into routine metabolism, is under debate. In this study a tri-trophic food chain was designed, consisting of the algae Rhodomonas salina, the copepod Acartia tonsa and freshly hatched larvae of the European lobster Homarus gammarus. The lobster larvae were presented with food of two different qualities (C:P ratios) and four different quantities to investigate the combined effects of food quality and quantity. Our results show that the quality of food has an impact on the condition of lobster larvae even at very low food quantities. Food with a lower C:P content resulted in higher condition of the lobster larvae regardless of the quantity of food. These interacting effects of food quality and food quantity can have far reaching consequences for ecosystem productivity...|$|R

Considering the estimated cougar density in our study area, dispersal of seeds by cougars could allow a mean, annual seed spread of ~ 5, 000 seeds per km².

5000|$|The {{deterioration}} of coral reefs is mainly linked to human activities - 88% of reefs are threatened through various reasons as listed above, including excessive amounts of [...] (carbon dioxide) emissions. Oceans absorb approximately 1/3 of the [...] produced by humans, which has detrimental {{effects on the}} marine environment. The increasing levels of [...] in oceans change the seawater chemistry by decreasing the pH. This process is also known as ocean acidification. Acidification negatively affects the carbonate buffering system and drops the carbonate saturation by 30%, which results in a decrease in reef calcification.
