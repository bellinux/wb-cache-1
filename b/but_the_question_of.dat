25|$|The {{history of}} Christianity in Hungary {{began in the}} Roman {{province}} of Pannonia where the presence of Christian communities is first attested in the 3rdcentury. Although the territory was under the successive control of the Huns, Germanic peoples, and Avars from the 5thcentury, Christian communities may have survived {{in the region of}} Lake Balaton up until the 9thcentury.

25|$|The {{marriage}} between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was {{by any standard}} extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's discomfort with any conversation that was not strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since {{he did not want}} to be accused of nepotism.|$|E
25|$|This {{notation}} {{does not}} easily provide for ways of describing all chords. Some chords {{can be very}} difficult to notate, and others that exist theoretically are rarely encountered. For example, there are six possible permutations of triads (chords with three notes) involving minor or major thirds and perfect, augmented, or diminished fifths. However, conventionally only four are used (major, minor, augmented and diminished). There is nothing to stop a composer using the other two, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> what to call them is interesting. A minor third with an augmented fifth might be denoted, for example, by Am+, which would strike most musicians as odd. In fact, this {{turns out to be the}} same as F/A bass (see slash chords below). A major third with a diminished fifth might be shown as A5.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1922, in {{an attempt}} to {{dislodge}} Anti-Treaty forces holed up in the Four Courts, salvos were launched by Free State troops into the area housing Anti-Treaty munitions, which led to an enormous out-of-control fire. The massive conflagration spread rapidly, destroying the buildings and resulting in the almost total destruction of the mass of Irish historical records archived in the Public Records Office of Ireland (and {{in other parts of the}} Four Courts). As this closely followed the 1921 destruction of centuries of other important Irish records kept in the Custom House, Dublin, the cumulative effect was the annihilation of a huge swath of Ireland's historical resources, to the despair of future researchers seeking to document many aspects of Irish history. Subsequent efforts by archivists and other interested parties have played an extremely important role in attempting to replace what was lost but, though an impressive inventory of material has been amassed, continues to accumulate and is now housed in the National Archives of Ireland, much of what was lost in the 1922 fire was irreplaceable. Which side bore the burden of the blame for the fire led to recriminations in the fire's aftermath, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> which side was ultimately responsible remains unresolved.|$|E

500|$|Throughout Churchill's {{second term}} as Prime Minister (1951–55) Home {{remained}} at the Scottish Office, although both Eden at the Foreign Office and Lord Salisbury at the Commonwealth Relations Office invited him to join their ministerial teams. Among the Scottish matters with which he dealt were hydro-electric projects, hill farming, sea transport, road transport, forestry, and the welfare of crofters in the Highlands and the Western Isles. These matters went largely unreported in the British press, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the royal cypher on Post Office pillar boxes became front-page news. Because Elizabeth I of England was never queen of Scotland, some nationalists maintained when Elizabeth II came to the British throne in 1952 that in Scotland she should be styled [...] "Elizabeth I". Churchill said in the House of Commons that considering the [...] "greatness and splendour of Scotland", and {{the contribution of the}} Scots to British and world history, [...] "they ought to keep their silliest people in order". Home nevertheless arranged that in Scotland new pillar boxes were decorated with the royal crown instead of the full cypher.|$|E

500|$|In 1802, Canonsburg Academy was reconstituted as Jefferson College, with John McMillan {{serving as}} the first President of the Board of Trustees. [...] In 1806, Matthew Brown petitioned the Pennsylvania General Assembly to grant Washington Academy a charter, {{allowing}} it to be re-christened as Washington College. [...] At various times over the next 60 years, the various parties within the two colleges pursued unification with each other, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> where the unified college would be located thwarted those efforts. [...] In 1817, a disagreement over a perceived agreement for unification erupted into [...] "The College War" [...] and threatened the existence of both colleges. [...] In the ensuing years, both colleges began to undertake risky financial moves, especially over-selling scholarships. [...] Thanks to the leadership of Matthew Brown, Jefferson College was in a stronger position to weather the financial storm for a longer period. [...] Desperate for funds, Washington College accepted an offer from the Synod of Wheeling {{to take control of}} the college, a move that was supposed to stabilize the finances for a period of time. [...] However, Washington College then undertook another series of risky financial moves that crippled its finances.|$|E
500|$|The High Court also {{examined}} {{a number of}} related propositions. In particular, they pointed out that when interpreting the legislation which established legal aid services, Australian courts did not recognise an absolute right to counsel in all circumstances, and thus the State {{does not need to}} provide counsel {{for the duration of the}} trial. The court also raised the question of what a right to counsel would actually mean in practice: that is, would a right to counsel at public expense entitle a person to counsel of a certain degree of experience? Furthermore, the court suggested that having a right to representation would necessarily imply that a trial conducted without the accused being legally represented would necessarily be unfair, an idea which has been rejected by the Australian courts. The accused must have lost a [...] "real chance of acquittal" [...] before a trial can be regarded as unfair. Essentially, Australian common law recognised a right to a fair trial, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the lack of representation caused an unfair trial had to be based on the particular circumstances of each case.|$|E

2500|$|Ojos del Salado is {{an active}} volcano, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{whether it should be}} {{considered}} currently (or [...] "historically") active is arguable. According to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program, the most recent known eruption was around 1,300 years ago, with large error. However, there is also some evidence for a minor ash emission in 1993, which would definitely qualify the volcano as historically active. The presence of fumaroles high on the mountain and recent-looking lava flows, albeit of uncertain age, also argues in favor of a categorization as [...] "active." [...] By these definitions, Ojos del Salado is the highest historically active volcano on Earth. If the older date is accepted, the title of [...] "highest historically active volcano" [...] might reside instead with the somewhat lower Llullaillaco volcano, which certainly has erupted in historic times (most recently in 1877) and is considered active.|$|E
