5000|$|Also {{referred}} to as [...] "simulated beadlocks". Streetlocks are a decorative element in which the wheel manufacturer casts or machines the appearance of bolt heads into the rim of a wheel. This provides the appearance of beadlocks, but no functional benefits beyond the internal <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> common to automotive wheels.|$|R
50|$|Some cyclists {{have avoided}} the price premium for a {{tubeless}} system by sealing the spoke holes {{with a special}} rim strip and then sealing the valve stem and <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> with a latex sealer. However, tires not designed for tubeless application do not have as robust a sidewall as those that are.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{passenger}} vehicles and tubeless tires typically use one-piece rims with a [...] "safety" [...] rim profile. The safety feature {{helps keep the}} tire bead held to the rim under adverse conditions by having a pair of safety humps extending inwardly of the rim toward the other tire <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> from an outer contoured surface of the rim.|$|R

50|$|Most road {{bicycles}} use 700C bicycle wheels (622 mm <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> diameter) {{with matching}} 20-25 mm wide tires. The wheels greatly affect {{the performance of}} a racing bike. The rim of the wheel can be shaped for greater aerodynamic efficiency making a triangular cross-section to form a teardrop with the tire. For hill climbs, however, energy losses due to the higher weight of most aerodynamic rims are greater than the aerodynamic drag reduction that they offer, so a traditional lighter box-sectioned rim is often used to make it go faster.|$|R
50|$|The {{tire bead}} {{is the part}} of the tire that {{contacts}} the rim on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The <b>bead</b> <b>seats</b> tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.|$|R

50|$|Tires {{are complex}} {{composite}} structures made {{of many different}} components that are assembled on a drum and cured in a mold. As a result, there are many conditions that result in RFV. These include variations in: tread extrusion thickness and symmetry, tread splice, body ply splices, inner liner splice, bead symmetry, turn-up symmetry, building drum alignment, transfer ring alignment, curing press <b>bead</b> <b>seating,</b> shaping bladder alignment and control, mold runout, and mold alignment. All of these factors can lead to variations in the material distribution and thickness that are modelled as spring length. The various tire components also are made from different materials, each of which exhibit variation in their elastic properties. These variations are influenced by rubber viscoelastic properties, mixing dispersion and uniformity, and cure heat history, among other things.|$|R
40|$|UMTRI has {{completed}} an experimental program {{to determine the}} inflation pressure required to fail a sample of thirty individual 16 inch light truck tires when those tires are mounted on 16. 5 inch wheels. It is possible to improperly installed a 16 inch tire (metric 215 / 85, in this case) on a 16. 5 inch tire wheel. When this is the case, the tire bead may make and air tight seal against the wheel, even though the bead is not properly seated. If inflation pressure is than elevated, the improper seating of the tire can generate excessive stresses in the bead wire, eventually resulting in failure of the wire and explosive deflation of the tire as {{the integrity of the}} <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> is lost. Such a failure was obtained for each of thirty tires tested...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of an {{experiment}} done by UMTRI to determine the inflation pressure required to fail 16 inch light truck tires, when improperly mounted on 16. 5 inch wheels. In an interim report titled "Report on Failure Testing of Thirty Tires" UMTRI reported on the test results of thirty tires fro six different manufactures. In this final report, the test results of twelve more tires from two additional manufactures are also considered. It is possible to improperly mount a 16 inch tire (metric 215 / 85, in this case) on a 16. 5 inch tire wheel. When this is the case, the tire bead makes an air tight seal against the improper seating generates excessive stresses in the tire bead wire.

40|$|Automobile {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component in vehicles to support the vehicle weight and maintain the contact between the vehicle body and road. Automotive wheels have evolved over the decades using materials from steels to aluminum and magnesium alloys. Aluminum wheels have gain popularity over steel wheels because they have less weight, better cosmetic appearance, and higher thermal conductivity for faster dissipation of heat from brakes. A rim is subject to mainly radial load and inflation pressure. The radial load is exerted on the rim as a vertical reaction force by road surface on four tires to balance the weight of a car. The radial load is applied to the rim at the <b>bead</b> <b>seats</b> with the tire, following a cosine function distribution around the contact area. The tire air pressure is applied directly on the rim at its outer side and indirectly at the rim flange. This project studied the influence of the radial load and the tire inflation pressure on the stress and displacement distribution in the wheel rim. A computer aided design model of an aluminum alloy wheel rim is analyzed using ANSYS. The geometrical parameters of the rim is further optimized to reduce weight...|$|R

40|$|Weftless bead design used in tires {{has long}} been the cause of failure. This type of bead design is {{generally}} used in agriculture, buses, trucks and passenger car tires. The main problem with this kind of bead is the splice region. It has ten cut wires, five at each over and underlap region. It is known since 1950 that Weftless design of the tire bead had failures within about 5 cm {{from the end of the}} overlapping parallel wire ribbon. The cause for this failure is generally attributed to the mounting process in which the diameter of the tire bead is changed during the mounting process as it moves from the well of the rim to the <b>bead</b> <b>seat.</b> The ideal <b>bead</b> design is a high strength flexible cable with minimal cross section, having same over and under windings to prevent stress concentrations in deflections as used in a normal steel cable. A finite element model of the tire bead was developed using ANSYS and tested under the known stresses of the mounting and final use conditions. Finite element calculations show the failure point of the Weftless bead is almost always at the under lap or at the starting point of this bead. Cable bead have significant advantages in safety over the Weftless bead still used in tires...|$|R

50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold <b>bead</b> <b>seat,</b> a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|R
