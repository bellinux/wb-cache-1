25|$|The stadium was {{upgraded}} {{multiple times}} in the 1980s beginning with replacement of <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> with chair back seats and waterproofing of {{the east and west}} stands in 1985.

By the end of the 1980s the stadium held 80,150 spectators.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} date {{on which to}} launch the plan was largely {{determined}} by other events taking place. Roosevelt wanted to present the legislation before the Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments on the Wagner Act cases, scheduled to begin on February 8, 1937; however, Roosevelt also {{did not want to}} present the legislation before the annual White House dinner for the Supreme Court, scheduled for February 2. With a Senate recess between February 3–5, and the weekend falling on February 6–7, Roosevelt had to settle for February 5. Other pragmatic concerns also intervened. The administration wanted to introduce the bill early enough in the Congressional session to make sure it passed before the summer recess, and, if successful, to leave time for nominations to any newly created <b>bench</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
25|$|All taxis bear a {{semi-circular}} green {{plate on}} the front grille, and {{at the back of}} the vehicle indicating the number of seats available. Throughout history, most Hong Kong taxis have been 4-door saloons with <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> in the front, thus allowing it to carry up to five passengers (driver excluded). In the early 1980s, 4-passenger taxis were introduced. Smaller saloons such as the Nissan Bluebird 910, Nissan Sunny B12, Toyota Corona (CT141) and the Mitsubishi Lancer were used. However, these were all phased out by the mid-1990s. Since then and until 2008, all Hong Kong taxis have been 5-passengers vehicles. But from 2008, the new Toyota Comfort equipped with new 2.0 VVT-i engine and equipped with floor shift automatic instead of column shift automatic, making the new Comfort a 4-passengers taxi again.|$|E

25|$|The {{new owner}} of the {{building}} was indoor soccer field developer Richard Fritz, who purchased the Majestic for $248,800. In April 2000 {{it was announced that}} local restaurateur Henry Doane would lease the theater and reopen after extensive renovations. Doane had bought the 71-year-old Orpheum Theatre (with the attached Stage Door Theater) a year earlier and installed a restaurant and bar in the lobby, making him the operator of the last three commercial movie screens in downtown Madison. Admitting publicly that he may lose money on the Majestic venture, he confessed to sentimental feelings about the theater and believed it could return to its former art house glory. Fritz and Doane spent $250,000 on a new roof, a new sound system, a larger concession stand and a first-floor restroom. Seating capacity went from 537 to 400 to provide more leg room, and padded <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> were installed in the balcony. The theater reopened on June 30, 2000 with Hamlet starring Ethan Hawke. The Majestic became one of the venues for the growing Wisconsin Film Festival. But Doane struggled to make a profit {{in the face of the}} same competition with the Westgate and Hilldale Theaters for independent film bookings and audiences. The theater stopped showing films on September 1, 2002 as a new buyer was found who planned to turn the movie house into a nightclub.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{design of}} all the German half-tracks of {{the early part of}} the war was done by Dipl.Ing.

It weighed , used a twelve-cylinder, [...] Maybach DSO 8 gasoline engine and its upper body had three <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> behind the driver.

500|$|Daimler-Benz {{combined}} {{the best of}} both designs in the DB s7 prototype which appeared in 1934. It used the same engine as the ZD.5, but otherwise bore little resemblance to the older model other than an upper body that had two <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> for the crew behind the driver's seat. This upper body remained the same {{over the life of the}} Sd.Kfz. 8. It weighed [...] and could pull loads of [...] An improved version was introduced in 1936 as the DB s8. The heavier (...) DB 9 model appeared in 1938. It used the Maybach HL 85 TUKRM engine, could carry an [...] payload and could tow a [...] load. Daimler-Benz tried unsuccessfully to use their diesel OM 48/1 engine, but it was repeatedly rejected by the Army Weapons Office. The DB 10 was a refined version of the DB 9 and was introduced in October 1939 and was produced for the duration of the war.|$|E
500|$|The stadium {{has been}} the home of Margate F.C. since 1929, the same year the park itself opened to the public. [...] The local council had {{purchased}} the former grounds of Hartsdown House for public use and built a stadium which it was agreed the football club would lease, initially at a charge of £200 per year. [...] Initially the players had to change in Hartsdown House itself, approximately 200yards from the pitch. [...] A small wooden grandstand with 500 <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> was soon added, followed shortly afterwards by new dressing rooms and a second stand {{on the north side}} of the ground containing a mixture of standing and seated accommodation. [...] The first ever match at the new stadium was a friendly against Folkestone on 31 August 1929 and the first competitive match a Kent League fixture against Dover two weeks later. [...] In 1934 the club entered into an agreement to become a nursery team for Arsenal, and as part of the agreement the Hartsdown pitch was altered to exactly match the size of that at Highbury.|$|E
