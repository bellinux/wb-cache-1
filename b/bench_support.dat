2500|$|Criticism slowly mounted: {{when the}} Whigs {{introduced}} a Poor Law Amendment Bill in 1841 {{to extend the}} Commission's life, MPs complained of the pettiness {{of some of the}} rules called for by the Poor Law Commission (e.g. workhouse inmates to take their meals in silence), of the refusal of the Commissioners to allow Boards of Guardians much discretion, and of the way the Commission had evaded Parliamentary scrutiny. A general election occurred before the Bill was passed, and the Conservatives came to power, with some of their MPs stating that they owed their seats to the opposition they had professed to the New Poor-law; the government, however, came forward with a Bill to extend the Commission to 1847, and to make minor amendments to the Poor Law. [...] Whilst there continued to be cross-party Front <b>Bench</b> <b>support</b> for the New Poor Law (in 1844 in Coningsby, Benjamin Disraeli mocked Peel's 'sound Conservative government' as 'Tory men and Whig measures') Conservative malcontents such as Disraeli were alive to the consequent opportunity to undermine Peel by allying themselves with the opposition to unpopular Whig measures. [...] The Bill made very slow progress (opponents made lengthy speeches; Fielden repeatedly moved adjournment of the debate), and many clauses were dropped in order to secure its passage before the existing authorisation of the Commission lapsed. [...] The previous proceedings of the Poor Law Commission were not endorsed unequivocably : ("My Lords, I don't mean to say that I approve of every act that has been done in carrying this bill into operation. I think that in many cases those who had charge of the working of the bill have gone too far") it was now stressed that the virtue of the Commission was that it supported diversity, rather than that it was necessary to achieve uniformity; administratively 'special rules' were to be as far as possible consolidated into general rules laid before Parliament. A further Poor Law Amendment Act was passed in 1844; its main effect was to again revise the treatment of unmarried mothers: in Committee stage many amendments seeking to relax the poor law regime were rebuffed by the Home Secretary on the argument that - correctly understood - the existing rules and regulations of the Poor Law Commission already permitted the relaxation sought.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} savings and revenue {{measures}} in the Budget were opposed by Labor, the Greens and cross benches in the Senate. In his Budget in reply speech, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said that Labor would oppose around $13 billion worth of cuts and tax hikes, including the changes to university funding. Initially Labor joined the Greens in opposing the reintroduction of a fuel excise levy, delaying passage of the measure until June 2015. Labor and the Greens opposed the Coalition's promised abolition of carbon pricing, {{and the introduction of}} [...] "direct action" [...] carbon-reduction policies, but the Government secured cross <b>bench</b> <b>support</b> for the repeal of the tax in July 2014. Labor and the Greens opposed abolition of the Rudd-Gillard mining tax, but it was repealed {{with the support of the}} Palmer United Party in September. The Government was unable to secure passage of its expanded Paid Parental Leave Scheme, or medicare co-contribution and the measures were scrapped. Education Minister Christopher Pyne continues to negotiate for passage of university funding reforms, but the measures are not supported by the Opposition and minor parties.|$|E

40|$|Effects of the recycle solvent {{hydrotreatment}} on oil {{yield of}} direct coal liquefaction {{were carried out}} in the 0. 18 t/day direct coal liquefaction <b>bench</b> <b>support</b> unit of National Engineering Laboratory for Direct Coal Liquefaction (China). Results showed that the hydrogen-donating ability of the hydrogenated recycle solvent improved and the hydrogen consumption of solvent hydrotreatment was increased by decreasing liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) from 1. 5 to 1. 0 h− 1 and increasing reaction pressure from 13. 7 to 19. 0 MPa. The hydrogen-donating ability of the hydrogenated recycle solvent was enhanced, thus promoting the oil yield and coal conversion of the liquefaction reaction. The coal conversion and distillates yield of coal liquefaction were increased from 88. 74 % to 88. 82 % and from 47. 41 % to 49. 10 %, respectively, with the increase in the solvent hydrotreatment pressure from 13. 7 to 19. 0 MPa. The coal conversion and distillates of coal liquefaction were increased from 88. 82 % to 89. 27 % and from 49. 10 % to 54. 49 %, respectively, when the LHSV decreased from 1. 5 to 1. 0 h− 1 under the solvent hydrotreatment pressure of 19. 0 MPa...|$|E

The caregiver then aligns the bridging rails with the shower bench's rails and locks them together using a cam lock. The {{next step is to}} roll the mobile chair (with seated patient) in position, and align and lock the mobile chair's rails with the bridge's rails (on the opposite side) again using a cam lock. Once the three sets of rails are connected, the caregiver can roll the chair (with the seated patient) over the rails laterally, off the wheeled base of the mobile chair, across the bridge, and into the shower or bath.

5000|$|The {{official}} Liberals {{found themselves}} a tiny minority within a government committed to protectionism. Slowly they found {{this issue to}} be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of collective responsibility to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over {{the introduction of the}} Ottawa Agreement on Imperial Preference. However, they remained sitting on the government <b>benches</b> <b>supporting</b> it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the 1935 general election, just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as [...] "independent Liberals". Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as Clement Davies, who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the Second World War and who would lead it after the war.|$|R

50|$|The Coolgarra Battery site {{comprises}} {{a series}} of benches extending down the northwest slope of the valley. A tall, redbrick chimney with a brick flue is the main feature of the site. This {{is one of only}} two brick chimneys surviving in the Herberton area (the other one being the Rocky Bluff Battery 15 km north-west of Herberton). The flue runs from the chimney to the boiler house site below the stamp battery. An old road curves to the northeast above the mullock heap. An earth ramp supported by bush timber posts has been built below the mullock heap. Below the ramp is a bush timber ore bin frame. Below this a stone retaining wall <b>supports</b> the <b>bench</b> where the stamp battery was located. There are concrete engine mounts and stamper foundations on the stamp battery. Another extensive stone retaining wall, which originally extended for over 110 metres, <b>supports</b> the main <b>bench</b> where the boiler house was located - 70 metres of this wall is still extant. Below this retaining wall several more earth <b>benches</b> <b>support</b> the concentration plant site and other infrastructure.
