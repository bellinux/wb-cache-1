5|$|Austria and {{the states}} of the Habsburg monarchy officially had a {{different}} standard since 1761, and Prussia, followed by its neighbours Anhalt, Lippe and Mecklenburg, would diverge in the opposite direction with a reform in 1816.

5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>cases</b> were {{appealed to}} the Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the highest court in Kentuckyin 1823. In the case of Blair, the debt relief {{position}} was argued by George M. Bibb, while the anti-relief position was represented by Robert Wickliffe. In Lapsley, Wickliffe joined George Robertson and Ben Hardin to represent the anti-relief position, while the relief position was argued by John Rowan and William T. Barry. Chief Justice John Boyle wrote the majority opinion in Blair on October 8, 1823, and Associate Justice William Owsley issued the court's opinion in Lapsley three days later. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> the anti-relief position was upheld.|$|E

30|$|Inspecting, now, Tables 5 and 6, it can {{be readily}} {{verified}} that <b>both</b> <b>case</b> scenarios resulted in significantly increased total volume of optimal pumping rates. The differences observed between the total volume of the optimal pumping rates, {{as well as the}} distribution of the pumping volume among the active locations in <b>both</b> <b>case</b> scenarios, suggest that the location of the extra artificial well significantly affects the final optimal pumping setup.|$|R
5|$|By the {{spectral}} theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an eigenbasis; that is, every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> all eigenvalues are real. This theorem can {{be generalized to}} infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many rows and columns, see below.|$|E

5|$|Further rebellions {{occurred}} in 1287–88 and, more seriously, in 1294, {{under the leadership}} of Madog ap Llywelyn, a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. This last conflict demanded the King's own attention, but in <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> the rebellions were put down.|$|E
5|$|In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is {{required}} {{as well as}} royal assent. In other monarchies—such as Sweden—the government officially promulgates laws. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> however, the process of royal assent is usually a formality, whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{conflict}} between feminist and traditional members {{led to the}} latter leaving Beth Israel, and forming the Orthodox Congregation Ahavas Torah. Beth Israel came under attack from neo-Nazi members of the Volksfront twice, in 1994 and again in 2002. In <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> the perpetrators were caught and convicted.|$|E

30|$|In <b>both</b> <b>case</b> studies, the NLFEA {{proposed}} herein gives {{very good}} results that match with acceptable accuracy the experimental test {{results in the}} case of non-damaged beams. The approach is numerically stable and insensitive over a wide range of number of elements and size of load increments. The tuning parameter, α, of the displacement field tuning convergence (DFTC) can be calibrated with only a few trials in <b>both</b> <b>case</b> studies, and the convergence of the model becomes systematic in almost all the studied cases.|$|R

5|$|Terry Sharples, {{a former}} One Nation {{candidate}} who had stood for the Senate in the 1998 election {{as an independent}} candidate, made a similar petition.

5|$|The Zion Cinema was {{the site}} of two {{attempted}} bombings, one in 1951 and the other in 1967. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> an incendiary device was planted under the theater seats and was discovered before it detonated.|$|E

5|$|When {{the glass}} {{electrode}} cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used. These may involve absorbance or fluorescence measurements.

5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Al-Baqi cemetery, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} two most {{important}} Islamic graveyards located in Medina, Saudi Arabia, was demolished in 1806 and, following reconstruction in the mid-19th century, was destroyed again in 1925 or 1926. An alliance of the House of Saud, and the followers of the Wahhabi movement known as the Emirate of Diriyah, carried out the first demolition. The Sultanate of Nejd, also ruled by the House of Saud and followers of Wahhabism, carried out the second. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> the actors were motivated by the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, which prohibits the building of monuments on graves.|$|E
