40|$|Partial {{discharge}} {{detection and}} localisation is a well-established off-line tool for diag- nosing medium voltage cables [1 - 3]. For on-line application {{a number of}} new problems have to be solved, not only related to sensor coupling and high noise levels. In this pa- per a few additional consequences are discussed. The electric field in a <b>belted</b> <b>cable</b> is elliptical. The amount of field eccentricity influences PD patterns, due both to the PD excitation itself and to the coupling and propagation of the signal to the cable conduc- tors. Further, the impedances seen by the propagating pulses at the cable end can vary, depending on the substation equipment. Therefore, localisation techniques based on re- flectometry become unreliable, and signal detection at both cable ends is preferred. This implicates the need of synchronisation of the two set-ups and a communication channel between them. This paper discusses the feasibility to use the cable under test for these purposes...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) magnitudes from classical detection {{techniques are}} {{expressed in terms of}} apparent charges. Signals from HF/VHF/UHF techniques on substation components are often hard to express in this quantity because of complex signal excitation and propagation channels. A method to calibrate PD signals obtained during online inductive detection in medium voltage <b>belted</b> <b>cables</b> is described. online inductive detection implies that the impedances of components present in substations essentially determine the detected PD signal magnitude. The use of <b>belted</b> <b>cables</b> means, that the coupling of a PD event to the conductors not only depends on the PD site within the cross-section of the cable or cable accessory, but also becomes dependent on the momentary phase angle. In addition, during signal propagation the signal magnitude may alter according to the propagation modes of a multi-conductor cable. These aspects are studied quantitatively by the use of theoretical modelling in addition to offline and online experiments. PD diagnostic equipment including pulse injection capability allows online calibration with sufficient accuracy, irrespective of the actual substation arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Different {{types of}} {{sensors can be}} used for on-line {{detection}} and localisation of PDs in medium voltage cables. These sensors can be placed on different locations in the substa-tions where the cable under test is terminated. Both aspects have a significant influence on the measured signals. In this paper both capacitive and inductive sensors are briefly evaluated, especially concerning their applicability for on-line measurements. Further-more, when the sensors are applied on-line, it is essential to realize which signals are being measured. Especially when three-phase <b>belted</b> <b>cables</b> are being measured, the situation differs considerably from off-line situations. When the cable is on-line, i. e. powered by the network itself, all three the phases are energized simultaneously. This means the PD pulses are propagating through two distinctive propagation modes: the Phase-to-Phase (PP) mode and the Shield-to-Phase (SP) mode. In this paper the differ-ent possible locations in a substation for placing sensors are discussed, with respect to the measured propagation modes, signal- and interference sensitivity, safety and practi-cal applicability.

40|$|Expressions {{are derived}} for the {{inception}} voltage at which discharges occur in gaseous voids entrained within the insulation of single and three-core, screened {{as well as}} <b>belted,</b> power <b>cables.</b> The inception voltage V//i depends upon the conductor diameter, the insulation thickness, the dielectric permittivity, the location, shape and length L of the void, and the pressure P of the gas inside the void.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} processing PD data captured using a wide bandwidth non-conventional PD sensor such as a radio frequency current transducer (RFCT). The method allows the discrimination between PD signals from multiple PD sources captured by the single sensor. Fundamentally the discrimination {{is based on the}} assumption that PD events from the same source will have very similar signatures in terms of time and frequency information whereas there are measurable differences in the signatures of two PD signals from different sources. To visualize this, it is possible to use a dimension reduction technique such that the features of each signal are represented as a single point in three-dimensional space. This process creates clusters of similar signals that can then be analyzed separately as a subset of the original captured data. This approach has been used to analyze PD signal data captured using RFCTs placed around the earth connections of 11 kV three phase <b>belted</b> <b>cables</b> in the UK and Cyprus.

40|$|Industrially driven {{interest}} {{in the field of}} partial discharge (PD) diagnostics has rapidly increased in recent years. Utilities are turning to continuous asset monitoring methods to inform them on the real-time health of plant. The majority of London's medium voltage (MV) distribution network is constructed from paper insulated lead covered (PILC) <b>belted</b> <b>cables.</b> The vast majority of this cable was commissioned in the 60 's and 70 's and is now nearing the end of its design life. PD diagnostics have been proposed as a possible tool for the condition monitoring of these distribution cables. Little is known about the characteristics of the PD activity that is produced as cables of this design degrade under rated conditions. This thesis describes the development of a PD measurement experiment that records PD data from either defective or damaged three-phase MV PILC cables under rated voltage conditions. The experiment has been designed to replicate the environment experienced by cable circuits in the field. The aim was to investigate the potential transfer of knowledge generated by the experiment onto an on-line commercial operational system. An investigation into the PD produced by the various degradation mechanisms have been undertaken to evaluate the relationship between the PD source conditions and recorded signals. It has been found that the phase-resolved PD patterns produced by different degradation mechanisms are unique. Consequently, a PD source discrimination technique has been successfully applied to both experiment and field data. The algorithm relies on the finding that the wavelet energy (WE) distribution of a PD pulse is source dependent. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to accurately classify PD pulses from different sources that had been tested experimentally. The ability to accurately discriminate between different PD sources in both experiment and field data should lead to a significant step forward in the field of PD diagnostics.

40|$|Actually, the Coriolis {{acceleration}} component {{experienced by}} axi-Downmagnetic tapes, paper sheets, textile fibers, band saws, aerial cable tramways, and crane hoist cables. Despite many advantages of these devices, noise and vibrations, particularly transverse vibra-tions, {{associated with the}} devices have limited their applications. For example, in magnetic tape drives, the vibration of a tape leads to signal modulation and accelerates the wear of the tape; in band saws, the vibration of a blade results in poor cutting quality. Therefore, understanding transverse vibrations of axially moving strings {{is important for the}} design of the devices. Furthermore, for high precision applications, it is desirable to introduce suitable control mechanisms to reduce vibrations of axially moving strings in order to improve performance of the devices. A string is a one-dimensional continuum that offers no resis-tance to bending. Since the gravitational force is sufficiently small compared with the tension force, the equilibrium configuration is a straight line. Many slender engineering elements such as <b>belts,</b> <b>cables,</b> strips, chains, tapes, ropes, and thread lines can be mod-eled as strings because their bending stiffness is relatively small. If slender engineering elements have rather large bending stiff-ness, they will be treated as moving beams. Slender engineering elements with curved equilibrium configurations will be treated as moving cables ~loose strings!. As for engineering elements that have considerable width, two-dimensional continuum models such as membranes, plates or shells should be used. The investigations on transverse vibrations and control of axi-ally moving strings have theoretical significance, because an axi-ally moving string is a simplest representative of distributed gy-roscopic systems. Axially moving strings, beams, cables, membranes, and plates all fall into the class of axially moving ally moving materials imparts a skew-symmetric or gyroscopic term to their governing equations. Due to particular characteristics of the gyroscopic term, the approaches developed in analysis and control of transverse vibrations of an axially moving string can be applied to other more complicated distributed gyroscopic systems.

40|$|Actuators and linear motors are {{a common}} way to provide single axis motion and force. Rack and pinion, chain, <b>belt,</b> <b>cable,</b> screw, {{hydraulic}} and electric solenoid {{are a few of}} the many types of actuators available. All have inherent strengths and weakness such as power consumption, mechanical failure and usually a trade off with speed and resolution. The thesis investigation is to develop a linear motion actuator based on the magnetic material, Terfenol-D which alters its shape when subjected to a magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as magnetostriction which can be defined as a changing of a material's physical dimensions in response to its magnetization. Terfenol-D has the largest known magnetostriction, 2000 ppm at ambient temperatures [1], of all commercially available materials. Because of these large strains it is given the term Giant Magnetostriction (GM). In Terfenol-D the GM is dependent on the direction of the applied magnetic field with respect to the direction in the crystal: the material elongates in the direction of the field and, orthogonal to this, the material contracts within the principal of constant volume. This property has been exploited by other researchers in the past resulting in Terfenol-D being used as a short stroke conventional actuator in applications requiring large force at both high and low frequencies, generating a range of applications including surgical instruments, ultrasonic transducers and many others. It is this property of Terfenol-D that will be exploited in this project in the development of the magnetostrictive linear motor. Stepping motors based upon Giant Magnetostrictive (GM) materials are more complex actuators than those based on a more conventional design. To get a long stroke, they use the addition of several small steps, each produced by quasi static deformation of the GM materials. In this project the Kiesewetter Elastic Wave Motor using Terfenol-D, as referenced in the abstract, was used as the starting point for the design of a new Terfenol-D based motor. In particular, the project investigates different topologies of Terfenol-D in the design and construction of a Magnetostrictive Linear Moto...|$|R

This choice is particularly difficult for robotic systems working within a magnetic resonance (MR) environment because of the safety and compatibility constraints imposed by the high magnetic field, switching gradients, electromagnetic pulses, and sensitive measuring equipment involved. This article analyzes actuation methods for robotic systems to be used within a magnetic resonance environment, such as systems for diagnostic and interventional MRI, neuroscience studies during functional MRI, and diagnostic fMRI. In the case of functional MRI, actuation is also required during imaging, whereas current MR-compatible interventional systems are typically moved between imaging phases. Our analysis {{is based on a}} variety of actuation principles that we have tested both for MR compatibility and for the quality of force feedback that can be realized, including hydrostatic, <b>belt,</b> and <b>cable</b> transmissions as well as electrostatic and piezoelectric actuators. The results are completed with developments of other groups. A good solution to a given application often involves a combination of several actuation principles.
