The attraction officially had {{metal detectors}}, security with metal detecting wands, and a zero tolerance policy for cell phones, wallets, coins, watches, cameras, {{anything that could be}} placed in one's pockets; all pockets were to <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> empty prior to boarding.

5|$|While {{predictions}} of the future can never <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> certain, present understanding in various fields allows for the prediction of far-future events, if only in the broadest outline. These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of Curiosity, {{formerly}} titled The Professor of Curiosity, is {{a comedy}} panel game on BBC Radio 4 that was first broadcast on 20 February 2008. It is hosted by John Lloyd (Professor of Ignorance at the University of Buckingham, and later at Southampton Solent University). He {{acts as the}} head of the (fictional) titular museum, while a panel of three guests – typically a comedian, an author and an academic – each donate to the museum an ‘object’ that fascinates them. The radio medium ensures that the suggested exhibits can <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> anything, limited only by the guests’ imaginations.|$|E

25|$|In {{opposition}} {{with the}} other nationalists, ultramontanes rejected {{the idea that the}} people are sovereign and that church and state should <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> separated. They accepted the authority of the British crown in Canada, defended its legitimacy, and preached obedience to the British ruler. For ultramontanes, the faith of Franco-Canadians was to survive by defending their Roman Catholic religion and the French language.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} {{states that}} a continuous probability distribution must possess a density, or equivalently, its {{cumulative distribution function}} <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> continuous. This requirement is stronger than simple continuity of the cumulative distribution function, {{and there is a}} special class of distributions, singular distributions, which are neither continuous nor discrete nor a mixture of those. An example is given by the Cantor distribution. Such singular distributions however are never encountered in practice.|$|E

Protocols vary for how it is given, but the typical doses are anywhere from 500mg up to 1.5grams. It is likely that this data was used to develop the initial protocols for state-sanctioned lethal injection, according to which one gram of thiopental was used to induce the coma. Now, most states use 5grams to <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> certain the dosage is effective.|$|E
25|$|M. Picot may inform his {{government}} that {{the acceptance of}} the whole project would entail the abdication of considerable British interests, but provided that the cooperation of the Arabs is secured, and that the Arabs fulfil the conditions and obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus and Aleppo, the British Government would not object to the arrangement. But, as the Blue Area extends so far Eastwards, and affects Russian interests, it would <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> essential that, before anything was concluded, the consent of Russia was obtained.|$|E

25|$|Good {{structural}} design {{is important in}} most building design, but particularly for skyscrapers since even a small chance of catastrophic failure is unacceptable given the high price. This presents a paradox to civil engineers: {{the only way to}} assure a lack of failure is to test for all modes of failure, in both the laboratory and the real world. But the only way to know of all modes of failure is to learn from previous failures. Thus, no engineer can <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> sure that a given structure will resist all loadings that could cause failure, but can only have large enough margins of safety such that a failure is acceptably unlikely. When buildings do fail, engineers question whether the failure was due to some lack of foresight or due to some unknowable factor.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says that the Good is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an origin and in power. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the Good can retain its place inside {{the realm of the}} Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real Being. In this case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The Good would therefore have a place in the hierarchy of real Beings. According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the Good to <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles.|$|E
500|$|In 1919, American {{inventor}} Lee De Forest {{was awarded}} several patents {{that would lead}} to the first optical sound-on-film technology with commercial application. In De Forest's system, the sound track was photographically recorded onto the side of the strip of motion picture film to create a composite, or [...] "married", print. If proper synchronization of sound and picture was achieved in recording, it could <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> counted on in playback. Over the next four years, he improved his system with the help of equipment and patents licensed from another American inventor in the field, Theodore Case.|$|E

500|$|Cagney's {{skill at}} noticing tiny details in other actors' {{performances}} became apparent during {{the shooting of}} Mister Roberts. While watching the Kraft Music Hall anthology television show some months before, Cagney had noticed Jack Lemmon performing left-handed. The first thing that Cagney asked Lemmon when they met was {{if he was still}} using his left hand. Lemmon was shocked; he had done it on a whim, and thought no one else had noticed. He said of his co-star, [...] "his powers of observation must <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> incredible, in addition {{to the fact that he}} remembered it. I was very flattered." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} pre-title {{sequence}} of the episode, Brenton wanted to include a [...] "frightening thriller set up" [...] where spies would listen in as an agent is undercover, and <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> helpless to aid the agent when he is in trouble, yet be nearby as this happens. He also wanted the audience to admire the villains, especially from the conversation between Tom and Rachid. Furthermore, the episode exemplifies Tom's brutality in his professional life; in one scene Tom questions Johnny who is recovering in hospital, but came to want the information more than care for his wellbeing.|$|E
500|$|The {{conscription}} legislation {{introduced the}} right to refuse military service, allowing for conscientious objectors to <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or {{to serve as a}} non-combatant in the army, according {{to the extent to which}} they could convince a Military Service Tribunal of the quality of their objection. Around 16,500 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers playing a large role. 4,500 objectors were sent to work on farms to undertake [...] "work of national importance", 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties as stretcher bearers, but 6,000 were forced into the army, and when they refused orders, they were sent to prison, as in the case of the Richmond Sixteen.|$|E
