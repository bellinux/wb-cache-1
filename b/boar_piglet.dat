40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate new baits for the oral delivery of vaccine preparations to 2 – 4 month-old wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets.</b> Baits were prepared using a matrix composed of wild boar feed, wheat flour, paraffin, sacarose and cinnamon-truffle powder attractant with polyethylene capsules dipped into the matrix to introduce vaccine formulation. Physical stability studies demonstrated that baits were stable for at least three days at temperatures as high as 42 °C. Recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the membrane-displayed BM 95 -MSP 1 a fusion protein were used to test bacterial viability in the baits and the antibody response in orally immunized wild boar. The E. coli viability was not significantly affected after bait incubation at 25 and 37 °C for 96 h. Bait acceptance studies using artificial feeders in the field showed that baits were accepted by 2 – 3 month-old animals, the preferred age for vaccination. Orally immunized wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> excreted recombinant E. coli in the feces and developed antibody titers to recombinant BM 95 -MSP 1 a protein, thus confirming that vaccine composition was released and reached the wild boar gastrointestinal track. The results of these experiments support the use of these baits for oral delivery of vaccine formulations to 2 – 4 month-old wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets.</b> This work was supported by Grants from Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA) (project FAU 2006 - 00017 -C 03 - 01), Consejería de Educación y Ciencia, Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha (JCCM) (Project PAI 06 - 0046 - 5285), the Grupo Santander and the Fundación Marcelino Botín, Spain.

40|$|A. Che’ Amat et al. Animal {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{caused by}} infection with Mycobacterium bovis and closely related {{members of the}} M. tuberculosis complex (MTC), is often reported in the Eurasian wild boar (. Sus scrofa). Tests detecting antibodies against MTC antigens are valuable tools for TB monitoring and control in suids. However, only limited knowledge exists on serology test performance in 2 - 6 month-old piglets. In this age-class, recent infections might cause lower antibody levels and lower test sensitivity. We examined 126 wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> from a TB-endemic site using 6 antibody detection tests {{in order to assess}} test performance. Bacterial culture (. n=. 53) yielded a M. bovis infection prevalence of 33. 9 %, while serum antibody prevalence estimated by different tests ranged from 19 % to 38 %, reaching sensitivities between 15. 4 % and 46. 2 % for plate ELISAs and between 61. 5 % and 69. 2 % for rapid immunochromatographic tests based on dual path platform (DPP) technology. The Cohen kappa coefficient of agreement between DPP WTB (Wildlife TB) assay and culture results was moderate (0. 45) and all other serological tests used had poor to fair agreements. This survey revealed the ability of several tests for detecting serum antibodies against the MTC antigens in 2 - 6 month-old naturally infected wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets.</b> The best performance was demonstrated for DPP tests. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis of a lower sensitivity of serology for detecting M. bovis-infected piglets, as compared to older wild boar. Certain tests, notably the rapid animal-side tests, can contribute to TB control strategies by enabling the setup of test and cull schemes or improving pre-movement testing. However, sub-optimal test performance in piglets as compared to that in older wild boar should be taken into account.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Wildlife vaccination is increasingly being explored as a tuberculosis (TB) control tool in all major wildlife reser-voirs. An attenuated mutant of M. bovis, Mycobacterium bovis BCG (bacille Calmette Guerin [1]), is often the vaccine used in wildlife vaccination trials worldwide [2 - 8]. In countries such as UK and the Republic of Ireland, Eurasian badger (Meles meles) vaccination field trials are becoming part of the TB control strategies [9]. Field vaccination trials are also ongoing in Spain, where the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) is regarded as the main driver of animal TB at the wildlife-livestock inter-face [10 - 12]. In Mediterranean Spain, modeling of tuberculosis in wild boar populations predicted that over 70 % of the an-nual cohort of wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> would be needed to be vaccinated in order to significantly reduce the prevalence of the disease and eventually eradicate the infection [13]. It has been demonstrated that the most efficient oral vaccine bait deployment strategy in this area consists in using selective piglet feeders and deploying vaccine baits both at the start (late June/early July) and the end o...|$|R

We aimed {{to characterize the}} first experimental Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (MAA) infection in wild boar in order to describe the lesions and the immune response as compared to uninfected controls. Twelve 1 - 4 -month-old wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> were housed in class III bio-containment facilities. Four concentrations of MAA suspension were used: 10, 102 and 104 mycobacteria (2 animals each, oropharyngeal route) and 2. 5 × 106 mycobacteria (2 animals each by the oropharyngeal and nasal routes). No clinical signs were observed and pathology evidenced a low pathogenicity of this MAA strain for this particular host. Bacteriological and pathological evidence of successful infection after experimental inoculation was found for the group challenged with 2. 5 × 106 mycobacteria.

Diet composition was determined by scat analysis (over 4 years: jackal 814 scats; fox 894 scats). Compared with jackals, foxes consumed More small mammals (mean biomass consumed: jackal 77 %. fox 68 %) {{and to a lesser extent}} plant matter (6 % and 18 %. respectively). The importance of other prey, such as wild boar (Sits scrofa L., 1758), cervids, brown hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778), birds, reptiles, fish, invertebrates, and domestic animals. was minimal. Both mesocarnivores consumed primarily small animals (< 50 g: 92 % and 87 %, respectively) : this implies a typical searching and solitary hunting strategy. The trophic niche breadth of both species was very narrow and the fox proved to be more of a generalist.

40|$|Background: The {{understanding}} of host-parasite systems in wildlife is of increasing interest {{in relation to}} the risk of emerging diseases in livestock and humans. In this respect, many efforts have been dedicated to controlling classical swine fever (CSF) in the European Wild Boar. But CSF eradication has not always been achieved even though vaccination has been implemented at a large-scale. Piglets have been assumed to be the main cause of CSF persistence in the wild since they appeared to be more often infected and less often immune than older animals. However, this assumption emerged from laboratory trials or cross-sectional surveys based on the hunting bags. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present paper we conducted a capture-mark-recapture study in free-ranging wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> that experienced both CSF infection and vaccination under natural conditions. We used multi-state capture recapture models to estimate the immunization and infection rates, and their variations according to the periods with or without vaccination. According to the model prediction, 80 % of the infected piglets did not survive more than two weeks, while the other 20 % quickly recovered. The probability of becoming immune did not increase significantly during the summer vaccination sessions, and the proportion of immune piglets was not higher after the autumn vaccination. Conclusions/Significance: Given the high lethality of CSF in piglets highlighted in our study, we consider unlikely that piglets could maintain the chain of CSF virus transmission. Our study also revealed the low efficacy of vaccination in piglet...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis, {{a member of}} the Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex, is an important health problem worldwide. The control of TB through vaccination of wildlife reservoirs may potentially have advantages over other management strategies. The most practical approach to deliver vaccines to wildlife is using oral baits that are stable under field conditions and effective in reaching the target species. Baits were developed in our laboratory to deliver oral vaccines to wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets.</b> However, these baits were well accepted by other wild species. Therefore, bait consumption by different M. bovis hosts was evaluated herein. The results showed that the baits were well accepted by cattle, feral pigs, and adult red deer whereas small mammals like badgers and possums showed varying bait acceptance. Bait acceptance by different species has the advantage of targeting more than one wildlife reservoir when they coexist in the same area and need to be vaccinated for TB control. However, bait delivery methods {{such as the use of}} selective feeders to target the desired species should be developed to avoid bait consumption by other species.

In the Himalayas and Burma, it is reported to frequently kill muntjac fawns, while in Ussuriland the base of its diet consists of musk deer, particularly in winter. The young of larger ungulate species are also taken, but within a weight range of 10 to 12 kg. In winter, the yellow-throated marten hunts musk deer by driving them onto ice. Two or three yellow-throated martens can consume a musk deer carcass in 2 to 3 days. Other ungulate species preyed upon by the yellow-throated marten include young wapiti, spotted deer, roe deer and goral. Wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> are also taken on occasion.

This study explores the relationship between CHI, measured using a haemagglutination-haemolysis assay (HAHL), and resistance to classical swine fever virus (CSFV) among wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets.</b> The individual dynamics of HAHL during piglet growth was analysed, using 423 serum samples from 92 piglets repeatedly captured in the absence of CSFV (in 2006) within two areas showing contrasting food availability. Natural antibody levels increased with age, but, in the youngest piglets antibody levels were higher in individuals from areas with the highest food availability. Complement activity depended on natural antibody levels and piglets' body condition. In the presence of CSFV (i. e., in 2005 within one area), serum samples from piglets that were repeatedly captured were used to assess whether piglet HAHL levels affected CSFV status at a later capture. The correlation between CHI and resistance to CSFV was tested using 79 HAHL measures from 23 piglets captured during a CSFV outbreak. Both natural antibodies and complement activity levels measured at a given time correlated negatively to the subsequent probability of becoming viremic. Finally, capture-mark-recapture models showed that piglets with medium/high average complement activity, independently of their age, were significantly less at risk of becoming viremic and more likely to develop a specific immune response than piglets with low complement activity. Additionally, piglets with high average complement activity showed the highest survival prospects. This study provides evidence linking CHI to individual fitness within a natural mammal population. The results also highlight the potential of HAHL assays to explore the dynamics and co-evolution between wildlife mammal hosts and blood-borne parasites interacting with the CHI...|$|R

[Results]: BCG re-vaccinated wild boar showed reductions of 75. 8 % in lesion score and 66. 9 % in culture score, as compared to unvaccinated controls. Only one of nine vaccinated wild boar had a culture-confirmed lung infection, as compared to seven of eight controls. Serum antibody levels were highly variable and did not differ significantly between BCG re-vaccinated wild boar and controls. Gamma IFN levels differed significantly between BCG re-vaccinated wild boar and controls. The mRNA levels for IL- 1 b, C 3 and MUT were significantly higher in vaccinated wild boar when compared to controls after vaccination and decreased after mycobacterial challenge. [Conclusions]: Oral re-vaccination of wild boar with BCG yields a strong protective response against challenge with a field strain. Moreover, re-vaccination of wild boar with BCG is not counterproductive. These findings are relevant given that re-vaccination is likely to happen under real (field) conditions.

Our observations on testicular histology confirmed that X-autosome translocation-carrier boars are sterile, and the analysis of reproductive data showed that the most striking effects of t(Xp+; 14 q-) on sows are the 50 % {{increase in the number of}} breedings required for conception and the over 25 % reduction in litter size compared with that of normal sows. The reproductive impact of this and similar translocations on the herd and on the swine industry in general is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Context]: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} is {{a persistent}} disease of livestock {{in many parts}} of the world, especially where wildlife hosts co-exist with livestock. In south-western Spain, despite the widespread implementation of test-and-cull strategies for cattle, the herd prevalence in areas with high wild boar densities remains stable. The control of M. bovis infection in wild boar is likely to be essential for effective disease control in livestock. [Methods]: We developed an individual-based model to evaluate whether vaccinating wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> with oral bait would be an effective strategy to reduce the prevalence of M. bovis infection in wild boar populations. Specifically, we quantified the proportion of piglets requiring vaccination and the number of years the vaccination programme would need to continue to eradicate bTB from wild boar within 25 years, comparing 'managed' populations on hunting estates where supplementary food is provided, with 'unmanaged', free-living populations. Successful vaccination was defined as the proportion of piglets that were delivered the vaccine and were effectively protected from infection. [Key results]: Longer-term (25 -year) vaccination strategies were more successful than short-term (5 -year) strategies at either eradicating M. bovis or reducing it to below 90 % of its original prevalence. M. bovis infection could be eradicated under a 25 -year vaccination strategy if 80 % of piglets were vaccinated in a managed population or 70 % of piglets were vaccinated in an unmanaged population. In contrast, 5 -year strategies in which 80 % of piglets were vaccinated reduced the prevalence of M. bovis only by 27 % or 8 % in the managed and unmanaged populations, respectively. [Conclusions]: The results of our simulation model, coupled with the promising results of initial vaccine and oral bait-uptake trials in wild boar indicated that vaccination could be an effective strategy to reduce the prevalence of M. bovis infection in wild boar if used in conjunction with other disease-control measures. [Implications]: The vaccination of piglets over a long-term period has the potential to make an important contribution to the eradication of M. bovis infection from wild boar reservoirs in southern Spain.

40|$|Special issue: 5 th International Conference on Mycobacterium bovis. [...] HAL Id: hal- 00701898 Despite the {{compulsory}} {{test and}} slaughter campaigns in cattle, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is still present in Spain, {{and the role}} of wildlife reservoirs is increasingly recognized. We provide an update on recent progress made in bTB control in Spanish wildlife, including aspects of epidemiology, surveillance, host-pathogen interaction and wildlife vaccination. At the high densities and in the particular circumstances of Mediterranean environments, wild ungulates, mainly Eurasian wild boar and red deer, are able to maintain Mycobacterium bovis circulation even in absence of domestic livestock. Infection is widespread among wild ungulates in the south of the country, local infection prevalence being as high as 52 % in wild boar and 27 % in red deer. Risk factors identified include host genetic susceptibility, abundance, spatial aggregation at feeders and waterholes, scavenging, and social behaviour. An increasing trend of bTB compatible lesions was reported among wild boar and red deer inspected between 1992 and 2004 in Southwestern Spain. Sporadic cases of badger TB have been detected, further complicating the picture. Gene expression profiles were characterized in European wild boar and Iberian red deer naturally infected with M. bovis. The comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in wildlife hosts in response to infection advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis, revealed common and distinctive host responses to infection and identified candidate genes associated with resistance to bTB and for the characterization of host response to infection and vaccination. Ongoing research is producing valuable knowledge on vaccine delivery, safety and efficacy issues. Baits for the oral delivery of BCG vaccine preparations to wild <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> were developed and evaluated. The use of selective feeders during the summer was found to be a potentially reliable bait-deployment strategy. Safety experiments yielded no isolation of M. bovis BCG from faeces, internal organs at necropsy and the environment, even after oral delivery of very high doses. Finally, preliminary vaccination and challenge experiments suggested that a single oral BCG vaccination may protect wild boar from infection by a virulent M. bovis field strain.

40|$|Chlamydiaceae are Gram-negative obligate {{intracellular}} bacteria. They {{are responsible}} for {{a broad range of}} diseases in animals and humans. In pigs, Chlamydia suis, Chlamydia abortus, Chlamydia pecorum and Chlamydia psittaci have been isolated. Chlamydiaceae infections in pigs are associated with different pathologies such as conjunctivitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, polyarthritis, polyserositis, pseudo-membranous or necrotizing enteritis, periparturient dysgalactiae syndrome, vaginal discharge, return to oestrus, abortion, mummification, delivery of weak piglets, increased perinatal and neonatal mortality and inferior semen quality, orchitis, epididymitis and urethritis in boars. However, Chlamydiaceae are still considered as non-important pathogens because reports of porcine chlamydiosis are rare. Furthermore, Chlamydiaceae infections are often unnoticed because tests for Chlamydiaceae are not routinely performed in all veterinary diagnostic laboratories and Chlamydiaceae are often found in association with other pathogens, which are sometimes more easily to detect. However, recent studies have demonstrated that Chlamydiaceae infections in breeding sows, <b>boars</b> and <b>piglets</b> occur more often than thought and are economically important. This paper presents an overview on: the taxonomy of Chlamydiaceae occurring in pigs, diagnostic considerations, epidemiology and pathology of infections with Chlamydiaceae in pigs, public health significance and finally on prevention and treatment of Chlamydiaceae infections in pigs. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} common {{practice}} in pig fattening production systems to castrate young <b>boar</b> <b>piglets</b> {{without the use of}} anaesthesia. In this study, we examined whether or not CO 2 gas is capable of inducing an acceptable anaesthetic state during which castration can be performed. The first step was to identify the most promising CO 2 /O 2 mixture. Based on the results from this first experiment, a mixture of 70 % CO 2 + 30 % O 2 was chosen for further investigation as a potential anaesthetic during the castration of young piglets. Thereby, it was established whether the duration and depth of anaesthesia were acceptable for castration where the animal has to be insensible and unconscious. Physiological effects were assessed based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, blood gas values and behavioural responses. During the induction phase, the only typical behaviour the piglets exhibited when exposed to the 70 / 30 gas mixture was heavy breathing. All piglets (n = 25) lost consciousness after approximately 30 s according to the EEG. Heart rate decreased slowly during the induction phase, a serious drop occurred when piglets lost their posture. Immediately after this drop, the heart rate neared zero or showed a very irregular pattern. Shortly after loss of posture, most animals showed a few convulsions. None of the animals showed any reaction to castration in behaviour and/or on the EEG and ECG. On average, the piglets recovered within 59 s, i. e. EEG returned to its pre-induction pattern and piglets were able to regain a standing position. After 120 s, heart rate returned to pre-induction levels. In order to explore the usage range of CO 2 concentration, 24 piglets were exposed to 60 % CO 2 + 20 % O 2 + 20 % N 2 for up to 30 s after loss of consciousness (as registered on EEG), and castrated after removal from the chamber. Sixteen of the 24 animals showed a reaction to the castration on the EEG. To establish the maximum time piglets survive in 70 % CO 2 + 30 % O 2, five piglets were placed in this mixture for 3 min. Two of them died. After that, four piglets were placed in this mixture for 2 min after unconsciousness, one died after 2 min. It was concluded from this study {{that it is possible to}} anaesthetise piglets with a mixture of 70 % CO 2 + 30 % O 2, but that there are limits to its safety in terms of CO 2 concentration and duration of exposure. Before implementation for practical use, further research is essential to assess the limits of gas concentration and exposure time...|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} of osteopontin (OPN) in boar testis was studied. Western blot analysis detected 66 - and 32 -kDa OPN immunopositive bands in the testes of adult <b>boars.</b> In postnatal <b>piglets,</b> the 66 -kDa OPN band was {{detected in the}} testes, but not the 32 -kDa band. In the newborn testis, OPN immunostaining was seen in gonocytes and in some supporting cells in the seminiferous tubules, {{as well as in}} interstitial Leydig cells. In the adult boar testis, OPN immunoreactivity was detected in seminiferous tubules with varying intensities. Intense OPN immunostaining was seen in the residual bodies and acrosomes in the spermatids while, occasionally, OPN immunostaining was seen in spermatogonia and various stage of spermatocytes but in few Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules. In addition, Leydig cells in adult boars were weakly immunostained with OPN. These findings suggest that OPN is detected in the majority of germ cells and is involved in spermatogenesis in boar testis...|$|R
