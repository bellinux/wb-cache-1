5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle <b>brake</b> (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the <b>brake</b> {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle <b>brake.</b> Other sources mention the muzzle <b>brake</b> was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>braking</b> torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic <b>braking</b> and regenerative <b>braking</b> system. The <b>braking</b> torque distribution strategy is proposed based on the required <b>braking</b> torque and the regenerative <b>braking</b> system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required <b>braking</b> torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque required for the anti-lock <b>braking</b> system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions are classified as the emergency <b>braking</b> and the normal <b>braking.</b> In the case of emergency <b>braking,</b> the required <b>braking</b> torque is to be equal to the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque. In the case of normal <b>braking,</b> the command <b>braking</b> torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required <b>braking</b> torque is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque and the command <b>braking</b> torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good <b>braking</b> performance when the required <b>braking</b> torque is smaller than the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, the whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by the regenerative <b>braking</b> system; when the required <b>braking</b> torque is bigger than the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, the whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by both the hydraulic <b>braking</b> system and the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, while the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper elaborates a {{mathematical}} model {{with a view to}} carrying out a study into the dynamics of wheeled tractors during <b>braking.</b> The <b>braking</b> dynamics is analyzed by considering two versions for the <b>braking</b> system: 1) <b>braking</b> applied on the rear axle and 2) <b>braking</b> applied on all four wheels. The mathematical model enables us to graphically illustrate the evolution of the following parameters: <b>braking</b> deceleration, <b>braking</b> speed and the distance traveled by the tractor during <b>braking.</b> The mathematical model elaborated is applied on a 4 x 4 tractor with engine power of 58 kW.

50|$|Threshold <b>braking</b> and Cadence <b>braking</b> are two manual {{techniques}} used to extract maximum deceleration from a vehicle. Threshold <b>braking</b> maintains a steady <b>braking</b> force with slight (10-20%) slip, around or {{just below the}} point of maximum tire grip force. Cadence <b>braking</b> accepts that holding the threshold <b>braking</b> limit is exceptionally hard, and relies on manual manipulation of <b>braking</b> force to rapidly go just {{above and below the}} skid point, essentially oscillating between unlocked rolling and locked skidding around the point at which threshold <b>braking</b> would be done. This is less effective than threshold <b>braking</b> but much easier to learn.|$|R

The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform.

40|$|A new {{cooperative}} <b>braking</b> {{control strategy}} (CBCS) is proposed for a parallel {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) with both a regenerative <b>braking</b> system and an antilock <b>braking</b> system (ABS) to achieve improved <b>braking</b> performance and energy regeneration. The <b>braking</b> system of the vehicle {{is based on a}} new method of HEV <b>braking</b> torque distribution that makes the antilock <b>braking</b> system work together with the regenerative <b>braking</b> system harmoniously. In the cooperative <b>braking</b> control strategy, a sliding mode controller (SMC) for ABS is designed to maintain the wheel slip within an optimal range by adjusting the hydraulic <b>braking</b> torque continuously; to reduce the chattering in SMC, a boundary-layer method with moderate tuning of a saturation function is also investigated; based on the wheel slip ratio, battery state of charge (SOC), and the motor speed, a fuzzy logic control strategy (FLC) is applied to adjust the regenerative <b>braking</b> torque dynamically. In order to evaluate the performance of the cooperative <b>braking</b> control strategy, the <b>braking</b> system model of a hybrid electric vehicle is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK. It is found from the simulation that the cooperative <b>braking</b> control strategy suggested in this paper provides satisfactory <b>braking</b> performance, passenger comfort, and high regenerative efficiency...|$|R
