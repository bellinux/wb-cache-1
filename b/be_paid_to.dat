5|$|After long negotiations, Portugal {{signed a}} treaty with Brazil on 29 August 1825 {{in which it}} {{recognized}} Brazilian independence. Except for the recognition of independence, the treaty provisions were at Brazil's expense, including a demand for reparations to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> Portugal, with no other requirements of Portugal. Compensation was to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> all Portuguese citizens residing in Brazil for the losses they had experienced, such as properties which had been confiscated. JoãoVI was also given the right to style himself emperor of Brazil. More humiliating was that the treaty implied that independence had been granted as a beneficent act of JoãoVI, rather than having been compelled by the Brazilians through force of arms. Even worse, Great Britain was rewarded for its role in advancing the negotiations by the signing of a separate treaty in which its favorable commercial rights were renewed and by the signing of a convention in which Brazil agreed to abolish slave trade with Africa within four years. Both accords were severely harmful to Brazilian economic interests.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 10th century, two powers had come to dominate the Balkans: the Byzantine Empire controlled the south of the peninsula and the coasts, and the Bulgarian Empire held the central and northern Balkans. The early decades of the century were dominated by Tsar Simeon(r. 893–927), who expanded his empire at Byzantium's expense in a series of wars and secured for himself recognition of his imperial title. Simeon's death in May 927 was soon followed by a rapprochement between the two powers, formalized with a treaty and a marriage alliance later that same year. Simeon's second son and successor, Peter I(r. 927–969), married Maria, the granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor Romanos I Lekapenos(r. 920–944), and his imperial title was recognized. An annual tribute (which the Byzantines termed a subsidy for Maria's upkeep, to save face) was agreed to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the Bulgarian ruler in exchange for peace.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, {{as well as all}} jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
