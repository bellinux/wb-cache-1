40|$|Two novel benzimidazole-attached spiro[benzofluorene] derivatives, 2, 2 '-(spiro[benzo[c]fluorine- 7, 9 '-fluorene]- 5, 9 -diylbis(4, 1 -phenylene)) bis(1 -phenyl- 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole) and 2, 2 '-(spiro[benzo-[de] anthracene- 7, 9 '-fluorene]- 2 ', 3 -diylbis(4, 1 -phenylene)) bis(1 -phenyl- 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole), were {{prepared}} by a Suzuki coupling reaction. Their photophysical and photochemical properties were studied systemically. The fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes were fabricated by {{using them as}} the emitters, all of them showed strong blue emission. Interestingly, from the <b>benzoanthracene</b> derived compound a high color purity was found with Commission de L'Eclairage 1931 chromaticity coordinates of (0. 15, 0. 10) and an efficiency of 1. 96 cd/A. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{this is the first time}} to obtain a deep-blue emission with spiro[benzofluorene] derivative in a nondoped device. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
