40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} for a risk analysis for leakages of flammable refrigerants into a poorly ventilated three-dimensional space. It also presents several test cases of risk analyses on flammability and ignitions to a leaked refrigerant. Concentration of a leaked flammable refrigerant at a leakage window, Cin, {{is determined by}} mass balance, providing information on the capacity of an air-refrigerant mixture, and the leakage rate. Five flammable refrigerants, 2, 3, 3, 3 -tetrafluoropropene (R- 1234 yf), difluoromethane (R- 32), 1, 1 -difluoroethane (R- 152 a), propane (R- 290), and ammonia (R- 717) {{have been used to}} analyze risk <b>of</b> <b>ignitions</b> and flammability. A computational fluid mechanics (CFD) technique has been applied to the present risk analyses, and temporal development of velocity, concentration, and temperature profiles of an air-refrigerant mixture in a three-dimensional space are computed. The obtained concentration profiles are compared with the lower flammability limits to analyze detailed risk <b>of</b> <b>ignitions</b> and flammability. The results of this study demonstrate that risk <b>of</b> <b>ignitions</b> can be investigated successfully based on the current CFD technique. This study furthermore shows that risk <b>of</b> <b>ignitions</b> and flammability is different depending on the flammability characteristics of each refrigerant. This study proposes an indicator, the Safety Index, to evaluate risk <b>of</b> <b>ignitions</b> in individual cases easily as screening of flammability without performing threedimensional calculations based on a CFD technique...|$|R
