5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed to <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group. Nihonium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, and <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.

5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern.

5|$|Some non-aqueous {{solvents}} can <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> acids. An acidic solvent {{will increase}} basicity of substances dissolved in it.

5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E

5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> {{if they were}} free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} studies of {{condensed}} states of matter was by English chemist Humphry Davy, in {{the first decades of}} the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty chemical elements known at the time, twenty-six had metallic properties such as lustre, ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity. This indicated that the atoms in John Dalton's atomic theory were not indivisible as Dalton claimed, but had inner structure. Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as nitrogen and hydrogen could be liquefied under the right conditions and would then <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> metals.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations {{stem from a}} {{clerical}} paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E
5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E
