By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} {{represents}} an initial attempt {{to assess the}} role of apathy in motivated decision making on the Iowa Gambling Task. Clinical descriptions of patients with apathy highlight deficits in the cognitive, emotional and behavioural aspects of goal directed activity, yet standard neurocognitive tests of these measures fail to demonstrate reliable sensitivity to the disorder. Available research suggests the Iowa Gambling Task is a robust test of complex emotional socio-executive processes involved in motivational decision making, which can analogue real-world goal-directed behaviour. Methods We ask whether performance on the Iowa Gambling Task can distinguish <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients with apathy symptoms from 1) <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients without apathy and 2) neurologically intact controls. Overall, 22 healthy adults and 29 <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients took part in this study. Results <b>Brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients with apathy were distinctively impaired on the Iowa Gambling Task compared to both non-apathetic <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients and neurologically intact healthy controls. On the other hand, standard measures for the cognitive control of behaviour failed to show this sensitivity. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the Iowa Gambling Task is sensitive {{to the presence of}} apathy symptoms. We discuss these findings in terms of neurocognition deficits in apathy and the related implications for rehabilitation and clinical intervention. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{updating}} process, {{which consists}} of building mental models and adapting them to the changes occurring in the environment, is impaired in neglect patients. A simple rock-paper-scissors experiment was conducted in our lab to examine updating impairments in neglect patients. The results of this experiment demonstrate {{a significant difference between}} the performance of healthy and <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> participants. While healthy controls did not show any difficulty learning the computer’s strategy, right <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients failed to learn the computer’s strategy. A computational modeling approach is employed to help us better understand the reason behind this difference and thus learn more about the updating process in healthy people and its impairment in right <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients. Broadly, we hope to learn more about the nature of the updating process, in general. Also the hope is that knowing what must be changed in the model to “brain-damage” it can shed light on the updating deficit in right <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients. To do so I adapted a pattern detection method named “ELPH” to a reinforcement-learning human decision making model called “RELPH”. This model is capable of capturing the behavior of both healthy and right <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> participants in our task according to our defined measures. Indeed, this thesis is an effort to discuss the possible differences among these groups employing this computational model...|$|R

5|$|However, {{although}} no structural <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses.

5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, <b>brain</b> <b>damage,</b> cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E

40|$|Processing of {{temporal}} information may {{require the use}} of spatial attention to represent time along a mental time line.

Right <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients presented time underestimation deficits, that were significantly greater in patients with neglect than in patients without neglect. PA inducing leftward attentional deviation reduced time underestimation deficit in patients with neglect. The results support the hypothesis that a right hemispheric network has a role, per se, in time perception. Moreover, they suggest that right hemisphere is important in time perception for its control of spatial attention, engaged in spatial representation of time. Procedures that ameliorate left spatial deficits could also be useful for modulating temporal deficits in right <b>brain</b> <b>damaged</b> patients with neglec...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E

In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury.
