50|$|Several {{protection}} schemes {{have been}} proposed in the literature to protect the multicast connections. The simplest idea to protect the multicast tree from single fiber failure is to compute a link disjoint backup tree. In Fig 2 a multicast session from source node F to destination nodes A,B,C,D and E forms a light tree. F is the root and the remaining nodes are the leaves. The primary light tree is shown in solid lines and (directed-link-disjoint) the <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>light</b> tree is shown in dotted lines carrying traffic from source node to destinations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970 a {{facelift}} {{included a}} grille with 13 vertical blades {{set against a}} delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color {{to give it a}} more refined look. Narrow vertical [...] "vee" [...] tail lights were seen again, but now had additional smaller V-shaped bottom lenses pointing downward below the bumper. Wheel discs and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Exterior distinctions came from a DeVille script above the rear end of the belt molding and from the use of long rectangular <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>light</b> lenses set into the lower bumper as opposed to the smaller square lens used on the Calais. A new feature was a body color border {{around the edge of the}} vinyl top covering, when this option was ordered. 1970 was the last model year for pillared sedans until hardtops were permanently dropped in 1977. It was also the last year the DeVille ever offered the convertible body style. A total of 181,719 DeVilles were sold, accounting for 76% of all Cadillacs. Never again would Cadillac sales be dominated to such a degree by a single model.|$|E

50|$|The Thunderbird for 1961 {{introduced}} several firsts for {{the automotive}} market. The most distinctive {{feature of the}} 1961 to 1963 Thunderbirds was the highly touted 'Swing Away' steering wheel. With the transmission in the park position the steering wheel would slide approximately 18 in to the right allowing the driver to exit the vehicle easily. Other innovations include a floating rear view mirror. Common on all autos produced today, this feature was first found on 1961 Thunderbirds. Depending on variable options Thunderbirds for 1961 could be purchased with options like air conditioning, power windows, power seats, AM radio, fender skirts and white wall tires. Several standard features, like power steering and power brakes, <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>lights</b> and bucket seats were costly options on most other autos.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, {{to commemorate}} the 50th anniversary of Cadillac, the V-shaped hood and deck emblems were done as gold castings. The grille {{wraparound}} panels were redesigned once again having broad chrome trim below each headlight with side scoop styling and gold-colored winged emblem mounted in the center. <b>Back</b> <b>up</b> <b>lights</b> were now standard equipment and were incorporated in the taillights. At the rear all Cadillacs adopted a through the bumper dual exhaust system. Although all Series 75 had been Fleetwood bodied since 1938 {{it was not until}} 1952 that Fleetwood script appeared on the rear deck lid. Equipment features were the same and no business sedans were built. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190 hp (142 kW) for 1952. It would borrow the bumper bullets (or dagmars) as a styling cue from the 1951 Le Sabre show car.|$|R

New standard features included self-winding clocks, improved direction signal indicators, glare proof mirrors, stannate treated pistons, and four barrel carburetion. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190 hp (142 kW). Sales fell to 70,255, but with the Series 61 out of the way, Series 62 sales accounted for a record 78% of all Cadillacs.|$|R

40|$|DHHS publication; no. (NIOSH) 97 - 110 This Alert {{described}} six fatal incidents involving moving {{refuse collection}} vehicles and offered recommendations for preventing such incidents. Between 1980 and 1992, 450 workers aged 16 or older died in incidents related to refuse collection. Of these, 303 (67 %) were vehicle related deaths, 110 occurring when the worker slipped or fell from a refuse collection vehicle, was struck or {{run over by}} the vehicle, or fell and was struck or run over by the refuse collection vehicle. Eighteen percent occurred while the refuse collection truck was <b>backing</b> <b>up.</b> Safety procedures include maintaining visual contact between the driver and workers on foot, checking both side mirrors repeatedly when backing, using a reliable spotter positioned to see both driver and any blind spots when backing, using standard hand signals when backing, stopping the truck if the spotter must change positions, immediately stopping the maneuver if visual contact with the spotter is lost, and remaining clear of {{the rear of the}} vehicle when the <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>lights</b> are on or alarm is sounding.

5000|$|Cadillac was restyled and {{re-engineered}} for 1961. The Eldorado Biarritz convertible was technically reclassified as a subseries of the De Ville (Series 6300), {{a status}} {{it would keep}} through 1964. An Eldorado convertible would remain in the Cadillac line through 1966, but its differences {{from the rest of}} the line would be generally more modest. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The Eldorado Biarritz featured front series designation scripts and a lower body [...] "skeg" [...] trimmed with a thin three quarter length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>lights,</b> windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, 6-way power bench seat or bucket seats, power vent windows, whitewall tires, and remote control trunk lock. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available.

50|$|The 260Z {{claimed a}} few updates and {{improvements}} over the 240Z. The climate controls were more sensibly laid out {{and easier to}} work, and those cars with air conditioning now had the A/C system integrated into the main climate control panel. There was also additional stiffness in the chassis due to a redesign of the chassis rails which were larger and extended further back than previous models. A rear sway bar was added as well. The 260Z debuted a redesigned dashboard and console, {{as well as new}} seat trim, and door panels for the interior. The tail lights were updated, moving the <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>lights</b> from the main tail light housing to the back panel. Early 1974 US 260Z models had bumpers that resembled those of the earlier 240Z, though increased slightly in size, pushed away from the body somewhat, and wearing black rubber bumper guards rather that the previous chrome bumper guards with rubber strips. These early cars still had the front turn signals located below the bumpers. Late 1974 U.S. 260Z models (often referred to as 1974.5 models) carried the heavier bumpers that would remain on the 1975-76 model years of the 280Z so as to be in compliance with United States bumper legislation in 1973. These late cars had the front turn signals relocated to the outer edges of the front grill, above the bumper.|$|R

50|$|Watson rebounded {{from the}} defeat to O'Donnell with a points win over {{journeyman}} Matt Scriven 21 August 2009 {{and a second}} round stoppage of Swiss boxer Riad Menasria on 27 November 2009. Prior to the fight with Menasria, Watson had {{said that he was}} looking to compete at light welterweight in the future and wanted to meet reigning British champion Lenny Daws. On 19 February 2010 in his first fight of the new year, Watson travelled to Stoke and stopped former British title challenger |Barrie Jones in 4 rounds. His chance to regain a championship belt came just over one full year since his defeat to O'Donnell. Given just two days notice Watson stepped in to fight Ugandan boxer Badru Lusambya on 16 April 2010 for the light middleweight version of the Commonwealth belt. Despite having never fought at the higher weight before, Watson put his opponent down 4 times in the second round to win a convincing victory. Despite the victory and the title Watson chose to move back down to welterweight for his next contest on 16 July 2010 after deciding that light middleweight was perhaps not his ideal weight. His opponent, the Ghanain journeyman Stephen Okine was stopped in the fifth round on the undercard of a bill that saw former victim Matthew Hatton retain his European title with a victory over his mandatory challenger Yuriy Nuzhnenko. On 6 November 2010 Watson moved <b>back</b> <b>up</b> to <b>light</b> middleweight at the Castle Leisure Center in Bury to register a win against Romanian journeyman Vasile Surcica, putting him down in the 8th round but failing to stop him inside the distance and scoring an 8 round points win.|$|R
