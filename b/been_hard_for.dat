25|$|Green dealt {{only with}} the plan for invasion, as no details on any subjugation of the {{population}} and eventual conquest of the entire island were included. Among the Irish population, however, there was an element of support for the Third Reich due to resentment of British rule. Sketchiness with regards to the plan has contributed to an assessment that it was more a diversionary attack than actual attempt to take over the island, although once committed it may have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the German forces to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|By {{separating}} Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud {{wanted to}} capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities {{and turn it into}} political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to manipulate it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to lure Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again.|$|E

Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
500|$|One of the inspirations {{behind the}} {{creation}} of the game was technological advances that made it possible to implement certain elements that could not be done in previous Mario games. Satoru Iwata explained that [...] "since 1996, when Mario appeared in 3D in Super Mario 64, it's always <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> players to judge how to jump and hit a block floating in a 3D space," [...] musing that the Nintendo 3DS autostereoscopy allowed for this issue to be fixed. The development team, which only had experience developing on consoles rather than handhelds, first tried playing Super Mario Galaxy 2 on a small television monitor. When it was found that Mario was too small to see and thus difficult to control, 3D Lands camera system and level terrain needed to be designed for viewing on the small Nintendo 3DS screen, making it easier for players to keep track of Mario. Certain aspects of gameplay were inspired by Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda franchise, including the way that the camera functioned during certain moments. Ideas that were ultimately not incorporated into 3D Land included a pro skater suit for Mario, the ability to change Mario's size to the extreme, and a feature that replaces Princess Peach's face with a photographed face. The game's title was chosen as an homage to the Super Mario Land games released on the Game Boy.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's better for me to play a lot, but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} the subject matter of Jarrell's work, the scholar Stephen Burt observed, [...] "Randall Jarrell's best-known poems are poems about the Second World War, poems about bookish {{children}} and childhood, and poems, such as 'Next Day,' in the voices of aging women." [...] Burt also succinctly summarizes the essence of Jarrell's poetic style as follows: [...] Jarrell's stylistic particularities have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> critics to hear and describe, both because the poems call readers' attention instead to their characters and because Jarrell's particular powers emerge so often from mimesis of speech. Jarrell's style responds to the alienations it delineates by incorporating or troping speech and conversation, linking emotional events within one person's psyche to speech acts that might take place between persons[...] [...]Jarrell's style pivots on his sense of loneliness and on the intersubjectivity he sought as a response.|$|E
2500|$|It {{would have}} <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> anyone {{to step into}} the shoes of Dr Price, but the {{minister}} from 1778 to his death in 1799 was a remarkable character in his own right. Joseph Towers was born in about 1738, the son of a poor bookseller, and was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Goadby of Sherborne. [...] Lacking formal education, he read all he could and educated himself, eventually writing learned works such as Criminal Libel and the Duty of Juries, and being awarded a Doctor of Law degree by Edinburgh University. Towers assisted fellow minister Andrew Kippis in developing the Biographia Britannica, a forerunner of the Dictionary of National Biography. [...] He was secretary of the highly respectable Society for Constitutional Information, which lobbied for political liberties, but it was suppressed by the authorities, who lived in fear of the Reign of Terror crossing the Channel. Towers was put under arrest until the Archbishop of Canterbury intervened on his behalf.|$|E

Jack Branning was introduced in October 2007, and his association with Ronnie was developed after he became her business partner at the soap's club, [...] "R". A flirtatious romance was established, {{which led to the}} start of a relationship in early 2008. The on-screen affair between Ronnie and Jack has reportedly <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> actors Samantha Womack and Scott Maslen, as off-screen they are close friends – Womack's husband is best friends with Maslen, and Womack is best friends with Maslen's wife. Womack has commented, [...] "I was very honest and verbal about [...] Our first kissing scene felt really uncomfortable, it was terrible, but we're over it now [...] Both our sons are slightly freaked out that one mummy seems to be kissing the other daddy, but they've been on so many film sets that they're used to us doing ludicrous things." ...|$|E
