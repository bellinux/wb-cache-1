50|$|Planned {{originally}} for RAF use, Horham airfield {{was provided}} to the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force in 1942. Two T-2 hangars were erected {{on the south side}} of the airfield and painted in <b>black</b> and <b>dark</b> earth <b>shadow</b> shading camouflage in contrast to later airfields where the hangars were finished in tar varnish. The technical site was adjacent to the two hangars beside the B1117 road to Eye. Station headquarters, administrative buildings and dispersed living sites were temporary constructions chiefly of to the west of the airfield in the parish of Denham.

50|$|Lyndhurst was the set for {{the movies}} House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1970) and Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1971), both based on the gothic soap opera <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows.</b>|$|R

The DVD and Blu-ray release of Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> and House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> {{were the first}} film {{to be released in}} the US with a GP rating.|$|R
50|$|While not {{appearing}} on <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> during those times, {{he appeared on}} Love Is a Many Splendored Thing as Jock Porter and Hidden Faces as Sharkey Primrose. He reunited with his <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> co-stars for the 1970 House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> as Willie Loomis, and, in 1971, with Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> as Alex Jenkins.|$|R
50|$|The 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic {{soap opera}} <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> was heavily {{inspired}} by Rebecca. Also the second <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> motion picture, Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> took {{inspiration from the}} novel.|$|R
50|$|The pilot never aired because The WB {{passed on}} the series. It was {{screened}} at a 2005 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> festival in Los Angeles, with subsequent showings at the 2006 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> 40th Anniversary Festival in Brooklyn, New York, the 2008 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> Festival in Burbank, California and the 2009 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> Festival in Elizabeth, New Jersey.|$|R
5000|$|Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> {{was not as}} {{successful}} as House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows.</b>|$|R
50|$|While on <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> she {{appeared}} in two films based on the series - House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1970) and Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1971). The series itself was canceled in April 1971. She appeared {{in a total of}} four hundred and five episodes.|$|R
5000|$|Several plot {{elements}} of this adaptation were also present in the storyline about Barnabas Collins in <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> specifically that Lucy was Dracula's lost love reborn. In <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> Barnabas Collins would find women looking like his love Josette. Dan Curtis was the producer of the original <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> series, and he carried the love story in his TV show into the 1970 film House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> and the TV remake 20 years later.|$|R
50|$|After {{appearing}} in the MGM film House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> Briscoe left <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> abruptly in 1970, suffering a mental breakdown.|$|R
50|$|All of the novels, {{with the}} {{exception}} of House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> were part of one shared continuity separate from the history supplied in the original television series. House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> was an adaptation of the MGM film, House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> and as such, represented a separate continuity.|$|R

30|$|Specific {{attention}} can {{be devoted}} to the way shadows and light are executed in the miniature. It is particularly striking that even in some tiny details, light and shadows have been applied as very thin layers. This is shown for the red fruit in Fig.  4 : on the vermilion where gold paint has been applied on the left as a highlight, and on the right a thin glaze of brazil-wood was used to create an initial degree of shadow. A fourth pigment has been used, carbon <b>black,</b> for a <b>darker</b> <b>shadow</b> to model {{the hole in the}} fruit. On the characters’ clothes such precise detailed work is also observed: a thin layer of the iron–copper–zink ink, the same as used for the text, is used for the shadows (as revealed by the comparison of light/dark zones on the blue dress of Fortune). It is difficult to state whether the ink has also been used to model shadows on the faces as the X-ray beam size does not allow us to resolve such tiny details; however the macrophotographs reveal the same type of hatching on the faces and on the clothes which would indicate that the same material was used (Fig.  3 d).|$|R
50|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> was {{released}} on May 11, 2012. Depp stars in and produces this gothic film based on the <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> TV series; Tim Burton directs.|$|R

50|$|Blackburn {{appeared}} in the motion pictures The Violators, Pretty Poison, Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> and Man on a Swing. Clarice was asked to bring her <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> character, Mrs. Johnson, {{to the big screen}} in House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> but at the time she was under contract to The Secret Storm and her schedule on the soap was too heavy for her to get away for the filming. The role was instead played by actress Barbara Cason, who was married to <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> actor Dennis Patrick.|$|R
50|$|Warner Home Video {{announced}} the re-release of both films on DVD in 2012; House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> was released {{for the first}} time alongside Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> on DVD and Blu-ray on October 30, 2012.
