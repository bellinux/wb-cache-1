25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the Ownership society, {{premised on the}} concepts of individual accountability, smaller government, and the owning of property. Critics have argued this contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis, by encouraging home ownership for those unable to afford them and insufficient regulation of financial institutions. The number of economic regulation governmental workers was increased by 91,196, whereas <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> cut down the number by 969.|$|E

25|$|Netanyahu unsuccessfully {{called for}} the early release of Jonathan Pollard, an American serving a life {{sentence}} for passing secret U.S. documents to Israel in 1987. He has raised the issue at the Wye River Summit in 1998, where he claimed that U.S. President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> privately agreed to release Pollard. In 2002, Netanyahu visited Pollard at his North Carolina prison. The Israeli Prime Minister maintained contact with Pollard's wife, and was active in pressing the Obama administration to release Pollard.|$|E
25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the Independent Counsel Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair that <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> with Monica Lewinsky. After several years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged that Bill Clinton lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|E
25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics {{that you had to}} offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E

500|$|President-elect <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> {{vowed to}} {{assemble}} {{an administration that}} [...] "looked like America", and it was widely assumed {{that one of the}} major cabinet posts would go to a woman. [...] In particular, he wanted to nominate one for the position of United States Attorney General, something women's political action groups were also requesting. [...] No woman had previously served in this post. [...] His choice, whose nomination was announced on December 24, 1992, was Zoë Baird, a 40-year-old senior vice president and general counsel at Aetna Life and Casualty Company who had previously worked in the Justice Department during the Carter administration.|$|E
500|$|Bill Oakley, who was {{a writer}} on The Simpsons at the time, {{came up with the}} idea for [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] two years before {{production}} began. Oakley got the inspiration for the episode after the feud between the Bushes and the Simpson family, and two years later when he and Josh Weinstein became showrunners of The Simpsons, they assigned Ken Keeler to write it. Oakley said that <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> been President of the United States for two years at the point when the episode went into production, so the feud had [...] "faded off into oblivion". The staff therefore thought it would be funny if the two parties encountered each other again.|$|E
500|$|By then, Rodham {{was viewed}} as someone with a bright {{political}} future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career. Wright thought she {{had the potential to}} become a future senator or president. Meanwhile, boyfriend <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur. After failing the District of Columbia bar exam and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, [...] "I chose to follow my heart instead of my head". She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.|$|E

500|$|The {{nature of}} the contest {{fractured}} {{in the next few}} days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates, and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson, were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign. Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans. She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary, setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President [...] "needs to stop". The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E

500|$|Former US President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> been {{a member}} of the club since May 2003.

Part of the Clintons' gift for Bill's 65th {{birthday}} was a round of golf at Trump National with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.|$|R
5000|$|The Bushes and <b>Clintons</b> <b>have</b> also {{remained}} political active, {{similar to}} the Kennedy family, even when not holding public office. Robert Reich <b>has</b> suggested that <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{is in a state}} of [...] "permanent election", due to the impeachment proceedings during his presidency and his continuing support in the campaigns of his wife Hillary Clinton. With the backing of his aide Doug Band, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> remained socially prominent through the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, something that did not sit well with one of his predecessors, Jimmy Carter. <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> spoken in support of the Democratic presidential nominee at every DNC from 2000 to 2016; by contrast the Bush family has been less active after 2009 after George W. left Bush departed the presidency, but Jeb Bush was mentioned as a presidential contender for 2012 and spoke at the RNC that year.|$|R

2500|$|Hillary Clinton {{described}} the remarks as [...] "elitist, out of touch, and frankly patronizing." [...] Noting {{he had not}} chosen his words well, Obama subsequently explained his remarks, [...] "Lately {{there has been a}} little typical sort of political flare-up, because I said something that everybody knows is true, which {{is that there are a}} whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania, in towns right here in Indiana, in my hometown in Illinois, who are bitter." [...] Obama had addressed similar themes in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose, and his strategists countered that <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> made similar comments in 1991.|$|E

Clifton-based community groups like the Staten Island Liberian Community Association (SILCA) have become politically active in defending the estimated 3,600 Liberians across the country who are on DED status.|$|R
2500|$|On November 21, 1997, President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> signed S. 923, special {{legislation}} {{introduced by}} Senator Arlen Specter to bar McVeigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery. His body was cremated at Mattox Ryan Funeral Home in Terre Haute. His ashes {{were given to}} his lawyer, who [...] "said that the final destination of McVeigh's remains would remain privileged forever." [...] McVeigh had written that he considered having them dropped {{at the site of}} the memorial where the building once stood, but decided that would be [...] "too vengeful, too raw, too cold." [...] He had expressed willingness to donate organs, but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations.|$|E
2500|$|Brown figured {{prominently}} {{in two ways}} in the Whitewater controversy of the Clinton presidential administration. Brown was investigating Clinton. Brown was contacted by David Hale, a municipal judge facing indictment for fraud, then functioning as a paid informant for the FBI. Under the auspices of Citizens United, Brown issued letters to 100,000 donors to Citizens United, asking for money and {{saying that he had}} proof that President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> engaged [...] "in a massive cover-up and conspiracy to obstruct justice" [...] in the investigations surrounding the Whitewater controversy. At the same time that Brown was investigating the Clintons, he was using the tax-exempt status of Citizens United to acquire funds, urging his donors to fill out an [...] "emergency impeachment" [...] survey, utilizing a push-poll technique. Brown's fundraising literature said, [...] "Our top investigator, David Bossie, is on the inside directing the probe as Special Assistant to U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth on the U.S. Senate Whitewater Committee." ...|$|E
2500|$|The recess {{appointment}} {{came about}} {{due to a}} more urgent problem: the long-stalled nomination of William B. Gould IV, a Stanford University law professor. [...] President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> nominated Gould to the NLRB in June 1993 {{with the intention of}} naming him chair. But Gould's appointment was held up by Senator Nancy Kassebaum, who (according to the New York Times) wanted to exercise power over Republican appointments to the Board. According to Gould, Truesdale was interviewed by the Clinton administration in December 1993 and the offer of another recess appointment to the Board extended to him. The Clinton administration had allegedly discussed the Truesdale recess appointment with Kassebaum, and offered to not appoint Truesdale as chair; in return, Kassebaum would allow the Gould nomination to go forward. According to Gould, the administration also agreed to nominate Charles I. Cohen, a former NLRB attorney practicing with the law firm of Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart. The deal-making appeared to have worked, as Kassebaum relented on February 19, 1994. Gould was confirmed, 58 to 38, by the Senate on March 2, 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{president}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> praised Huckabee {{and stated}} {{that he is a}} rising star in the Republican Party. <b>Clinton</b> and Huckabee <b>have</b> collaborated on initiatives such as the fight against childhood obesity.
