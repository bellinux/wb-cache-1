In 2009, city councillor John Rogers proposed that the Portway be closed to motor traffic on summer Sundays to allow cycling in a car free environment. In 2015, the Portway was closed for five consecutive Sundays over May and June.

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying [...] "He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it.

[...] Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, [...] "both literally and figuratively in touch with the forest;" [...] which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says [...] "Listen, I will you well" [...] before leaving his colleagues. Le Guin makes another reference to Marvell's poetry at {{the conclusion}} of the story, which refers to the notion of a planetary consciousness. Marvell's poem [...] "The Garden" [...] speaks of [...] "a green thought in a green shade"; Le Guin describes World 4470 as [...] "one <b>big</b> <b>green</b> thought." [...] Le Guin's depiction of the planetary vegetative intelligence is of something that is [...] "whole, undifferentiated and unconscious." [...] Thus, it finds the very concept of other beings terrifying, and it is qualitatively different from animal intelligences.|$|E
