5|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, the Swedish FA {{experimented with}} the {{competition}} format: between 1982 and 1990, the Swedish championship {{was given to}} the winners of a play-off held between the four best-placed Allsvenskan teams. A championship league was contested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> six clubs in the league in 1991 and 1992. The pre-1982 format was then restored. Malmö FF won Allsvenskan a record five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, but only won the play-offs in 1986 and 1988. After a brief successful period in the mid-1990s, the club began to decline in Allsvenskan and found themselves relegated in 1999, the first time since 1936 they were out of the top division. The team were relegated to the newly created Superettan.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} puzzles, Barth {{wanted to}} keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player {{to come to a}} solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the tutorials provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained baffled as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of the game from these tutorials such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard. He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments and discussions on the previous games.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{football}} champions are {{the winners}} of the primary football competition in Spain, La Liga. The league is contested on a round robin basis and the championship awarded to the team that is top of the league {{at the end of the}} season. La Liga, first established in 1929, originally contained ten teams. Before La Liga's organization, the Copa del Rey—a regionalised cup competition—was effectively the national championship. La Liga is contested in by 20 teams; the three lowest-placed teams are relegated to the Segunda División and replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> three teams in that division. Of the founding teams in La Liga, only Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao have not been relegated. The league was cancelled between 1936 and 1939 because of the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|When Q3 was contested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> ten drivers, Nico Rosberg was {{the first}} to set a time, but Hamilton {{immediately}} went faster, setting a time of 1:23.397, which eventually secured him pole position. Again, both Ferrari drivers went faster than Rosberg, being about three-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. During the last timed runs, Räikkönen moved ahead of Vettel to qualify on the front row, while Rosberg improved his time, but stayed in fourth on the grid. He would later refer to his old power unit as the main reason for his qualifying performance. Nico Hülkenberg posted a time good enough for ninth, but his car came to a halt at the pit lane entrance, after his team had miscalculated the fuel put into his car. The two Williams of Massa and Bottas qualified fifth and sixth respectively, with Hülkenberg's teammate Pérez behind them in seventh, ahead of Romain Grosjean. Marcus Ericsson rounded up the top ten, but was later dropped to twelfth on the grid for impeating Hülkenberg in Q1. It was Hamilton's eleventh pole position in twelve races in the season so far.|$|E
