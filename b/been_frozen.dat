5|$|Kesselring's own {{trial began}} in Venice on 17 February 1947. The British Military Court was {{presided over by}} Major General Sir Edmund Hakewill-Smith, {{assisted}} by four lieutenant colonels. Colonel Richard C. Halse – who had already obtained {{the death penalty for}} von Mackensen and Kurt Mälzer – was the prosecutor. Kesselring's legal team was headed by Hans Laternser, a skilful German lawyer who specialised in Anglo-Saxon law, had represented several defendants at the Nuremberg Trials, and would later go on to represent Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein. Kesselring's ability to pay his legal team was hampered because his assets had <b>been</b> <b>frozen</b> by the Allies, but his legal costs were eventually met by friends in South America and relatives in Franconia.|$|E

5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010. Noriega's lawyers {{claimed the}} La Santé Prison, {{at which he}} was held, was unfit {{for a man of}} his age and rank; the French {{government}} refused to grant him prisoner of war status, which he had in the United States. On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) that had long <b>been</b> <b>frozen</b> in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid $6,000 to {{taxidermist}} Sergio Vigilato {{to preserve}} the dress. It had <b>been</b> <b>frozen</b> following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor once it was defrosted. It was treated with bleach, formaldehyde and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so {{to give it the}} same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.|$|E

Willow accidentally turns a troll into an eborsisk, a massive, fire-breathing, two-headed monster-like dragon that turns the tide of the battle, and Airk arrives with his army to assist. However, Kael captures Elora and returns to Nockmaar, where he reports Sorsha's betrayal to Bavmorda.|$|E

50|$|A piece {{which is}} {{adjacent}} in any cardinal direction to a stronger opposing piece <b>is</b> <b>frozen,</b> unless it <b>is</b> also {{adjacent to a}} friendly piece. Frozen pieces may not be moved by the owner, but may be dislodged by the opponent. A frozen piece can freeze another still weaker piece. The silver rabbit on a7 <b>is</b> <b>frozen,</b> but the one on d2 is able to move because it is adjacent to a silver piece. Similarly the gold rabbit on b7 <b>is</b> <b>frozen,</b> but the gold cat on c1 is not. The dogs on a6 and b6 do not freeze each other because they are of equal strength. An elephant cannot <b>be</b> <b>frozen,</b> since there <b>is</b> nothing stronger, but an elephant can be blockaded.|$|R
5|$|In 2002 Switzerland {{became a}} full {{member of the}} United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely {{recognised}} state without full UN membership. Switzerland is {{a founding member of}} the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has <b>been</b> <b>frozen.</b> Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during three}} flybys by Cassini on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} Enceladus' surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations. The smooth plains, which Voyager 2 had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were {{found within the}} older, cratered terrain, suggesting that the surface {{has been subjected to}} extensive deformation since the craters were formed. Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are fissures, plains, corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either Voyager spacecraft, such as the bizarre terrain near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus's interior may be liquid today, even though it should have <b>been</b> <b>frozen</b> long ago.|$|E
