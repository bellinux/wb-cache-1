5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon <b>boule</b> (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The <b>boule</b> would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's <b>boule</b> (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council.|$|E
5|$|Throughout March 2012, Architects and Touché Amoré {{supported}} Rise Against {{on their}} European tour.

Because Hillier-Brook had announced he would leave Architects on 16 April 2012 after his final performance with the band at Groezrock Festival, Josh Middleton of Sylosis joined the band as touring guitarist.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{pre-flight}} {{ground based}} investigation of crystal growth of II-VI compound semiconductors, a number of ZnSe <b>boules</b> have been grown by physical vapor transport (PVT) at Marshall Space Flight Center. <b>Boules</b> were grown in both horizontal and vertical configurations and seeded and self-seeded growth techniques were employed. As-grown and/or cleaved <b>boules</b> were examined {{by a combination of}} synchrotron white beam x-ray topography (SWBXT) and high resolution triple axis diffraction (HRTXD) to characterized the structural defects and correlate them with the growth conditions. Horizontal grown <b>boules</b> tend to grow away from the ampoule wall (contactless growth) and generally exhibit large (110) facets parallel to the gravity vector. Vertical grown <b>boules</b> grew to the full diameter of the ampoule and exhibited no faceting. X-ray topography combined with back reflection x-ray diffraction revealed the presence of lamellar twins (180 deg type about the [111] axis) in horizontal grown <b>boules</b> while vertically grown <b>boules</b> contain a few large grains, some of which are twinned. X-ray topographs and reciprocal space maps recorded from the <b>boules</b> show the better crystal quality of horizontal grown <b>boules.</b> The relationship between crystal quality and gravity vector is investigated. Further, an attempt is made to extend the Hurle theory of twin nucleation in Czochralski grown crystals to explain the twinning mechanisms in horizontal grown <b>boules...</b>|$|R

5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian {{democracy}} was restored on three separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322BC.

Other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed {{a greater degree of}} autonomy. After PhilipII conquered Amphipolis in 357BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (<b>boule),</b> and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs. Philippi, the city founded by PhilipII, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues. The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by temples and priesthoods.|$|E

25|$|Crystals {{produced}} by the Verneuil process are chemically and physically equivalent to their naturally occurring counterparts, and strong magnification is usually required {{to distinguish between the}} two. One of the telltale characteristics of a Verneuil crystal is curved growth lines (curved striae) formed as the cylindrical <b>boule</b> grows upwards in an environment with a high thermal gradient; the equivalent lines in natural crystals are parallel. Another distinguishing feature is the common presence of microscopic gas bubbles formed due to an excess of oxygen in the furnace; imperfections in natural crystals are usually solid impurities.|$|E
