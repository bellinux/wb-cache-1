5|$|However, after Detroit's {{first round}} {{loss to the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the {{following}} season, he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph's three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche would <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. The irony of the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E

25|$|Ownership of {{the airport}} has changed {{a number of times}} over the years but the airport was wholly owned by Blackpool Borough Council until 2004 when it was sold to a {{consortium}} led by Wolverhampton Airport operators City Hopper Ltd (CHAL), who operated it until May 2008 when Balfour Beatty purchased MAR Property's 95% stake; Blackpool Borough Council having retained 5%. The remaining 5% is held by Blackpool Borough Council. During 2014 Balfour Beatty claimed to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> buyer for the airport and then after just one month announced that it was to close the Airport. On 15 October 2014, the airport's terminal and Air Traffic Control provision was closed with the last scheduled flights to Dublin & Isle of Man leaving in the late afternoon. In November 2014, the former company formed a new company called Squires Gate Airport Operations Ltd and the airport reopened once again in December 2014 for non-commercial operations.|$|E
25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a few moments to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E
25|$|This {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by Creangă's rendition of interactions between his father, depicted as aloof and moody, but often amused by his boy's misbehaving, and his mother, who supervises the children directly and criticizes Ștefan for not following her lead. Indicating that he deserved the often severe punishments applied by his parents, the narrator then details his mischievousness and antics. He recounts his participation in the customs related to Saint Basil's feast (modern New Year's Day), fashioning a pig's bladder into a rattle and joining buhai players in celebrations as noisy as to irritate the settled villagers. The story also shows Nică greedily consuming all the milk his mother leaves out for souring and trying to {{blame it on the}} strigoi spirits, or bothering Chiorpec the shoemaker {{to the point where the}} aging man would punish him by covering his face in terpene. In summer, the boy plans a ruse to steal cherries from his uncle's property, and makes his way into the orchard by pretending to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cousin. Caught red-handed by his aunt and chased by her through a hemp plot, he manages to escape when she gets tangled in the plants.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Saret Koheh {{made good}} on the threats of the “Night Letter” posted in Kamdesh {{beginning}} the campaign season of 2007. It also confronted Lieutenant Colonel Kolenda commanding American forces {{in the area in}} Naray, with the fact that COIN operations in Nuristan were facing a crisis. AAF operations in the area were expanding, involving a greater proportion of the local population, and were being supported by Taliban organizations in Pakistan. American forces were strung out in a thinly held and poorly supplied picket line from Naray to Kamdesh along the Landay-Sin River. The American forces were too outnumbered to survive in sustained combat with the local population. Something had to be done to put the Americans and the Afghans of Nuristan on the same side. The first effort in a new COIN campaign was made by First Lieutenant Dave Roller. He decided that the appearance of American soldiers in their “battle rattle” war gear gave the impression of soulless killing machines. Encased in armor, helmets, and weapons, Americans appeared to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fight. As a contrast Dave attended his next meeting with the Kamdesh village leaders dressed in a T-shirt and shorts. When he spoke to them he discussed their common values as leaders of families and communities working toward a better future for their children. Mawlawi Abdul Rahman of Kamdesh was a local elder much impressed with this new approach. He began building a consensus of village elders in support of the Afghan government. Through {{the rest of the summer}} and fall of 2008, Captain Joey Hutto, the new commander of COP Keating, and his troops expanded this initiative. Hutto had worked for years on COIN campaigns in Central America, and put his skills to good use in Nuristan.|$|E
500|$|Reports of {{a planned}} sequel of Ra.One began {{surfacing}} prior to the film's release, though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown. Both Khan and Sinha admitted to formulating plans for a sequel, though the former noted {{that it would be}} [...] "presumptuous" [...] to start the sequel before the first film's release. Khan later refuted the speculations, saying that a sequel was unlikely due to his other commitments. After Ra.One won a National Award, an [...] "overjoyed" [...] Khan said that the film's world could be further explored. He stated that the sequel, if made, would be titled G.One and not Ra.Two, and that he would make it [...] "faster, bigger and better" [...] than Ra.One. Khan was reported to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> script, without a fixed release date. In April 2012, Mushtaq Sheikh said that the pre-production of the sequel had begun.

According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song has a beat of 130 {{beats per minute}} and is written in the key of A minor. Spears's vocal range spans from G3-C5. In the song, Spears seems to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman named Amy in a club. It {{has been suggested that}} Amy is either Amy Winehouse or an alter ego of Spears herself. The verses end with the hookline [...] "Hahahehehahaho", which, according to Poppy Cossins of The Sun, is fitting to [...] "the album's [...] overtone". The chorus begins with the lines [...] "Love me, hate me / Say what you want about me", a reference to the public's perception and fascination with Spears' life. This presents Spears both as [...] "an object of desire and a punching bag". According to Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, this line also alludes to the public image of British singer Amy Winehouse.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were divided}} with the {{character}} development and the storylines in Tron: Legacy. Writing for The New Yorker, Bruce Jones commented that the audience didn't connect {{with the character}}s, as they were lacking emotion and substance. [...] "Disney may <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> merchandising bonanza with this long-gestating sequel to the groundbreaking 1982 film," [...] remarked Jones, [...] "but someone in the corporate offices forgot to add any human interest to its action-heavy script." [...] Likewise, USA Today journalist Claudia Puig found Tron: Legacy to resonate with [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "unimaginative, even obfuscating" [...] dialogue, and that [...] "most of the story just doesn't scan". As Dana Stevens from Slate summed up, [...] "Tron: Legacy {{is the kind of}} sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends to put me to sleep, the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli. I confess I may have snoozed through one or two climactic battles only to be startled awake by an incoming neon Frisbee." [...] Although he proclaimed the plot of Tron: Legacy and its predecessor to be spotty, Ian Buckwater of NPR was lenient of the latter film due to its youth-friendly nature. In contrast to negative responses, Michelle Alexander of Eclipse adored the plot of Tron: Legacy, a reaction that was paralleled by Rossiter Drake from 7x7, who wrote that it was [...] "buoyed" [...] by its [...] "sometimes convoluted, yet hard to resist" [...] story. Metros Larushka Ivan-Zadeh complained about the underdeveloped plot, saying [...] "In 2010, issues surrounding the immersive nature of gaming and all-consuming power of modern technology are more pertinent than ever, so it's frustrating the script does nothing with them." [...] However, she conceded that [...] "it's the best 3D flick since Avatar and a super-groovy soundtrack by Daft Punk nonetheless makes for an awesome watch".|$|E

2500|$|The North Vietnamese Air Force began {{receiving}} the MiG-19 {{at the end}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, which ended in 1968. Despite their limited numbers, MiG-19s were involved in extensive combat during Operations Linebacker 1 and Linebacker 2 (a.k.a. the Christmas Bombing). The NVAF claimed only seven victories over U.S. aircraft, using the MiG-19, all of which were F-4 Phantom IIs. The MiG-19 was tested by U.S. pilots in the United States in 1969 after receiving a Chinese J-6 (F-6 exported model) from Pakistan. [...] In addition to finding the aircraft to have a good canopy allowing good visibility for the pilot, along with 3 hard hitting 30mm cannons, U.S. pilots found the MiG-19 (J6/F6) to be an excellent fighter, [...] "like the MiG-17, it could easily out-turn the Phantom...and could out-accelerate the F-4 out to Mach 1.2, but was slower than the MiG-21.". [...] However, the MiG-19's strongest fault was its extremely short range, as one U.S. test pilot remarked, [...] "after going in full after-burner at low altitude for 5 minutes, the MiG driver will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place to land!" [...] This, combined with the aircraft's twin engines, which were difficult to maintain, made the MiG-19 unpopular with North Vietnamese pilots.|$|E
