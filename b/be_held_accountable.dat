5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E

When their attainder had been lifted in 1558, the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father's possessions or titles. Yet on 25 and 26December 1561 Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick, and the next year received {{a large portion of the}} lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland. Warwick Castlewhich the Queen visited on her 1572 summer progressbecame his seat, while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley.

5000|$|Because many {{different}} individuals in large organizations contribute {{in many ways}} to the decisions and policies, it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results. This is what is known, following Thompson, as the problem of many hands. It creates a dilemma for accountability. If individuals <b>are</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> or responsible, individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished, or they [...] "take responsibility" [...] in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences. If only organizations <b>are</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable,</b> then all individuals in the organization are equally blameworthy or all are excused. Various solutions have been proposed. One is to broaden the criteria for individual responsibility so that individuals <b>are</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for not anticipating failures in the organization. Another solution, recently proposed by Thompson, is to hold individuals accountable {{for the design of}} the organization, both retrospectively and prospectively.|$|R
