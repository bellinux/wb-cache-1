Second on {{his team is}} Tehmton Irani, or Tammy, (Boman Irani) who is an overweight jogger and suffers from epileptic fits. It is also revealed that Tammy and Manohar were best friends. Third on the team is Rohan Singh (Vivaan Shah), a young hacker who Charlie believes can hack into Shalimar's computerized system. He is also Jag's nephew. After thoroughly researching about the vault, the team finds the main vault comprises a <b>biometric</b> <b>lock</b> (fingerprint lock). The problem is that only one person can access the vault at any time: Vicky Grover (Abhishek Bachchan), Charan's son. So they enlist {{the aid of a}} lookalike, Nandu Bhide (Abhishek Bachchan). Charlie describe his team as ek full time bewda (Nandu), ek sanki jadeya (Tammy), ek bhari banduk sipahi (Jag), ek badmaash bachcha (Rohan).|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{research}} interest in exploring how biometric data is {{and can be}} shared across online social networks. However, most existing tools for sharing <b>biometric</b> data <b>lock</b> researchers into vendor-specific solutions that cannot be easily adapted to the specific researchers' requirements, users' needs and ethical considerations. To mitigate this, we investigate the requirements for open source researcher-oriented biometric data sharing systems. Requirements were captured using: first-hand insights from two prototype deployments, a systematic review of the literature, and interviews with HCI researchers who have built such tools. The requirements thus captured were implemented in the BioShare system and insights from implementing these requirements are presented. BioShare allows users both to share data but also receive inputs from remote viewers of the data in real-time. Concurrently it provides logging capabilities for researchers to analyze system interactions...|$|R

The presented schemes enable many {{useful applications}} employing multiple users and/or multiple locking sets. Introducing the original single control fuzzy vault of Juels and Sudan we identify several {{similarities and differences}} between their vault and secret sharing schemes which influence how best to obtain working generalisations. We design multiple-control fuzzy vaults suggesting applications using <b>biometric</b> credentials as <b>locking</b> and unlocking values. Furthermore we assess the security of our obtained generalisations for insider/ outsider attacks and examine the access-complexity for legitimate vault owners...|$|R

40|$|<b>Biometric</b> door <b>lock</b> {{security}} systems are used at those {{places where you}} have important information and stuffs. In that kind of places multibiometric electronic door lock {{security systems}} {{that are based on}} finger print and iris recognization. Multibiometric door lock security systems are used to prevent the door related burglaries such as break ins occurred in different forms so this is the best method to prevent this type of happenings. Unlike keyed locks, {{there is no need to}} take the keys with you when you go out without necessary of worrying about losing keys. This paper proposes a multimodal biometrics door lock system with iris and fingerprint as a computer application for automatically identifying or verifying a person from fingerprint iris recognition system. The first stage is identification and second one is verifying that whether he is a genuine user or imposter. During second stage system compares the input set with all available stored set in database. This comparison gives a ranked list of matches. Based on the rank retrieved an alarm is activated automatically when any unauthorized person tries to open the door. So this kind of multimodal biometrics will provide a highly secured and authenticated access...|$|R
40|$|Locking folders {{effectively}} protects {{data from}} malicious programs, such as Viruses, Worms, and Trojans. Biometric template protection {{is a hot}} topic of research recently. Fuzzy vault is a recently developed construct which binds secret key (Password) and biometric information to provide template protection. In this {{paper we propose a}} <b>biometric</b> folder <b>locking</b> system using fuzzy vault for face. At the user’s side, biometric template(face) and the password are accepted from the user. At the locking stage, fuzzy vault encoding is implemented by transforming the biometric template and the password. Then, at the unlocking stage, for the biometric template claimed by the user, corresponding fuzzy vault will be checked. If it has been changed then folder unlocking will be failed. Otherwise, by decoding the fuzzy vault the key will be obtained. If the key is same as the password entered by the user, then unlocking the folder will be successful. Otherwise it will be failed. The contribution of this paper include: Instead of using the face image directly for processing, real time video for face is accepted from user and characteristic feature points will be further used for processing. No database is being used for storage of the characteristic feature points. The Galois field algorithm is used for storing the transformed values in the fuzzy vault. This will introduce difficulty in reconstructing the original values from the stored ones. The experimental results shows that the proposed scheme provides promising results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Intrinsically in {{home and}} office {{appliances}} like light and fan are controlled manually, {{which leads to}} power wastage. Even {{though there is no}} usage then also left ON and even when the appliances are in use their operation is not controlled by environmental conditions like temperature variations and daylight. By making a smart automated controlling system for appliances we can save the power by some amount. In this paper we are providing a solution for preventing the wastage of power in an adequate and cost effective way. Our system consists of a <b>biometric</b> electronic door <b>lock</b> and power saving module. When the user finger print matches in door lock, the power saving module is switched ON. The power saving module switches the appliances in the room based on the presence of the person. It also controls the power delivered to fan and light according to temperature of room and natural daylight intensity. Keywords- ARM 7 TDMI-S, Wireless RF module, LPC 2129...|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{we propose}} an unlinkable multi-instance iris {{biometric}} cryptosystem {{based on the}} improved fuzzy vault scheme. The proposed system <b>locks</b> <b>biometric</b> feature sets extracted from binary iris biometric reference data, i.e. iris-codes, of {{the left and right}} irises in a single fuzzy vault. In order to retain the size of the protected template and authentication speed, the proposed fusion step combines the most discriminative parts of two iris-codes at feature level. It is shown that the proposed key-binding process enables the generation of irreversible protected templates which prevents from previously proposed cross-matching attacks. Further, we investigate the optimal choice among potential decoding strategies with respect to biometric performance and time of key retrieval. The fully reproducible system is integrated to two different publicly available iris recognition systems and evaluated on the CASIAv 3 -Interval and the IITDv 1 iris databases. Compared to the corresponding unprotected recognition schemes, genuine match rates of approximately 95 and 97 % at which no false accepts are observed and maintained in a single- and multi-instance scenario, respectively. Moreover, the multi-iris system is shown to significantly improve privacy protection achieving security levels of approximately 70 bits at practical biometric performance.|$|R
40|$|The general {{trend of}} human nature always longing for {{security}} Physically, Mentally and Socially. Fingerprint based security access control and identity systems are used {{for all kinds of}} office and service sector operations in the day today environment. Fingerprint System based access control is more secured as compared to the conventional swipe card or ID cards because of the exclusive fingerprint for every entity. Fingerprint Systems have fascinated people for centuries. They have been used as a method of personal identification since ancient times. The two key aspects of most of the Fingerprint System biometric solutions are Finger Print identification and authentication. The process of identification tells you who an individual is, or in the negative sense tells you who they are not. Fingerprints Security is examined using two different sets of criteria. One way of looking at Fingerprint Security System is using their "Class Characteristics". Finger Print Security Systems can be used to get rid of so many issues such as Physical Access Control, Health care Biometrics, Fingerprint and Biometrics <b>Locks,</b> <b>Biometric</b> Sensors and Detectors, RFID Tags, RFID Readers, Road Barriers, RFID Smart Card, CCTV, Metal Detectors, LED Search Lights, Fire Alarm, Finger Print Movement Control, Physical Access Control, Optical Fingerprint Scanners, Optical Sensors, Card Locks Card Access Control Systems, Fingerprint Technology, Digital Fingerprint, USB Fingerprint Reader etc...|$|R
