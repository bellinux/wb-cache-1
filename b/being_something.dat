Characters sing {{for much of the}} episode, {{generally}} completing their songs rather than singing only the opening lines, and much of the story is told through the lyrics and characters' interactions through songs. The episode was quite different from other episodes of Inside No. 9 in being more upbeat in tone, lacking explicitly bloody or macabre elements, and <b>being</b> <b>something</b> of a love story. The filming experience and resulting episode was a highlight of the series for Pemberton, but raised technical challenges, in part due to simultaneous singing and talking.|$|E
