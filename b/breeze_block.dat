500|$|Jason Fox for NME {{felt that}} [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] was Oasis's {{return to the}} [...] "long lost humanism" [...] of their 1996 single [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger", because of Noel Gallagher's ability to lighten the mood of his {{audience}} {{when they are in}} need. He further wrote that the listener is transported back when [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] was released. Simon Evans for musicOMH also compared the song to [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger", writing that they have the same [...] "defiance". Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic was brief in his review of the song, simply writing that it is a [...] "pretty good power ballad". Evan Chakroff for Stylus Magazine wrote that the song was forgettable, adding that while writing his review of the album, he could not remember the melody of [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". Victoria Segal for NME wrote a single review when it was released, and believed that it was difficult to take the song seriously. Segal wrote that it is a [...] "disappointing" [...] song that when [...] "looked at in the sober light of day, it's nothing but a lachrymose slur through the Big Noel Book Of Emotional Cliches and some truly shameless piano, but you just know that come closing time, it could make a <b>breeze</b> <b>block</b> cry". BBC reviewer Chris Long stated he preferred previous single [...] "The Hindu Times" [...] but [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] delivered on the [...] "simple tunes, good strong riffs and textbook lyrics" [...] in which Gallagher specialized.|$|E
