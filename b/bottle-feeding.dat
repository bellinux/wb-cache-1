5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as <b>bottle-feeding</b> or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects. In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks. In {{areas of the world}} with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. <b>Bottle-feeding</b> of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E
25|$|The time {{commitment}} of exclusive breastfeeding {{is also an}} economic constraint. The time required per week to breastfeed rather than bottle-feed or feed solids to children can be a significant burden for women without other childcare or who need to spend this time doing paid work. However, some {{evidence suggests that the}} long-term benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the short-term costs. In the United States, workplace policy surrounding breastfeeding and parental leave often does not reflect these benefits. In addition, women are often unable to risk the loss of their jobs or loss of income due to breastfeeding adherence, so <b>bottle-feeding</b> is the best solution for the short-term.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is increasing}} worldwide and reliable animal models {{are important for}} progression of the research field. The pig is a commonly used large animal model in diabetes research and the present study aimed to refine a model for oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in young growing pigs, as well as describing intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in the same age group. The refined porcine OGTT will reflect that used in children and adolescents. Eighteen pigs were obtained one week after weaning and trained for two weeks to <b>bottle-feed</b> glucose solution, mimicking the human OGTT. The pigs subsequently underwent OGTT (1. 75 g/kg BW) and IVGTT (0. 5 g/kg BW). Blood samples were collected from indwelling vein catheters for measurements of glucose and the diabetes related hormones insulin, glucagon and active glucagon-like peptide- 1. The study confirmed that pigs can be trained to <b>bottle-feed</b> glucose dissolved in water and thereby undergo an OGTT more similar to the human standard OGTT than previously described methods in pigs. With the refined method for OGTT, oral intake only consists of glucose and water, which is an advantage over previously described methods in pigs where glucose is given together with feed which will affect glucose absorption. Patterns of hormonal secretion in response to oral and intravenous glucose {{were similar to those}} in humans; however, the pigs were more glucose tolerant with lower insulin levels than humans. In translational medicine, this refined OGTT and IVGTT methods provide important tools in diabetes research when pigs are used as models for children and adolescents in diabetes research...|$|R
25|$|Immigrant {{status in}} the United States is a {{predictor}} for breastfeeding adherence. In particular, the Hispanic paradox {{plays a role in}} the high breastfeeding rates observed among Hispanic/Latina women in the United States. Breastfeeding initiation rates among this population are higher for less acculturated immigrants; Hispanic women {{who have been in the}} United States for longer are less likely to breastfeed. This disparity does not depend on age, income level, or education level; more acculturated Hispanics are likely to cite the same reasons for <b>bottle-feeding</b> as native-born white women do. In many cases, the connection that Hispanic women feel to their culture and its values can strongly influence their decision regarding breastfeeding.|$|E

2500|$|Breastfeeding {{promotion}} is {{a movement}} that came about {{in the twentieth century}} in response to high rates of <b>bottle-feeding</b> among mothers, and in recognition of the many health benefits to both mothers and children that breastfeeding offers. While infant formula had been introduced in developed countries in the 1920s as a healthy way to feed one's children, the emergence of research on health benefits of breastfeeding precipitated the beginning of the breastfeeding promotion movement in the United States. [...] In the 1950s, La Leche League meetings began. The United States began incorporating benefits specific to breastfeeding promotion into its Women, Infants, and Children program in 1972. In 1989, WIC state agencies began being required to spend funds targeted at breastfeeding support and promotion, including the provision of education materials in different languages and the purchase of breast pumps and other supplies.

Studies have found that marketing of infant formula in hospitals makes it likelier that a woman will breastfeed for a shorter amount of time due to the perceived convenience of <b>bottle-feeding.</b> Formula companies often offer these discharge packs, as well as a general supply of formula, to hospitals at no cost, which can place some facilities at an economic disadvantage if they choose to give up these benefits. However, not accepting free formula is one of the criteria that determine whether a facility can be certified as Baby-Friendly; thus, the economic burden of giving up access to formula for free can be a significant barrier for disadvantaged facilities that wish to achieve Baby-Friendly status.|$|E

This Scottish study evaluates the role of knowledge and social influences (subjective norms, exposure to breastfeeding; social barriers) on beliefs and future intentions to breastfeed or <b>bottle-feed.</b> Social influences from family and peers are investigated. Design A cross-sectional between-subjects observational design was used. A questionnaire was administered {{to a sample of}} 229 (46 %) male and 267 (54 %) female adolescents aged 11 - 18. Setting Participants completed questionnaires during lessons at 3 secondary schools in Central Scotland. Results Knowledge about health benefits of breastfeeding was generally poor. Analyses found that perceived social barriers to breastfeeding moderated the relationship between knowledge and beliefs. More knowledge, positive beliefs and supportive subjective norms also predicted future intentions to breastfeed. Parental norms exerted greater influence than peer norms on adolescents’ breastfeeding beliefs. Conclusions Knowledge and social influences are important predictors of positive breastfeeding beliefs, and future intentions to breastfeed in adolescents.

40|$|Background: Pregnancy is {{associated}} with increased absolute amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22 : 6 n 3) in plasma phospholipids. Expressed {{as a proportion of}} total fatty acids, DHA declines slightly in late pregnancy but little information is available on the normalization of DHA postpartum, which may be different in lactating and nonlactating women. Objective: The aim was to investigate maternal plasma and ery-throcyte long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (long-chain polyenes; LCPs) postpartum, particularly DHA, in relation to lactation and dietary LCP intake. Design: Healthy pregnant women who intended to breast-feed or exclusively <b>bottle-feed</b> their infants were studied at 36 – 37 wk of pregnancy. Blood samples were collected at entry, after parturi-tion on days 2 and 5, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 wk postpar-tum. Fatty acid profiles were analyzed in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids. Dietary intakes were assessed 4 and 32 wk post-partum with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Results: After delivery, the percentages of plasma linoleic, arachi-donic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acids increased over time, whereas the percentage of docosapentaenoic acid decreased; the patterns of change did not differ significantly between the lactating and nonlactating groups. The percentage of DHA in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acids declined significantly in the 2 groups, more so in the lactating women, and was enhanced when the lactation period was extended. Despite the apparent higher dietary intake of essential fatty acids in the lactating group at week 4, it was not signifi-cantly {{different from that of the}} nonlactating group.

Thus, this qualitative descriptive study explored, {{within the context of the}} Socioecological Framework, women’s decision making on whether to breastfeed or <b>bottle-feed</b> their infants and the effect of mass media on their decision. Data were collected in individual audiotaped interviews with participants recruited from the Massachusetts Breastfeeding Coalition and UMass Memorial Medical Center.

40|$|Parental self-efficacy (PSE) {{is defined}} as "the {{expectation}} caregivers hold {{about their ability to}} parent successfully" (Jones & Prinz, 2005, p. 342). According to Bandura (1977), self-efficacy is based on four sources, including ‘performance accomplishments’: if successful experiences are repeated this can lead to increases in efficacy expectations, while repeated failures can lead to decreases. With respect to parenting, breastfeeding {{is one of the first}} experiences mothers have with their infants. Previous studies showed that self-efficacy is an important predictor of the duration and level of breastfeeding (e. g. O’Brien, Buikstra, Fallon, & Hegney, 2009). However, it can also be suggested that the association between breastfeeding and PSE is bidirectional. Based on the theoretical framework of Bandura, it could be argued that successful experiences with breastfeeding are related to an early sense of efficacy in parenting and therefore to an increase in PSE. As part of an ongoing longitudinal study 205 primiparous expecting women completed questionnaires on breastfeeding and parental self-efficacy (the Maternal Self-Efficacy in the Nurturing Role Questionnaire) at 32 weeks of pregnancy (T 1) and 3 months after birth (T 2). Prenatally (at T 1), these mothers stated that they would prefer to breastfeed as opposed to <b>bottle-feed</b> their infants. With respect to the postnatal breastfeeding questionnaire (at T 2), mothers rated on 5 -point Likert scales whether they 1) experienced breastfeeding as very difficult to very easy and 2) whether they experienced breastfeeding as very tiring to not tiring. The preliminary results of two hierarchical regression analyses, with PSE T 1 scores entered first, indicated that mothers who experienced breastfeeding as easier or less tiring increased in PSE from T 1 to T 2 (respectively =. 16, p <. 05 and =. 18, p <. 01).

African American women (AAW) continue to breastfeed the least compared to other populations. Few researchers conducting research related AAW 2 ̆ 7 s infant feeding preferences have employed the Black Feminist philosophy or the theory of self-efficacy. This philosophy and theory may offer insight into factors that influence AAW 2 ̆ 7 s infant feeding choices. The purpose of this mixed-method study was to examine prenatal breastfeeding self-efficacy (confidence) and actively listen to and analyze AAW 2 ̆ 7 s reports of factors influencing their infant feeding choice. Fifty-nine AAW in their 3 rd trimester of pregnancy completed a Prenatal Self-Efficacy questionnaire. Three to four weeks postpartum, 17 women were re-contacted and participated in individual narrative interviews. Prenatal self-efficacy scores for women who intended to breastfeed were significantly higher (M = 82. 59, SD = 12. 53) than those intending to <b>bottle-feed</b> (M = 70, SD 15. 45), p =. 001. Prenatal self-efficacy was predictive of intended feeding method (p =. 004). During the individual postpartum interviews, women disclosed various reasons and personal explanations of how they arrived at their infant feeding choices. Four of the themes from the narrative were parallel to Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s (1977) four sources of self efficacy: performance accomplishments, verbal persuasions, vicarious experiences, and physiological responses.

40|$|Young infants {{need their}} {{caregivers}} {{to help them}} regulate their affect. When the caregiver does this successfully, infants gradually learn to regulate their affect themselves. However, regulating the affect of the infant is challenging for new parents; they have to learn which methods are effective from the signals the baby emits. To interpret these signals, caregivers {{have to be in}} control of their own emotions as well, which might be more difficult if an infant is hard to soothe, since research has shown that exposure to infant cries leads to strong physiological arousal (Donovan & Leavitt, 1989). The current study investigated with a simulated cry response task whether perceptions of a crying infant and physiological reactions were influenced by difficulty of regulating the infant’s affect. We were also interested in whether this had an effect on the response latency and the amount and consistency of the caregiver’s responses. This study has been executed with first-time pregnant women, because we expected {{them to be able to}} relate to this task more than any other group of non-parent adults, while their responses were not colored by previous parenting experiences. 179 women (age 18 - 40 years) who were pregnant with their first child participated at 22 weeks of pregnancy in a computerized cry response task involving audio taped baby cries. They listened to 2 x 10 baby cries during which they could choose one of four responses (feeding, distracting, changing the diaper or picking up the infant) to terminate the cry. The first series of cries simulated an easy to regulate infant (soothing success rate 80 %, short cry duration); the second series represented a difficult to regulate infant (soothing success rate 20 %, longer cry duration). After each series, the women filled out four questions regarding their perception of the cries. Physiological reactivity was measured using the VU-AMS (De Geus & Van Doornen, 1996), an ambulatory device that records ECG and ICG, allowing calculation of indicators of sympathetic (PEP; pre-ejection period) and parasympathetic nervous system activity (RSA: respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The cries of the difficult infant were perceived as more urgent, stressful, unpleasant and piercing (p<. 01) than the cries of the easy infant. Women also gave more responses (p<. 001) and changed their responses more often (p<. 001) for the difficult infant. Perceived urgency was positively related to faster responses (p<. 01), a larger number of responses (p=. 064) and more altered responses (p<. 01). Preliminary physiological data (n= 76) showed that lower PEP (more sympathetic stress) was related to faster (p<. 05) and more responses (p<. 01). Longer, difficult to calm crying alters pregnant women’s perceptions of the meaning of the cries. Differences in perception and arousal may partly explain response tendencies to crying infants. Heightened physiological arousal may lead to excessive soothing behaviors. Nurturing Role Questionnaire) at 32 weeks of pregnancy (T 1) and 3 months after birth (T 2).

With respect to the postnatal breastfeeding questionnaire (at T 2), mothers rated on 5 -point Likert scales whether they 1) experienced breastfeeding as very difficult to very easy and 2) whether they experienced breastfeeding as very tiring to not tiring. The preliminary results of two hierarchical regression analyses, with PSE T 1 scores entered first, indicated that mothers who experienced breastfeeding as easier or less tiring increased in PSE from T 1 to T 2 (respectively =. 16, p <. 05 and =. 18, p <. 01). PSE scores at both time points were not related to breastfeeding at T 2. A subset of the mothers (n = 77) stopped to breastfeed their infants before three months of age. The mothers who indicated that they stopped earlier than planned had marginally lower PSE scores at T 2 as opposed to mothers who did not stop earlier than planned (p =. 08). For health care practices, the current findings emphasize the importance of supporting mothers’ early experiences with breastfeeding, especially since success-based efficacy beliefs are related to positive parenting and child outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} of breastfeeding {{have been well}} documented for both mother and child. Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for an infant and includes decreased risk for numerous diseases and illnesses. However, {{there is evidence that}} when mothers return back to work from maternity leave, they often stop breastfeeding. The present research project utilizes the Positive Deviance approach to find working mothers who have successfully breastfed their children exclusively for six months and to determine what enables these mothers to continue to breastfeed past one year of birth while working full time. The purpose is to understand why some working mothers, who face resistance and odds, succeed in effectively breastfeeding while most others do not. ^ Working mothers who continued to breastfeed past one year were found using snowball sampling through a local El Paso charter of an international organization, Mothers of Preschoolers (MOPS). MOPS is a support group for mothers with {{children under the age of}} five. Mothers were also found after attending a meeting for the Bi-National Breastfeeding Coalition. For a mother to be considered a Positive Deviant (PD), she will have to meet the following criteria: located in El Paso, TX, working full-time, must have exclusively breastfed for six months and introduced solid foods at six months while continuing to breastfeed for one year or beyond, and to have done so in the face of resistance from one or more friends, family or colleagues. After the PD mothers were identified, in-depth interviews were conducted to help understand what enables the working mother to breastfeed past one year. The identified communicative acts were both intrapersonal and interpersonal in nature. ^ Temporally, these communicative acts occurred for the working mothers, before the child was born, immediately after the child was born and in preparing to return to work. Before the child was born, the working mothers who were positive deviants made an active decision to breastfeed. These PD mothers would discuss their decisions with their partner and they would both come up with a “game plan” on how to make it work. In fact, a mutual decision was reached that baby formula will not be in the picture. Lastly, the PD mothers would purchase a breast pump before the birth of the child. ^ After the birth of their child, the PD mothers regularly sought the advice of lactation consultants to learn how to nurse properly. Many even called the lactation consultant after being discharged from the hospital. Mothers also learned their child’s feeding routines and cues, charting the feeding schedule, including carefully noting, which breast the child nursed from and for what duration. Mothers also figured out ways to deal with painful breasts and cracked nipples with over-the-counter products and holistic remedies. Some PD mothers worked out a night schedule with their husbands enabling them to <b>bottle-feed</b> the child breast milk that was pumped in advance. This allowed them to get at least three days of adequate sleep during the week. ^ In their preparation to return to work, most of the PD mothers were aware of their legal rights to pump milk in the workplace. Also, the PD mothers would build up a stock of pumped breast milk before returning to work. At work, the PD mothers used creative strategies to use the breast pump, and at home train caregivers on how to properly handle and administer breast milk to their child. The mothers would remind caregivers on a daily basis that her child was breastfed. If the child was under the care of a relative, the mother would go over how to properly administer breast milk through a bottle. PD mothers also nursed their child before leaving the house in the morning and soon after on arrival from work. The PD mothers clearly demonstrated the important role of communication in the various stages of breastfeeding their children. Whether it was with their spouse to gain support, or seek the advice of a lactation consultant, or train caregivers, the PD mothers employed communication as a strategic tool to engender effective breastfeeding outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MD) -University of Natal, Durban, 1999. Background: in 1987, {{the first}} child with HIV- 1 {{infection}} was identified in the paediatric wards at King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban. This made paediatricians aware that the epidemic had spread {{to the children of}} KwaZulu/Natal. Although information on transmission and natural history was becoming available from developed countries, little was known about the disease in developing countries. It was important to determine transmission rates and disease patterns in the local population, in order to appropriately counsel women, and for management of infected infants. In addition, with resources for laboratory diagnoses being limited in developing countries, much emphasis had to be placed on clinical findings for identification of infected children. In 1989, a retrospective analysis was made of the HIV-infected children seen over a 2 -year period, between 1987 and 1989. Nine such children were identified and their clinical and biochemical features were described. It was concluded that HIV infected children presented with an identifiable pattern of signs, fairly similar to that described for children in industrialised countries. With these findings, a prospective study was undertaken, to determine the vertical transmission rate, the factors affecting this rate, and natural history of vertically transmitted I-IIV- 1 infection. ix KwaZulu/Natal, being at the epicentre of the epidemic in South Africa, was a natural site for the study. Patients and Methods: a trained research worker was placed in the antenatal clinic at King Edward VIII Hospital for the specific purpose of educating, counselling, and testing of all women attending the clinic. Women attending the clinic {{for the first time in}} the index pregnancy were offered HIV testing if informed consent was obtained. Blood for HIV serology was drawn at the same time as sampling for the obligatory syphilis serology. The acceptance rate for sampling was > 95 %. The majority of the women attending the clinic were black, and first attendance was generally late, into the third trimester. The same research worker was responsible for post-test counselling which was offered to all the women, not only those who tested positive. This research worker was also responsible for obtaining maternal consent for entering the newborn infant into the study. All newborn infants were seen within 48 hours of birth. At this time they were examined, growth parameters were recorded, and initial blood samples taken. These infants were then followed-up at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, then at 3 -month intervals up to 18 months, then at 6 -month intervals. At each visit, a thorough clinical examination was performed, growth measurements taken, and development assessed. Record was made of any interim illness and visits to health centres, and of hospital admissions. Method of feeding was note& and details on immunisation obtained from the child's immunisation card. The children received all the x routine childhood immunisations according to the national regimen, based on WHO recommendations. Mothers were asked to bring the child to the follow up clinic for any problem, so that episodes of illness would not be missed. The women were reimbursed for transport costs to encourage follow up visits. Calculation of transmission rate and classification of infection status were made according to the recommendations of the Ghent workshop. Children were regarded as infected if they were antibody positive at 18 months or had an HIV related death. They were classified as uninfectd if the antibody test was negative at 9 months of age. Those infants who were lost to follow up before the age of nine months whilst still antibody positive and those whose cause of death could not be determined, were classified as indeterminate. The diagnosis of AIDS was based on the WHO criteria. Blood samples were taken at birth, at age one and three months, then at three month intervals to 18 months; thereafter at six month intervals. Sera were tested for HIV 1 antibodies by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,ELISA. Samples that tested positive were confirmed by two tests, a Roche Elisa and by an immunoflourescent assay (IFA). A sample was regarded as being positive if both the second ELISA as well as the IFA or the Western Blot tested positive. xi Results: between October 1990 and March 1993, 234 infants and their 229 mothers were entered into the study. Those who did not attend a single follow up after birth were excluded from the study. The final cohort comprised 181 infants, of whom 48 were classified as infected (including 17 deaths); 93 not infected, and 40 as indeterminate (including 8 deaths). Maternal Data: about 60 % of the mothers were under 30 years of age and were multiparous; 18 % tested positive for syphilis serology; 22. 9 % were anaemic during pregnancy, and 37 % were delivered by caesarean section. Most women lived in urban areas, and 16 % chose to <b>bottle-feed</b> exclusively. Vertical Transmission Rate and Factors affecting this Rate: the median vertical transmission rate was 34 %, (95 % confidence intervals, CI 26 %- 42 %). This figure is similar to that found in most parts of Africa, but much higher than those for Europe and USA. The maternal factors found to be associated with an increased risk of transmission were vaginal deliveries and a low haemoglobin level during pregnancy. Breastfeeding, Transmission, and Outcome: breastfeeding was found to have an increased risk of transmission, by 15 % (CI 1. 8 - 31. 8). On assessing growth and morbidity, it was noted that breastfed infants were not protected against such common childhood infections as pneumonia and diarrhoea, and that failure to thrive occurred with equal frequency in both those breastfed as well as those receiving artificial feeds. Newborn Data: when comparing newborn data between those infants who were subsequently found to be infected with those who were uninfected, it was found that there were no major differences between these groups with regard to growth parameters and neonatal complications. However, those infants with rapidly progressive disease (those who died within 24 months), were noted to have lower mean birth weights and lengths, a higher frequency of low birth weights, and tended to have more neonatal problems. Clinical Manifestations: the first differences between the infected and the uninfected infants generally manifested from about 3 months of age. HIV infected children were identifiable by higher frequencies of thrush, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, and hepatosplenomegaly in the early stages, and later on with a higher tendency to neurological and developmental abnormalities, as well as of diarrhoea. Pneumonia was found with equal frequencies in both the infected and uninfected children. The HIV infected child could be distinguished fairly early in life by the combination of the manifestations described above. Progression to AIDS: AIDS was diagnosed in 44 % of all the infected children during the study period. Ninety five percent of these children were identified by 12 months of life, showing a rapid progression of the disease Longitudinal Growth: when longitudinal growth parameters were analysed in this cohort, it was found that HIV infected children were stunted from as early as 3 months of age, and remained below the international standards into early childhood. Infected children were also found to be malnourished (i. e. weight for age below international means), from an early age, and this persisted throughout early childhood. Of note, the uninfected childrens' weights, although comparable to international means initially, dropped after the first year of life. However, both groups did not have significant wasting, when compared to international means. Mortality: there were 25 known deaths during the study period. Of these, 17 were classified as HIV-related, and 8 as indeterminate. The mean age at death was 10. 1 months, with 83 % of all the HIV-related deaths occurring within the first year of life. The commonest diagnoses at the ti me of death were diarrhoea, pneumonia, and failure to thrive; also, thrush was common, as were neurological abnormalities...|$|R
