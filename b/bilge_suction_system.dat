40|$|AbstractObjectivesDecontaminating {{dental chair}} unit (DCU) <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> in a convenient, safe and {{effective}} manner is problematic. This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction handpieces, assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated <b>Suction</b> Tube Cleaning <b>System</b> (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel single component suction handpieces. ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of suction filter housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume suction hoses. Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> reduced this dramatically (ranges for filter cage and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction handpieces could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component handpieces, allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> and single component handpieces radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks. Clinical significanceDCU <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> become heavily contaminated during use. Conventional disinfection does not adequately control this. Furthermore, multicomponent suction handpieces cannot be adequately disinfected without disassembly, which is costly in time, staff and resources.

The authors investigated an "intelligent" remote controlled automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> A <b>suction</b> cannula with an optic sensor at its tip was connected to a special closed cardiotomy reservoir. Contact with blood immediately generated a reservoir vacuum from 0 to - 100 mmHg, permitting aspiration until the blood was no longer detected (automatic shut off). Blood trauma was evaluated in a bovine model, comparing the automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> vs standard continuous aspiration (control) adjusted to - 100 mmHg. After full systemic heparinization, five calves (weight, 62. 5 +/- 4. 4 kg) for the automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> group, and four (weight, 62. 8 +/- 5. 1 kg) for the control group, were equipped with a jugular cannula connected via a roller pump to the cardiotomy reservoir. Through a small thoracotomy, a standardized hole was created in the right atrium, allowing for a blood loss of approximately 400 ml/min. The suction cannula was placed into the chest cavity in a fixed position. Blood samples were drawn at regular intervals for cell count and chemistry. Lactate dehydrogenase values, for the automatic <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> and the control groups, respectively, expressed as percent of baseline value, were 88 +/- 14 vs 116 +/- 22 after 1 hr; 94 +/- 16 vs 123 +/- 23 after 2 hr; and 97 +/- 19 vs 140 +/- 48 after 3 hr (p < 0. 05).

40|$|During {{mechanical}} ventilation, {{patients are}} connected to the ventilator by an endotracheal tube. The tube needs to be cleaned from mucus by suction, which can cause negative effects such as lung collapse, hypoxemia and desaturation. These can be avoided by preoxygenation, change of ventilator settings, use of closed <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> and recruitment manoeuvres. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of endotracheal suction during different ventilator settings and by different suction methods. A method to reverse side effects was investigated. In anaesthetized pigs, the effect of suction during volume and pressure-controlled ventilation was investigated, and the effect of different <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> and catheter sizes were compared. Suction efficacy was investigated in a bench study. The effect of recruitment manoeuvre added after suction, i. e. post-suction recruitment manoeuvre was evaluated. Endotracheal suction causes lung volume loss leading to impaired gas exchange, an effect that is more severe in pressure-controlled ventilation than in volume-controlled ventilation. When 14 French suction catheters were used more side effects were found compared to 12 French catheters, but no difference was found between open and closed <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> in pressure-controlled ventilation. Open <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> was more effective to remove mucus compared to closed system. Post-suction recruitment manoeuvre restored the side effects after the first recruitment when it was applied directly after suction. In conclusion, open endotracheal suction causes impairment in gas exchange and lung mechanics, and more so in pressure-controlled than in volume-controlled mode. These changes can be minimized if smaller suction catheters are used. A post-suction recruitment manoeuvre applied directly after suction restores lung function. It is obvious that the recruitment manoeuvre should be added directly after suction, because if the manoeuvre is delayed and the lung is collapsed and left collapsed, it will be more difficult to recruit the lung...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{standard}} {{heart-lung machine}} {{is a major}} trigger of systemic inflammatory response and the morbidity attributed to conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC) is still significant. Reduction of blood-artificial surface contact and reduction of priming volume are principal aims in minimized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) cardiopulmonary bypass systems. The aim {{of this paper is}} to give an overview of the literature and to present our experience with the MECC-smart <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: At our institution, 1799 patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, 1372 with a MECC-smart <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> and 427 with CECC. All in-hospital data were assessed and the results were compared between the 2 groups. Patient characteristics and the distribution of EuroSCORE risk profile in our collective were similar between both groups. Average age in the MECC collective was 67. 5 +/- 11. 4 years and average EuroSCORE was 5. 0 +/- 1. 5. Average number of distal anastomoses was similar to the average number encountered in patients undergoing CABG surgery with CECC (3. 3 +/- 1. 0 for MECC versus 3. 2 +/- 1. 1 for CECC; P = ns). Myocardial protection is superior in MECC patients with lower postoperative maximal cTnI values (11. 0 +/- 10. 8 micromol/L for MECC versus 24. 7 +/- 25. 3 micromol/L for CECC; P <. 05). Postoperative recovery was faster in patients operated on with the MECC-smart <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> and discharge from the hospital was earlier than for CECC patients (7. 4 +/- 1. 9 days for MECC versus 8. 8 +/- 3. 8 days for CECC; P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The MECC-smart <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> is a safe perfusion technique for CABG surgery. In patients operated on with this system, the clinical outcome seems to be better than in patients operated on with CECC. This promising and less damaging perfusion technology has the potential to replace CECC systems in CABG surgery...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether patients ventilated in the assist-control mode experienced {{a change in}} oxygenation, respiratory rate, inspiratory:expiratory ratio, heart rate, blood pressure or acid-base balance when suctioned with a closed tracheal <b>suction</b> <b>system.</b> DESIGN: A quasi-experimental, within-subject, repeated-measures design was used. SUBJECTS: 18 patients ventilated on a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0. 47 +/- 0. 17 and 2. 3 +/- 5. 0 cm H 2 O positive end-expiratory pressure. INTERVENTIONS: Two suction passes were performed, with measurements at baseline, immediately after the first suction pass, immediately before the second suction pass, immediately after the second suction pass, 2 minutes after the second suction pass and 5 minutes after the second suction pass. No hyperoxygenation was used. RESULTS: Significant differences were seen over time for arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and inspiratory:expiratory ratio. Arterial oxygen saturation decreased to less than 90 % in four subjects (range 88 % to 89 %), with a maximum fall of 9 %. No significant differences were seen for heart rate, blood pressure, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, time to nadir (lowest arterial oxygen saturation) or recovery time. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects ventilated in the assist-control mode and suctioned with a closed tracheal <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> did not experience significant changes in cardiovascular or acid-base parameters when suctioned without hyperoxygenation. Although most subjects did not become desaturated, four subjects experienced desaturation at one or more intervals.

40|$|Turbulent flow has a {{significantly}} higher drag than the corresponding laminar flow at the same flow conditions. The presence of turbulent flow over {{a large part of}} an aircraft therefore incurs a significant penalty of increased fuel consumption due to the extra thrust required. One possible way of decreasing the drag is to apply surface suction to delay the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. However, in order for the gain from the reduction in drag to outweigh the extra costs associated with the <b>suction</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>suction</b> must be distributed in an optimum, or near optimum, manner. In this paper two practical cases are considered. In the first of these a flat plate with panels whose positions are adjustable but do not overlap is treated. Since the cost function in this case is multi-modal, non-smooth and non-convex, methods for solving the optimisation problems necessary to design multi-panel <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> based on direct search techniques are developed. In the second case considered the problem is that of linear distributed suction over the front part of an aerofoil. For this case, the computational load increases so significantly that in some cases it is not really feasible to continue the investigation using a single processor code. To overcome this, three parallel global optimisation algorithms are developed for the design of multi-panel <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> on an aerofoil and it is shown that good solutions can be found efficiently...|$|R
