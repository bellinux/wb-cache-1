Upon the conclusion of their month-long morning marathon of the series, titled [...] "RetroMTV Brunch", MTV aired the footage in August 2013.

500|$|Lafayette's {{reputation}} in France is more problematic. Thomas Gaines, {{in his book}} about Lafayette, noted that the response to Lafayette's death was far more muted in France than in America, and suggested that {{this may have been}} because Lafayette was the last surviving hero of America's only revolution, whereas the evolution of the French government has been far more chaotic. Lafayette's role, especially in the French Revolution, created a more nuanced picture of him in French historiography. To the 19th century historian Jules Michelet, Lafayette was a [...] "mediocre idol", lifted by the mob far beyond what his talents deserved. In their Histoire et dictionnaire de la Révolution française, Jean Tulard, Jean-François Fayard, and Alfred Fierro noted Napoleon's deathbed comment about Lafayette that, if Napoleon had had Lafayette's place during the French Revolution, [...] "the king would still <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> his throne". They called Napoleon's comment [...] "not too excessive" [...] and deemed Lafayette [...] "an empty-headed political dwarf [...] one of the people most responsible for the destruction of the French monarchy". Gaines disagreed, and noted that liberal and Marxist historians have also dissented from that view of Lafayette. As Lloyd Kramer related in a survey of the French public, just before the Revolution's bicentennial in 1989, 57 percent deemed Lafayette the figure from the Revolution they most admired, with Marat and Saint-Just tying for second with 21 percent each: [...] "he [...] clearly had more French supporters in the early 1990s than he could muster in the early 1790s".|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

2500|$|... IFPI {{claims that}} the website is {{extremely}} profitable, and that The Pirate Bay is more engaged in making profit than supporting people's rights. The website has insisted that these allegations are not true, stating, [...] "It's not free to operate a Web Site on this scale", and, [...] "If we were making lots of money I, Svartholm, wouldn't be working late at the office tonight, I'd <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a beach somewhere, working on my tan." [...] In response to claims of annual revenue exceeding US$3million made by the IFPI, the site's spokesman Peter Sunde argues that the website's high bandwidth, power, and hardware costs eliminate the potential for profit. The Pirate Bay, he says, may ultimately be operating at a loss. In the 2009 trial, the defence estimated the site's yearly expenses to be 800,000 SEK (US$110,000).|$|E
2500|$|The {{restoration}} project required 205 tons of steel. Some of {{the original}} components will go on display at museums in Shanghai. [...] Liu Yanbin, {{a member of the}} project team, indicated, [...] "The iron handrails and the cement pavements have will be replaced with wooden ones, and the triangular truss will be replaced with an arc, as it was in 1907." [...] Wooden sidewalks were restored {{on both sides of the}} bridge's vehicle lanes. Mao Anji, a project manager, indicated: [...] "The roadways are to be paved after the bridge is moved back to the creek. We will replace the previous concretes with wooden materials to build the new sidewalks to bring back the bridge's original and old style." [...] Additionally, [...] "some triangle-shaped frames on the bridge's two arches have been replaced with curved ones to restore the original appearance. During previous repairs, workers used the triangle structures to replace the old ones because they were easier to create than those with a curve." [...] According to the project engineers, [...] "Compared to the bridge's main structure, its underwater section has been drastically altered. Workers removed nearly 800 wooden pillars that were sunk 11 meters into the river bed. Now the bridge's three piers will <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> 36 one-metre-wide concrete supports that are deeply-rooted to a depth of 67 metres under the bottom of the creek." [...] The restored bridge stands on new concrete piles that are wider and deeper than the original wooden supports and is expected to have a safe lifespan of at least another 50 years.|$|E

2500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, Chad Smith {{said he had}} discussions with Flea about how much longer the band could continue touring. [...] "I was like, 'I don't know!' I want to make records, I still love making records, but the touring part... I don't know if we can continue. I mean, three of us are 54 years old – Anthony, me and Flea. Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E
