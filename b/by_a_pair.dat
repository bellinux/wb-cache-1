5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis supply port of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes. They were intercepted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly {{enough that it}} crash-landed back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard Formidable. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily {{and a pair of}} Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.|$|E
5|$|Required {{power was}} put up <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of {{afterburning}} Westinghouse XJ46-WE-02 turbojets, fed from intakes mounted high above the wings to avoid ingesting spray.

5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) {{and the other with}} nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E

5|$|The Canopus-class {{ships were}} powered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam {{provided}} by twenty Belleville boilers. They {{were the first}} British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led {{to the adoption of}} fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the Majestics.|$|E
