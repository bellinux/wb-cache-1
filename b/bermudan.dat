5|$|In the World Cup finals El Salvador {{was drawn}} into a group with Belgium, Mexico, and the Soviet Union. El Salvador lost their first game 3–0 to Belgium in Mexico City on June 3. The second match was played against the host nation, Mexico, on 7 June. The game was decided by a {{controversial}} call {{near the end of}} the first half, with the score still at 0–0. Egyptian referee Hussain Kandil awarded a free kick to El Salvador in their own half. However, a Mexican player took the free-kick, passing to another Mexican player who scored. The Salvadoran players protested vigorously, to the extent of physically jostling <b>Bermudan</b> linesman Keith Dunstan, but the goal was allowed to stand. El Salvador restarted the game by kicking the ball into the crowd in protest. They eventually lost the game 4–0. The team's third and final game occurred on June 10 with El Salvador losing 2–0 to the Soviet Union in Mexico City, to finish at the bottom of Group A with 0 points.|$|E

The band's debut live performance was at the 1993 Glastonbury Festival. Within a year, Dismont had left the band, only to be replaced by organist Jay Darlington, who had previously been a member of several mod revival bands.

In early 1969, Laker Airways leased the former Qantas Boeing 707-138Bs from Kleinwort Benson for <b>Bermudan</b> $8,500 a month to replace Britannias on a new series of transatlantic affinity group charter flights. Two years later, Laker Airways also acquired a One-Eleven 300 from Bahamas Airways that had originally been delivered to British Eagle. BOAC purchased for £4 million the 707-365C British Eagle had leased from Kleinwort Benson (subsequently subleased to MEA).

Agarkar and Kumble then contributed with identical bowling figures of 3/38 as Bermuda were bowled all out for 156 in the 44th over, India winning the lopsided game by 257 runs.

25|$|Sir James Reginald Conyers CBE (3 September 1879 – 26 July 1948), {{known as}} Reggie Conyers during his early life, was a Bermudian lawyer, politician, and cricketer. Born in Pembroke Parish, Bermuda, Conyers was a keen {{member of the}} Hamilton Cricket Club, and toured the United States with the club in 1905. Having {{regularly}} played for Bermuda against touring American teams, {{he was invited to}} play for the Gentlemen of Philadelphia during the team's 1908–09 tour of Jamaica. In the final match of the tour, against Jamaica at Melbourne Park, Conyers scored 149 runs opening Philadelphia's batting, his highest first-class score and only first-class century. He would later make several appearances for Philadelphia's Merion Cricket Club in the Halifax Cup competition in 1909 and 1911. Conyers remained heavily involved in Bermudian cricket after the tour's end, often captaining the <b>Bermudan</b> national team against touring sides from North America.

Luton Borough Police (1876-1947) wore a straw helmet in a similar style to the <b>Bermudan</b> police helmet, with a small oval plate.

I cannot tell how often I have seen a private soldier escape the horse, or a beggar wheedle out a good alms by {{a touch of the}} brogue. And, indeed, as soon as the Albanian had laughed at me I was pretty much at rest. Even then, however, he made many conditions, and - for one thing - took away our arms, before he suffered us aboard; which was the signal to cast off; so that in a moment after, we were gliding down the bay with a good breeze, and blessing the name of God for our deliverance. Almost in the mouth of the estuary, we passed the cruiser, and a little after the poor SARAH with her prize crew; and these were both sights to make us tremble. The <b>Bermudan</b> seemed a very safe place to be in, and our bold stroke to have been fortunately played, when we were thus reminded of the case of our companions.

6000|$|How I {{wish you}} could have been there! The hearing lasted three days, and I would not have missed a minute of it. As it was, I did not miss a syllable, and it was so deeply printed on my mind that I believe I could repeat it word for word if I had to. But, in the first place, I must try and realize the scene to you. I was once summoned as a witness in one of our courts, you remember, and I have never {{forgotten}} the horror of it: the hot, dirty room, with its foul air, the brutal spectators, the policemen stationed among them to keep them in order, the lawyers with the plaintiff and defendant seated all at one table, the uncouth abruptness of the clerks and janitors, or whatever, the undignified magistrate, who looked as if his lunch had made him drowsy, and who seemed half asleep, as he slouched in his arm-chair behind his desk. Instead of such a setting as this, you must imagine a vast marble amphitheatre, larger than the Metropolitan Opera, by three or four times, all the gradines overflowing (that is the word for the [...] "liquefaction of the clothes" [...] which poured over them), and looking like those <b>Bermudan</b> waters where the colors of the rainbow seem dropped around the coast. On the platform, or stage, sat the Presidents of the Assembly, and on a tier of seats behind and above them, the national Magistrates, who, as this is the capital of the republic for the time being, had decided to be present at the hearing, because they thought the case so very important. In the hollow space, just below (like that where you remember the Chorus stood in that Greek play which we saw at Harvard ages ago), were the captain and the first-mate on one hand, and the seamen on the other; the second-mate, our particular friend, was not there because he never goes ashore anywhere, and had chosen to remain with the black cook in charge of the ship. The captain's wife would rather have stayed with them, but I persuaded her to come to us for the days of the hearing, because the captain had somehow thought we were opposed to him, and because I thought she ought to be there to encourage him by her presence. She sat next to me, in a hat which I {{wish you could}} have seen, Dolly, and a dress which would have set your teeth on edge; but inside of them I knew {{she was one of the}} best souls in the world, and I loved her the more for being the sight she was among those wonderful Altrurian women.|$|E
