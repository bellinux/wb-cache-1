To study the magnetic damping effects on the growth process, a vertical magnetic field and a cusp magnetic field were considered. Due to our special interest in the melt convection, only local simulation was conducted. The melt flow was calculated by large-eddy simulation (LES) and the magnetic forces were implemented in the CFD code by solving a set of user-defined scalar (UDS) functions. In the absence of magnetic fields, the numerical {{results show that the}} <b>buoyant</b> <b>plumes</b> rise from the crucible to the free surface and the crystalmelt interface, which indicates that the heat and mass transfer phenomena in Si melt can be characterized by the turbulent flow patterns. In the presence of a vertical magnetic field, the temperature fluctuations in the melt are significantly damped, with the <b>buoyant</b> <b>plumes</b> forming regular cylindrical geometries. The cusp magnetic field could also markedly reduce the temperature fluctuations, but the <b>buoyant</b> <b>plumes</b> would break into smaller vortical structures, which gather around the crystal {{as well as in the}} center of the crucible bottom.

40|$|Data {{from field}} surveys and stream gages were {{analyzed}} from southern Lake Michigan {{in order to}} characterize the physical, biological, and chemical environments associated with river plumes. Five Lake Michigan tributaries were examined: Burns Ditch (IN); Trail Creek (IN); St. Joseph River (MI); Grand River (MI); and Muskegon River (MI). The field surveys indicate that specific conductance is a robust parameter for distinguishing river water from lake water for most of these southern watersheds. For most of the year, the plumes {{were found to be}} buoyant, {{with the exception of a}} brief period in late fall when air (and hence river) temperatures typically fall below the receiving lake water temperature. Field surveys indicate that the lift-off point for stronger <b>buoyant</b> <b>plumes</b> is consistently close to the river mouth, which agrees reasonably well with analytical predictions. For tributaries with very small flowrates, the plume lift-off point is upstream of the river outlet, causing an estuary-like environment in the river with buoyant river water atop colder lake water. The vertical extent of the surface plumes is found to be modest, less than 2 m thick at most in-lake locations. The horizontal extent of the plumes is also found to be relatively small, ranging from 0. 13 to 8. 5 km 2 in area, suggesting in-plume residence times of 0. 2 to 21. 8 hours. Application of recently-developed plume classification charts for wind-affected <b>buoyant</b> <b>plumes</b> indicates that most <b>buoyant</b> <b>plumes</b> are expected to be shore attached, offshore spreading, or diffuse offshore spreading. ...|$|R

Measured particulate iron concentrations reach 614 nM. High concentrations of particulate Fe oxyhydroxides result from the extremely high Fe concentration (~ 24 mM) and Fe/H 2 S ratio (~ 24) of the vent fluids, and persist to at least 10 km away from the vent site due to the advection of plume material with the ambient along-axis flow. Two of the nine pairs of pump deployments appear to have intercepted the buoyant or otherwise very young portion of the hydrothermal plume. These samples are characterized by anomalously (compared to neutrally <b>buoyant</b> <b>plume</b> samples) high concentrations of Mg, U, and chalcophile elements, and low concentrations of Mn, Ca, V, Y, and the rare earth elements (REE). Within the neutrally <b>buoyant</b> <b>plume,</b> elemental distributions are largely consistent with previously observed behaviors: preferential removal of chalcophile elements, conservative behavior of oxyanions (P, V, and U), and continuous scavenging of Y and the REE. This consistency is particularly significant {{in light of the}} underlying differences in fluid chemistry between Rainbow and other studied sites. Chalcophile elements are preferentially removed from the plume in the order Cd>Zn>Co>Cu.

The isotopic composition (? 56 Fe) of dFe in vent fluids appears to be distinct from other sources of dFe to the deep ocean, but the evolution of ? 56 Fe during mixing between vent fluids and seawater is poorly constrained. Here we present the evolution of ? 56 Fe for dFe in hydrothermal fluids and dispersing plumes from two sites in the East Scotia Sea. We show that ? 56 Fe values in the <b>buoyant</b> <b>plume</b> are distinctly lower (as low as ? 1. 19 ‰) than the hydrothermal fluids (? 0. 29 ‰), attributed to (i) precipitation of Fe-sulfides {{in the early stages of}} mixing, and (ii) partial oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III), > 55 % of which subsequently precipitates as Fe-oxyhydroxides.
