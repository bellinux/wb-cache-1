5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the <b>bacilli</b> overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant <b>bacilli</b> produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis <b>bacilli</b> with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the <b>bacilli)</b> of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast <b>bacilli</b> are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{models of}} {{naturally}} occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals {{have a natural}} propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus. Certain breeds of dog suffer from narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition. Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally suffer from leprosy; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are {{the primary source of}} <b>bacilli</b> used in leprosy vaccines.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called <b>bacilli</b> (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
25|$|Phenylethyl alcohol agar selects for Staphylococcus species while {{inhibiting}} Gram-negative <b>bacilli</b> (e.g., Escherichia coli, Shigella, Proteus, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Both Stähelin's {{parents were}} medical doctors. After preparatory {{school and a}} {{classical}} education {{with the emphasis on}} Greek and Latin, Stähelin studied medicine in Basel, Zürich and Florence (1944–1950). His first position after graduation was at the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Basel (1951–1954) where he investigated the morphology and sporulation of anthrax <b>bacilli</b> {{with the help of the}} then-new phase contrast microscope. In May 1951, Stähelin was the first to observe naked anthrax <b>bacilli</b> protoplasts, called gymnoplasts, which had left behind their empty cell walls. A year later, during his studies of their osmotic behavior, he discovered and described the occasional fusion of naked protoplasts. This seminal paper in German immediately caught the attention of the bacterial geneticist Joshua Lederberg, who personally requested a copy.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{researchers}} performed {{tests on}} prisoners with Bubonic plague, cholera, smallpox, botulism, and other diseases. This research {{led to the}} development of the defoliation <b>bacilli</b> bomb and the flea bomb used to spread bubonic plague. Some of these bombs were designed with porcelain shells, an idea proposed by Ishii in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Y. pestis <b>bacilli</b> {{can resist}} {{phagocytosis}} and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, {{the lymph nodes}} can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.|$|E
25|$|Xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agar is {{used for}} the culture of stool samples and {{contains}} two indicators. It is formulated to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria, while the growth of Gram-negative <b>bacilli</b> is encouraged. The colonies of lactose fermenters appear yellow. It is also used to culture possible Salmonella that may be present in a food sample. Most Salmonella colonies produce a black centre on it.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, Pasteur's rival Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, a {{veterinary}} surgeon, used {{carbolic acid}} to kill anthrax <b>bacilli</b> and tested the vaccine on sheep. Pasteur {{thought that this}} type of killed vaccine should not work because he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent. In early 1881, Pasteur discovered that growing anthrax <b>bacilli</b> at about 42 °C made them unable to produce spores, and he described this method {{in a speech to the}} French Academy of Sciences on February 28. Later in 1881, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Société d'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur agreed, and the experiment, conducted at Pouilly-le-Fort on sheep, goats and cows, was successful. Pasteur did not directly disclose how he prepared the vaccines used at Pouilly-le-Fort. His laboratory notebooks, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, show that he actually used heat and potassium dichromate, similar to Toussaint's method.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the first}} {{reported}} cases of plague in Australia at Sydney in January 1900, Pound was asked to examine rats in Brisbane. In March 1900 Pound found plague <b>bacilli</b> in a dead rat near a wharf used by ships arriving from Sydney. The first human cases in Queensland were diagnosed later that year, and plague examinations became {{a major part of}} the institute's work until 1909.|$|E
25|$|Leprosy {{is spread}} between people. This {{is thought to}} occur through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of an {{infected}} person. Leprosy occurs more commonly among those living in poverty. Contrary to popular belief, it is not highly contagious. The two main types of disease {{are based on the}} number of bacteria present: paucibacillary and multibacillary. The two types are differentiated by the number of poorly pigmented, numb skin patches present, with paucibacillary having five or fewer and multibacillary having more than five. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast <b>bacilli</b> in a biopsy of the skin or by detecting the DNA using polymerase chain reaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It often occurs in close {{proximity}} to water bodies, but no specific activities that bring people into contact with water have been identified (i.e. fetching of water, fishing, rice farming, washing, bathing, etc.). The mode of transmission of Buruli ulcer is not entirely known. Recent evidence suggests insects may be involved in the transmission of the infection. These insects are aquatic bugs belonging to the genus Naucoris (family Naucoridae) and Diplonychus (family Belostomatidae). Trauma is probably the most frequent means by which M. ulcerans is introduced into the skin from surface contamination. The initial trauma can be a mild skin wound such as scratch or as severe. Other studies have suggested aerosol spread but these are not proven. In Australia, animals such as koalas and possums are naturally infected. Epidemiological evidence has not clearly supported person-to-person transmission. However, Muelder & Nourou found that 10 out of 28 patients had relatives who had also had the disease, and cautioned against the dismissal of person-to-person transmission. Given the number of patients who shed large numbers of <b>bacilli</b> from their wounds and live in very close contact with relatives, more cases should have been observed. The cases reported by Muelder & Nourou could perhaps have been exposed to a common source of infection, and there might also be genetic component to sensitivity to the disease.|$|E
500|$|The Gram stain, {{developed}} in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, characterises bacteria {{based on the}} structural characteristics of their cell walls. The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the [...] "gram-positive" [...] cell wall stain purple, while the thin [...] "gram-negative" [...] cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (gram-positive cocci, gram-positive <b>bacilli,</b> gram-negative cocci and gram-negative <b>bacilli).</b> Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or Nocardia, which show acid-fastness on Ziehl–Neelsen or similar stains. Other organisms {{may need to be}} identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as serology.|$|E
500|$|Acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacteria, are {{resistant}} to decolorisation by acids during staining procedures. The high mycolic acid content of Mycobacteria {{is responsible for the}} staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or acid-fast stain, in which the acid-fast <b>bacilli</b> are stained bright-red and stand out clearly against a blue background.|$|E
500|$|Bacteria are {{the most}} common cause of community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP), with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50% of cases. [...] Other commonly isolated bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae in 20%, Chlamydophila pneumoniae in 13%, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3% of cases; Staphylococcus aureus; Moraxella catarrhalis; Legionella pneumophila and Gram-negative <b>bacilli.</b> A number of drug-resistant versions of the above infections are becoming more common, including drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).|$|E
500|$|Using {{histological}} {{stains on}} expectorated samples from phlegm (also called [...] "sputum"), scientists can identify MTB under a [...] microscope. Since MTB retains certain stains even after being treated with acidic solution, it {{is classified as}} an acid-fast bacillus. The most common acid-fast staining techniques are the Ziehl–Neelsen stain and the Kinyoun stain, which dye acid-fast <b>bacilli</b> a bright red that stands out against a blue background. Auramine-rhodamine staining and fluorescence microscopy are also used.|$|E
500|$|The {{bacillus}} causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, {{was identified}} and described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch. He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery. Koch {{did not believe}} the bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle <b>bacilli</b> as a [...] "remedy" [...] for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it [...] "tuberculin". While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis. The World Tuberculosis Day was established on 24 March for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|Osteomyelitis (bacterial bone infection), [...] {{the most}} common cause of {{osteomyelitis}} in SCD is Salmonella (especially the atypical serotypes Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella paratyphi B), followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative enteric <b>bacilli</b> perhaps because intravascular sickling of the bowel leads to patchy ischaemic infarction.|$|E
2500|$|Albert Calmette, a French {{physician}} and bacteriologist, {{and his assistant}} and later colleague, Camille Guérin, a veterinarian, were working at the Institut Pasteur de Lille (Lille, France) in 1908. [...] Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tubercle bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew <b>bacilli</b> that seemed less virulent, and {{changed the course of}} their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium. [...] The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent <b>bacilli</b> were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals. [...] They transferred to the Paris Pasteur Institute in 1919. [...] The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|Gramicidin {{is active}} against Gram-positive bacteria, {{except for the}} Gram-positive <b>bacilli,</b> and against select Gram-negative organisms, such as Neisseria bacteria. [...] Its {{therapeutic}} use is limited to topical application, as it induces hemolysis in lower concentrations than bacteria cell death, so it cannot be administered internally. Since the exterior epidermis is composed of dead cells, applying it {{to the surface of}} the skin will not cause harm.|$|E
2500|$|Pyrazinamide diffuses {{into the}} {{granuloma}} of M. tuberculosis, where the tuberculosis enzyme pyrazinamidase converts pyrazinamide to the active form pyrazinoic acid. [...] Under acidic conditions of pH 5 to 6, the pyrazinoic acid that slowly leaks out converts to the protonated conjugate acid, which {{is thought to}} diffuse easily back into the <b>bacilli</b> and accumulate. [...] The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH.|$|E
2500|$|Sputum smears and {{cultures}} {{should be done}} for acid-fast <b>bacilli</b> if the patient is producing sputum. [...] The preferred method for this is fluorescence microscopy (auramine-rhodamine staining), which is more sensitive than conventional Ziehl-Neelsen staining. In cases {{where there is no}} spontaneous sputum production, a sample can be induced, usually by inhalation of a nebulized saline or saline with bronchodilator solution. A comparative study found that inducing three sputum samples is more sensitive than three gastric washings.|$|E
2500|$|If a new or amended {{species is}} placed in new ranks, {{according}} to Rule 9 of the Bacteriologocal Code the name is formed {{by the addition of}} an appropriate suffix to the stem of the name of the type genus. For subclass and class the recommendation from [...] is generally followed, resulting in a neutral plural, however a few names do not follow this and instead keep into account graeco-latin grammar (e.g. the female plurals Thermotogae, Aquificae and Chlamydiae, the male plurals Chloroflexi, <b>Bacilli</b> and Deinococci and the greek plurals Spirochaetes, Gemmatimonadetes and Chrysiogenetes).|$|E
2500|$|An {{empirical}} {{regimen of}} antimicrobials should be chosen {{based on the}} pattern of bacterial susceptibility and nosocomial infections in the affected area and medical center {{and the degree of}} neutropenia. Broad-spectrum empirical therapy (see below for choices) with high doses of one or more antibiotics should be initiated at the onset of fever. These antimicrobials should be directed at the eradication of Gram-negative aerobic <b>bacilli</b> ( [...] i.e., Enterobacteriace, Pseudomonas [...] ) that account for more than three quarters of the isolates causing sepsis. Because aerobic and facultative Gram-positive bacteria (mostly alpha-hemolytic streptococci) cause sepsis in {{about a quarter of the}} victims, coverage for these organisms may also be needed.|$|E
2500|$|Cefalexin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. [...] It is bactericidal {{and acts}} by inhibiting {{synthesis of the}} peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, {{it is able to}} irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative <b>bacilli.</b> However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cephalexin.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{when the}} isolate is {{recognised}} to be significant, commonly used identification systems may misidentify the organism as Chromobacterium violaceum or other nonfermenting, Gram-negative <b>bacilli</b> such as Burkholderia cepacia or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. [...] Again, because {{the disease is}} rarely seen in Western countries, identification of B. pseudomallei in cultures may not actually trigger alarms in physicians unfamiliar with the disease. [...] Routine biochemical methods for identification of bacteria vary widely in their identification of this organism: the API 20NE system accurately identifies B. pseudomallei in 99% of cases, as does the automated Vitek 1 system, but the automated Vitek 2 system only identifies 19% of isolates.|$|E
2500|$|BCG is {{prepared}} from {{a strain of}} the attenuated (virulence-reduced) live bovine tuberculosis bacillus, Mycobacterium bovis, that has lost its ability to cause disease in humans. Because the living <b>bacilli</b> evolve {{to make the best}} use of available nutrients, they become less well-adapted to human blood and can no longer induce disease when introduced into a human host. [...] Still, they are similar enough to their wild ancestors to provide some degree of immunity against human tuberculosis. [...] The BCG vaccine can be anywhere from 0 to 80% effective in preventing tuberculosis for a duration of 15 years; however, its protective effect appears to vary according to geography and the lab in which the vaccine strain was grown.|$|E
2500|$|Lactobacillus paracasei {{belongs to}} kingdom Bacteria. [...] L. paracasei {{is part of}} the {{division}} Firmicutes, and also belongs to the class <b>Bacilli.</b> [...] The order and family are Lactobacillales and Lactobacillaceae respectively. The argument on the nomenclature of L. paracasei versus L. casei has been one of intense debate. [...] Most of the species profiled as L. casei or L. paracasei {{have been found to be}} part of the same species. [...] In 1989, it was proposed that L. paracasei be designated a subspecies (paracasei) to account for the species that it shares DNA homology with. It has been shown their names have been used interchangeably in scientific literature. 16S RNA sequence homology has confirmed the relatedness between these species.|$|E
2500|$|BCG {{is given}} {{as a single}} {{intradermal}} injection at the insertion of the deltoid. [...] If BCG is accidentally given subcutaneously, then a local abscess may form (a [...] "BCG-oma") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with antibiotics immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. However, {{it is important to}} note an abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual <b>bacilli</b> are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Holy water fonts {{have been}} {{identified}} as a potential source of bacterial and viral infection. In the late 19th century, bacteriologists found staphylococci, streptococci, coli <b>bacilli,</b> Loeffler's bacillus, and other bacteria in samples of holy water taken from a church in Sassari, Italy. In a study performed in 1995, 13 samples were taken when a burn patient acquired a bacterial infection after exposure to holy water. The samples in that study were shown to have a [...] "wide range of bacterial species", some of which could cause infection in humans. During the swine flu epidemic of 2009, Bishop John Steinbock of Fresno, California recommended that [...] "holy water should not be in the fonts" [...] due to fear of spreading infections. Also in response to the swine flu, an automatic, motion-detecting holy water dispenser was invented and installed in an Italian church in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The Badger Trust {{national}} charity, {{believes that}} vaccination {{will also be}} more likely to help eradicate the disease. Referring to further studies by Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) and the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA),the group claims that vaccination reduces the risk of unvaccinated badger cubs testing tuberculosis positive, because [...] "by the time cubs emerge and are available for vaccination they might have already been exposed [...] to TB". Steve Clark, a director of the group, has separately said that [...] "vaccination also reduces the <b>bacilli</b> that is excreted by infected badgers. It doesn't cure them, but it reduces the possibility of any further infection...in the region of a 75% level of protection. The life span of a badger is about five years. So if you continue the vaccination project for five years, then the majority of animals that were there at the beginning will have died out and that vaccination programme is leading towards a clean and healthy badger population." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{he began}} his investigation, Koch knew {{of the work of}} Villemin and others who had {{continued}} his experiments like Julius Conheim and Carl Salmosen. He also had access to the [...] "pthisis ward" [...] at the Berlin Charité Hospital. Before he confronted the problem of tuberculosis, he worked with the disease caused by anthrax and had discovered the causal agent to be Bacillus anthracis. During this investigation he became friends with Ferdinand Cohn, the director of the Institute of Vegetable Physiology. Together they worked to develop methods of culturing tissue samples. 18 August 1881, while staining tuberculous material with methylene blue, he noticed oblong structures, though {{he was not able to}} ascertain whether it was just a result of the coloring. To improve the contrast, he decide to add Bismarck Brown, after which the oblong structures were rendered bright and transparent. He improved the technique by varying the concentration of alkali in the staining solution until the ideal viewing conditions for the <b>bacilli</b> was achieved.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{can develop}} two {{clinical}} phases: an acute septic phase and a chronic eruptive phase associated with skin lesions. In the acute phase (also known as Oroya fever or fiebre de la Oroya), B. bacilliformis infection is a sudden, potentially life-threatening infection {{associated with high}} fever and decreased levels of circulating red blood cells (i.e., hemolytic anemia)and transient immunosuppression. B. bacilliformis is considered the most deadly species to date, with a death rate of up to 90% during the acute phase, which typically lasts two to four weeks. Peripheral blood smears show anisomacrocytosis with many <b>bacilli</b> adherent to red blood cells. Thrombocytopenia is also seen and can be very severe. Neurologic manifestations (neurobartonellosis) are altered mental status, agitation, or even coma, ataxia, spinal meningitis, or paralysis. It is seen in 20% of patients with acute infection, in which the prognosis is very guarded with an about 50% mortality. The most feared complication is overwhelming infection mainly by Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Salmonella (both S. typhi and [...] S. non-typhi, as well as reactivation of toxoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent of}} work occupying the Bacteriological Institute is {{detailed}} in the Public Health Commissioner's annual reports. For 1905–1906, Pound {{stated that the}} institute had received a total of 17,062 specimens (animal and human combined). Specimens that returned positive for disease included: plague 49 (rat 38, human 11), tuberculosis 165 (cattle 2, human 163), typhoid 194, diphtheria 65, and leprosy 17. Unique specimens from medical operations were preserved for the institute's museum using the [...] "formalin-glycerine process". Inoculum for pleuropneumonia was still being supplied to cattle owners in Queensland and other states, [...] "guaranteed ... free from tuberculosis, actinomycosis, and other animal diseases". The institute also tested water and food. Of the 30 water samples examined for bacteria that year, Pound recorded that half were found to contain [...] "coli bacilli" [...] (an indicator of faecal contamination), 3 of which were also found to contain typhoid <b>bacilli.</b> An investigation of specimens from dengue fever patients was summarised with Pound noting that, of the microorganisms isolated, one microscopically distinct bacillus found common to 11 cases failed to prove as the [...] "sole exciting cause" [...] (now known to be viral).|$|E
