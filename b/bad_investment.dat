5|$|Meanwhile, former {{warehouse}} {{workers and}} lottery winners Calvin (Calvin Tenner) and Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) approach Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asking for their jobs back {{as they made}} a <b>bad</b> <b>investment</b> in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. Darryl accepts them back and shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking pictures at the family portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand.|$|E
5|$|She {{suffered}} another serious financial setback in 1835 {{when she}} {{lost most of}} her life savings, about £300, in a <b>bad</b> <b>investment.</b> Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that {{it is not clear whether}} the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.|$|E
5|$|The {{father was}} {{eventually}} fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, {{and forced to}} take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a <b>bad</b> <b>investment,</b> and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house. Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born. She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria's father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.|$|E

25|$|Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an {{investor}} in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let {{the chairman of}} the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau was only trying to recoup losses from a <b>bad</b> <b>investment.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Saskatchewan Party's {{aggressive}} {{questioning of}} the provincial NDP government over a <b>bad</b> <b>investment</b> of public funds – SPUDCO – forced cabinet minister Eldon Lautermilch to apologize for misleading the legislature, a fact that only became apparent once sworn evidence was acquired from a civil lawsuit against the province.

25|$|In {{the third}} series, 1920–1921, Mary has ended her {{engagement}} to Richard Carlisle, despite his vindictive threats to expose her past indiscretion. Mary and Matthew are {{married in the}} series première, but Robert (Lord Grantham) learns {{that the bulk of}} the family's fortune (including Cora's dowry) has been lost, due to his well-intentioned, but <b>bad</b> <b>investment.</b> In the meantime, Edith has fallen hard for Sir Anthony Strallen, whom Robert discourages from marrying Edith due to his age and infirm condition. At Edith's insistence, Robert gives in and welcomes Sir Anthony, but the latter cannot accept {{the fact that there is}} no reservation from the Grantham family, and at the altar on their wedding day announces that he cannot go through with the marriage, devastating Edith.|$|E
25|$|In 1867 {{the company}} {{incurred}} financial losses from a <b>bad</b> <b>investment</b> in the United Kingdom and declining demand for its products. In {{the same year}} Julius Vorster Jr., {{the son of the}} founder Julius Vorster, became involved in the management of the company. On his recommendation the company began to produce magnesium sulfate {{in order to reduce the}} losses. Magnesium sulfate was primarily intended for the export to the United Kingdom, where it was used as a drying agent in the textile industry. The new product and an improving market for potassium nitrate helped the company to overcome the financial crisis in 1870. In 1871 the potassium chloride factory in Staßfurt was closed. On October 1, 1875 the second son of Vorster, the chemist Fritz Vorster joined the company as technical director. After the death of the founder Julius Vorster on October 10, 1876, the new owners converted the company into a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).|$|E
25|$|Before the event, Jeff Jarrett {{was on his}} way out of the company, as {{management}} felt he {{had been}} a <b>bad</b> <b>investment</b> for the company. Vince McMahon, the WWF Chairman, came up with the idea for Jarrett and Chyna to become involved in a storyline together. Vince Russo was asked to write the storyline leading up to the match, including when Jarrett would taunt Chyna and hit her with random household objects. The fans responded positively to the battle-of-the-sexes match-ups. They were originally supposed to have their match-up at Rebellion, but the WWF extended the storyline for another month due to its popularity. In the midst of the feud, Russo left the WWF for rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In her autobiography If They Only Knew, Chyna implies that Russo was the person who convinced McMahon to delay their pay-per-view match for a month, because he knew Jarrett was also going to sign with WCW. Because of the delay, Jarrett's contract expired the day before the match, so he was not contractually required to wrestle at the event. Hours before the event began, Jarrett demanded (and received) somewhere between $300,000–500,000 to wrestle Chyna for the night.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{playing a}} major role in the Lexington real estate market, Wilkinson was {{fiercely}} protective of his privacy; for a time, he even refused to allow newspapers to publish pictures of him. His public profile began to rise when he announced plans to construct the 50-story World Coal Center on the corner of Main and Limestone streets in Lexington. When completed, it would be the largest office complex between Atlanta and Chicago. Wilkinson hoped that all the major coal companies in the state would relocate their offices to the center, making it a hub for the international coal market. Shortly after Wilkinson demolished the historic Phoenix Hotel to make way for the building, the coal market experienced a pronounced lull, and the empty lot where the proposed coal center would have stood was derided as [...] "Wally's Folly" [...] and [...] "Lake Wilkinson". In 1984, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government secured a lease from Wilkinson to develop a temporary municipal park on the site. Wilkinson conceded that he would not be able to develop the proposed World Coal Center in the near-term, and Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler wanted to improve the property before the city hosted the finals of the 1985 NCAA men's basketball tournament at Rupp Arena. In early 1985, Wilkinson struck a deal with the state and urban county governments to retain the park and build a public library and parking garage while allowing Wilkinson to construct and operate a 21-story apartment complex above the garage. Critics claimed that the city-county government bailed Wilkinson out of a <b>bad</b> <b>investment</b> by purchasing the property from him and by giving him a government-subsidized, low interest rate on his $12 million mortgage for the apartment building.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless {{by now the}} NBR had {{acquired}} the entire company, and over several years when its utility as a springboard for a Perth line was gone, the NBR tried to sell it.

In 1871 the entire Halbeath line was closed down {{and some of its}} track removed.|$|E

2500|$|In Chicago, {{alderman}} Democrat Proco [...] "Joe" [...] Moreno {{announced his}} determination to block Chick-fil-A's bid to build a second store in the city: [...] "They'd {{have to do a}} complete 180", Moreno said in outlining conditions under which he would retract the block. [...] "They'd have to work with LGBT groups in terms of hiring, and {{there would have to be}} a public apology from [...]" [...] Moreno received backing from Chicago's Mayor, Rahm Emanuel: [...] "Chick-fil-A values are not Chicago values", Emanuel said in a statement. [...] "They disrespect our fellow neighbors and residents. This would be a <b>bad</b> <b>investment,</b> since it would be empty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the '33 Act is to ensure that buyers of {{securities}} receive complete and accurate information before they invest in securities. [...] Unlike state blue sky laws, which impose merit reviews, the '33 Act embraces a disclosure philosophy, meaning that in theory, it is not illegal to sell a <b>bad</b> <b>investment,</b> as long as all the facts are accurately disclosed. [...] A company that is required to register under the '33 act must create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with copious information about the security, the company, the business, including audited financial statements. [...] The company, the underwriter and other individuals signing the registration statement are strictly liable for any inaccurate statements in the document. [...] This extremely high level of liability exposure drives an enormous effort, known as [...] "due diligence", to ensure that the document is complete and accurate.|$|E

60|$|The {{power of}} the new {{influences}} which {{have been brought to}} bear on the middle-class mind, with respect to Art, may be sufficiently seen in the great rise in the price of pictures which has taken place (principally during the last twenty years) owing to the interest occasioned by national exhibitions, coupled with facilities of carriage, stimulating the activity of dealers, and the collateral discovery by mercantile men that pictures are not a <b>bad</b> <b>investment.</b>|$|E
