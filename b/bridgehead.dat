5|$|The Strachwitz Battle Group annihilated the Soviet 8th Army shock troop wedge at {{the western}} end of the Krivasoo <b>Bridgehead</b> on 26 March. The German battle group {{destroyed}} the eastern tip of the <b>bridgehead</b> on 6 April. Generalmajor Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz von Groß-Zauche und Camminetz, inspired by the success, tried to eliminate the whole <b>bridgehead</b> but was unable to proceed due to the spring thaw that had rendered the swamp impassable for the Tiger I tanks. By the end of April, the parties had mutually exhausted their strengths. Relative calm settled on the front until late July 1944.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bridgehead,</b> {{captured}} by the 6th Airborne Division, was the subquent launching point {{for a number of}} following operations. I Corps conducted the eastern pincer of Operation Perch out of the <b>bridgehead,</b> but were halted by the 21st Panzer Division. A later operation, Dreadnought, was planned but cancelled; it intended for VIII Corps to use the <b>bridgehead</b> as a basis for an outflanking attack on Caen. Finally, Operations Atlantic and Goodwood attacked out of the <b>bridgehead</b> liberating the remaining sectors of Caen and ending the Battle for Caen.|$|E
5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, {{the rifle}} corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two small groups of tanks broke through {{the lines of the}} rifle corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the <b>bridgehead</b> in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the <b>bridgehead</b> was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bridgeheads</b> - unless {{close to}} enemy units - are removed if {{no longer needed}} for supply. This {{prevents}} the German player from keeping <b>bridgeheads</b> in Warsaw or Paris as excuses for overstacking defenders years after the initial cross-river attack.|$|R

5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German <b>bridgehead,</b> but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their <b>bridgehead</b> at Barcs overnight.|$|E
5|$|The French grand {{plan called}} for two French armies to press against the flanks of the {{northern}} armies in the German states while a third army simultaneously approached Vienna through Italy. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push southeast from Düsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau's army an easier crossing of the Rhine between Kehl and Hüningen. According to plan, Jourdan's army feinted toward Mannheim, and Charles quickly reapportioned his troops. Moreau's army attacked the <b>bridgehead</b> at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops—troops recruited that spring from the Swabian circle polities, inexperienced and untrained—which amazingly held the <b>bridgehead</b> for several hours, but then retreated toward Rastatt. On June 23–24, Moreau reinforced the <b>bridgehead</b> with his forward guard. After pushing the imperial militia from their post on the <b>bridgehead,</b> his troops poured into Baden unhindered. Similarly, in the south, by Basel, Ferino's column moved speedily across the river and proceeded up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and into {{the southern end of}} the Black Forest. Anxious that his supply lines would be overextended, Charles began a retreat to the east.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{capitulation}} at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional {{forces with}} which he could end the siege at Hüningen. He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the <b>bridgehead.</b> General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the new French commander, pre-empted {{what would have been}} a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg finally took possession of the <b>bridgehead.</b> Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.|$|E

5|$|At 15:30, Egyptian forces {{captured}} Fort Lahtzanit, {{the first}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall, {{and by then}} the infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage {{in less than an}} hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each <b>bridgehead).</b> Each <b>bridgehead</b> was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
5|$|Between 7 June and 10 June, the 6th Airborne Division repusled {{a number}} of German attacks.

50|$|Because of {{the total}} focus on the city, the Axis forces had {{neglected}} for months to consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the Don River. The Soviet forces were allowed to retain <b>bridgeheads</b> on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These <b>bridgeheads</b> in retrospect presented {{a serious threat to}} Army Group B.|$|R
5|$|In Rotterdam, though {{reinforced}} by an infantry regiment, the Dutch failed to completely dislodge the German airborne troops from their <b>bridgehead</b> {{on the northern}} bank of the Maas. Despite permission from General Kurt Student, the German commander in Rotterdam refused to evacuate this <b>bridgehead</b> and the few German defenders held fast in a single office building, protected by a canal {{in front of them}} and covered by fire from the south bank. The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug. The German forces involved in the attack of the previous day on The Hague also held out, none of the attempts to eliminate the isolated groups of in total about 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces met with success.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening of 7 April, German units in regimental {{strength}} began to cross the Drava near Barcs and established a second <b>bridgehead</b> in the sector of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. Affected by propaganda from the Ustaše, the border troops abandoned their positions and withdrew to Virovitica. Fifth column activities within units of the 4th Army were fomented by the Ustaše, which facilitated German establishment of the <b>bridgehead</b> at Barcs, and resulted {{in a number of}} significant revolts within units. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, which had mobilised in Bjelovar, was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions. On the night of 7/8 April, the Croats of the 108th Regiment revolted, arrested their Serb officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The regiment then marched back towards Bjelovar. The revolt of the 108th Regiment meant that the entire frontage of the division had to be covered by a single regiment. During the night, patrols were sent towards the German <b>bridgehead,</b> but Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their <b>bridgehead</b> at Barcs overnight. By late evening on 7 April, Petrović's reports to the Yugoslav Supreme Command noted that the 4th Army was exhausted and its morale had been degraded significantly, and that Nedeljković concurred with his commander's assessment.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the Lexicon-Tirtur {{junction}} was the village of al-Galaa. Prior to the 1967 Six Day War, the village had been {{the site of an}} agricultural project. This agricultural station incorporated several irrigation ditches and specialized Japanese-made machinery. When the Sinai came under Israeli occupation, Israeli soldiers unwittingly mistook the Japanese characters for Chinese ones, leading to the location being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on military maps. Just north and north-west of Chinese Farm was a hill mass known by its Israeli codename 'Missouri'. During Operation Badr, al-Galaa and the Chinese Farm fell within the designated <b>bridgehead</b> of the 16th Infantry Division. Abd el-Hamid's 16th Infantry Brigade occupied and defended these locations. After partaking in the initial canal-crossing, the brigade, {{along with the rest of}} the division, faced an attack by Raviv's brigade on October 9. The Israelis achieved some initial gains, but were repelled by the end of the day. Also located within 16th Division's <b>bridgehead,</b> as of October 13, was the 21st Armored Division. Its units were positioned in the center and the {{north of the}} <b>bridgehead.</b> The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and, along with the 1st Brigade, participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14; as a result, it had lost half of its operational tank strength. In the aftermath, Oraby's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes. On October 15, there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian <b>bridgehead,</b> unevenly split among Oraby's brigades: 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade, 39 with the 14th Armored Brigade, and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade. Despite their heavy losses, the Egyptian forces in the <b>bridgehead</b> outnumbered Reshef's force.|$|E
50|$|The Uprising {{reached its}} apogee on August 4 when the Home Army {{soldiers}} managed to establish frontlines in the Wola and Ochota districts. However, {{they failed to}} secure the bridges over the Vistula or <b>bridgeheads</b> {{on the other side}} of the river. Also, there were still several German pockets of resistance inside the Polish-controlled territory, most notably the PAST skyscraper, the <b>bridgeheads,</b> and Headquarters of the police.|$|R
25|$|Two <b>bridgeheads</b> were {{established}} by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. The first was across the bridge {{on the main road}} near Khurbet Hadrah, while the second was established on the coast Sheik Muanis, near the mouth of the river. Their aims were to discourage the Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army, and to gain territory. The New Zealand Mounted Brigade, and two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, continued to hold these two <b>bridgeheads</b> on the northern bank, until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November. The 3rd and 7th Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army pushed back the <b>bridgeheads</b> and restored their hold on the Nahr el Auja, and the tactical situation.|$|R
500|$|The Vauban fortresses at Hüningen and Kehl {{were both}} {{important}} <b>bridgeheads</b> across the river; maintaining control {{of them had}} been critical in Moreau's relatively easy access to the German side of the Rhine in June 1796. At both towns, the principal fortresses lay on the west side (French side) of the Rhine; the <b>bridgeheads</b> and the smaller fortifications surrounding those lay on the both sides. [...] Taking them would require a costly and time-consuming siege.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the advance}} of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the {{formerly}} Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav region of Baranja made holding {{the line of the}} Danube critical for the Germans. In early November the Soviet troops established a <b>bridgehead</b> over the Danube from Apatin (in modern-day Serbia). From 9 November onward, the division was committed in several stages to the Eastern Front, starting with the reconnaissance battalion which went into action at Dárda west of the Apatin <b>bridgehead</b> on 10 November. They were followed by a grouping of three battalions (I/27, II/28 and II/28), an artillery battalion (III/AR 13) and pioneer support. Known as Kampfgruppe Hanke after their commander Hans Hanke, they moved from the Brčko <b>bridgehead</b> and joined a blocking position at Pélmonostor on 14 November south-west of a second Soviet <b>bridgehead</b> that had been established at Batina (in modern-day Croatia). As a result, the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia. Within a week they were joined by the reconnaissance battalion, which had acquitted itself well in fighting west of Apatin. By 20 November, the Red Army was across the Danube in force at Batina. The following day Kampfgruppe Hanke was driven out of its positions, when the remaining 200 troops withdrew. By 25 November the rest of the division was on its way from the Zagreb area. The remnants of Kampfgruppe Hanke were placed under command of Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister, withdrawing as far as Siklós in southern Hungary by 29 November.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June, Montgomery {{issued a}} {{directive}} to Dempsey {{to launch a}} new pincer attack {{with the aim of}} capturing Caen. The initial plan called for I and XXX Corps to attack west of Caen for four days, before VIII Corps launched the main attack out of the Orne <b>bridgehead,</b> east of Caen, on 22 June. It was soon realised that VIII Corps {{would not be able to}} assemble within the small perimeter of the Orne <b>bridgehead</b> and the following day the plan was revised. A preliminary operation was to take place three days before the main assault. The 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (I Corps) was ordered to strike south from the Orne <b>bridgehead,</b> to prevent units of the 21st Panzer Division from being transferred. Operation Martlet was to commence one day before Epsom with the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 8th Armoured Brigade (XXX Corps) securing the right flank of VIII Corps, by capturing the high ground to the south-west.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, {{elements}} of XLVI Motorised Corps crossed the Drava at Gyékényes and attacked towards Koprivnica. Available {{troops of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska took up defensive positions to stop this German penetration and Petrović ordered Nedeljković to mount a counter-attack against the <b>bridgehead.</b> By nightfall the counter-attack had not materialised, the defenders had withdrawn to Koprivnica, and Petrović had ordered Nedeljković to counter-attack on the following morning. Also on 7 April, the few remaining reconnaissance aircraft of the 4th Army mounted attacks on a bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. On 8 April, the XLVI Motorised Corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand its <b>bridgehead</b> at Gyékényes.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{advanced}} {{across the}} river and established two <b>bridgeheads.</b> The first was across the bridge {{on the main road}} near Khirbet Hadrah (also referred to as Khurbet Hadra) and the second was at Sheik Muanis, near the mouth of the river. These operations had two aims– to gain territory and discourage the Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army. After successful actions by the New Zealand Mounted Brigade, two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division held these two <b>bridgeheads</b> on the northern bank until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November. The 3rd and 7th Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army had driven in the <b>bridgeheads</b> and restored the tactical situation.|$|R
500|$|The fortresses at Hüningen and Kehl {{were both}} {{important}} <b>bridgeheads</b> {{across the river}}. At Strasbourg, a once imperial city, and Kehl, the German village {{across the river from}} it, the first permanent bridge had been erected in 1338. In 1678, [...] Strasbourg was taken over by France, and the bridge became part of the city's defense system. Louis XIV ordered the construction of the fortress by the famous architect, Sébastien Le Préstre de Vauban (1679–81), resulting {{in the construction of the}} star-shaped fortresses and <b>bridgeheads</b> in both locations. [...] The principal fortresses lay on the west side (French side) of the Rhine; the <b>bridgeheads</b> and the smaller fortifications surrounding those lay on the west side; these protected the various bridges, barrages and viaducts connecting the east and west sides of the river.|$|R

5|$|On October 18, Sharon's {{division}} {{across the}} canal included the 243rd Paratrooper Brigade under Colonel Danny Matt and an armored brigade under Colonel Haim Erez. Sharon, wanting {{to expand the}} Israeli <b>bridgehead</b> northward, received permission to cross a third unit, an armored brigade under Colonel Amnon Reshef, to the west bank, and did so on October 19. The paratroopers {{and part of the}} armor had been holding the Israeli <b>bridgehead</b> since October 16, facing little resistance, while Reshef's brigade had been involved in heavy fighting at the Chinese Farm until it was relieved by Israeli reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Operation Jackal, or {{alternatively}} Operation June Dawns, commenced on 7 June 1992. The attacking HV/HVO force moved {{east and north}} from Čapljina towards Stolac and Mostar aiming to push the VRS back from the Neretva River and capture positions around Mostar. The HV/HVO force captured the first objective of the offensive, the town of Tasovčići located across the Neretva River, opposite Čapljina, on 8 June. The HV component of the force which captured Tasovčići, the 156th Infantry Brigade, was detached from the force tasked with continued advance to capture Klepci and Prebilovci to protect the right flank of the Neretva <b>bridgehead.</b> The HV 116th Infantry Brigade held the Neretva River valley south of the <b>bridgehead</b> and east of Metković.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, {{had managed}} to block the North Korean's advance to Yongsan while the 19th Infantry was able to push it back and inflict {{substantial}} casualties.

On August 7–8, the North Koreans tried to move two more battalions across the river to the north, but were repulsed by 21st Infantry, which was still in place. The KPA battalions were shifted south to cross at the <b>bridgehead,</b> instead. By August 8, an estimated regiment of North Korean troops were across the Naktong.|$|E
