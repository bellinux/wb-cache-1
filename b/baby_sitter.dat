500|$|Born {{and raised}} by his single mother in Southern Houston, Texas, Lecrae moved often early in life, living in San Diego, Denver, and Dallas. He has stated {{that he would go}} to church with his Christian grandmother, but {{considered}} it for [...] "older people" [...] and said it [...] "wasn't for me." [...] Lecrae never met his father, who ended up becoming a drug addict. In the song [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", Lecrae reveals that when he was almost eight, a female <b>baby</b> <b>sitter</b> sexually molested him, an incident which Lecrae believes distorted his view of sexuality, influencing his later promiscuous lifestyle. Experiencing abuse and neglect during his childhood, Lecrae used his ability to rap as a source of significance. According to Lecrae, his grandmother would not allow him to watch rap music videos on television, but he would sneak in late at night. It was in these videos that Lecrae found individuals to look up to. Lecrae states that [...] "there were no Martin Luther Kings or Malcolm Xs, they had all passed away so I had Tupac." [...] After being shown a gun by his uncle, Lecrae began looking up to gangsters and turned to a life of crime. Lecrae remembers taking a BB gun and standing in the street pointing it to a car, frightening the female driver, simply for fun. At 11 years old, he started writing music for a rhythm and blues group formed by some neighbors. His first track, written for a neighborhood crush, emulated the style of Tupac, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest. At the age of 16, he started taking drugs, fighting, was arrested in high school for stealing, and eventually ended up on a gang list. Lecrae tried [...] "pretty much every drug there was to try" [...] except for heroin and crack cocaine.|$|E

500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a <b>baby</b> <b>sitter</b> constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E

25|$|The United States Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), {{as amended}} by The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003, defines {{child abuse and neglect}} as, at minimum: any recent act or failure to act {{on the part of a}} parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious {{physical}} or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.
