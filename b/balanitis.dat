5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease <b>balanitis</b> xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E

25|$|In young children, it {{is normal}} {{to not be}} able to pull back the foreskin. In more than 90% of cases, this {{inability}} resolves by the age of seven, and in 99% of cases by age 16. Occasionally, phimosis may be caused by an underlying condition such as scarring due to <b>balanitis</b> or <b>balanitis</b> xerotica obliterans. This can typically be diagnosed by seeing scarring of the opening of the foreskin.|$|E
25|$|Pathological {{phimosis}} (as {{opposed to}} the natural non-retractability of the foreskin in childhood) is rare and the causes are varied. Some cases may arise from <b>balanitis</b> (inflammation of the glans penis).|$|E
25|$|Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (thought to be {{the same}} {{condition}} as <b>balanitis</b> xerotica obliterans) is regarded as a common (or even the main) cause of pathological phimosis. This is a skin condition of unknown origin that causes a whitish ring of indurated tissue (a cicatrix) to form near the tip of the prepuce. This inelastic tissue prevents retraction.|$|E
25|$|Phimosis is a {{condition}} in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be pulled back past the glans. A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination. In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during an erection, but is otherwise not painful. Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as <b>balanitis,</b> and other complications.|$|E

500|$|An {{inflammation}} of the glans penis and foreskin is called balanoposthitis, and the condition affecting the glans alone is called <b>balanitis.</b> [...] Most cases of these conditions occur in uncircumcised males, affecting 411% of that group. [...] The moist, warm space underneath the foreskin is thought to facilitate the growth of pathogens, particularly when hygiene is poor. [...] Yeasts, especially Candida albicans, {{are the most common}} penile infection and are rarely identified in samples taken from circumcised males. [...] Both conditions are usually treated with topical antibiotics (metronidazole cream) and antifungals (clotrimazole cream) or low-potency steroid creams. Circumcision is a treatment option for refractory or recurrent balanoposthitis, but in recent years the availability of the other treatments have made it less necessary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arthritis}} {{often is}} coupled with other characteristic symptoms; {{this has been}} called Reiter's syndrome, Reiter's disease or Reiter's arthritis. [...] The term [...] "reactive arthritis" [...] is increasingly used {{as a substitute for}} this designation because of Hans Conrad Julius Reiter's war crimes with the Nazi Party. The manifestations of reactive arthritis include the following triad of symptoms: an inflammatory arthritis of large joints, inflammation of the eyes in the form of conjunctivitis or uveitis, and urethritis in men or cervicitis in women. Arthritis occurring alone following sexual exposure or enteric infection is also known as reactive arthritis. Patients can also present with mucocutaneous lesions, as well as psoriasis-like skin lesions such as circinate <b>balanitis,</b> and keratoderma blennorrhagicum. Enthesitis can involve the Achilles tendon resulting in heel pain. Not all affected persons have all the manifestations.|$|E
5000|$|Zoon's <b>balanitis</b> {{also known}} as <b>Balanitis</b> Circumscripta Plasmacellularis or plasma cell <b>balanitis</b> (PCB) is an idiopathic, rare, benign penile {{dermatosis}} for which circumcision is often the preferred treatment. [...] Zoon's <b>balanitis</b> has been successfully treated with the carbon dioxide laser and more recently Albertini and colleagues report the avoidance of circumcision and successful treatment of Zoon's <b>balanitis</b> with an Er:YAG laser. Another study, by Retamar and colleagues, found that 40 percent of those treated with CO2 laser relapsed.|$|E
50|$|Posthitis and <b>balanitis</b> (inflammation of the glans penis) usually occur {{together}} as balanoposthitis. Circumcision prevents balanoposthitis though <b>balanitis</b> can still occur separately.|$|E
50|$|<b>Balanitis</b> circinata (also {{known as}} circinate <b>balanitis)</b> is a {{dermatologic}} manifestation of reactive arthritis (sometimes {{also referred to}} as Reiter Syndrome although this eponym is falling out of use due to his association with the Nazi party) comprising a serpiginous annular dermatitis of the glans penis. Circinate <b>balanitis</b> is the most common cutaneous manifestation of reactive arthritis. However, circinate <b>balanitis</b> can also occur independently. Topical corticosteroid therapy is the most commonly used treatment, and topical calcineurin inhibitors have also been used successfully.|$|E

5000|$|By the 1920s, {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} disease had undermined much of the original medical basis for preventive circumcision.

50|$|In modern medicine, {{circumcision}} {{may be used}} as {{treatment for}} severe phimosis or recurrent <b>balanitis.</b> Advocacy is often centered on preventive medicine while opposition is often centered on human rights (particularly the bodily integrity of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure.|$|E
