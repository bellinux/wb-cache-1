5|$|In 2015, the BBC {{announced}} that the Horrible Histories concept would <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> in a new format, focussing on {{the life and times}} of a single historical figure per episode. The rebooted series was again developed by LionTV and will involve a largely all-new production team and cast, while still retaining Jenner as lead historical consultant and many of the original series's writers. In addition, original stars Farnaby and Howick will return in limited roles.|$|E
5|$|Most {{importantly}} the operas themselves {{are now beginning}} to <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, Les Huguenots, they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator's lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.|$|E
5|$|Giselle was {{performed}} in Paris from its debut in 1841 to 1849, with Grisi always dancing the title role. In 1849, it was dropped from the repertoire. The ballet <b>was</b> <b>revived</b> in 1852 and 1853, without Grisi, then dropped from the repertoire after 1853. It <b>was</b> <b>revived</b> in 1863 for a Russian ballerina, then dropped again in 1868. It <b>was</b> <b>revived</b> almost 50 years later in 1924 for the debut of Olga Spessivtzeva.

5|$|Reptile is a Raptor, a nearly-extinct bipedal {{humanoid}} race of reptilian {{creatures and}} loyally serves the series' recurring villain Shao Kahn in hope that his race will <b>be</b> <b>revived.</b> Reptile has {{been featured in}} almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the 2011 reboot, {{he had yet to}} be rewarded for his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{is known}} for its {{dramatically}} placed castles and towers, which have become an accepted part of a romantic landscape. Castles, tower houses, peel towers and royal palaces of the period all contributed {{to the development of the}} unique style known as the Scots baronial that would be used for estate houses in Scotland in the sixteenth century, and which would <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> and used extensively from the nineteenth century, including the royal residence at Balmoral and then exported across the world. The Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century would lead to the rejection of many features of Medieval churches, resulting in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration, and would usher in new architectural forms. However, they would <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> from the 1850s to the 1890s, when large Gothic revival churches were built in considerable numbers for all the major denominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Monaco {{consists of}} up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in s and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto security systems, or the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep. The main difference between single-player and multiplayer modes is that in multiplayer, when a player dies they must <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> before the level can be completed.|$|E
50|$|After a {{style has}} gone out of fashion, revivals and re-interpretations may occur. For instance, classicism has <b>been</b> <b>revived</b> many times and found new life as neoclassicism. Each time it <b>is</b> <b>revived,</b> it <b>is</b> different. The Spanish mission style <b>was</b> <b>revived</b> 100 years later as the Mission Revival, and that soon evolved into the Spanish Colonial Revival.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915 {{the earlier}} name, [...] "Cape Corps", <b>was</b> <b>revived</b> for {{a unit of}} Coloured soldiers. The name Cape Regiment <b>was</b> <b>revived</b> for another Coloured unit, in 1986.|$|R

5|$|The idea of {{reviving}} the ancient Olympic Games {{had been raised}} {{from time to time}} during the early and mid 19th century, inspired to a certain degree by romanticism and patriotism. In 1833, the romantic poet Panagiotis Soutsos, in his work Dialogue of the Dead, proposed the revival of the Games in the newly formed Greek state, as part of the revival of ancient Greek tradition. In 1852, archaeologist Ernst Curtius stated during a lecture that the Olympic events would <b>be</b> <b>revived.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Sde Dov does close, its {{military}} terminal would be relocated to the Palmachim Airbase and civilian activities would be relocated to Ben Gurion Airport. With capacity at Ben Gurion projected {{to reach a}} maximum {{over the next few}} decades however, the concept of building an airport offshore in the Tel Aviv region may yet <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> in the future. Sde Dov itself is operating near to capacity, however, with annual passenger movements around 700,000 and a potential capacity of 950,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{about his past}} life, Harsha is rescued from the lake by a fisherman named Solomon (who is the reincarnation of Sher Khan) and, with Soloman's help, visits Udayghad. He gains access to Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's memories of the past are not revived within the day they can never <b>be</b> <b>revived,</b> and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Ghora is accidentally killed by Raghuveer. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived; she reunites with Harsha. Harsha fights Raghuveer, {{and with the help}} of Solomon, manages to kill him.|$|E
50|$|The 1934 Broadway {{production}} received mostly good notices, {{however it}} was a financial failure and has not <b>been</b> <b>revived</b> on Broadway. The 1981 musical adaptation has been considerably more successful, having <b>been</b> <b>revived</b> several times.|$|R

5|$|Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a {{tactical}} role-playing video {{game in which}} players control protagonist Ike {{and a group of}} characters across multiple battle scenarios. At the game's opening, multiple difficulty settings can be chosen: in the Japanese version the options are Normal, Hard, and Maniac modes, while the western version has Easy, Normal, and Hard modes. In all modes, characters who fall in battle cannot <b>be</b> <b>revived,</b> being removed {{from the rest of the}} game, and no revival items can be used on them during a battle. If Ike falls in battle, the game will end and the stage must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Lorraine, Charles V {{was without}} an heir and Marguerite-Louise, as the {{daughter}} of a Lorrainer princess, delegated the right to succeed to the duchy to her elder son, Ferdinando. Grand Duke Cosimo tried to get his son international recognition as heir-apparent, to no avail. Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, supported Cosimo's claim, not wanting to see Lorraine revert to France. The Treaties of Nijmegen, which concluded the Franco-Dutch War, did not rubber stamp Cosimo's ambitions, as he had wished. The Lorrainer question was concluded with the birth of a son to Charles V in 1679, ending Cosimo's dream of a Medici cadet branch, dreams which were to <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> in 1697 by Gian Gastone's marriage to an heiress.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{report on}} the {{accident}} noted, but did not criticise, the medical operation at the scene. It described how paramedics attended {{to those who were}} conscious with life-threatening injuries, but did not make any attempts to resuscitate victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs because they believed that they could not <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> because they had succumbed to the cold salt water. It was estimated by the authorities who attended the scene of the crash that 15 ambulances responded to the accident site, all of which were used to transport the injured to hospitals, and that 40 additional ambulances were available near the site of the crash, but were not needed.|$|E

5|$|Today, New South Wales waratahs {{are grown}} commercially in Australia north of Sydney {{and in the}} Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne. They are also grown commercially in New Zealand and in Israel, and also in Hawaii, {{where they have been}} grown since 1961. One major {{challenge}} in commercial production is that in any one location the flowering season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks). The season for cut flowers may be extended, however, by growing plants at different latitudes. The vase life of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> somewhat by water.|$|E
5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks and he felt {{it would be a good}} race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would <b>be</b> <b>revived</b> at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race would be better than Silverstone.|$|E
5|$|Even as the XF-108 {{program was}} {{progressing}} well, {{there were signs}} that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23September 1959. North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might <b>be</b> <b>revived.</b> Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante {{could be seen as}} the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.|$|E
