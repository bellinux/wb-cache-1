The only other occurrence of ① in the literature identifiable with a Chemical Abstract search (CAS no. 55521 - 72 - 7) is our first review of the GIMME phenomenon in 2010 [7]. In the discussion of chalconatronite (Na 2 Cu(CO 3) 2 ∙ 3 H 2 O, a joint corrosion product of soda glass in contact with copper alloys in clean air free from formaldehyde) {{it was noted that}} ① has been mentioned by Barger and White [8] to occur on a cover glass of a daguerréotype (copper plate with photo-sensitized silver layer). Identified with X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), it was not included in their earlier original research paper on corrosion products [9]. Bellendorf [10] also identified ① by XRPD together with chalconatronite in five corrosion samples from fourteen to eighteenth cent. burial plates in Franconian chapels in Bamberg and Rothenburg ob der Tauber cast from quaternary copper alloys (Cu/Zn/Sn/Pb). Here the sodium most likely originates from migrating salts in the wall plaster, not from soda glass.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{introduced}} micronized copper (MC) formulations, {{consisting of}} a nanosized fraction of <b>basic</b> <b>copper</b> (Cu) <b>carbonate</b> (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) nanoparticles (NPs), {{were introduced to the}} market for wood protection. Cu NPs may presumably be more effective against wood-destroying fungi than bulk or ionic Cu compounds.

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess if MC wood preservative formulations have a superior efficacy against Cu-tolerant wood-destroying fungi due to nano effects than conventional Cu biocides. After screening a range of wood-destroying fungi for their resistance to Cu, we investigated fungal growth of the Cu-tolerant fungus Rhodonia placenta in solid and liquid media and on wood treated with MC azole (MCA). In liquid cultures we evaluated the fungal response to ion, nano and bulk Cu distinguishing the ionic and particle effects by means of the Cu 2 + chelator ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and measuring fungal biomass, oxalic acid production and laccase activity of R. placenta. Our results do not support the presence of particular nano effects of MCA against R. placenta that would account for an increased antifungal efficacy, but provide evidence that attribute the main effectiveness of MCA to azoles...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory X-ray powder microdiffraction (micro-pXRD) {{is a very}} {{effective}} non-destructive method for direct phase analysis of samples smaller than 1 mm containing crystal constituents with no need of their pre-treatment. It is suitable for identification of pigments in fragments of colour layers of artworks, or their cross-sections, {{as well as for}} examination of secondary degradation products. X-ray powder diffraction is indispensable in the identification of pigments that are variable in mineralogical composition and similar in elemental composition, such as copper-based or earthy pigments. The micro-pXRD with a conventional X-ray tube, monocapillary with an exit diameter of 0. 1 mm and position sensitive detector permits us to deal with samples routinely prepared for microscopy. Contrarily to the microdiffraction using synchrotron beams the presented technique is suitable for routine laboratory analysis. In the case of wall paintings, compared to easel paintings, inorganic components are predominating. Lower amounts or even absence of organic stuff facilitate the measurements using XRD. We used micro-pXRD for distinguishing of different cooper-based compounds, <b>basic</b> <b>copper</b> chlorides, <b>carbonates,</b> sulphates and <b>copper</b> acetates, used as green pigments, e. g. atacamite, malachite, verdigris, in fresco-secco paintings from the 15 th century found in monasteries and churches in the Czech Republic.

30|$|We {{report on}} the {{elemental}} and chemical characterization of tarnish on a historic daguerreotype plate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy reveal the presence of C, O, Na, K, P, Cl, Hg, Ag, Cu, S and Au. Synchrotron based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, together with two-dimensional X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy, provide information beyond the elemental distribution and speciation of the daguerreian tarnish features, revealing the presence of NaCl, KCl, HgCl 2, HgSO 4, CuS, and Ag 2 S on the surface. Through the application of synchrotron XRF, the distributions of Ag and S {{were found to be}} inversely correlated. This suggests a preferential accumulation of S within high-density particle regions. Spectroscopic investigation at different regions within the XRF image showed that blemish regions contained degradation products such as NaCl and KCl with AgCl noted in the surrounding regions. The observation of Cu on the surface, in the form of CuS, may either be a result of Cu diffusing through grain boundaries and/or holes in the Ag, or from the accretion of Cu salts, such as <b>basic</b> sodium <b>copper</b> <b>carbonate,</b> from the deterioration of the above cover glass. Silver halides (AgCl, AgBr and AgI) were also detected with XANES. This {{may be the result of}} either environmental conditions or from residual products from the production process of the plate. These results point to the interaction between deterioration products from the cover glass with the daguerreotype surface as one, but not the only, source of the tarnish.|$|R
50|$|Proust’s largest {{accomplishment}} {{into the}} realm of science was disproving Berthollet with the law of definite proportions, which is sometimes also known as Proust's Law.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nanosize}} copper oxide and <b>basic</b> <b>copper</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{on the physical}} and mechanical properties of flakeboards were investigated according to ASTM Standard D- 1037, and the curing process of phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin containing copper compounds was further investigated using dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

While <b>basic</b> <b>copper</b> <b>carbonate</b> increased thickness swelling and water absorption to some extent, {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. The DSC results indicated that the comparable activation energy and reaction enthalpy, obtained from nanosize copper oxide treated samples, contributed to the higher degree of conversion of PF resin and undiminished bonding strength of flakeboards, which is probably related to the acceleration of the addition reactions taking place among small molecules in PF resin and the enhancement of heat transfer of composite mat caused by nanosize copper oxide...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{prepared}} a novel structure comprising of raspberry-like CeO 2 deposited on CuO microspheres (Ce-CuO) for Rochow reaction.

After calcination, they were transformed into Ce-CuO but still maintained the hierarchical structure, and meanwhile, mesoporous structure was formed (for simplicity, we will only state them as metal oxide in the following context). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. When used as a Cu-based catalyst, Ce-CuO exhibited superior catalytic property to the single CuO, CeO 2 and their physically mixture in the Rochow reaction with dimethyldichlorosilane (M 2) selectivity increased from ca. 65 to 83. 7 %. The higher M 2 selectivity of Ce-CuO is mainly due to its larger surface area and the synergistic effect between CuO and CeO 2. This work demonstrates that catalytic performance of the Cu-based can be improved by adding Ce rare-earth element and by carefully controlling their structures.
