5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful in operations against the Austro-Hungarians.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Backbones</b> <b>of</b> propositional {{theories}} are literals that are true in every model. Backbones {{have been used}} for characterizing the hardness of decision and optimization problems. Moreover, back-bones find other applications. For example, backbones are often iden-tified during product configuration. Backbones can also improve the efficiency of solving computational problems related with proposi-tional theories. These include model enumeration, minimal model computation and prime implicant computation. This paper investi-gates algorithms for computing <b>backbones</b> <b>of</b> propositional theories, emphasizing the integration of these algorithms with modern SAT solvers. Experimental results, obtained on representative problem in-stances, indicate that the proposed algorithms are effective in practice and can be used for computing the <b>backbones</b> <b>of</b> large propositional theories. In addition, the experimental results indicate that proposi-tional theories can have large backbones, often representing a signif-icant percentage {{of the total number of}} variables. ...|$|R

Material & Methods: 40 girls and 40 boys, including 18 girls and 18 boys with the right-side deformation <b>of</b> <b>backbone</b> in the thoracic department, the left-side – 22 girls and 22 boys are examined. Results: features of changes of indicators, depending on sex of children and frontage of the top of arch of curvature of spine column, are revealed when studying the level <b>of</b> flexibility <b>of</b> <b>backbone</b> and endurance <b>of</b> muscles of a trunk at children of the middle school age with scoliotic posture.

5|$|The initial non-military {{application}} of distributed element filters {{was in the}} microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide the <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, mass-production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic satellite television systems. An emerging application is in superconducting filters {{for use in the}} cellular base stations operated by mobile phone companies.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} the <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> RAF Fighter Command, and saw action in the European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe {{was designed to be}} powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.|$|E

5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed the <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the chance to join Tranmere Rovers, but instead joined Preston North End after being persuaded by manager John McGrath, who promised to make Allardyce the <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> his team.

By this time Allardyce began considering his retirement as a player, and applied to management positions at York City and Notts County, and had an unsuccessful interview with Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
5|$|As a captain, Gilligan was well-liked by {{players and}} commentators, {{although}} many {{did not believe}} he was an effective tactician.

As a fielder, he inspired his teams to become good fielding sides. In addition, as MCC captain of a team which toured India in 1926–27, he encouraged Indians {{to take responsibility for}} their own cricket board instead of allowing white Englishmen to run Indian cricket, and lobbied the MCC to bestow Test match status on the Indian team. As MCC president, he played a part in the D'Oliveira affair in 1968. He died in 1976, aged 81.|$|E
