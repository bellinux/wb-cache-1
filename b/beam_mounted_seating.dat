40|$|A {{wind energy}} {{harvester}} inspired by music playing harmonicas was proposed for micro-power generation. The energy harvester utilizes flow-excited self-sustained oscilla-tions of a piezoelectric cantilever <b>beam</b> <b>mounted</b> in a wind pipe to generate electric power. The {{dependence of the}} energy harvester’s power generation performance {{on a set of}} the design parameters such as the chamber volume, aperture width and beam dimensions has been studied previously. However, the performance of the nonlinear multi-physics system with two-way fluid structure coupling also depends on other design parameters such as the geometry of the oscillatory <b>beam,</b> the <b>beam</b> <b>mounting</b> configuration and the geometry of the pipe outlet. A systematic design analysis of the effects of these parameters is necessary for the optimization of the energy harvester. In this study, theoretical and computational modeling and design analysis are per-formed to investigate the influence of the design parameters of beam geometry and pipe outlet structure on the performance of the wind energy harvester. It is known that the in-crease of the beam bending displacement induces a larger strain in the piezoelectric laye...|$|R

40|$|DISCOS {{was used}} to {{simulate}} the spin-up of a uniform flexible <b>beam</b> <b>mounted</b> on a rigid spinning disk. The system operated well {{for the first few}} seconds but then there was a drastic rise in deflection as the whole system became unstable. Attention is given to the reason for the breakdown of DISCOS and how this affects the simulation results from DISCOS and other multiflexible-body simulation programs. It is found that a formulation option already available in DISCOS will eliminate the dramatic divergence observed in high spin regimes and give good results in low spin regimes while requiring highly simplified input data...|$|R

40|$|A gas {{lubricated}} {{thrust bearing}} is described which employs relatively rigid inwardly cantilevered spokes carrying a relatively resilient annular member or annulus. This annulus {{acts as a}} beam on which are mounted bearing pads. The resilience of the <b>beam</b> <b>mount</b> causes the pads to accept the load and, with proper design, responds to a rotating thrust-transmitting collar by creating a gas film between the pads and the thrust collar. The bearing may be arranged for load equalization thereby avoiding the necessity of gimbal mounts or the like for the bearing. It may also be arranged to respond to rotation in one or both directions...|$|R

50|$|Crossbars were {{historically}} common, simple fasteners consisting simply of a plank or <b>beam</b> <b>mounted</b> to {{one side}} of a door by a set of cleats. The board could be slid past the frame to block the door. Alternatively, the bar can be a separate piece that is placed into open cleats or hooks, extending across the frame on both sides. The effect of this device is essentially the opposite of the crash bar in that its operation is to permit the door to be opened inward rather than outward. On a set of double doors, the same principle works, but needn't extend past the frame. The bar simply extends into another set of cleats on the other door such as to interfere with the door opening.|$|R

Results are reported for several combinations of adhesive strengths, beam thickness, and support flexibilities characterized through torsional and vertical translational spring stiffnesses. Special {{attention is paid to}} the important extreme cases of clamped and simply supported beams. The popular Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model for adhesion is obtained as a limit of the adhesive zone model. Finally, we compare our predictions with preliminary experiments and also demonstrate the utility of our approach in modeling complex structural adhesives...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the problem of}} attenuating the vibration at a certain location on a flexible cantilevered <b>beam</b> <b>mounted</b> on a vibrating base which is the tip in this case. Attenuation is achieved {{without the need for}} sensor placement at that location. A modal state-space model of the flexible beam is constructed from the beam’s first ten modes of vibration. A reduced-order optimal observer is utilized to estimate the deflection of the beam’s tip from measurements of vertical deflections at mid-span and actuator locations. An inertial actuator is <b>mounted</b> on the <b>beam</b> itself, provides the control effort necessary for attenuating the tip vibration, resulting from shaker excitation. Experimental and simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control technique...|$|R
