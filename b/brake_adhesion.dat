40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{adhesive}} power of a tire {{with respect to the}} road involves several properties which result from the purpose of the tire; namely, connecting link between vehicle and road: (1) The tire must transfer the tractive and braking forces acting in the direction of travel (tractive and <b>braking</b> <b>adhesion).</b> (2) The tire is to prevent lateral deviations of the vehicle from the desired direction of travel (track adhesion). Moreover, the rubber tire provides part of the springing of the vehicle. Above all, it has to level out the minor road irregularities; thus it smoothes, as it were, the road and simultaneously reduces the noise of driving. The springing properties of the tire affect the adhesive power. The tests described below comprise a determination of the <b>braking</b> and track <b>adhesion</b> of individual tires. The adhesion of driven wheels has not been investigated so far. *"Versuche zur Feststellung des Haftverm_gens von Personenwagen-Bereifungen", Deutsche Kraftfahrtforschung, Technischer Forschungsbericht...|$|R

5000|$|... 33,000 m2 paddock {{divided into}} two zones for dynamic tests such as slalom, curve tracing, {{emergency}} braking, acceleration / traction, car dynamics (understeer / oversteer), wet skid control and stability control. The sprinkler system design offers wet weather conditions simulation and our 70m x 4m area of epoxy surface {{can be used to}} test <b>braking</b> without <b>adhesion.</b>|$|R
50|$|Severe <b>braking</b> or low <b>adhesion</b> may {{stop the}} {{rotation}} of the wheels while the vehicle is still moving can cause a flat spot on the tire and localized heat damage to the tire material.|$|R
50|$|When a {{train is}} <b>braking,</b> the low <b>adhesion</b> manifests as wheel slip where the {{wheelset}} is rotating {{at a lower}} velocity (speed) than the forward speed of the train. The most extreme {{example of this is}} where the wheel stops rotating altogether (wheel slide) while the train is still moving and can result in a “wheel flat” caused by the softer wheel steel being abraded away by the harder rail steel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{emergency}} braking deceleration and braking distance of high-speed train were studied under {{the conditions of}} <b>adhesion</b> <b>brake</b> on dry and humid rail surfaces, and adhesion and non-adhesion composite brake on humid rail surface. The average {{emergency braking}} deceleration was calculated by the area-method. The {{results show that the}} braking performance is affected significantly by the wheel/rail adhesion state and the braking performance of high-speed train can be improved by applying the adhesion and non-adhesion composite brake in the state of humid rail surface...|$|R
25|$|Prior to each {{leaf fall}} season many train {{companies}} arrange low adhesion training for their newly qualified drivers. This consists of taking over {{a section of}} line during a quiet period. Using lineside markers each driver gets his train up to speed and then makes a Full Service <b>brake</b> under normal <b>adhesion</b> conditions. The railhead is then treated with a contaminant that has a low coefficient of friction. On the second run the driver will experience the sound and sensation of the train sliding, and the stopping distance will be considerably greater.|$|R

30|$|The {{hook and}} shaft are drawn in proportion, {{and it was}} {{observed}} {{at this point that}} given Nature’s reputation for energy efficiency and balance, the shaft walls are near parallel, making it clear that they are hiding some secret with regards their form. And that is the inner form, the non-homogenous fibrous, cellular flesh of the hook and shaft and their inner control system or genetic instructions that led the flower, mauve and bright and well suited to the pollinators of the area to transform into the perfect seed dispersal mechanism using the same structures, though desiccated. The flattened flange is optional, but follows from {{the fact that there are}} further structural options available, such as flanges or setae, substructures that could play a part in anchoring more firmly in the substrate or providing a <b>brake</b> for <b>adhesion</b> and detachment, mimicking the attachment mechanism of the dragonfly head arrestor mechanism [4]. At this stage a universal foot is being considered for a one-size-fits-all attachment mechanism that can anchor to a wall or vertical flat surface irrespective of the size of the object, and then, it shall be scaled down according to need and ability to adhere and detach repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|The prototype, EF63 1, was {{produced}} in 1962 by Toshiba for testing before full production of the class started in 1963 spread between manufacturers Kawasaki, Mitsubishi and Toshiba. The class was equipped {{with a number of}} special safety features to cope with the unique conditions of operating on the 66.7‰ gradient of the Usui Pass. These included independent dynamic brakes on all six axles (hence the large louvres along the bodysides for heat dissipation), magnetic <b>adhesion</b> <b>brakes</b> operating directly on the rails, and mechanical locking brakes. Small wheels attached to the centre bogie were used to measure the train speed and apply the brakes in the case of run-away. The class used the same 425 kW MT52 traction motors used on the EF62s and also the EF70s.The entire class was based at Yokokawa depot, and they were always used in pairs at the Yokokawa end of trains travelling in both directions, and were capable of operating in multiple with Class EF62 locomotives and a wide range of EMU types (including 115, 185, 189, 489 series) - hence the impressive array of jumper cables and connectors on the Karuizawa ends of the locos. Trains ascending the incline from Yokokawa were driven by the driver in the rearmost cab of the EF63 pair {{at the rear of the}} train, with the driver in the front cab of the train acting only as signal look-out.|$|R
