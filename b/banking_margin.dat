40|$|In {{the process}} of {{creating}} a new concept of the financial mechanism, it is important, in our opinion, to construct a mechanism for depreciation of fixed assets of enterprises, adequate to the goals of the national economy modernization. It seems appropriate to establish a depreciation model which will allow the state to conduct depreciation policy differentiated by branches of the national economy and on specific territories. In addition, depreciation deductibles must be real, that means, they should be accumulated on the accounts and not just be tax exemptions. There are expressions of the Russian economists, {{that it is possible to}} ensure the realization of revenues depreciation on special accounts under threat of possible penalties. The solution of this problem, it seems, can be achieved through mandatory enrollment of depreciation amounts into the escrow bank accounts without withdrawing the funds before the expiration of the depreciation period of fixed assets of the owners. The yield on bank deposits in the Russian market, as a rule, does not exceed the Central Bank refinancing rate. Keeping money in the long term on such conditions is not economically feasible - a negative return on these investments is guaranteed, but if the federal government has helped to ensure a nominal rate of return of deposits to 10 % (in a given period of time) at the expense of its resources, then our proposal could have lost the character of economic voluntarism. If all accrued depreciation (2 348 641 million rubles) will be placed on deposit accounts and the credit system of the Russian Federation will provide holders an annual yield of 10 % (at the rate of inflation 8. 8 %), the annual subsidy amount will be 28 183. 7 million rubles. In this case, the credit system receives a resource for the issuance of long-term loans. Taking into account the <b>banking</b> <b>margin</b> of 2 %, the annual interest on long-term loans could amount (in terms of the current time) 10 - 12 % of annual yield...|$|E

40|$|Georges Bank is a large, shallow feature {{separating}} the Gulf of Maine from the Atlantic Ocean. Previous studies demonstrated a strong tidal-mixing front during the warm {{season on the}} northern <b>bank</b> <b>margin</b> between thermally stratified water in the Gulf of Maine and mixed water on the bank. Tides transport warm water off the bank during flood tide and cool gulf water onto the bank during ebb tide. During 10 days in August 2009, we mapped frontal temperatures in five study areas along ∼ 100 km of the <b>bank</b> <b>margin.</b> The seabed "frontal zone", where temperature changed with frontal movment, experienced semidiurnal temperature maxima and minima. The tidal excursion of the frontal boundary between stratified and mixed water ranged 6 to 10 km. This "frontal boundary zone" was narrower than the frontal zone. Along transects perpendicular to the <b>bank</b> <b>margin,</b> seabed temperature change at individual sites ranged from 7. 0 °C in the frontal zone to 0. 0 °C in mixed bank water. At time series in frontal zone stations, changes during tidal cycles ranged from 1. 2 to 6. 1 °C. The greatest rate of change (- 2. 48 °C hr(- 1)) occurred at mid-ebb. Geographic plots of seabed temperature change allowed the mapping of up to 8 subareas in each study area. The magnitude of temperature change in a subarea depended on its location in the frontal zone. Frontal movement had the greatest effect on seabed temperature in the 40 to 80 m depth interval. Subareas experiencing maximum temperature change in the frontal zone {{were not in the}} frontal boundary zone, but rather several km gulfward (off-bank) of the frontal boundary zone.

40|$|Countries {{differ in}} {{the extent to which}} their {{financial}} systems are bank-based or market-based. The financial systems of Germany and Japan, for example, are considered bank-based because banks play a leading role in mobilizing savings, allocating capital, overseeing investment decisions of corporate managers, and providing risk management vehicles. The systems of the United States, and the United Kingdom are considered more market-based. Using bank-level data for a large number of industrial and developing countries, the authors present evidence about the impact of financial development, and structure on bank performance. They measure the relative importance of bank or market finance by the relative size of stock aggregates, by relative trading or transaction volumes, and by indicators of relative efficiency. They show that in developing countries, both banks and stock markets are less developed, but financial systems tend to be more bank-based.

While concentration is positively associated with net interest margins, this relationship breaks down when controlling for regulatory impediments to competition and inflation. Furthermore, bank regulations become insignificant when controlling for national indicators of economic freedom or property rights protection, while these institutional indicators robustly explain cross-bank net interest margins and overhead expenditures. Thus, bank regulations cannot be viewed in isolation; they reflect broad, national approaches to private property and competition...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} {{explanation for the}} decline in <b>bank</b> interest <b>margins</b> in many developed countries, which, in our view, better fits the empirical and narrative evidence on bank behavior {{in the run-up to}} the credit crisis. A common thread in the literature on <b>bank</b> interest <b>margins</b> is a causality that runs from competition to lower margins to new activities. The causal chain that we propose runs from ROE maximization to asset growth to lower interest margins.

It discusses the roots of financial underdevelopment in the CIS- 7 countries by examining the differentials in interest rate spreads between the CIS- 7 countries and the transition economies that have achieved faster financial development. The roots of the divide are traced to weaknesses in the institutional infrastructure for financial intermediation, which lead to a combination of low depositor trust in the banking system and high credit risk. High credit risk stems mainly from the poor creditor-rights protection and weak auditing and accounting standards. Financial sector reform strategies that fail to give priority to the resolution of weaknesses in the basic financial infrastructure are unlikely to be successful in letting the CIS- 7 countries bridge the great divide.
