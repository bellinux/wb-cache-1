5|$|In Apra Harbor, ten ships or tugs were sunk, as were {{numerous}} smaller vessels. One {{of the ships}} that survived in the harbor was the cutter <b>Basswood</b> of the Coast Guard, which recorded a wind gust of 220km/h (140mph). Pamela's damage prevented regular flights {{in and out of}} the island.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} M.polygramma grow in groups or sub-clusters under hardwoods, {{particularly}} deciduous trees such as oak, maple, and <b>basswood.</b> In North America, {{it has been}} collected from North Carolina, Massachusetts, New York, and Michigan, where it fruits from June to October. The fruit bodies are susceptible to attack by the parasitic fungi Spinellus fusiger and S.macrocarpus.|$|E

5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} {{demonstrated a}} rich and nuanced use of color. She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of the}} woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or <b>basswood</b> and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek lacks a {{riparian}} buffer in some places. However, the Mahoning Creek floodplain and {{the nearby}} slopes are listed as a Locally Significant site on the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory. Eastern hemlock trees inhabit the slopes and river birch, silver maple, and silky dogwood inhabit the floodplain itself. American <b>basswood</b> also grows {{in the vicinity of}} the creek here. Additionally, spring wildflowers grow in this area. The site has a high level of plant biodiversity. However, many trees in the area are affected by an aphid species known as the hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi is a {{saprobic}} species, and derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down the complex insoluble polysaccharides found in woody material, such as cellulose and lignin. Fruit bodies are found growing singly or in very small groups, and are attached to buried or partially buried sticks in forests. <b>Basswood</b> has been noted to be a preferred wood type for the species. Fruit bodies typically appear during early spring, but may occasionally also in late fall. Although the distribution appears to be largely restricted to the eastern United States, it was once reported in Bulgaria in 1994, representing the first European collection.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe," [...] he answered, not {{altogether}} liking her tone. And then before anything more {{could be said}} the automobile swept {{up in front of}} Ben <b>Basswood's</b> home, and the conversation became general.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think, Roger. If he does tell the truth, then it is quite likely that Tim Crapsey was trying to play a double game {{so far as the}} <b>Basswoods</b> were concerned." ...|$|R

5|$|The Shickshinny Mountain Slopes, {{which are}} listed as a Locally Significant Area in the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory, {{are located in the}} {{watershed}} of Hunlock Creek in Plymouth Township. These slopes are on the northern side of Shickshinny Mountain and contain second-growth northern hardwood forests and some rock outcroppings with small seeps. The area contains a large number of wildflower species and some rare plants. The main tree species in this area include American <b>basswood,</b> sugar maple, white ash, white oak, black cherry, and eastern hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{tree species}} have been {{observed}} near Lake Chillisquaque. These include two oak species, two maple spaces, red elm, boxelder, shagbark hickory, black tupelo, American <b>basswood,</b> eastern hop-hornbeam, black ash, and musclewood. Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, speckled alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as <b>basswood,</b> maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E
6000|$|... "If the <b>Basswoods</b> {{expect you}} to do {{anything}} regarding that note you got from Porton they had better get busy before long," [...] remarked Roger one evening. [...] "Otherwise Porton may do as he threatened--destroy the pictures." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later found the two touring-cars in the village where Mr. <b>Basswood's</b> friend resided. Here, as the gentleman had said, was located a fairly good hotel, where {{accommodations}} for the night could be had.|$|R

"Not only that, {{but he had}} a tippet {{placed over}} his head and around his neck, and he spoke in a very hoarse voice, stating that he had caught a terrible cold while on the sleigh-ride and while coming back to Crumville on the freight train. He spoke about Mr. <b>Basswood's</b> real estate business, and about Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth and Jessie, and so many other things that we are {{familiar}} with, that I was completely deceived. Then, too, his turning over that written card to me also threw me off my guard. But I know I was very foolish, very foolish indeed!" [...] and Mrs. <b>Basswood's</b> lips trembled and she wrung her hands once again.|$|R

25|$|Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most {{commonly}} manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch veneers that are bonded {{together in a}} hot press over hardwood cores of <b>basswood</b> or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. <b>Basswood</b> is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured {{to a number of}} specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies and meets specifications.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is known}} for its vast and lush forests of beech, white pine, oak, chestnut, maple, <b>basswood,</b> ash, elm, and holly trees. Several {{uncommon}} silver birch stands can be found. A variety of orchids abound, including one rare species that has no leaves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know exactly, Dave. But I {{got word}} through Ben <b>Basswood's</b> cousin that Nat had told Ben he wasn't {{going to let}} you ride over him this term. I think Nat is jealous because you were so {{successful}} in that trip to Cave Island." ...|$|R

60|$|As Mr. <b>Basswood's</b> {{friend had}} said, the road leading from Rayville northwestward was in fine shape, {{and they were}} able to cover the next thirty miles at a fair rate of speed. But then they got in among the hills, and here the road became as winding and {{dangerous}} as ever.|$|R
25|$|In December, 2009 the Children's Pavilion and the Rose Carousel were opened. The menagerie {{includes}} thirty animals {{ranging from}} bears, to horses, to ostriches, to zebras and mirrors {{the world from}} which The Gardens draws its visitors. The designs were hand picked by the owner, in consultation with an artist from North Carolina. The carvings were done {{by some of the}} few remaining carvers of carousel art. Each animal is carved from <b>basswood</b> and took many months to complete. There are also two chariots able to accommodate disabled persons.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} US, the gypsy moth prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, {{speckled}} alder, <b>basswood,</b> gray birch, paper birch, poplar, willow, and hawthorns, among other species. Older larvae feed on {{several species of}} softwood that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and pine and spruce species native to the east. The gypsy moth avoids ash trees, tulip-tree, American sycamore, butternut, black walnut, catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, cedar, American holly, and mountain laurel and rhododendron shrubs, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high.|$|E
25|$|Indiana bats {{were found}} {{in a variety of}} plant {{associations}} in a southern Iowa study. Riparian areas were dominated by eastern cottonwood, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). In the forested floodplains, the dominant plants included black walnut (Juglans nigra), silver maple, American elm (Ulmus americana), and eastern cottonwood. In undisturbed upland forest, the most common plants were black oak (Quercus velutina), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). Black walnut, American <b>basswood,</b> American elm, and bur oak dominated other upland Indiana bat sites.|$|E
60|$|That {{day was a}} {{particularly}} trying one in the classroom. The lessons were unusually hard, and Dave had {{all he could do}} to pass, especially in those studies presided over by Professor Haskers. Roger made one miss in his Latin and poor Phil made several, while Ben <b>Basswood's</b> recitation was a complete failure.|$|R
60|$|Having {{sent his}} {{message to the}} <b>Basswoods</b> and {{received}} Ben's reply, there seemed nothing further for our hero to do but to wait. He and Roger were very busy helping to survey the route beyond the new Catalco bridge, and in the fascination of this occupation Ward Porton was, {{for the next few}} days, almost forgotten.|$|R
60|$|Tim Crapsey had a {{delicate}} mission to perform. First {{of all he}} was to size up matters around {{the homes of the}} Wadsworths and the <b>Basswoods,</b> and then he was to do what he could to hire a cutter and a fast horse at the local livery stable. This done, he was to procure something to eat both for himself and for his companion.|$|R
25|$|The {{frequent}} midwinter thaws in Great Plains Chinook {{country are}} more of a bane than a blessing to gardeners. Plants can be visibly brought out of dormancy by persistent Chinook winds, or have their hardiness reduced even if {{they appear to be}} remaining dormant. In either case, they become vulnerable to later cold waves. Many plants which do well at Winnipeg (where constant cold maintains dormancy all winter) are difficult to grow in the Alberta Chinook belt; examples include <b>basswood,</b> some apple, raspberry and Saskatoon varieties, and Amur maples. Trees in the Chinook-affected areas of Alberta are known to be small, with much less growth than trees in areas not affected by Chinooks. This is once again caused by the ‘off-and-on’ dormancy throughout winter.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 2009, the Children's Pavilion and Rose Carousel {{were opened}} to the public. The Rose Carousel, crafted by Brass Ring Entertainment of Sun Valley, California is the only {{carousel}} on Vancouver Island. The menagerie includes thirty animals ranging from bears, to horses, to ostriches, to zebras, to cats and mirrors the world from which The Gardens draws its visitors. The designs were hand picked by Robin Clarke, The Gardens' owner and great grand daughter of Jennie Butchart, in consultation with an artist from North Carolina. The carvings were done {{by some of the}} few remaining carvers of carousel art. Each animal is carved from <b>basswood</b> and took many months to complete. There are also two chariots able to accommodate disabled persons.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} {{theme of}} this region is shaped by rolling hills, Great Lakes shorelines including coastal dunes on the west coast, large inland lakes, numerous rivers and large forests. A tension zone is identified running from Muskegon to Saginaw Bay marked by a change in soil type and common tree species. North of the line the historic presettlement forests were beech and sugar maple, mixed with hemlock, white pine, and yellow birch which only grew on moist soils further south. Southern Michigan forests were primarily deciduous with oaks, red maple, shagbark hickory, <b>basswood</b> and cottonwood which are uncommon further north. Northern Michigan soils tend to be coarser, and the growing season is shorter with a cooler climate. Lake effect weather brings significant snowfalls to snow belt areas of Northern Michigan.|$|E
6000|$|Following {{the trip}} up the coast, {{it had been}} decided by the Wadsworths and the <b>Basswoods</b> to spend part of the summer in the Adirondacks, at a spot known as Mirror Lake. Thither all {{of the young people}} and some of the older ones went to enjoy {{themselves}} greatly and to meet with a number of strange happenings, all of which have been related in detail in the volume preceding this, entitled [...] "Dave Porter at Bear Camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, in this way: {{when they}} heard about the miniatures, and Crapsey heard how much Porton looked like me, and how {{intimate}} I and the Wadsworths were with the <b>Basswoods,</b> {{it may have been}} Crapsey who concocted the scheme for getting possession of the miniatures. And if he did that, it is more than likely that he will be the one to dispose of the pictures or send in an offer to return them for a certain amount." ...|$|R
50|$|Caretaker's Woods, {{named for}} the caretaker's house that was once in the area, are located on 8 acre of land along the lake, just {{to the north and}} west of Picnic Point. The land in this area slopes quite {{dramatically}} toward the lake, which means that it receives less direct sunlight in comparison {{to other parts of the}} preserve. Vegetation in this area prefers a cool, moist environment. Trees in the woods are a mix of young maples, <b>basswoods,</b> and slippery elms, and older red oaks.|$|R
