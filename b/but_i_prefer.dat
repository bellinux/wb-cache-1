2500|$|Asked by the Dallas Observer for {{his view}} of {{religion}} and spirituality, Lennon said,I'm not against religion, because I think it serves a purpose in our society {{and it can be}} helpful to certain groups of people. But, for me, religion is mythology. ... I do think we all have a spirit, and I think there's a lot more to life and human consciousness than science can explain. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> looking to science for answers because it can be tested and vigorously logical.|$|E

2500|$|Wireds Erika Milvy {{commented that}} [...] "Fox's Simpsons Cartoon Studio {{may be more}} the '90s answer to Colorforms than a finely tuned {{animation}} resource, but dang if it isn't fun to watch Smithers and Mr. Burns hula across the monitor as a three-eyed fish swims by," [...] and added that [...] "for the anally inclined, there's certainly a way to have these cartoons make more sense. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to toss rhyme and reason out the window." [...] Joseph Szadkowski of The Washington Times wrote that [...] "For the amount of complicated computer stuff going on — frame by frame editing, character motion, voice overlays — even the most computer-illiterate individual {{should be able to}} figure this out. The Simpsons Cartoon Studio [...] is a very fun, relatively inexpensive jaunt into the mind of Mr. Groening." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{choose to}} analyse the differing physiques and playing {{styles of the}} two, while {{part of the debate}} revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players: Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character. When asked which he preferred, then FIFA president Sepp Blatter commented that Messi will [...] "always get a lot of votes because he plays well and scores goals" [...] before saying that Ronaldo [...] "is like a commander on the field of play. This is the other side of football and it's good to have commanders on the field. They don’t have the same attitude and that gives life to football. One has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other but that doesn't matter. I can't say who is the best. I like both of them, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> Messi".|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{says that}} his views on {{abortion}} were drastically altered on November 9, 2004, after discussing stem cell research with Douglas Melton, a stem cell researcher at Harvard University. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute was planning research that would have involved therapeutic cloning. The Governor says that Melton declared that the research [...] "is not a moral issue because we kill the embryos at 14days." [...] "I looked over at Beth Myers, my chief of staff, and we both had exactly the same reaction, which is it just hit us hard," [...] recalled Romney. [...] "And as they walked out, I said, 'Beth, we have cheapened the sanctity of life {{by virtue of the}} Roe v. Wade mentality.' And from that point forward, I said to the people of Massachusetts, 'I will continue to honor what I pledged to you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to call myself pro-life.'" [...] Melton disputes Romney's account of the meeting, declaring [...] "Governor Romney has mischaracterized my position; we didn't discuss killing or anything related to it ... I explained my work to him, told him about my deeply held respect for life, and explained that my work focuses on improving the lives of those suffering from debilitating diseases." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rochdale, Dec. 12, 1879.—Perhaps I {{ought to}} have written to you [...] sooner to {{acknowledge}} the receipt of your letter of the 28th ult., [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to let you get home before I wrote, and I was in [...] truth rather puzzled as to what I ought to say.|$|R
60|$|I felt disappointment. I {{was willing}} to admit drink {{in the case of}} my shoemaker, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> it as a {{recourse}} instead of a cause. Why had he pitched upon his perpetual, strange note of the Wandering Jew? Why his unutterable grief during his aberration? I could not yet accept whiskey as an explanation.|$|R
6000|$|Witherby had {{the task}} before him of transmuting an {{expression}} of rather low cunning into one of wounded confidence, mingled with high-minded surprise. [...] "I thought it had your ear-marks, Mr. Hubbard: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> not to believe it till I heard the fact from your own lips. I supposed that our contract covered such contributions as this." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{joined the}} Muslim Brotherhood Group {{and worked with}} Imam al-Banna. I was {{influenced}} by al-Banna's moderate thoughts and principles ... (Later) MB asked {{me to be a}} chairman, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to be a spiritual guide for the entire nation.... MB consider me their Mufti, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't have a relation with the organization, because being an MB chairman is something difficult requiring a highly sophisticated wisdom, and <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> to be devoted to the entire nation, and I feel comfortable with this decision. I like MB and consider them the nearest group to be righteous.|$|R
5000|$|Krol {{was born}} on February 20, 1919, in Hamilton, Ontario. He was {{commonly}} nicknamed [...] "King". He said in 1999, [...] "My parents are Polish and the name was actually Krul.

6000|$|... "Princess," [...] he said, [...] "there can {{be little}} {{conversation}} between us. Yet I shall ask you to remember this. Von Ragastein planned my death in cold blood. I could have slain him as an assassin, without the slightest risk, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to meet him {{face to face with}} the truth upon my lips. It was his life or mine. I fought for my country's sake, as he did for his." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was last}} winter. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> have been {{contented}} and happy this summer. Of course, {{it is not}} Philadelphia life, and I miss the excitement and gayety of my uncle's house. I knew my place was with my brothers. My aunt pleaded with me {{to live with her}} and not go to the wilderness. I had everything I wanted there--luxury, society, parties, balls, dances, friends--all that the heart of a girl could desire, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to come to this little frontier settlement. Strange choice for a girl, was it not?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By all means, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should <b>prefer</b> {{to do so}} as I go. Fool, {{is there}} any hiding place in this church, or must we stop here to have our throats cut?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was so very earnest and {{so really}} troubled, and he {{stumbled}} about {{so for the}} right word, and hit upon the wrong one with such unfailing disaster, that {{she must have been}} superhuman not to laugh.

5000|$|Dobbie prays aloud after dinner, {{invoking the}} aid of God in {{destroying}} our enemies. This is highly approved of by the Maltese, who have the same idea about God, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> would <b>prefer</b> an efficient Air force here.|$|R
60|$|I looked. Behold Madame, in shawl, wrapping-gown, and slippers, softly {{descending}} the steps, {{and stealing}} {{like a cat}} round the garden: in two minutes {{she would have been}} upon Dr. John. If she were like a cat, however, he, quite as much, resembled a leopard: nothing could be lighter than his tread when he chose. He watched, and as she turned a corner, he took the garden at two noiseless bounds. She reappeared, and he was gone. Rosine helped him, instantly interposing the door between him and his huntress. I, too, might have got, away, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>preferred</b> to meet Madame openly.|$|R
