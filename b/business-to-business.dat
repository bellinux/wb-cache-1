5|$|You Don't Know Jack was {{developed}} by Chicago-based company Jellyvision. The You Don't Know Jack (YDKJ) series, though popular in the 1990s during the rise of gaming on personal computers, had not had an official full release since 1998 with You Don't Know Jack: The Ride. Though Jellyvision offered some web-based You Don't Know Jack games in the interim years, the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s. Though they had considered adapting the game for consoles, and had produced two titles for the original PlayStation, they could only realize You Don't Know Jack games with players at the same keyboard for input. During this time, Jellyvision reinvented itself as Jellyvision Labs, offering its services in <b>business-to-business</b> communication including for tax software from H Block and interviews for Equifax.|$|E

25|$|Cradle-to-gate is an {{assessment}} of a partial product life cycle from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed <b>business-to-business</b> EDPs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.|$|E

2500|$|Pavlou and Majchrzak {{argued that}} {{research}} on <b>business-to-business</b> e-commerce portrayed technology as overly deterministic.

50|$|The main {{differences}} between business-to-consumer (B2C) and <b>business-to-business</b> CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases {{and length of}} relationships. <b>Business-to-business</b> companies tend to have smaller contact databases than business-to-consumer, the volume of sales in <b>business-to-business</b> is relatively small. There are fewer figure propositions in <b>business-to-business,</b> but in some cases, they cost {{a lot more than}} business-to-consumer items and relationships in <b>business-to-business</b> environment are built {{over a longer period of}} time. Furthermore, <b>business-to-business</b> CRM must be easily integrated with products from other companies. Such integration enables the creation of forecasts about customer behavior based on their buying history, bills, business success, etc. An application for a <b>business-to-business</b> company must have a function to connect all the contacts, processes and deals among the customers segment and then prepare a paper. Automation of sales process is an important requirement for <b>business-to-business</b> products. It should effectively manage the deal and progress it through all the phases towards signing. Finally, a crucial point is personalization. It helps the <b>business-to-business</b> company to create and maintain strong and long-lasting relationship with the customer.|$|E
