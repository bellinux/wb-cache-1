40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} mixed color {{sequential}} (MCS) algorithm with high contrast enhancement technique in RGB light-emitting diode (LED) backlight display. Owing to syn-chronous control of {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD) and LED panels, high quality image with suppressed color breakup (CBU) and motion blur effects is achieved by our novel color sequential tech-nique. Importantly, MCS algorithm is useful for color filter-less optical compensated bend (OCB) panel display for alleviating CBU and motion blur effects. Furthermore, high contrast image is also presented on LCD panel because of mixed red–green–blue (RGB) and cyan–magenta-yellow (CMY) backlights with op-timum power consumption. In other words, MCS algorithm with high contrast enhancement technique can have the better per-formance compared with other field sequential color techniques. Experimental results demonstrate by an actual RGB backlight module for 32 -in 1366 * 768 LCD panel the improvement of CBU and motion blur effects.

40|$|Abstract—The {{characteristics}} of nanotip-enhanced plasma lamps (NTL) as a <b>backlight</b> for <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays</b> {{have been investigated}} on a 14 -in panel. Using a direct-current pulse bipolar waveform driving, the NTL operates with lower igni-tion and sustain voltages below 300 V compared with conven-tional plasma lamps due to the tiny discharge gap between the indium tin oxide electrode and nanotip electrodes. Lumi-nous efficiencies of 16 lm/W at the lowest ignition voltage of 150 V have been realized for NTL, which correspond to 3780 cd/m 2 of luminance in 260 V with 50 torr of pure xenon gas. Index Terms—Lamps, LCD, microdischarge. R ECENTLY, <b>backlighting</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD) panels has become a key research issue for increasing the diagonal size for monitor to television applications. In increasing the diagonal size of the panel, cost is a major factor. Light-emitting diode backlight is still expensive compared with other backlights such as cold cathode fluorescent lamp, hot cathode fluorescent lamp, external electrode fluorescent lamp, and flat fluorescent lamp. Furthermore, the driving voltage of the existing backlights {{is higher than the}} 1 – 2 kV required to operate LCD. Producing difficulties in terms of luminous efficiency, cost, and electrical hazard. In this paper, we report on the nanotip-enhanced plasma lamp (NTL) using nanotip electrodes which are fabricated by semiconductor processes. The NTL ignites a wide and stable plasma along the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and silver electrodes on the front and rear panels, respectively [1]. The NTL excited the phosphor layer by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and generated visible white light at a lower ignition voltage because of the field emission at the nanotip electrodes. A plasma lamp has been reported, which used carbon nanotube as a needle electrode to converge the equipotential lines to improve the local electric field and generate the field emission [2]. The NTL uses xenon as a discharge gas to replace mercury. We investigated a 14 -in NTL mercury free flat plasma lamp for LCD backlight with low driving voltage, high luminance, and luminous efficiency...|$|R

25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as <b>backlights</b> in <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays).</b> Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|R
50|$|Powder phosphor-based {{electroluminescent}} {{panels are}} frequently used as <b>backlights</b> to <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays.</b> They readily provide a gentle, even illumination {{to the entire}} display while consuming relatively little electric power. This makes them convenient for battery-operated devices such as pagers, wristwatches, and computer-controlled thermostats, and their gentle green-cyan glow is a common sight in the technological world. They do, however, require relatively high voltage (between 60 and 600 volts). For battery-operated devices, this voltage must be generated by a converter circuit within the device; this converter often makes an audible whine or siren sound while the backlight is activated. For line-voltage-operated devices, it may be supplied directly from the power line. Electroluminescent nightlights operate in this fashion. Brightness per unit area increases with increased voltage and frequency.|$|R

When doped with 0. 1 wt% hexadecyltrimethylammonium perchlorate we observed that the SmAD phase of compound 9 could be switched with a relatively low voltage (58 VRMS, roughly half that required for the analogous nitrile). This apparent reduction in threshold voltage, which occurs as a consequence of switching from a nitrile- to a nitro- group, provides a new impetus to study alternative polar terminal groups when designing host materials for smectic A scattering devices...|$|R
30|$|High {{output power}} GaN-based {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) attract much attention {{because of their}} various applications in traffic signals, full-color <b>displays,</b> <b>backlight</b> in <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays,</b> solid-state lighting, and so forth [1]. At present, {{because of the difficulty}} of obtaining high-quality and reasonable-cost GaN substrates, sapphire is most commonly used as the substrate for LEDs due to its high-temperature stability and physical robustness. However, owing to the large lattice mismatch and thermal expansion between the epitaxial GaN film and the underneath sapphire substrate, high threading dislocation densities with the order of 109 to 1010  cm− 2 and deterioration of the electrical and optical properties, therefore, lead to poorer internal quantum efficiency (ηint) and reliability [2, 3]. On the other hand, the refractive index of nitride films (n[*]=[*] 2.5) is higher than that of sapphire substrates (n[*]=[*] 1.78) and air (n[*]=[*] 1). The critical angle of the escape cone is about 23 °, which indicates that only about 4  % of the generated light in the active layer can be extracted from the surface and mostly absorbed by the electrode at each reflection and gradually disappears due to total internal reflection, and is then converted to heat [4].|$|R
30|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} light source in next-generation solid-state lighting, GaN-based light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been extensively developed in past few years. Nowadays, GaN-based LEDs have already been used extensively in traffic signals, full-color displays, and <b>backlight</b> units for <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays.</b> To further extend the application arm of GaN-based LEDs to general lighting, further improvement on heat dissipation and light extraction efficiency are eagerly required. However, the poor thermal conductivity of sapphire prevents efficient dissipation of heat generated from the active area during operation, thus inducing seriously junction heating and the subsequent reduction of internal quantum efficiency. Moreover, the low light extraction efficiency caused by the absence of bottom reflector is also a problem associated with conventional GaN-based LEDs.|$|R

Considering {{that it is more}} important to make sure a high quality of the displayed image when reducing the power consumption, therefore, in this paper the new algorithm chooses R PSNR (the peak signal-to-noise ratio) = 30 as the lowest standard to guarantee the quality of image. R PSNR = 30 could provide a value that the maximum distortion of the image can be accepted, then, we substitute the maximum gray level of each region into the formula to judge whether satisfy the flow chart. If the value do not meet the condition, we decrease it one by one until find the right value. Finally, we take the luminance of the right value as backlight luminance.   Meanwhile, a method is also proposed in this paper to simplify the calculation time. Successive searches will be made on the basis of the n (ranging from 0. 1 to 1) times of the maximum luminance, and stop when R PSNR >= 30. However, in order to guarantee the quality of the image, the 0. 7 times of the maximum luminance is used as the minimum backlight luminance.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{have become}} a good {{alternative}} to traditional cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) for <b>backlighting</b> sources in <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays</b> (LCDs). LED <b>backlighting</b> provides a number of benefits over CCFLs, such as greater efficiency, better brightness, longer lifetime, higher dimming ratios, and lower drive circuitry voltage [1]. One application where a higher dimming ratio is desired is in aerospace cockpit LCD modules, which need to provide both high brightness for sunlight readability and also a high dimming ratio for very low brightness during nighttime operation. Two methods commonly used to dim LEDs are constant current reduction(CCR) and pulse width modulation(PWM) dimming. The downside to using CCR is the limited dimming ratio and nonlinearities in light output that occur from variations in luminous efficacy over the dimming range [2]. To obtain a high dimming ratio using PWM dimming, the LED current rise time must be sufficiently faster than the minimum PWM. This ensures {{that there will be}} no nonlinearities in the light output, which could result in visible flicker when operating at low-brightness settings. To provide higher system efficiency, a method for soft starting the LED regulator is presented. This method allows for reduced head room operation by ramping the LED current during turn-on, which results in a reduced voltage dip on the LED power supply. Finally, a method for head room adjustment that allows for adjustment of the LED supply voltage for variations in forward voltage over temperature and time is presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first demonstrations of two dynamic exit pupil (DEP) tracker techniques for autostereoscopic displays. The first DEP tracker forms an exit pupil pair {{for a single}} viewer in a defined space with low intraocular crosstalk using a pair of moving shutter glasses located within the optical system. A display prototype using the first DEP tracker is constructed {{from a pair of}} laser projectors, pupil-forming optics, moving shutter glasses at an intermediate pupil plane, an image relay lens, and a Gabor superlens based viewing screen. The left and right eye images are presented time-sequentially to a single viewer and seen as a 3 D image without wearing glasses and allows the viewer to move within a region of 40 cm x 20 cm in the lateral plane, and 30 cm along the axial axis. The second DEP optics can move the exit pupil location dynamically in a much larger 3 D space by using a custom spatial light modulator (SLM) forming an array of shutters. Simultaneous control of multiple exit pupils in both lateral and axial axes is demonstrated {{for the first time and}} provides a viewing volume with an axial extent of 0. 6 - 3 m from the screen and within a lateral viewing angle of +/- 20 degrees for multiple viewers.

30|$|Gallium nitride-based LEDs with {{wavelengths}} from ultraviolet to blue/green {{have attracted}} considerable research attention [15, 16]. GaN-based LEDs with high brightness {{can be used}} in applications such as large-size full-color displays, short-haul optical communication, traffic signal lights, and <b>backlights</b> for color <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays</b> [17 – 19]. The brightness of GaN-based LEDs depends on the external quantum efficiency (EQE), which is the product of internal quantum efficiency and LEE. Because of the inherently high refractive index contrast between free space and the semiconductor material, the calculated critical angle for the generated light to escape from the p-GaN layer into the air is approximately 23 °. The small critical angle indicated that few photons can be extracted from the device due to the total internal reflection (TIR). Thus, the LEE of GaN-based LEDs is very low, leading to a low EQE for GaN-based LEDs. Several studies [20 – 23] have employed textured or patterned sapphire as a back reflector {{to increase the number of}} escape photons. The LEE for GaN-based LEDs with textured or patterned sapphire can be improved by the high probability of photons reflected from sapphire. However, the mechanically and chemically strong nature of sapphire renders roughening and patterning a challenging task. In addition, achieving the small dimensions of scattering objects through photolithography is difficult because of the short wavelength of nitride-based LEDs. Studies [24 – 26] have reported that a textured GaN surface can be used to increase the critical angle to enhance the LEE. However, surface texturing of GaN-based LEDs is impeded by the thin p-GaN and the sensitivity of p-GaN to plasma damage and electrical deterioration. In addition to the textured GaN surface, some studies [27, 28] have attempted to roughen the mesa sidewalls through photochemical etching or create oblique mesa sidewalls through a reflowed photoresist and adjust the CF 4 flow during dry etching to increase the LEE. However, the surface of the rough mesa sidewalls was nonuniform, and the improved LEE for oblique mesa sidewalls was restricted within the sidewall region [29].|$|R
