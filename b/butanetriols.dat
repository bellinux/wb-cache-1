IntroductionCatalytic hydrogenolysis of C 4 -C 6 sugar-derived polyols (e. g. erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol) in {{aqueous solution}} is an interesting pathway {{for the production of}} many value-added chemicals. 1 Both cleavage of C-C bonds and C-O bonds can occur. In these processes, selectivity is a major issue due to the multitude and sequential steps, which result in a mixture of products. One objective {{of this study was to}} optimize the catalyst and reaction conditions for the selective C-O bond cleavage (in detriment of C-C) of erythritol in order to produce partially deoxygenated chemicals such as <b>butanetriols</b> (BTO), butanediols (BDO), and butanols (BuOH). The challenge is that smaller C 2 -C 3 polyols can be obtained from C-C bond cleavage, in addition to cyclic molecules (by internal dehydration) and threitol by isomerization. These catalysts were then studied for the hydrogenolysis of sorbitol. On the other hand, the production of C 2 -C 3 polyols (i. e. ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and glycerol (GL)) by C-C bond cleavage of xylitol is known to be favored in basic media. 2 The second objective of this work was to investigate the effect of Ca(OH) 2 amount for glycols production and to develop bifunctional catalysts associating a basic oxide and Ru sites on active carbon to operate in base-free conditions. 2. Experimental Ru catalysts were prepared by impregnation with aqueous solutions of Ru(NO) (NO 3) 3 of bare or basic oxide modified active carbon. Bimetallic Rh-ReOx catalysts supported on TiO 2 and ZrO 2 were prepared by successive impregnation with aqueous solutions of RhCl 3 and NH 4 ReO 4. The solids were dried, reduced in flowing H 2, and passivated with flowing 1 %O 2 in N 2. The experiments were performed in 300 mL batch reactors at 200 °C and under H 2 pressures in the range 40 - 120 bar. Quantitative analysis were performed using HPLC instruments equipped with RID and UV detectors in series, using Rezex ROA-Organic acid and RCM-monosaccharide Ca 2 + columns. The carbon balances was verified using a TOC-VCSH analyzer (Shimadzu). The catalysts were characterized by XPS, TEM, XRD and ICP and CO 2 -TPD. 3. Results and discussionC-O hydrogenolysisIn the selective hydrogenolysis of erythritol to BTO and BDO, the addition of ReOx species to supported rhodium metal enhanced the catalytic activity and selectivity towards C-O hydrogenolysis products. The influence of reaction conditions (e. g. temperature, pressure of H 2, acid additive, effect of support) were studied to optimize the selectivity to partially deoxygenated C 4 products. The selectivity to BTO increased from 10 - 13 % to 35 - 37 %, respectively, when the pressure increased from 30 to 120 bar. This enhancement was accompanied with the decrease in selectivity to BDO from 43 to 28 % (as a function of pressure) over Rh-ReOx/TiO 2. Conversely, no drastic changes were noticed in the presence of Rh-ReOx/ZrO 2 where the selectivity to BDO remained constant around 26 - 29 %. In the presence of both catalysts, the mass balance was > 90 % except under 30 bar of hydrogen. The loss of carbon in aqueous phase is due to the formation of short-chain compounds which have been transferred from the liquid phase to the gas phase, such as CO 2 or alkanes. C-C hydrogenolysis In neutral aqueous solution, the main reactions were epimerization of xylitol to arabitol and adonitol (C 5 alditols) at 80 % conversion of xylitol with a catalytic activity of 727 molxylitol. h- 1. molRu- 1. With the addition of Ca(OH) 2 (xylitol/OH-= 8. 5. 10 - 4), the activity decreased to 67 molxylitol. h- 1. molRu- 1, however the retro-aldol condensation was promoted and a combined selectivity to EG and PG of 25 % was observed. The best selectivities to EG (25 %) and PG (32 %) were obtained for the xylitol/OH- ratio of 0. 13. Beyond this value, the production of LA became predominant (25 %). In neutral conditions and in comparison with Ru/C catalyst, 3. 1 %Ru/ 4. 5 %MnO/C yielded lower concentrations of epimers and C 4 products and higher glycol production (selectivity of 34 %) with an activity of 220 molxylitol h- 1 molRu- 1. However, a substantial leaching of MnO was observed and must be due to the production of LA and other carboxylic acid compounds. Different ways to limit the leaching were explored. 4. Conclusions We have demonstrated that Rh-ReOx catalysts supported on TiO 2 and ZrO 2 are selective for C-O bond hydrogenolysis of erythritol. In the presence of 3. 7 wt%Rh– 3. 5 wt%ReOx/ZrO 2 catalyst, the highest selectivity to (BTO & BDO) reached 66 % at 80 % conversion of erythritol. Regarding C-C hydrogenolysis, the selectivity to the glycols is clearly dictated by the presence of a base. The addition of MnO oxide favors C-C cleavage by retro-aldol condensation in neutral conditions...|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE: Glycerol {{serves as}} the {{principal}} backbone moiety bound to various acyl/alkyl chains for membrane lipids of Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. In this study, we report a suite of unusual tetraether lipids in {{which one of the}} two conventional glycerol backbones is substituted by <b>butanetriol</b> or pentanetriol. METHODS: Identification of these lipids was achieved via diagnostic fragments and their expected acetylation products using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and their diagnostic ether cleavage products using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). RESULTS: We observed structural variations in the polyol backbones and alkyl chains and term these core lipid derivatives: isoprenoidal <b>butanetriol</b> dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (iso-BDGTs), isoprenoidal pentanetriol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (iso-PDGTs), and hybrid isoprenoidal/branched BDGTs and PDGTs (ib-BDGTs, ib-PDGTs). Of these, iso-BDGTs were the most abundant with a methylation at either the sn- 1 or sn- 3 position of glycerol and were also found as part of intact polar lipids, adjoined to mono- or diglycosidic headgroups. Iso-BDGTs and iso-PDGTs are likely produced by Archaea, as indicated by the presence of the characteristic biphytanyl moieties. CONCLUSIONS: Butanetriol- and pentanetriol-based tetraether lipids occur in modern estuarine and deeply buried subseafloor sediments, suggesting the presence of alternative backbones in archaeal lipids...|$|R

Chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (both (S) - and (R)-forms) has been synthesized in high enantiomeric purity from (S)- and (R)-1,2,4-butanetriol, respectively, obtained from chiral feedstocks. Thus, the chiral (S)-1,2,4-butanetriol intermediate was cyclized to chiral (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran {{in the presence}} of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) catalyst at temperatures of 180−220 °C. [...] Similarly, (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran {{was prepared}} in 95.8% optical purity from L-malic acid via an esterification-reduction-cyclodehydration sequence. 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran has been synthesized via hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofuran employing various borane reagents and chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurans have also been prepared by catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofurans with a borane {{in the presence of}} a homogeneous chiral platinum complex, followed by oxidation. Racemic 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran may be prepared in analogous fashion from racemic <b>butanetriol,</b> employing PTSA catalyst for the dehydrocyclization.

40|$|AbstractTo analyse {{the effect}} of the altered {{glycerol}} backbone structure on the glycerophospholipid conformation, we have replaced the glycerol moiety by the rac- 1, 2, 4 -butanetriol residue in 1, 2 -diacyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholines (PC), and then analysed the resulting 1, 2 -dialkanoyloxy-rac-but- 4 -yl-[2 -(trimethylammonium) ethyl] phosphates (1, 2 -bPC) and 1, 3 -dialkanoyloxy-rac-but- 4 -yl-[2 -(trimethylammonium) ethyl] phosphates (1, 3 -bPC) by high-resolution 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy in both CDCl 3 and D 2 O. The preferred conformation about the C 1 –C 2 glycerol bond in PC was almost completely preserved in 1, 2 -bPC, but it was completely random in case of 1, 3 -bPC. Out of the three C–C bonds present in the <b>butanetriol</b> backbone of 1, 3 -bPC, only the C 2 –C 3 bond experienced a restricted rotation. However, the conformational preference about this bond was virtually similar to that observed for the C 1 –C 2 bond in PC. These results clearly demonstrate that the preferred conformation of the glycerol backbone is determined primarily by the intramolecular acyl chain stacking which essentially requires a vicinal arrangement of the acyl chains in glycerophospholipids...|$|R
