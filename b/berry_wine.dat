40|$|The açaí berry {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} for dieters and the health conscious. The berry contains high levels of antioxidants. The main anthocyanins are cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside and cyanidin- 3 -glucoside. The berries also contain vitamins and nutrients that help boost energy and alertness, and fatty acids that help maintain normal cholesterol levels. As {{a result of the}} health benefits of the constituents, the berries are chosen for obtaining the active ingredients by extraction. The solids left over after extraction still contain nutrients and useful components. There is a possibility of fermenting this residual and creating an açaí <b>berry</b> <b>wine.</b> Açaí <b>berry</b> <b>wine</b> is another new product on the market. The extracts and the wine are analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In an effort to utilize every part of the berry, the residual from the extract is also successfully fermented. Pilot plant studies are conducted utilizing supercritical carbon dioxide, an ethanol entrainer to increase its solubility, and subcritical water to extract components from freeze dried açaí berry. There is much potential and flexibility in the process, which effectively extracted lipids from the berry leaving behind anthocyanins without solvent residue...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of raw material, pressing, and glycosidase on the aromatic profile of goji <b>berry</b> <b>wine.</b> The free-run and the pressed juice of dried and fresh goji berries were used for wine production, whereas glycosidase was applied to wine after fermentation. Dried goji berry fermented wine exhibited much stronger fruity, floral, caramel, and herbaceous odors due {{to higher levels of}} esters, β-ionone and methionol. However, fresh berry fermented wine possessed stronger chemical notes due to higher levels of 4 -ethylphenol. Pressing treatment reduced the fruity and caramel odors in these fermented wines, and fresh berry free-run juice fermented wine exhibited the least floral aroma. Glycosidase addition did not alter the aromatic composition of wines. The principal component analysis indicated that goji raw material played a primary role in differentiating the aromatic profiles of the wines due to the difference on the content of 20 esters, nine benzenes, eight aldehydes/ketones, three acids, two alcohols and six other volatiles. The content differences on isopentyl alcohol, styrene, benzyl alcohol, 1 -octanol, (E) - 5 -decen- 1 -ol, 1 -hexanol, and β-cyclocitral resulted in the segregation of the wines with and without the pressing treatment, especially for fresh berry fermented wine...|$|E
40|$|The fruit (goji berry) of Lycium barbarum, a {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, {{has been widely}} used in health diets due to its potential role {{in the prevention of}} chronic diseases. One of the most popular applications of goji berry is to make goji wine in China by steeping goji berry in grain liquor. However, how the steeping process affects antioxidant capacities and phytochemicals of goji berry is not yet fully understood. Therefore, to provide scientific data for the utilization of goji berry in the nutraceutical industry, the diffusion rate of betaine, β-carotene, phenolic compounds in goji berry and their antioxidant capacities affected by alcohol concentration and steeping time were determined by UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The results showed that low alcohol concentration (15 % or 25 %) would promote the diffusion of betaine and increase antioxidant activity, while high concentration (55 % or 65 %) would generally increase the diffusion of flavonoids and reduce antioxidant activity. The steeping time had no significant effect on the diffusion of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities. However, all goji <b>berry</b> <b>wine</b> steeped for 14 days with different alcohol concentrations exhibited the highest betaine concentration.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a serine aminopeptidase that is a novel target for type 2 diabetes therapy due to its incretin hormone regulatory effects. In this study, well-characterized anthocyanins (ANC) isolated from <b>berry</b> <b>wine</b> blends and twenty-seven other phenolic compounds commonly present in citrus, berry, grape, and soybean, were individually investigated for their inhibitory effects on DPP-IV by using a luminescence assay and computational modeling. ANC from blueberry-blackberry wine blends strongly inhibited DPP-IV activity (IC 50, 0. 07 [*]±[*] 0. 02 to > 300 [*]μM). Of the twenty-seven phenolics tested, the most potent DPP-IV inhibitors were resveratrol (IC 50, 0. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 4 [*]nM), luteolin (0. 12 [*]±[*] 0. 01 [*]μM), apigenin (0. 14 [*]±[*] 0. 02 [*]μM), and flavone (0. 17 [*]±[*] 0. 01 [*]μM), with IC 50 values lower than diprotin A (4. 21 [*]±[*] 2. 01 [*]μM), a reference standard inhibitory compound. Analyses of computational modeling showed that resveratrol and flavone were competitive inhibitors which could dock directly into all three active sites of DPP-IV, while luteolin and apigenin docked in a noncompetitive manner. Hydrogen bonding was the main binding mode of all tested phenolic compounds with DPP-IV. These results indicate that flavonoids, particularly luteolin, apigenin, and flavone, and the stilbenoid resveratrol can act as naturally occurring DPP-IV inhibitors...|$|E

The relationships between climatic {{variables and the}} yield, and novel technological berry quality (QItechnologicalberry), phenolic berry quality (QIphenolicberry), overall berry quality (QIoverallberry), and wine quality (QIwine) indices confirmed {{that the most important}} climatic factors were rainfall, temperature, and radiation. Climate was more influential in determining yield, <b>berry,</b> and <b>wine</b> composition in some important physiological periods such as early season (budburst–fruit set) and ripening (véraison–harvest). In general, climate had more influence on berry quality than on wine quality indices and greater QIoverallberry was also reflected in greater QIwine. According to the stepwise multiple regression, the best fitted models for the partial root-zone drying irrigation (PRI) system were less complex (with a lower number of climatic variables) than for the regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) system, suggesting that PRI is less influenced by climatic factors than RDI. For PRI, the models for yield, <b>berry</b> and <b>wine</b> quality were explained by three climatic factors (rainfall, Tª, and radiation), whereas for RDI, more climatic factors came into play (number of hours of sunshine, evapotranspiration, and vapor pressure deficit). According to these models, in RDI, a sunny and drier pre-véraison period followed by higher soil water availability and associated greater crop evapotranspiration during ripening favored final <b>berry</b> and <b>wine</b> quality. In contrast, in PRI, greater rainfall during the growing season and greater solar radiation during ripening were the main climatic factors that positively influenced the yield response, <b>berry</b> and <b>wine</b> quality. Besides, <b>berry</b> quality in PRI was more affected (negatively) by high temperatures (high Tªmax and Tªmin) during the growing season than in RDI and SDI, indicating that cooler and humid years may favor the PRI response more. These results suggest that years with a cool, wet winter followed by a mild, wet spring and early summer (April–June) and a mild fruit set–véraison period (June–July), and then greater solar radiation during ripening (August–mid-September) provide adequate growth potential and increase the likelihood of higher <b>berry</b> and <b>wine</b> quality in PRI. Besides, more irrigated SDI vines were less sensitive to high temperatures and low soil water content during ripening than RDI and PRI vines.

40|$|Background and Aims: Interactions are {{the main}} causes of {{complexity}} in field experiments; however, no studies have combined water and temperature regimes in field-growing vines. Here we assessed grape and wine attributes from a field trial where these factors were directly manipulated. Methods and Results: The experiment consisted of Shiraz vines grown in a 22 factorial experiment with two temperature (control and heated) and two water regimes (deficit and irrigated) during two seasons (2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12). The sensory and compositional characteristics of grapes and wines were assessed in both seasons, whereas a detailed profile of the phenolic substances was determined by spectrophotometry in 2011 / 12. We found additive effects (i. e. lack of interaction) between temperature and water for berry mass and components, fruit composition (titratable acidity and pH), grape phenolic substances (12. 5 % ethanol-extracted {{and most of the}} 70 % acetone-extracted), wine phenolic substances (chemical age 2), and wine sensory traits (floral aromas and berry flavours). Significantly, previously unrecorded interactions between temperature and water were found for grape phenolic substances (70 % acetone-extracted skin and seed tannins and total phenolic substances per <b>berry),</b> <b>wine</b> phenolic substances (colour density, tannins and phenolic substances) and wine sensory traits (floral aromas, cooked fruit flavours and tannin structure). Conclusion: The effect of water deficit leading to colourful and flavoursome wines rich in phenolic substances may not be held under high temperature. Significance of the Study: Our study anticipates the drier and hotter climate of the Barossa Valley, and provides industry with indications of a shift in wine profiles that would require technological innovation to maintain the identity of Barossa Shiraz.

40|$|Berry sensory {{assessment}} (BSA) is {{a technique}} that can help grapegrowers and winemakers make decisions about harvest date and grape product allocation. BSA as a structured technique {{has been used by}} grapegrowers, winemakers and researchers for the last thirteen years. However the number of studies reporting results of the effect of viticultural practices on berry sensory characteristics and wine quality is limited. This thesis examined the BSA technique through four different studies. Study one is a combined review literature review and industry survey paper in which the methodology of Berry Sensory Assessment is presented and the research conducted using BSA is discussed. It also presents the results of a survey channeled to Australian grapegrowers and Australian and New Zealand winemakers about their experience using BSA, their perceptions on its use and their suggestions for improving the methodology. It was evident from the survey that 90 % of grapegrowers and winemakers use BSA and they want to understand the link between BSA and wine quality. These results demonstrated the importance of BSA for wine producers and the need for further improvement. The aim of study number two was to determine if berry sensory attributes and berry compositional variables could predict wine sensory attributes, wine compositional variables and wine quality in Shiraz. The analyses of <b>berry</b> and <b>wine</b> sensory attributes, compositional measures and wine quality using partial least squares regression and Pearson’s correlations from two seasons identified several relationships between berry sensory attributes and wine sensory attributes and quality. A significant negative relationship was identified between seed bitterness and wine savoury spice flavour for the two seasons. The berry sensory attribute pulp detachment from the skin was identified as a predictor of various wine sensory attributes (eg. the harder to detach skin from the pulp the higher intensity for wine body colour, rim colour and dark <b>berry</b> aroma) and <b>wine</b> quality scores in the season 2011. The aim of study number three was to determine if berries stored at - 20 °C for three months could be used instead of fresh berries to conduct BSA. Being able to conduct BSA on frozen berries could help to reduce sensory fatigue in assessors by allowing them to evaluate samples over a longer time period and to schedule BSA away from the busy harvest period. The results of this study determined that sensory profile from Shiraz berries differed in five sensory attributes – pulp sweetness, pulp fresh fig flavour, skin colour extraction, skin bitterness and seed astringency - between fresh and frozen berries at three times of harvest, preventing the evaluation of these five sensory attributes in Shiraz frozen berries. Study number four aimed to determine the effect of three rootstocks on sensory and compositional differences of Shiraz grapes and wines in comparison to a nongrafted control. The trial was conducted over two seasons. <b>Berry</b> and <b>wine</b> sensory and compositional {{differences were found between the}} grafted treatments and the nongrafted control. PCA was able to discriminate the wines from the four treatments in three groups of aroma compounds (acetate esters, ethyl esters and higher alcohols) in both seasons. The results of wine quality scores from two seasons showed that the un-grafted treatment had the lowest quality and 110 Richter and Schwarzmann the highest. The findings from this study identified relationships between the sensory and compositional variables in <b>berries</b> and <b>wines</b> that are affecting wine quality.

In {{the last few decades}} the trend of increasing global temperatures has affected the accumulation of sugars in berries and hence the degree of alcohol in resultant wines. Therefore numerous studies have considered different agronomic practices that limit photosynthetic activity. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a natural anti-transpirant on grapevine physiology and <b>berry</b> and <b>wine</b> composition on different cultivars. In 2013 and 2014, in South Italy and Souther Australia, Aglianico and Falanghina, Shiraz and Semillon vines were treated at veraison with the anti-transpirant Vapor Gard® (T) and compared with a control (C) sprayed just with water. A bunch thinning (BT) treatment was also applied to both the Vapor Gard® treatment and the control. For each treatment was assessed vegetative response (pruning weight) and production (production and number of bunches per plant, TSS, pH, TA, polyphenols, anthocyanins) of individual varieties. Consideration was also the effectiveness of the film terpene that has come to form on the leaves, limiting gas exchange, through measurements of net photosynthesis and transpiration (LI- 6400). The results demonstrate that the application of anti-transpirant has reduced assimilation rate (A), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), sugars berries accumulation (TSS) and wine alcohol degrees (% vol.).

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of timing of leaf removal on yield components, berry sensory characteristics, composition and sensory properties of Vitis vinifera L. Grenache wines under non-irrigated conditions. Methods and results: The effects of timing of defoliation (fruit set and veraison) on yield components, <b>berry</b> maturity, <b>wine</b> composition and sensory properties of head trained, non irrigated, Grenache vines grown in Rioja appellation were studied. Leaf removal did not significantly modify total leaf area per vine as well as yield components. Grenache berries from early defoliated vines achieved the highest skin and technological maturity. Wine parameters, such as alcohol content, pH, titratable acidity, tartaric acid and total polyphenol index were unaffected by defoliation. Conversely, early leaf removal carried out at fruit set, significantly reduced the malic acid content of the wine and enhanced its colour intensity. Aroma complexity, mouthfeel, tannin quality and persistence were found to be significantly higher in the wine corresponding to the early leaf removal treatment. This was also the most preferred wine in terms of overall value. Conclusion: This article shows that timing of leaf removal had a marked effect on <b>berry</b> maturity, <b>wine</b> composition and sensory properties of Grenache wines made from grapes grown under dry-farmed conditions. Significance and impact of study: The results suggest that the timing of defoliation induces significant changes in Grenache wine composition and its sensory attributes.

40|$|Almost {{since the}} {{beginning}} of time, people have been making wines from all sorts of plants, and not just from grapes but also from wild and cultivated <b>berries.</b> The <b>wine</b> of the Marula berry is much loved throughout eastern and southern Africa, but it could soon be facing competition from the berry of the Eembe tree Berchemia discolor. Researchers in Namibia have produced a very passable wine from the fruit of this tree which can grow up to 18 metres high in dry areas ranging from Sudan to southern Africa. The Windhoek university team bought its dried fruits on the market, dissolved the pectins, and added citric acid to increase acidity. They used commercially available yeasts rather than natural yeasts to bring on the fermentation process. The initial must had an alcohol strength of 8. 6 °; adding extra sugars brought it up to 12. 3 °. Aerobic fermentation lasted for 5 days, and the anaerobic for a further 3 months. Taste tests showed that added sugar and sulphur dioxide improved quality. The method has been written up in detail in Volume 6, Number 3, 2001 of the Journal of Food Technology in Africa.

40|$|Sangiovese, {{the most}} {{widespread}} red <b>berry</b> Italian <b>wine</b> variety, occupies 69790 ha of the total national vine surface. Just in Emilia Romagna, predominantly in the hillsides from Imola to Rimini, this variety covers over 8000 ha, roughly 13, 4 % of the region’s vine surface. As part of the C. R. P. V. project “Viticultural zoning of the Romagna hills”, 15 vineyards of Sangiovese with similar age, plant densities and training systems but different altitudes were identified and their pedologic characteristics accurately described. The results show that altitude and the geology of the soil, and consequent deriving soil characteristics, are the main environmental factors that influence production, sugar level and anthocyanins content in the Sangiovese variety. In fact, also the final wines show a different colour intensity, structure and aroma depending on the soil type...|$|R

40|$|Rotundone is a {{sesquiterpene}} {{that gives}} grapes and wine a desirable 'peppery' aroma. Previous research {{has reported that}} growing grapevines in a cool climate {{is an important factor}} that drives rotundone accumulation in grape <b>berries</b> and <b>wine.</b> This study used historical data sets to investigate which weather parameters are mostly influencing rotundone concentration in grape <b>berries</b> and <b>wine.</b> For this purpose, wines produced from 15 vintages from the same Shiraz vineyard (The Old Block, Mount Langi Ghiran, Victoria, Australia) were analysed for rotundone concentration and compared to comprehensive weather data and minimal temperature information. Degree hours were obtained by interpolating available temperature information from the vineyard site using a simple piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method (PCHIP). Results showed that the highest concentrations of rotundone were consistently found in wines from cool and wet seasons. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the concentration of rotundone in wine was negatively correlated with daily solar exposure and grape bunch zone temperature, and positively correlated with vineyard water balance. Finally, models were constructed based on the Gompertz function to describe the dynamics of rotundone concentration in berries through the ripening process according to phenological and thermal times. This characterisation is an important step forward to potentially predict the final quality of the resultant wines based on the evolution of specific compounds in berries according to critical environmental and micrometeorological variables. The modelling techniques described in this paper were able to describe the behaviour of rotundone concentration based on seasonal weather conditions and grapevine phenological stages, and could be potentially used to predict the final rotundone concentration early in future growing seasons. This could enable the adoption of precision irrigation and canopy management strategies to effectively mitigate adverse impacts related to climate change and microclimatic variability, such as heat waves, within a vineyard on wine quality.

40|$|Continental Croatia wine {{region and}} {{especially}} Kutjevo vineyards {{are famous for}} their predicate wines production and quality. The most common grape varieties used there for different types of predicate wine are Welsch Riesling and Traminer. Ice wines, selected harvest <b>wines</b> and dry <b>berry</b> selection <b>wines</b> from different harvest years were examined by HPLC method to determine organic acids composition. The oldest sample was Traminer selected harvest from vintage year 1990, while the youngest wine was Traminer ice wine from harvest 2011. The dominant organic acids in all analyzed wines were tartaric, malic, citric and galactaric, ranged from 0. 09 to 2. 98 g/L. In most wines the difference in concentration of glucuronic, galacturonic and gluconic acids was established. The highest content of glucuronic acid was 58. 4 mg/L in Traminer dry berry selection 2011. Galacturonic acid dominated in the same wine (924 mg/L), just like gluconic acid (141 mg/L) ...|$|R
40|$|The grapevine is an {{economically}} important crop {{and a model}} species of long-lived perennials widely used in bioclimatic studies. Ambient temperature modulates berry composition, hence the significant research effort in establishing links between temperature, <b>berry</b> composition and <b>wine</b> attributes. Our current understanding {{of the effect of}} temperature on <b>berries</b> and <b>wines</b> has been largely gained from indirect methods or direct methods in controlled conditions. Indirect methods include comparisons of thermally contrasting locations and vintages; this approach is of value but is bound to be inconclusive as the effect of temperature is often confounded with other weather and climate factors (solar radiation, vapour pressure deficit and rainfall), manage- ment practices and soils. Direct experimental methods comparing fruit grown at a range of temperature are required to prove cause-and-effect, but attempts to modify the thermal regime of the plant often generate secondary effects. Experimental artefacts in controlled environments often include small soil volume, lack of wind and altered radiation regimes, with direct implications for plant physiology and berry composition. Experiments involving controlled temperature in vineyards aim at a higher degree of realism, but are constrained by cost, issues of scale in space and time, and are not necessarily free from artefacts. Indirect and direct methods are of course non-mutually exclusive but complementary. This review critically assesses the methods used to elucidate the effect of temperature on grape berry composition. It emphasises the limitations of studies where confounded effects are overlooked. With the focus on selected berry traits (total soluble solids, total and titratable acidity and anthocyanins), we analyse the dominant effect of temperature and highlight discrepancies and agreements between indirect and direct research methods.

40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effects}} of exogenous melatonin treatment of pre-veraison grapes on phenolic components and antioxidants of grape <b>berries</b> and <b>wine.</b> The results showed an increase in the concentration of cyanin- 3 -O-glucoside, peonidin derivatives, and two flavanols [namely (+) -catechins and (−) -epicatechins] of grapes, as well as flavonols in both grapes and wine due to the application of melatonin. These compounds are derivatives of the catalysate of flavonoid 3 ’-hydroxylase (F 3 ’H) in the flavonoid synthesis pathway of plants. It can be inferred that melatonin increased the activity of F 3 ’H or expression of VvF 3 ’H during grape berry maturation. In addition, two melatonin treatments of pre-veraison grape berries reduced the DPPH radical-scavenging ability and copper ion-reducing power of grapes and wine, whereas one melatonin treatment just reduced those in wine. This study will provide a practical strategy to change the phenolic composition of grapes and wine...|$|R
