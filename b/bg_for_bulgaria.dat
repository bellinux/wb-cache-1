40|$|Abstract. Let G be a {{discrete}} group. In this note we {{build a bridge}} between the homotopy theory of BG and the theory of proper G-actions, by showing that under mild restrictions, the classifying space for proper G-bundles has the homotopy type of the W-nullication of <b>BG</b> <b>for</b> some space W. This allows us to use properties of the localization functors to obtain spaces that are homotopy equivalent to <b>BG</b> <b>for</b> a wide range of groups, and on the other hand, we take prot of the existence of well-known geometrical and nite-dimensional models of <b>BG</b> <b>for</b> some innite groups for obtaining homotopical information about the p-primary part of their classifying spaces. 1...|$|R
