His wife, however, conceived again and again. She became pregnant twelve times and each time she had a daughter. By that time his business started to go wrong for him since the ships that took his goods to sell in another country were robbed several times.

40|$|To develop {{effective}} {{biological control}} methods for management of Fusarium wilt of banana, 71 endophytic bacteria were isolated from root and corm tissues and 37 bacteria were {{isolated from the}} rhizospheres of 21 different banana accessions. The in vitro screening of these microbes against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (causal agent of Fusarium wilt in banana) demonstrated that six endophytic and four rhizospheric bacterial isolates reduced the severity of Fusarium wilt while not totally suppressing the disease. These effective bacteria were mixed in different combinations and evaluated in cv. Grand Naine. Soil applications of five different combinations resulted in complete suppression of Fusarium wilt and increased plant growth parameters and number of roots compared to control plants. Field evaluation of these five combinations of bacterial isolates {{in an area of}} heavy inoculum and using cv. Grand Naine indicated that all the bacterial combinations suppressed Fusarium wilt and increased the number of <b>banana</b> <b>hands</b> (up to 155 %) and bunch weight (up to 214 %) as compared to untreated controls. These bacterial antagonists survived in the rhizosphere for up to 35 d and completely colonized roots, corms, pseudo stems and petioles 15 d after inoculation. The combination of bacterial antagonists could provide sustainable management of Fusarium wilt in banana under field conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|The manual {{transportation}} of banana bunches within plots provokes physical damages to fruits compromising their quality. To assess {{the influence of}} the distance banana bunches travel on the shoulders of harvesters within the plot, on the incidence of physical damages present on the peel of fruits of the Nanicão cultivar, two experiments were carried out in the Vale do Ribeira region (SP), in sites with slope < 1 %. Each experiment divided the plot in different distance bands, two of which were included in this study: one located far away from the collection roads (30 - 50 m and 80 - 100 m distance bands) and another in an intermediate position (70 - 80 m and 130 - 150 m distance bands). For each distance band, six banana bunches of 36 mm gauged fruits were randomly sampled. Four <b>banana</b> <b>hands</b> were cut from the middle region of each bunch and ten fruits were assessed per hand, totaling 240 fruits per treatment. Bunches were harvested at the same maturity degree and those served as control were not transported. A total of 1440 fruits was assessed in the two experiments. The physical damages on the fruit surface were graded on a scale with 6 divisions: 0 - 0. 25 cm²; 0. 25 - 0. 5 cm²; 0. 5 - 1. 0 cm²; 1. 0 - 1. 5 cm²; 1. 5 - 2. 0 cm²; 2. 0 - 2. 5 cm².

40|$|The postharvest {{development}} of crown rot of bananas depends notably on the fruit susceptibility to this disease at harvest. It {{has been shown}} that fruit susceptibility to crown rot is variable and it was suggested that this depends on environmental preharvest factors. However, {{little is known about the}} preharvest factors influencing this susceptibility. The aim of this work was to evaluate the extent to which fruit filling characteristics during growth and the fruit development stage influence the banana susceptibility to crown rot. This involved evaluating the influence of (a) the fruit position at different levels of the <b>banana</b> bunch (<b>hands)</b> and (b) changing the source–sink ratio (So–Si ratio), on the fruit susceptibility to crown rot. The fruit susceptibility was determined by measuring the internal necrotic surface (INS) after artificial inoculation of Colletotrichum musae. A linear correlation (r = − 0. 95) was found between the hand position on the bunch and the INS. The So–Si ratio was found to influence the pomological characteristics of the fruits and their susceptibility to crown rot. Fruits of bunches from which six hands were removed (two hands remaining on the bunch) proved to be significantly less susceptible to crown rot (INS = 138. 3 mm 2) than those from bunches with eight hands (INS = 237. 9 mm 2). The banana susceptibility to crown rot is thus likely to be influenced by the fruit development stage and filling characteristics. The present results highlight the importance of standardising hand sampling on a bunch when testing fruit susceptibility to crown rot. They also show that hand removal in the field has advantages in the context of integrated pest management, making it possible to reduce fruit susceptibility to crown rot while increasing fruit size.

40|$|In 1996, the European banana import {{regime was}} {{under attack by}} the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The United States, {{supported}} by three major multinational corporations in the banana industry along with four Latin American countries, placed pressure on Europe to comply with trade obligations regarding its banana import regime, as they deemed it was functioning illegally. There will be many meetings and consultations {{in the coming year}} culminating in a vote on modifying fundamental rules of the Common Market Organization for Bananas (CMOB), which had been adopted at Marrakech in 1995. The new legislation may be very detrimental to member states of the ACP. The possibilities for growth of ACP member states, traditional suppliers to Europe, is dependent upon current negotiations regarding repartition of quotas. The extent of the current socioeconomic crisis, which could prompt WTO to take corrective measures, is already quite alarming for other Caribbean countries where banana production is the main resource (particularly, for example, Dominica, St Lucia, and Jamaica). Indeed, for several years now, these countries have suffered from diminished competitivity because they have not made needed structural changes. However, opportunities for diversification exist, these include: the opening up of other markets, reinvigoration of local markets, amelioration of channels of production and commercialization of high quality products such as organic bananas and the fair trade banana. But it is wise to be realistic, the roads to diversification, although realizable, are not without their challenges. World trade figures for bananas account for only 13. 3 tonnes of bananas (FAO, 1996). Whereas 80 % of all bananas produced worldwide go to domestic markets. In most producing countries, bananas are very popular and used in a variety of local dishes. Both in terms of production and consumption, plantain {{is at the top of}} the popularity hit list. It literally provides food security for millions of people. Of the 28. 3 million tonnes of plantain produced worldwide, 69. 4 % is destined for human consumption, 11. 1 % processed and 8 % fed to livestock. More than 60 % of this world volume is produced and consumed in central and western Africa. Plantain production is targeted for domestic consumption and thus marketed according to traditional strategies. The plantain trade is closely tied to urban market trends, with demand rising steadily as the population grows. This trade is also dependent on the marketing subsector organisation - transporters, wholesalers, retailers - which varies from country to country. Plantain is transported from plantation to market in a variety of ways, e. g. on labourers' backs, in a refrigerated lorry, by canoe and on bicycles. In Ghana, market retailers and traders go to the plantations or villages themselves to purchase plantain supplies from farmers with whom they have established agreements. Whole bunches are placed in baskets; <b>banana</b> <b>hands</b> and fingers are put in bags and carried out manually to the road. A lorry driver is then paid to transport the fruit to market, and collector-wholesalers often arrange the lorry transport operation. The bananas are sold to middlemen or traders, who sell them to retailers, who in turn sell them to consumers in bunches or separate fingers. The complexity of the intermediary subsector increases proportionally around distribution hubs with the distance between production and supply markets, especially when the approach routes are in good shape. This trend is well established in Caribbean countries such as St Vincent, whereas it is just emerging in Africa. For instance, jobbers group around important markets in southwestern Cameroon (Mile 60, Bole and Owe). The banana plantations are quite remote from Douala (100 - 150 km), not easily accessible, and often impassable in the rainy season. Large quantities of plantain are delivered to the city markets on a daily basis via regular distribution channels, and the longest one involves three main types of middleman: collector-wholesalers (purchasing 50 - 500 bunches from the producers), sedentary wholesalers, who sell to retailers on a per-bunch basis in the wholesale and retail markets of Douala, and these retailers in turn sell to consumers or other retailers on a per-finger basis. Middlemen have a key role in the plantain marketing subsector - from the wholesaler to the retailer. As this domain becomes increasingly complex, growers are forced to produce greater quantities of higher-quality plantain, more regularly, and at lower cost. Production criteria are gathered by middlemen on the basis of information they obtain on selling prices, consumer demand and market trends. By professionalizing the subsector, the most organized of these go-betweens (dealers, transport agents, etc.) could become key stakeholders and thereby influence domestic market patterns. Reducing postharvest losses As domestic consumer demand is constantly increasing, local market dynamics depend on producers' capacity to maintain adequate sustainable production levels, while staving off postharvest banana losses. The most common cropping practice involves extending yearly production over as long a period as possible. Soil potential is crucial for the success of this strategy. In Cameroon and Rwanda, on volcanic soils in the Dominican Republic, and on river alluvia in the humid intertropical zone, plantain growers have adopted a sustainable production strategy, and this crop is often their main source of income. In Ghana, consumer demand for plantain is high and its retail price is steadily rising, however production has been stagnant for 10 years. This situation could be turned around by planting high yield, strongly pest and disease resistant, cultivars. Postharvest plantain losses are generally heavy and are estimated at about 3 million tonnes worldwide. These losses are due to poor harvest and handling conditions, in addition to a shortage of distribution channels (e. g. Côte d'Ivoire). The quality of communications networks is also an important factor. In most African countries, access routes to markets are in poor condition and poorly maintained, except around large urban centres. For instance, farmers in Rusitu valley in Zimbabwe produce high volumes of dessert bananas. They lose a substantial portion of their overall production during the rainy season because of the very long distances along poor roads that have to be travelled to the nearest urban markets. The EU has set up a system whereby farmers can rent vehicles to facilitate getting to local markets. Still, asphalting the roads represents the most efficient way of promoting trade to external markets. Cameroon is a case in point, there are now paved roads allowing comparatively easy access to the main markets and the capital. In 1996, the European banana import regime was under attack by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ...|$|R
