40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from <b>bovine</b> clinical <b>mastitis</b> in Varamin, Tehran Province, Iran. All of the isolated Staph. aureus were identified by morphology and culture and confirmed using the API Staph identification system (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France). Antibiotic resistance genes were detected by PCR with oligonucleotide primers specific for each gene. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 43 of 207 (20. 1 %) bovine clinical milk samples. Using disk diffusion, methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus was detected in 5 of 43 (11. 6 %) samples. The pathogen showed high resistance against penicillin G (86 %) and tetracycline (76. 7 %).

40|$|Due to its {{association}} with low-quality milk {{and a decrease in}} milk production in <b>bovines,</b> <b>mastitis</b> is a major cause of economic loss. Additionally, mastitis can be harmful to suckling newborns and can cause damage to the mammary gland. In mastitic mammary secretions there is a substantial increase in somatic cells, specifically neutrophils. In this study we examined the ability of mastitic and nonmastitic mammary secretions to cause in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis using a microchemotaxis assay. Also, the role of the inflammatory chemokine interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) in neutrophil recruitment during mastitis was addressed in these in vitro experiments. We found that both nonmastitic and mastitic mammary secretions were chemotactic, not chemokinetic, for neutrophils. The neutrophil chemotactic activity in mastitic, but not nonmastitic, mammary secretions was blocked by anti-IL- 8 antibodies. Molecular mass separation of the active components showed that the chemotactic activity of the mastitic secretions was present in the 10 -kDa-or-less fraction and was blocked by anti-IL- 8 antibodies.

40|$|Economic {{evaluation}} of the treatment <b>bovine</b> subclinical <b>mastitis</b> caused by S. aureus was evaluated. Two hundred and seventy udder quarters with or without subclinical mastitis were distributed into four groups, in conformity to lactational stage and treatments.

Treatment with gentamicin (150 mg) was accomplished by intramammary doses, once a day, after performing sensitivity tests. The mammary quarters were re-evaluated after 30 days. The costs with the treatment were calculated considering a S. aureus prevalence of 5 % as well as expenses with antibiotic, milk disposal, tests of drug sensitivity and workload. There was loss of income of 2 % and 14 % in the groups 1 and 2, respectively, {{when compared with the}} values before the treatment.

Public health can be threatened by the transfer of pathogens from animals to people via indirect contact through food or directly by contact with animals. The potential transfer of resistance determinants from animals to humans through Escherichia coli strains is an additional cause of concern. From February to November 2004, 670 samples of bovine mastitic milk were collected in two Brazilian states. The 231 E. coli strains isolated from the samples were screened for the presence of genes encoding Shiga toxin (stx 1 and stx 2) and intimin (eae). Twenty (8. 6 %) strains were shown by PCR to harbor the Shiga toxin genes (8 harbored the stx 1 gene, 12 the stx 2 gene and none both of them). Two (0. 8 %) strains were eae positive; however, they did not carry the stx 1 or stx 2. These strains were also screened for resistance to 12 antimicrobial agents. Predominant resistance was to amikacin (60. 0 %), gentamicin (50. 0 %), streptomycin (50. 0 %) and ampicillin (45. 0 %). Multidrug resistance was found among 7 isolates (35. 0 %).

The genotypic detection of MRSA was done through PCR detection of the resistance mecA gene. Furthermore, this study aimed to investigate the in vitro MIC and MBC of the Dodonaea angustifolia plant extract, Honey, and AuNPs against the clinically isolated MRSA and VRSA. Of 93 mastitis milk samples examined, 54 (58. 1 %) S. aureus were isolated and identified {CP S. aureus =  46 (85. 2 %) and CN S. aureus =  8 (14. 8 %) }. The whole MRSA, VRSA, MSSA, and VSSA detected were 19 (35. 2 %), 7 (13 %), 35 (65 %), and 47 (87 %) respectively. The mean counts of S. aureus were between 8. 6  ×  104  ±  3. 5  ×  105  CFU/ml.

40|$|<b>Bovine</b> {{subclinical}} <b>mastitis</b> is an {{inflammation of}} the mammary gland caused by bacterial intramammary infection, accounting for large economic losses. Treatment of subclinical mastitis is not suggested for lactating cows due {{to the risk of}} milk contamination. The objectives of this study were to evaluate an antimicrobial peptide, nisin, in the treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating cows. A total of 90 lactating Holstein cows with subclinical mastitis were randomly divided into nisin-treated (n = 46) and control (n = 44) groups. In the nisin-treated group, cows received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2, 500, 000 IU once daily for 3 days while the control cows received no treatment. Milk samples were collected from the affected mammary quarters before treatment and 1 and 2 weeks after treatment for analyses of bacteria, somatic cells, and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase). Results indicated that nisin therapy had bacteriological cure rates of 90. 1 % for Streptococcus agalactiae (10 of 11), 50 % for Staphylococcus aureus (7 of 14), 58. 8 % for coagulase-negative staphylococci (7 of 17), and 65. 2 % for all cases (30 of 46). Meanwhile, only 15. 9 % (7 of 44) of untreated cows spontaneously recovered.

Milk samples of both groups showed a decrease in total bacterial count at the 3 rd and 10 th day and the reduction percent was 99. 6 and 99. 8 %, respectively. Milk cytological results showed a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in lymphocyte and significant (p< 0. 05) decrease in neutrophil percentages at the 3 rd day up to the 10 th day in group b while the same results were achieved at the 10 th day in group a. Milk yield records in group a showed decrease by the 3 rd day post intramammary infusion and then gradually increased up to the 10 th day reaching nearly the same levels. Milk yield of group b showed a slight decrease by the 3 rd day and gradually increased to level higher than that before infusion. Haematological study revealed that the percentage of blood neutrophil significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) from the 3 rd up to the 10 th day in both groups while the lymphocytic percentage increased significantly (p< 0. 05).
