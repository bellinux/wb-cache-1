40|$|<b>Boltzmann</b> <b>equations</b> {{are often}} used to {{describe}} the non-equilibrium time-evolution of many-body systems in particle physics. Prominent examples are the computation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma after a relativistic heavy ion collision. However, <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>equations</b> are only a classical approximation of the quantum thermalization process, which is described by so-called Kadanoff-Baym equations. This raises the question how reliable <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>equations</b> are as approximations to the complete Kadanoff-Baym equations. Therefore, we present in this article a detailed comparison of <b>Boltzmann</b> and Kadanoff-Baym <b>equations</b> in the framework of a chirally invariant Yukawa-type quantum field theory including fermions and scalars. The obtained numerical results reveal significant differences between both types of equations. Apart from quantitative differences, on a qualitative level the late-time universality respected by Kadanoff-Baym equations is severely restricted in the case of <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>equations.</b> Furthermore, Kadanoff-Baym equations strongly separate the time scales between kinetic and chemical equilibration. In contrast to this standard <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>equations</b> cannot describe the process of quantum-chemical equilibration, and consequently also cannot feature the above separation of time scales.

The system simulated consists of a protein forming an ion channel (or an artificial nanopores like a Carbon Nano Tube, CNT), with a membrane (i.e. lipid bilayer) that separates two ion baths on either side. BioMOCA is based on two methodologies, namely the Boltzmann transport Monte Carlo (BTMC) and particle-particle-particle-mesh (P3M).
