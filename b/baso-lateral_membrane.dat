40|$|Abstract Background A {{complex of}} three cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) Neurexin IV(Nrx IV), Contactin (Cont) and Neuroglian (Nrg) is {{implicated in the}} formation of septate junctions between epithelial cells in Drosophila. These CAMs are interdependent for their localization at septate junctions and e. g. null mutation of nrx IV or cont induces the mislocalization of Nrg to the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane.</b> These mutations also result in ultrastructural alteration of the strands of septate junctions and breakdown of the paracellular barrier. Varicose (Vari) and Coracle (Cora), that both interact with the cytoplasmic tail of Nrx IV, are scaffolding molecules required for the formation of septate junctions. Results We conducted photobleaching experiments on whole living Drosophila embryos to analyze the membrane mobility of CAMs at septate junctions between epithelial cells. We show that GFP-tagged Nrg and Nrx IV molecules exhibit very stable association with septate junctions in wild-type embryos. Nrg-GFP is mislocalized to the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane</b> in nrx IV or cont null mutant embryos, and displays increased mobile fraction. Similarly, Nrx IV-GFP becomes distributed to the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane</b> in null mutants of vari and cora, and its mobile fraction is strongly increased. The loss of Vari, a MAGUK protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Nrx IV, has a stronger effect than the null mutation of nrx IV on the lateral mobility of Nrg-GFP. Conclusion The strands of septate junctions display a stable behavior in vivo that may be correlated with their role of paracellular barrier. The membrane mobility of CAMs is strongly limited when they take part to the multimolecular complex forming septate junctions. This restricted lateral diffusion of CAMs depends on both adhesive interactions and clustering by scaffolding molecules. The lateral mobility of CAMs is strongly increased in embryos presenting alteration of septate junctions. The stronger effect of vari by comparison with nrx IV null mutation supports the hypothesis that this scaffolding molecule may cross-link different types of CAMs and {{play a crucial role in}} stabilizing the strands of septate junctions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Na-K-ATPase {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} enzyme in the animal cell plasma membrane, but the role of the membrane in its regulation is poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between Na-K-ATPase and membrane microdomains or “lipid rafts ” enriched in sulfatide (sulfogalactosylceramide/SGC), a glyco-sphingolipid implicated as a cofactor for this enzyme, in the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane</b> of rainbow trout gill epithelium. Our studies demonstrated that when trout adapt to seawater (33 ppt), Na-K-ATPase relocates to these structures. Arylsulfatase-induced desul-fation of basolateral membrane SGC prevented this relocation and significantly reduced Na-K-ATPase activity in seawater but not freshwater trout. We contend that Na-K-ATPase partitions into SGC-enriched rafts to help facilitate the up-regulation of its activity during seawater adaptation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{morphology}} of {{the digestive}} system in fasting and refed Burmese pythons was determined, {{as well as}} the localization of the proton (H(+), K(+) -ATPase) and sodium (Na(+), K(+) -ATPase) pumps. In fasting pythons, oxyntopeptic cells located within the fundic glands are typically non-active, with a thick apical tubulovesicular system and numerous zymogen granules. They become active Immediately after feeding but return to a non-active state 3 days after the Ingestion of the prey. The proton pump, expressed throughout the different fasting/feeding states, is either sequestered in the tubulovesicular system in non-active cells or located along the apical digitations extending within the crypt lumen in active cells. The sodium pump is rapidly upregulated in fed animals and is classically located along the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membranes</b> of the gastric oxyntopeptic cells. In the Intestine, it is only expressed along the lateral membranes of the enterocytes, i. e., above the lateral spaces and not along the basal side of the cells. Thus, solute transport within the Intestinal lining is mainly achieved through the apical part of the cells and across the lateral spaces while absorbed fat massively crosses the entire height of the cells and flows into the Intercellular spaces. Therefore, in the Burmese python, the gastrointestinal cellular system quickly upregulates after feeding, due to Inexpensive cellular changes, passive mechanisms, and the progressive activation and synthesis of key enzymes such as the sodium pump. This cell plasticity also allows anticipation of the next fasting and feeding periods...|$|R

This is the first report of the immunohistochemical localization of cephalopod Na+/K+-ATPase with the polyclonal antibody alpha (H- 300) raised against the human alpha 1 -subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase. Na+/K+-ATPase immunoreactivity was observed in several tissues (gills, pancreatic appendages, nerves), exclusively located in <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membranes</b> lining blood sinuses. Furthermore, large single cells in the gill of adult L. vulgaris specimens closely resembled Na+/K+-ATPase-rich cells described in fish. Immunohistochemical observations indicated that the amount and distribution of Na+/K+-ATPase in late cuttlefish embryos {{was similar to that}} found in juvenile and adult stages. The ion-regulatory epithelia (e. g., gills, excretory organs) of the squid embryos and paralarvae exhibited less differentiation than adults. Na+/K+-ATPase activities for whole animals were higher in hatchlings of S. officinalis (157. 0 ± 32. 4 µmol/g FM/h) than in those of L. vulgaris (31. 8 ± 3. 3 µmol/g FM/h). S. officinalis gills and pancreatic appendages achieved activities of 94. 8 ± 18. 5 and 421. 8 ± 102. 3 µmol ATP/g FM/h, respectively. High concentrations of Na+/K+-ATPase in late cephalopod embryos might be important in coping with the challenging abiotic conditions (low pH, high pCO 2) that these organisms encounter inside their eggs.

Although both strains transport taurine similarly at the luminal membrane, impaired exit at the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane</b> of renal epithelium in the hypertaurinuric strain results in increased intracellular levels of taurine and subsequent backflux into the urine.

We develop a biophysical model of the bullfrog's saccular hair cell consisting of two compartments, mechanical and electrical, to study how the mechanical and the voltage oscillations interact to produce coherent self-sustained oscillations and how this interaction contributes to the overall sensitivity and selectivity of the hair cell. The model incorporates nonlinear mechanical stochastic hair bundle system coupled bi-directionally to a Hodgkin-Huxley type system describing somatic ionic currents.

RT-PCR {{was used to}} probe the presence of POT mRNA in freshly isolated bovine RPE (BRPE) and human RPE (HRPE) cells, a human RPE cell line (ARPE- 19), and human and bovine neural retina. [14 C]GlySar uptake was used to characterize POT activity in cultured ARPE- 19 cells and freshly isolated BRPE cell sheet suspen-sions. Results. PHT 1 mRNA was expressed in BRPE, HRPE, ARPE- 19, and bovine and human neural retina. In contrast, PEPT 2 and PHT 2 were expressed only in bovine and human retina, and PEPT 1 could not be detected. GlySar exhibited a linear uptake over 6 h at pH values of 6. 0 and 7. 4, with greater uptake at pH 7. 4 (p < 0. 01). GlySar uptake did not exhibit saturability (5 – 2000 M) and was unchanged when studied {{in the presence of}} 1 mM L-histidine. In contrast, GlySar uptake was significantly decreased when studied at 4 °C or in the presence of endocytic inhibitors at 37 °C (p < 0. 01). Studies in BRPE cell sheet suspensions validated the results obtained in ARPE- 19 cells and strongly suggested the absence of POT on the apical and <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membranes</b> of RPE. Conclusions. PHT 1 mRNA is present in native bovine and human RPE and a human RPE cell line. However, the data argue against PHT 1 being expressed on plasma membranes of RPE.

These cell-types are thought to control zinc excretion from the body. The baso-lateral localization and zinc-regulation of ZIP 5 in these cells are unique among the 14 members of the Slc 39 a family and suggest that ZIP 5 {{plays a role in}} zinc excretion. We created mice with floxed Zip 5 genes and deleted this gene in the entire mouse or specifically in enterocytes or acinar cells and then examined the effects on zinc homeostasis. We found that ZIP 5 is not essential for growth and viability but total knockout of ZIP 5 led to increased zinc in the liver in mice fed a zinc-adequate (ZnA) diet but impaired accumulation of pancreatic zinc in mice fed a zinc-excess (ZnE) diet. Loss-of-function of enterocyte ZIP 5, in contrast, led to increased pancreatic zinc in mice fed a ZnA diet and increased abundance of intestinal Zip 4 mRNA. Finally, loss-of-function of acinar cell ZIP 5 modestly reduced pancreatic zinc in mice fed a ZnA diet but did not impair zinc uptake as measured by the rapid accumulation of (67) zinc. Retention of pancreatic (67) zinc was impaired in these mice but the absence of pancreatic ZIP 5 sensitized them to zinc-induced pancreatitis and exacerbated the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles containing secretory protein in acinar cells. These studies demonstrate that ZIP 5 participates in the control of zinc excretion in mice. Specifically, they reveal a paramount function of intestinal ZIP 5 in zinc excretion but suggest a role for pancreatic ZIP 5 in zinc accumulation/retention in acinar cells. ZIP 5 functions in acinar cells to protect against zinc-induced acute pancreatitis and attenuate the process of zymophagy. This suggests that it {{may play a role in}} autophagy...|$|R

Epithelial cells in the small intestine showed characteristic localizations of galectin- 2 and galectin- 4 / 6 in the cytoplasm of goblet cells and the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane</b> of enterocytes in association with maturation, respectively. Galectin- 3 expressed only at the villus tips was concentrated at the myosin-rich terminal web of fully matured enterocytes. Epithelial cells of the large intestine contained intense immunoreactions for galectin- 3 and galectin- 4 / 6 but not for galectin- 2. The stratified squamous epithelium of the forestomach was immunoreactive for galectin- 3 and galectin- 7, but the basal layer lacked galectin- 3 immunoreactivity.

We have previously demonstrated the involve- ment of a synaptobrevin/VAMP 2 protein in AQP 2 exocytosis. In this work we analyzed the pattern of subcellular distribution and the functional role of a set of Q and R-SNARE in a polarized mouse collecting duct cell line, MCD 4, stably transfected with human AQP 2.

In {{order to gain}} insight into the {{molecular}} mechanisms that allow taste cells to respond to changes in their osmotic environment, we have used primarily immunocytochemical and molecular approaches to look for evidence {{of the presence of}} aquaporin-like water channels in taste cells. Labeling of isolated taste buds from the fungiform, foliate, and vallate papillae in rat tongue with antibodies against several of the aquaporins (AQPs) revealed the presence of AQP 1, AQP 2, and AQP 5 in taste cells from these areas. AQP 3 antibodies failed to label isolated taste buds from any of the papillae. There was an apparent difference in the regional localization of AQP labeling within the taste bud. Antibodies against AQP 1 and AQP 2 labeled predominantly the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane,</b> whereas the AQP 5 label was clearly evident on both the apical and basolateral membranes of cells within the taste bud. Double labeling revealed that AQP 1 and AQP 2 labeled many, but not all, of the same taste cells.

The method depends on the preferential aggregation of other subcellular structures by bivalent metal ions. MgCl 2 is added to a homogenate of cortical tissue prepared from frozen rabbit kidneys.

While changes of the local microcirculation observed during diabetes can somehow explain periodontal pathologies this hypothesis does not stand for the carious decay. We propose the hypothesis that the increase of carious incidence might be linked to changes in the salivary composition, such as an increase of salivary glucose concentrations. The amount of glucose in saliva has been widely discussed in various scientific articles. Subsequently, we performed an initial study that allowed us to confirm that the concentration and excretion of glucose in the saliva were higher in diabetic patients compared to normal patients. In diabetic patients, the relative increase in salivary glucose concentration is even comparable to the rise of blood glucose. We conducted experimental studies in animals in order to investigate the presence and the level of expression of glucose transporters (GLUT 1, GLUT 2, GLUT 4, SGLT 1) in rat parotid glands. Through immunohistochemical labeling techniques, gene expression studies and protein expression studies, we demonstrated that GLUT 1, GLUT 4 and SGLT 1 were found in rat parotid glands of normal and diabetic rats. Functional studies targeting the activity and the flux through those glucose transporters strengthened our hypothesis on the potential role of glucose transporter in salivary glucose. This original work introduce for the first time the hypothesis of a secretion mechanism of glucose by the salivary glands through GLUT 1 & SGLT 1 transporters, the first one being located on the apical and baso-lateral membranes of acinar cells, while the second one is located on the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane.</b> Secretion of glucose by the parotid gland is no longer at any doubt even though further studies must now specify the specific mechanisms.

40|$|SUMMARY It is {{currently}} {{believed that the}} rate and direction of sodium transport in the small intestine may be regulated by the activity of Na,K-ATPase in the basolateral cell membrane. We tested this hypothesis by selectively infusing ouabain, a known inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase, into the mesenteric artery supplying a perfused loop of ileum in 18 dogs. Before ouabain infusion there were significant correlations between the activity of Na,K-ATPase and net and lumen to plasma fluxes of sodium and chloride. After ouabain, {{there was no significant}} change in sodium and chloride trans-port, unidirectional fluxes or transmucosal potential difference, despite a 50 % reduction in Na,K-ATPase activity. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between Na,K-ATPase activity and sodium or chloride transport after ouabain. The only statistically significant effect of ouabain infusion was a reduction in the rate of bicarbonate secretion. Thus, the results of our experiments suggest that mucosal Na,K-ATPase is not a rate-limiting step in the absorption of sodium and chloride in the dog ileum, though it may be an important facilitative factor. The normal small intestine in vivo usually absorbs physiological electrolyte solutions, although the rate of absorption is highly variable from subject to subject, and in the same subject on different days (Turnberg et al., 1970). In some apparently normal people and animals, the small intestine even secretes fluid, rather than absorbs it (Florey et al., 1941; Scott, 1965; Turnberg etal., 1970). In some animals, secretion is more common than absorption (Powell et al., 1968). One of the plausible explanations of variable rates of absorption-secretion is the activity of the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane</b> concentration of sodium and potassium-dependent ATPase (Na,K-ATPase) (Schultz et al., 1974). This enzyme {{is believed to be the}} biochemical counterpart of a sodium pump, which transports sodium in exchange for potassium across the basolateral membrane (Hokin, 1976). It is postulated that the Na,K-ATPase pumps more sodium out of the cell than potassium into the cel...|$|E
40|$|Dietary {{carbohydrates}} are hydrolyzed in {{the small}} intestine ultimately, by the brush-border membrane disaccharidases (sucrase, maltase and lactase) into monosaccharides: D-glucose, D-galactose and D-fructose. D-glucose and D-galactose are transported across the brush border membrane (BBM) from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes by the Na+- dependent glucose transporter 1, SGLT 1, while D-fructose is transported by GLUT 5. These monosaccharides, exit the cell across the <b>baso-lateral</b> <b>membrane</b> (BLM) into the systemic circulation via the facilitated monosaccharide transporter, GLUT 2. SGLT 1 regulation is vital {{for the provision of}} glucose to the body and for maintaining glucose homoeostasis. The expression and activity of SGLT 1 are adaptively regulated by dietary sugars in most species studied. The intestinal capacity to absorb glucose is maintained via basal level of SGLT 1 expression. However, this capacity becomes limited when the luminal carbohydrates exceed a threshold level, leading to up-regulation of SGLT 1. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that luminal sugar concentration, when above a threshold, is detected by the intestinal glucose sensor, consisting of two subunits, Taste 1 receptor 2 (T 1 R 2) and 3 (T 1 R 3) expressed in enteroendocrine L-cells. This activates a pathway, in endocrine cells, leading to secretion of the gut hormone glucagon like peptide 2 (GLP- 2), known to up-regulate SGLT 1 expression. Binding of GLP- 2 to its receptor on the enteric neurons induces a neuronal response evoking secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and/or Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) by sub-mucosal plexus. Binding of VIP/PACAP to their receptor VPAC 1 (VIP and PACAP receptor type 1) on the basolateral membrane of absorptive enterocytes leads to increased concentration of intracellular cAMP which in turn enhances the half-life of SGLT 1 mRNA, increasing the number of SGLT 1 proteins per enterocytes. In diabetes, the intestinal capacity for glucose absorption is enhanced complicating the aetiology of the disease. This enhanced expression is independent of either luminal sugar and blood glucose concentrations or insulin levels. The work in this thesis was aimed at identify molecular basis of enhanced SGLT 1 expression in the diabetic intestine using intestinal tissues from rats with experimentally induced diabetes and biopsies from the intestine of human diabetics. The data indicate that increased SGLT 1 expression is due to dysregulation of pathway controlling SGLT 1 expression...|$|E
