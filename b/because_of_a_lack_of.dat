It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> time to prepare for the race.

The role of oceans in {{the global}} cycle of mercury is still poorly characterized, mainly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> {{long-term}} data on atmospheric mercury concentrations in the remote Southern Ocean. In the frame of GMOS (Global Mercury Observation System), we present here the first results from a new monitoring station at Amsterdam Island in the Southern Indian Ocean. For the period January to April 2012, we recorded mean concentration of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) and particulate-bounded mercury (PHg) of 1. 03 ng m- 3, 0. 37 and 0. 34 pg m- 3 respectively. While GEM concentrations showed little variations, RGM and PHg exhibited fast variations with alternation of value below the instrumental detection limit and maximum values up to 4 pg m- 3...|$|R
5|$|Sonic 2 is {{believed}} to have been planned to have time travel aspects and was originally developed alongside Sonic CD as the same game, but Sonic CD eventually became its own game over time. A demonstration cartridge of Sonic 2 was stolen at a New York City toy show early in 1992, which was later attributed to a lack of security. The prototype ROM was rediscovered by a fan named Simon Wai on a Chinese website, and features playable sections of two cut levels from the final release of the game: Wood Zone and Hidden Palace Zone.
