40|$|Although {{numerical}} simulation of concrete {{has a significant}} background {{in the framework of}} simplified one- and two-dimensional elements, a full triaxial description of the structural behaviour of this material is still subject to active research. High fidelity modelling has only been enabled once the required computational capacity achieved an appropriate threshold, and it is precisely of such computational nature that there are diverse drawbacks the material model has to overcome. For concrete, an existing model combining plasticity and isotropic damage is chosen in this work, and this choice over multi-surface plasticity is duly justified. Additionally, an extension to anisotropic damage is proposed. Focus is set on a series of algorithmic enhancements that significantly increase robustness in stress evaluation, in particular from stress states that pathologically associate to a singular Jacobian matrix and stress-returns that lead towards sensitive areas of the failure surface in principal stress space, where plastic flow is undefined. Reinforcing steel is modelled as embedded bars inside the corresponding concrete parent elements, with solely axial stiffness. An arbitrary orientation inside the concrete elements is allowed but otherwise the discretised bars share the parent element morphology, order and degrees of freedom, resulting in a perfect bond interaction. An improved and systematic linearising procedure is presented to track the intersections of each <b>bar</b> <b>segment</b> with its embedding parent element, which can be readily applied to any element type and order. This facilitates an accurate calculation of this constituent’s contribution to the parent element’s stiffness matrix and nodal force vector. The robustness of the enhanced material model is verified by means of numerical tests, highlighting the convergence ratio, and validation ensues via simulations of established benchmark tests. Finally, some case studies are presented to illustrate the performance of the model at structural level, with insight into various issues of computational nature. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|A design {{methodology}} of flexible structure is presented {{for the purpose}} of enrichment of the structural function by utilizing the mechanics realized by large elastic deformation of flexible members. The flexible member is modeled by straight <b>bar</b> <b>segments</b> linked by virtual coil springs. Its large deformation is analyzed by means of the Lagrange multiplier method, the functional of which is constituted in line with the principle of stationary potential energy with constraints on geometrical boundary conditions. The sensitivity analysis is formulated especially for the solution obtained by the Lagrange multiplier method so as to approximate the change of the structural response in the first-order sense with respect to design variables. Owing to the sensitivity analysis, governing equation of the design variables to realize the prescribed response of the structure is derived as a set of linear simultaneous equations. The solution of design variables is determined by the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse since the coefficient matrix of the equation becomes rectangular in general. Adequacy of the proposed formulation is attested through the successful renewal of the flexural rigidity of members in numerical examples to realize the prescribed relationship between external forces and displacements...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{structural}} synthesis is proposed to set disposed {{shape of a}} flexible frame within an allowable region. Members of the flexible frame, which are initially straight, are discretized into straight <b>bar</b> <b>segments</b> linked by virtual coil springs at nodes. Assuming total strain energy is independently separated into two contributions of bending deformation by the springs and rectilinear deformation by the segments, we find positions of the nodes in the disposed state {{by means of the}} Lagrange multiplier method that searches for a stationary point of the total strain energy under the constraints on geometrical boundry conditions. A new formulation of the sensitivity analysis is derived to approximate the change of the found nodal positions with respect to design variables in the first-order sense. A layout constraint to exclude all the nodes from convex prohibited regions in disposed state yields governing equation of design variables in the form of linear simultaneous equations with rectangular matrix of coefficients, which is dealt with by the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. A numerical example concerning with Y-shaped frame whose disposed shape is constrained by three prohibited regions demonstrates the validity of the proposed formulation...|$|R

For the application of the load, the bars were attached to “EMIC” where the active tip of 200 kgf load cell was at a specific point of the bar (15 mm) with a speed of 0. 5 mm per minute. The data showed statistically significant differences in relation to alloys and thickness among the bars, and all thicknesses evaluated were different.

40|$|AbstractThe {{landscape}} {{of a river}} sandbar is composed of several elements, including vegetation, bare areas, side-pools and so on. For sandy river management, {{it is necessary to}} determine the contributing factors for the ecosystem functions of alternate <b>bar</b> <b>segments.</b> In recent years, {{it has been reported that}} sandbars have a water purification function involving denitrification driven by sub-surface flow, but the details are still unknown. The objective of this study was to develop a model that could be used to examine how the nitrogen is trapped and retained by several elements of a sandbar in an alternate bar reach. We also developed a framework to analyze the temporal change in the denitrification by using a numerical simulation, aerial photos, and a water quality information system. The numerical simulation was performed under the discharge and morphological conditions of the Yahagi River in the Chubu region of Japan. The main results of this study are that the temporal change in the denitrification ecosystem function in a sandbar reach can be quantified using the proposed model and the denitrification activity has increased over the past 40 years. In addition, it was clearly shown that differences in the vegetation distribution and sandbar shape affect the nitrogen dynamics. Thus, the numerical simulation has made it possible to determine the most effective vegetation patterns to maximize the ecosystem function in a sandbar...|$|R

40|$|Interactions {{in primary}} visual cortex (V 1) between simple visual {{elements}} such as short <b>bar</b> <b>segments</b> are believed to underlie our ability to easily integrate contours and segment surfaces. We used intrinsic signal optical imaging in alert fixating macaques to measure the strength and cortical distribution of V 1 interactions among collinear bars. A single short bar stimulus produced a broad-peaked hill of activation (the optical point spread) covering multiple orientation hypercolumns in V 1. Flanking the bar stimulus {{with a pair of}} identical collinear bars led to a strong nonlinear suppression in the optical signal. This nonlinearity was strongest over the center bar region, with a spatial distribution that cannot be explained by a simple gain control. It was a function of the relative orientation and separation of the bar stimuli in a manner tuned sharply for collinearity, being strongest for immediately adjacent bars lying on a smooth contour. These results suggest intracortical interactions playing a major role in determining V 1 activation by smooth extended contours. Our finding that the interaction is primarily suppressive when imaged optically, which presumably reflects the combined inhibitory and excitatory inputs, suggests a complex interplay between these cortical inputs leading to the collinear facilitation seen in the spiking response of V 1 neurons. This disjuncture between the facilitation seen in spiking and the suppression in imaging also suggests that cortical representations of complex stimuli involve interactions that need to be studied over extended networks and may be hard to deduce from the responses of individual neurons...|$|R

Methods and results: A total of 196 patients with 223 segments (sirolimus-eluting stents [SES]: 104, paclitaxel-eluting stents [PES]: 119) underwent intravascular ultrasound eight months after DES implantation. Arterial injury {{was defined as the}} balloon-to-artery ratio (<b>BAR).</b> <b>Segments</b> were categorised into two groups: high BAR defined as BAR> 1. 1 (120 <b>segments),</b> and low <b>BAR</b> defined as BAR ≤ 1. 1 (103 segments). Baseline clinical characteristics were similar for both groups. Although reference vessel diameter was smaller, stent diameter, maximal balloon pressure and balloon diameter were higher in the high BAR compared with the low BAR group. Lumen (7. 10 ± 1. 91 vs. 6. 25 ± 1. 69, p= 0. 001), stent (7. 31 ± 1. 95 vs. 6. 41 ± 1. 80, p= 0. 001), and external elastic membrane (17. 1 ± 4. 9 vs. 14. 8 ± 4. 0, p< 0. 0001) areas (mm 2) were higher, but neointimal hyperplasia (0. 21 ± 0. 36 vs. 0. 16 ± 0. 48, p= 0. 42) area (mm 2) was similar in the high BAR compared with the low BAR group. Arterial injury as assessed by BAR was not associated with the amount of neointimal hyperplasia (R 2 = 0. 003, p= 0. 40). Conclusions: Arterial injury does not correlate with the amount of neointimal hyperplasia following DES implantation. Conventionally aggressive DES implantation techniques do not adversely affect long-term outcome with respect to restenosis. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
