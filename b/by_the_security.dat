5|$|The {{decline of}} the Roman Empire brought an end to Roman rule in Britain {{by the start of}} the 5th century. The town within the old Roman walls at Worcester {{continued}} to be occupied however, remaining a prominent military feature. New Christian religious foundations were established at Worcester during this period, attracted there in large part <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> the Roman defences offered during a troubled period. In the 7th century, Worcester Cathedral was built, once again within the old Roman walls.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persevered as an {{exclusively}} underground organization. Its activists were dogged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Service (SB), {{but managed}} to strike back: on May 1, 1982, a series of anti-government protests brought out thousands of participants—several dozen thousand in Kraków, Warsaw and Gdańsk. On May 3 more protests took place, during celebrations of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. On that day, communist secret services killed four demonstrators – three in Warsaw and one in Wrocław.|$|E
5|$|After ZANLA spent 1971 and 1972 covertly subverting {{the local}} black {{population}} of north-eastern Rhodesia to their {{side in the}} Maoist fashion, it attacked two white farms near the north-eastern village of Centenary in December 1972. The RLI {{was one of the}} first units despatched to counter the infiltration, and Operation Hurricane, a major counter-insurgency action, was started in the country's north-east soon after. Hurricane would last for the rest of the war, eventually just one of seven operational areas defined across Rhodesia <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces—Operations Thrasher, Repulse and Tangent followed in 1976, Grapple began a year later and Splinter, covering Lake Kariba, started in 1978.

5|$|Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and {{continuing}} throughout the 1980s, {{the intensity of}} Bahrain's political situation sharply increased. Al-Jamri, who was then participating in several petitions, was questioned multiple times and put under strict surveillance <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> and Intelligence Service. In 1984, the Islamic Enlightenment institution, with which al-Jamri was associated, was closed by the government. The government also closed other places of meeting and prohibited public seminars. Al-Jamry however opened his house for daily meetings, also offering a weekly space for public debates; he continued to do so despite several government attempts to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Gordimer herself became {{involved}} in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for trade unionist activities and {{being a member of}} the SACP. Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the Delmas Treason Trial in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC while it was still an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French Mandate and President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E

5|$|The Office of Military Cooperation, {{just one}} and a half blocks from the embassy, {{required}} evacuation. Despite its proximity to the embassy, an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest. A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left the embassy at 8:47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans). This was the only excursion outside the embassy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> detail. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{also has}} two disused quarries, one quarry {{listed on the}} North West side on an 1911 map, and another one listed as an old quarry on the West side in 1885–1900.

People protesting against the building of an A46 bypass road cut a small turf maze into the hill, during {{the construction of the}} bypass in the mid-1990s. In one day of protests, 11 people, including George Monbiot, were hospitalised as a result of beatings <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> guards.|$|E

Tapioca's government have further alleged that the plot was masterminded by Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus themselves. Tapioca invites the trio to visit San Theodores, promising them safe passage, but Tintin deems {{it to be a}} trap, leaving Haddock and Calculus to go alone.

5|$|A {{string of}} new {{peacekeeping}} missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council which also triggered {{interest in the}} reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} force led by Castillo Armas {{attempted to make}} forays towards the towns of Zacapa and Puerto Barrios; however, these were beaten back by the Guatemalan army. The propaganda broadcast by the CIA had far more effect; it succeeded in leading a Guatemalan pilot to defect, which led to Árbenz grounding the entire air force, fearing its defection. The CIA also used its planes, flown by American pilots, to bomb Guatemalan towns for psychological effect. When the old planes used by the invasion force {{were found to be}} inadequate, the CIA persuaded Eisenhower to authorize the use of two additional planes. Guatemala made an appeal to the United Nations, but the US vetoed an investigation into the incident <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> Council, stating that it was an internal matter in Guatemala. On 25 June, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Frightened by this, Árbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers. The army refused to do this, instead demanding that Árbenz either resign or come to terms with Castillo Armas.|$|E
