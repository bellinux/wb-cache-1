5000|$|To each {{of these}} firms, Zinn would present the annual <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of Lola Zinn Furniture, {{together}} with the manufacturing account, the profit-and-loss account for the previous year, and, {{on the face of}} the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> the <b>audit</b> certificate and a signature purporting to be that of the company's auditor. These accounts were false. Of the company's trading and assets, they presented [...] "a completely wrong picture." ...|$|R
5000|$|Governments {{generally}} have {{some degree of}} influence over even [...] "independent" [...] central banks; the aim of independence is primarily to prevent short-term interference. For example, the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve are nominated by the President of the U.S. and confirmed by the Senate, publishes verbatim transcripts, and <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> are <b>audited</b> by the Government Accountability Office.|$|R
40|$|Fair value {{accounting}} forces {{institutions to}} revalue inventory whenever a transaction occurs. An institution that faces a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> constraint may have incentives to suspend trading in Level 3 assets (traded on opaque over-the-counter markets) {{in order to}} avoid such marking-to-market. This keeps the book valuation artificially high, relaxing the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> constraint. But, the institution loses direct control of the risk of its position. Solving this "real options" problem, the institution will report profits as they occur but delay reporting losses. A regulator trying to control risk imposes fines for <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> manipulation and capital requirements. Both these tools can increase risk-taking and <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> manipulation. <b>Audits</b> in comparision generally decrease risk-taking but may be costly to the regulator. The model provides predictions on the distribution of a bank's trading gains in illiquid markets. The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies.

Parris said what {{had occurred in}} Trinidad [...] "had no effect on Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean". Parris stressed that the Bajan company was autonomous and its management structure, <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> and <b>auditing</b> were totally separate.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{ascertain}} the impact of corporate governance variables and firm attributes on audit delay in the Nigerian banking sector. We used ordinary least square technique to analyze our data. Our results reveals that there is no significant relationship between ownership structure, firm size, <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> date and <b>audit</b> delay, while firm age and profitability have positive relationship with audit delay. Board size exhibits a negative relationship with audit delay. We conclude older firms, December <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> date and institutional ownership will increase the delay in publishing of audited financial report consequently, the study recommended that statutory bodies should enact law to reduce institution ownership and the firm should be compile to adjust their balance date from January-December to June – July to avoid rush associated with December...|$|R
40|$|Banks face a {{tradeoff}} between diversifying and focusing their loan portfolio. In this paper {{we carry out}} an empirical study for the German market {{to shed light on}} the question whether or not the benefits of risk sharing outweigh those of specialization. We use data from the Bundesbank's quarterly borrowers statistic to determine the degree of diversification in the banks' loan portfolios and combine this data with the banks' <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> and <b>audit</b> reports. The unique database comprises data from all German banks during the period from 1993 to 2003. Our main results can be summarized in three statements: i) Specialized banks have a slightly higher return than diversified banks. ii) Specialized banks have lower relative loan loss provisions and lower shares of non-performing loans, iii) However, the standard deviations of the loan loss provision ratio and the non-performing loan ratio are lower for diversified banks.

40|$|Audit {{delay is}} {{interval}} of days between <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> date and <b>audit</b> report date. The {{purpose of this}} research is to analyze the effect of company attributes and audit factors to audit delay. This research uses 611 companies listed in Malaysian Stock Exchange from the period of 2006 until 2011 as sample. The independent variables used are size of the company, debt to equity ratio, profitability, subsidiaries of multinational companies, audit firm size, audit fees, industry type,  age of company, company financial year end, and audit opinion. The method of analysis in this research is multiple linear regressions. The results of this study shows that size of the company, debt to equity ratio, profitability, subsidiaries of multinational companies, audit firm size, audit fees, industry type, age of company, and audit opinion have significant influence on audit delay while financial year end does not have significant influence on audit delay...|$|R
40|$|Any {{type of entity}} {{must show}} in its {{financial}} statements information regarding its significant estimations concerning the future periods and other important sources of uncertainty at the date at which the financial statements are drafted, which presents {{an increased risk of}} generating an adjustment of the accounting value of the assets and debts in the future fiscal year. This information must include the nature of the estimations and their accounting value at the date of the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> The <b>auditing</b> of the financial statements in which accounting estimations are presented frame a high risk of significant distortion. Because of this, the auditor must obtain sufficient audit evidence which would certify if these estimations are reasonable, respectively if the data on which the estimations are based upon are accurate, complete and relevant, and the procedures and methods used {{for the development of the}} estimations are adequate for the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> structures to which they apply. The development of provisions, as a manner to reflect uncertainties within the accounting system, contributes to the accurate representation of the company’s financial position. Such uncertainties are acknowledged through the presentation of their nature and value, but also through the exercising of prudence for the development of the financial statements. Prudence implies the identification of those accounting estimations, associated to the given uncertainties conditions, which would not over-evaluate the assets and the incomes, and the debts and expenses would not be under-evaluated. Exercising prudence should not allow, for instance, the accumulation of excessive provisions, the deliberate under-evaluation of assets and incomes, nor the deliberate over-evaluation of debts or expenses. This requirement is imperative, due to the fact that investors substantiate their economic decisions starting from the analysis of the financial statements, as accurate image of the financial position and efficiency of an entity...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of a central bank {{contains}} valuable information {{for the quality of}} a currency. As an illustration we analyze the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the Federal Reserve System (FED) during the subprime crisis between June 2007 and December 2008. Until September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the FED did not expand strongly. However, the structure of the FED assets varied pronouncedly. Starting in September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> expanded dramatically. The calculation of certain <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> ratios supports the assessment of an important decrease {{of the quality of the}} currency.

40|$|We analyse {{corporate}} <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> adjustment {{episodes in}} Germany and Japan, {{as well as}} a sample of 30 countries, using national account data. Corporate <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> adjustment tends to be long lasting and associated with a strong impact on current accounts, wages and investment. Adjustment episodes lead to significant changes in corporate <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> ratios with a buildup of liquidity and a reduction of leverage. The adjustment is generally achieved by reducing investment and increasing savings {{on the back of a}} falling wage share. A panel econometric exercise shows that <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> adjustment periods are triggered by macroeconomic downturns as well as <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> stress due to high debt, low liquidity and negative equity price shocks. ...|$|R
