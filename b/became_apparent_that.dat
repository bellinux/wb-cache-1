5|$|There was {{danger of}} {{invasion}} {{from the more}} powerful French forces, so Adams and the Federalist congress built up the army, bringing back Washington as its commander. Washington wanted Hamilton to be his second-in-command and Adams reluctantly accommodated. It <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington's advanced years.|$|E

5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.|$|E
5|$|With {{the twin}} {{victories}} of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, {{the threat of}} a future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.|$|E

5|$|As it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that,</b> {{not only}} were {{conditions}} in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E
5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Brezhnev {{was the leader of}} the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny's position within the collective leadership strengthened.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the {{facilities}} at Hampden were {{in need of}} renewal. As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> {{the light}} {{pollution}} from Cleveland {{was beginning to}} make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 {{miles to the east}} in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> four lanes at {{the western}} end was not enough. Several safety {{improvement}} areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers Road), to a new two-lane road {{to the south of}} it that crossed the Roaring Fork to the east of the town.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean.

5|$|It soon <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Méchain and Delambre's result (443.296lignes) was {{slightly}} too short for the meridianal {{definition of the}} metre. Arago and Biot extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806–1809, and found that one ten-millionth of the Earth's quadrant should be 443.31lignes: later work increased the value to 443.39lignes. The modern value, for the WGS84 reference spheroid, is m or lignes.|$|E
5|$|Moberly, born in 1846, was {{the tenth}} of fifteen children. She {{came from a}} {{professional}} background; her father, George Moberly, was the headmaster of Winchester College and later Bishop of Salisbury. In 1886 Moberly became the first Principal of a hall of residence for young women, St. Hugh's College in Oxford. It <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Moberly needed someone to help run the college, and Jourdain was asked to become Moberly's assistant.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} the Allies, Austria agreed to send a force to the Kingdom of Naples to depose Murat in February 1815, when it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Murat corresponded with Napoleon I, which was {{explicitly}} forbidden by a recent treaty. Murat never actually wrote to Napoleon, but Louis, intent on restoring the Neapolitan Bourbons at any cost, forged the correspondence, and subsidised the Austrian expedition with 25million francs.|$|E

5|$|Rudd {{initially}} {{said that}} he would challenge Gillard, but it soon <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> he did not have enough support within the party to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.|$|E
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E
5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the badly coordinated {{uprising}} had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers {{refused to participate}} in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion.

Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E
