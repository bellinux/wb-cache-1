In this work, the simulated gas sweetening unit with Methyl-DiEthanolAmine (MDEA) solvent was studied to improve quality. Firstly, the effect of trays types and then, the effect of various packing {{and the effect of}} the packing size were considered on the flow rate of CO 2 and H 2 S in the main streams. Results show that with considering the different trays types in the regenerator tower, the flow rate of CO 2 in the sweet gas stream with <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> <b>tray</b> is lower than other trays types. Also, with considering the different trays types in the absorber tower, the flow rate of CO 2 in the sweet gas stream with <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> <b>tray</b> is lower than other trays types in the absorber tower. In considering with different types of packing, results show that the flow rate of CO 2 with ballast ring packing and the flow rate of H 2 S with Raschig ring packing are lower than other types of packing. However, in some types such as cascade miniring, Intalox Saddles and pall ring, there is no difference for the flow rate of CO 2 or H 2 S. In all cases, with increasing the size of the packing, the flow rate of CO 2 and H 2 S in the sweet gas stream increases, however, this increasing in the metal packing is very small...|$|E

50|$|Trayed {{strippers}} {{can have}} sieve, valve, or <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> <b>trays</b> while packed strippers can have either structured packing or random packing. Trays and packing {{are used to}} increase the contact area over which mass transfer can occur as mass transfer theory dictates. Packing can have varying material, surface area, flow area, and associated pressure drop. Older generation packing include ceramic Raschig rings and Berl saddles. More common packing materials are metal and plastic Pall rings, metal and plastic Zbigniew Bia≈Çecki rings, and ceramic Intalox saddles. Each packing material of this newer generation improves the surface area, the flow area, and/or the associated pressure drop across the packing. Also important, {{is the ability of}} the packing material to not stack on top of itself. If such stacking occurs, it drastically reduces the surface area of the material. Lattice design work has been increasing of late that will further improve these characteristics.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} demonstrations of intermolecular forces is the tension at the surface of liquid n-alkanes. The prediction of surface tension is important in the design of distillation towers, extraction units and tower internals such as <b>bubble</b> <b>caps</b> and <b>trays,</b> since it has a considerable influence on the transfer of mass and energy across interfaces. Surface tension data are needed wherever foaming emulsification, droplet formation or wetting are involved. They are also required in a number of equations for two-phase flow calculations and for determining the flow regime. Petroleum engineers are especially interested in the surface tension in the extraction of crude oil to add surfactants to modify the interfacial properties between crude oil and the geological reservoir to improve production and increase oil yields. In this work, a simple computer program using Arrhenius-type asymptotic exponential function, Vandermoned matrix and Matlab technical computing language, is developed for the estimation of surface tension of paraffin hydrocarbons as a function of molecular weight and temperature. The surface tension is calculated for temperatures in the range of 250 to 440 K and paraffin hydrocarbons molecular weights between 30 and 250. The proposed numerical technique is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly if more data become available in the future. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being less than 2 %...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe depict and analyse the {{complete}} evolution {{of an air}} bubble formed in a water bulk, from the time it emerges at the liquid surface, up to its fragmentation into dispersed drops. To this end, experiments describing the drainage of the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> film, its puncture and the resulting bursting dynamics determining the aerosol formation are conducted on tapwater bubbles. We discover that the mechanism of marginal pinching at the bubble foot and associated convection motions in the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap,</b> known as marginal regeneration, both drive the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> drainage rate, and are responsible for its puncture. The resulting original film thickness h evolution law in time, supplemented with considerations about the nucleation of holes piercing the film together culminate in a determination of the cap film thickness at bursting h(b) proportional to R^ 2 /L, where R is the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> radius of curvature, and L a length which we determine. Subsequent to a hole nucleation event, the cap bursting dynamics conditions the resulting spray. The latter depends both on the bubble shape prescribed by R/a, where a is the capillary length based on gravity, and on h(b). The mean drop size similar to R^(3 / 8) h_b^(5 / 8), the number of drops generated per bubble N similar to (R/a) ^ 22 (R/h_b) ^(7 / 8) and the drop size distribution P(d) are derived, comparing well with measurements. Combined with known bubble production rates over the ocean, our findings offer an adjustable parameter-free prediction for the aerosol flux and spray structure caused by bubble bursting in this precise context...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how the drainage and rupture of surfactant-stabilised bubbles floating {{at the surface}} of a liquid pool depend on the concentration of surface-active molecules in water. Drainage measurements at the apex of bubbles indicate that the flow profile is increasingly plug-like as the surfactant concentration is decreased from several times the critical micellar concentration (cmc) to just below the cmc. High-speed observations of bubble bursting reveal that the position at which a hole nucleates in the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> also depends on the surfactant concentration. On average, the rupture is initiated close to the bubble foot for low concentrations (< cmc) while its locus moves towards the top of the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> as the concentration increases above the cmc. In order to explain this transition, we propose that marginal regeneration may be responsible for bubble rupture at low concentrations but that bursting at the apex for higher concentrations is driven by gravitational drainage...|$|R

40|$|In the two-group {{interfacial}} area transport equation, bubbles are categorized into two groups, i. e., spherical/distorted bubbles as group 1 and cap/slug/churn-turbulent bubbles as group 2. The bubble rise velocities {{for both groups}} of bubbles may be estimated by the drift flux model by applying different distribution parameters and drift velocities for both groups. However, the drift velocity for group 2 bubbles is not always applicable (when the wall effect becomes important) as in the current test loop of interest where the flow channel is confined by two parallel flat walls, with a dimension of 200 -mm in width and 10 -mm in gap. The previous experiments indicated that no stable slug flow existed in this test section, {{which was designed to}} permit visualization of the flow patterns and bubble characteristics without the distortion associated with curved surfaces. In fact, distorted cap bubbly and churn-turbulent flow was observed. Therefore, it is essential to developed a correlation for <b>cap</b> <b>bubble</b> drift velocity in this confined flow channel. Since the rise velocity of a <b>cap</b> <b>bubble</b> depends on its size, a high-speed movie camera is used to capture images of <b>cap</b> <b>bubbles</b> to obtain the bubble size information. Meanwhile, the rise velocity of <b>cap</b> and elongated <b>bubbles</b> (called <b>cap</b> <b>bubbles</b> hereafter) is investigated by examining the captured images frame by frame. As a result, the conventional correlation of drift velocity for slug bubbles is modified and acceptable agreements between the measurements and correlation estimation are achieved...|$|R

40|$|Solids {{flow through}} an orifice {{at the bottom}} of a standpipe, against a {{counterflow}} of gas, becomes unstable as the gas flow is increased. In the unstable condition, the solids flow in the standpipe is jerky, reflecting the oscillations between flow and no flow at the orifice, and resembles slip- stick flow. Practical operation of these systems requires a straightforward quantitative demarcation for distinguishing when flow behaviour changes from stable to unstable. This paper presents an analysis of flow stability in standpipes with gas counterflow, supported by small-scale experiments. For smaller orifices, solids flow instability occurs when a hemispherical <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> just spans the orifice, corresponding to a certain critical negative pressure gradient. For large orifices, stable solids flow is abruptly cut off when the counterflowing gas rate is high enough, and no unstable solids flow region occurs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{computational}} fluid dynamic simulations of boiling flows using time-averaged Eulerian multi-phase approaches, the many sub-models required to describe such a complex phenomena are of particular importance. Of interest here, wall boiling requires calculation of the contribution of evaporation to global heat transfer, which in turn relies on determination of the active nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter and frequency of bubble departure. In this paper, an improved mechanistic model for the bubble departure diameter during flow boiling is developed. The model {{is based on the}} balance of forces acting on a bubble at a single nucleation site, with a new equation governing bubble growth proposed. The formulation accounts for evaporation of the micro-layer under the bubble, heat transfer from superheated liquid around the bubble surface, and condensation on the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> due to the presence of sub-cooled liquid. Validation of the growth equation is provided through comparison against experiments in both pool boiling and flow boiling conditions. Introduction of condensation on the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> allows reproduction of the growth of the bubble for different sub-cooling temperatures of the surrounding liquid. In addition, a sensitivity study guarantees dependency of the bubble departure diameter on relevant physical quantities such as mass flow rate, heat flux, liquid sub-cooling and pressure, with any inclination of the channel walls correctly accounted for. Predictions of bubble departure diameter and bubble lift-off are validated against three different databases on sub-cooled flow boiling with water and an additional database on saturated boiling with refrigerant R 113. The whole data set guarantees validation is performed over a range of parameters and operating conditions as broad as possible. Satisfactory predictive accuracy is obtained in all conditions. The present formulation provides an appropriate starting point for prediction of the behaviour of vapour bubbles under more general conditions which include lift-off after sliding, the frequency of bubble departure, bubble merging and bubble shrinking and collapse due to condensation...|$|R

When feeding synthetic solutions containing 700 mg/kg ammonia, stripping efficiencies of more than 98 % were achieved at gas to liquid mass ratios (G/L) ratios of 2. 5 - 2. 7. This produced stripper bottom solutions contains 10 mg/kg ammonia. Reducing the air flow by 25 % increased the ammonia content in the stripper bottoms to 30 mg/kg. Using the graphical McCabe-Theile method, the overall column efficiency for the <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> column during ammonia stripping was between 9 and 26 % because of the low contact efficiency of this column. When treating the as received plant wastewater, the ammonia removal efficiency was only 84 % at thelower G/L ratio.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of microbes and other particulates is frequently enriched in the droplets produced by bursting bubbles. As a bubble {{rises to the}} ocean surface, particulates in the bulk liquid can be transported to the sea surface microlayer by attaching to the bubble‚Äôs interface. When the bubble eventually ruptures, a fraction of these particulates is often ejected into the surroundings in film droplets with a particulate concentration that is {{higher than in the}} liquid from which they formed. The precise mechanisms responsible for this enrichment are unclear, yet such enrichment at the ocean surface influences important exchange processes with the atmosphere. Here we provide evidence that drainage, coupled with scavenging, is responsible for the enrichment. By simultaneously recording the drainage and rupture effects with high-speed and standard photography, we directly measured the particulate concentrations in the thin film of a <b>bubble</b> <b>cap</b> at the moment before it ruptures. We observed that the enrichment factor strongly depends on the film thickness at rupture, and developed a physical model, based on scavenging and drainage, that is consistent with our observations.

Distributor pressure drop measurements between the two distributors are compared with the theoretical estimations while {{the influence of the}} mass inventory is studied. Comparison is established for the transition velocity from bubbling to turbulent regime, Uc, deduced from the pressure fluctuations in the bed using gauge pressure measurements. The effect of the distributor on the flow structure near the bottom region of the bed is studied using differential and gauge pressure transducers located at different axial positions along the bed. The radial voidage profile in the bed is also measured using optical fiber probes, which provide local measurements of the voidage at different heights above the distributor. The {{distributor plate}} has a significant effect on the bed hydrodynamics. Owing to the jetting caused by the perforated plate distributor, earlier onset of the transition to the turbulent fluidization flow regime was observed.

Data from KC- 135 and sounding rocket experiments indicate little effect of gravity on boiling heat transfer at wall superheats below 25 C, despite vast differences in bubble behavior between gravity levels. In microgravity, a large primary bubble, surrounded by smaller satellite bubbles, moved over the surface, occasionally causing nucleation.
