5|$|Coverage {{in rural}} areas is unusually low, given the level of {{economic}} development and sector development. Using a <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> of access, based on the WHO definition of an improved water source, access {{in rural areas}} in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in Honduras - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in Ecuador, also a poorer country than Colombia.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{initially}} <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees {{often had}} differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this <b>broad</b> <b>definition,</b> bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E

5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted {{in such a way}} that it does very little.|$|E
5|$|Pluralists use {{the term}} Crusade of any {{campaign}} explicitly sanctioned by the reigning Pope. This reflects {{the view of the}} Roman Catholic Church (including medieval contemporaries such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux) that every military campaign given Papal sanction is equally valid as a Crusade, regardless of its cause, justification, or geographic location. This <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> includes attacks on paganism and heresy such as the Albigensian Crusade, the Northern Crusades, and the Hussite Wars, and wars for political or territorial advantage such as the Aragonese Crusade in Sicily, a Crusade declared by Pope InnocentIII against Markward of Anweiler in 1202, one against the Stedingers, several (declared by different popes) against Emperor FrederickII and his sons, two Crusades against opponents of King Henry III of England, and the Christian re-conquest of Iberia.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

25|$|The broader {{category}} of speculative fiction includes science fiction, fantasy, alternate histories (which {{may have no}} particular scientific or futuristic component), and even literary stories that contain fantastic elements, such {{as the work of}} Jorge Luis Borges or John Barth.

50|$|The {{scope of}} the Lobopodian concept varies from author to author. Its most limited sense refers to a suite of mainly Cambrian panarthropod taxa with {{flexible}} non-segmented limbs - for example Aysheaia, Hallucigenia and Xenusion. A <b>broader</b> <b>definition</b> of lobopodia would also incorporate the extant phyla Onychophora and Tardigrada. The <b>broadest</b> <b>definition</b> proposes the (monophyletic) Superphylum Lobopodia to encompass all three panarthropod phyla.|$|R

25|$|Body {{modification}} is {{the deliberate}} altering {{of the human}} body for any non-medical reason, such as aesthetics, sexual enhancement, a rite of passage, religious reasons, to display group membership or affiliation, to create body art, shock value, or self-expression. In its most <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> it includes plastic surgery, socially acceptable decoration (e.g. common ear piercing in many societies), and religious rites of passage (e.g. circumcision in a number of cultures).|$|E
25|$|Within this <b>broad</b> <b>definition,</b> {{theories}} of spiritual evolution are very diverse. They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing {{development of an}} individual), or both. They can be holistic (holding that higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), idealist (holding that reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or nondual (holding {{that there is no}} ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality).

In the 2011 rankings, UBC was ranked 2nd in the category: top 5 teaching programs. UBC's law school ranked fifth among Canadian law schools. The Sauder School of Business' MBA programs were ranked fourth in Canada. The same rankings placed the business school 11th in Canada for its undergraduate business program.|$|E
25|$|There are {{considerable}} variations between countries {{in their approach}} to sexual violence. Some countries have far-reaching legislation and legal procedures, with a <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> of rape that includes marital rape, and with heavy penalties for those convicted and a strong response in supporting victims. Commitment to preventing or controlling sexual violence is also reflected in an emphasis on police training and an appropriate allocation of police resources to the problem, in the priority given to investigating cases of sexual assault, and in the resources made available to support victims and provide medico-legal services.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} the {{practice}} of burning tobacco and inhaling the smoke (consisting of particle and gaseous phases). (A more <b>broad</b> <b>definition</b> may include simply taking tobacco smoke into the mouth, and then releasing it, as is done by some with tobacco pipes and cigars.) The practice was believed to begin as early as 5000–3000 BC. Tobacco was introduced to Eurasia in the late 17th century where it followed common trade routes. The practice encountered criticism from its first import into the Western world onwards, but embedded itself in certain strata {{of a number of}} societies before becoming widespread upon the introduction of automated cigarette-rolling apparatus.|$|E
