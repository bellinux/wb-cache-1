5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate. This one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a <b>better</b> <b>world.</b> Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E
5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the {{physical}} description of the savior. During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a <b>better</b> <b>world</b> and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to take place on the final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes to atone for past actions by doing so.|$|E
5|$|She Has a Name is a {{play about}} human {{trafficking}} written by Andrew Kooman in 2009 as a single act and expanded to full length in 2010. It is about the trafficking of children into sexual slavery and {{was inspired by the}} deaths of 54 people in the Ranong human-trafficking incident. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of She Has a Name was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt in Calgary, Alberta in February 2011. From May to October 2012, She Has a Name toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A <b>Better</b> <b>World</b> raised money to help women and children who had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. The first performances of She Has a Name in the United States took place in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} test of West's {{political}} outlook was the Bolshevik Revolution.

Even before the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917, West expressed her doubts that events in Russia could serve as a model for socialists in Britain or anywhere else.|$|E

In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.|$|E

25|$|Ryerson's major {{contribution}} {{was as a}} Marxist historian and {{it was here that}} Ryerson was to find his voice. The Canadian bourgeoisie's dismissal of Communism generally states that it is an alien importation and as such has no basis within Canadian society. By stressing the progressive nature of the Canadian past, the CPC hoped to prove the validity of its existence within Canadian society. During this period, numerous articles and pamphlets were published by the CPC, {{but it was not until}} the 1937 publication of Stanley Ryerson's 1837-The Birth of Canadian Democracy, that the full Marxist analysis of the on the 1837 Rebellions would appear. 1837 should be viewed as a work of Marxist historiography written for a working-class audience and not for academia; since Ryerson wrote this book so it could be used as a weapon in the struggle of working people to build a qualitatively different and <b>better</b> <b>world.</b> Ryerson's rationale for writing this book, as was the rationale for all his works, can be best summarised as an exploration of Canadian history with the hopes of educating the working-class, in a sense it was an exercise in the raising of class consciousness.|$|E
