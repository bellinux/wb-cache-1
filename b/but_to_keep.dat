5|$|After {{reading the}} report, an outraged Hermann Göring demanded 'at the highest level' the {{transfer}} of the airmen to Luftwaffe control. Unknown to all airmen except Lamason, their execution had been scheduled for 26 October, if they remained at Buchenwald. News of the airmen's scheduled execution had been conveyed to Lamason by a German political prisoner, Eugen Kogon, who had a reliable contact within the camp administrative area. Lamason discussed the information at length with Yeo-Thomas, Burney and Robert and they concluded there was little that could be done to avert the mass execution. Lamason decided not to inform the airmen, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this information to himself to keep morale high and in the slight hope the Luftwaffe would intervene in time. On the night of 19 October, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 airmen, including Lamason, were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E

25|$|After {{disembarking}} reinforcements {{and supplies}} at Oran and Mers El Kébir, Francisco de Mendoza's fleet returned to Spain. King Philip II, {{informed about the}} development of the siege, decided to reward Martín de Córdoba and Francisco Vivero, commanding officer of Fort San Miguel, for keeping these two crucial strongholds in Spanish hands. In fact, this allowed the capture the following year of Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, a success which was followed in 1565 by the decisive defense of Malta against the fleet of Turgut Reis. Several years later, in 1574, it was discussed at the Spanish court whether or not to abandon Oran and Mers El Kébir. King Philip II ordered Vespasian Gonzaga Colonna, Prince of Sabbioneta and Duke of Trayecto, to make a comprehensive report about the situation of both towns. Gonzaga advised to abandon Oran <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Mers El Kebir. However, marshal Juan Muñoz sent to the king a report by Sancho de Leyva advising to keep both strongholds. Philip II finally opted for the advice of Leyva.|$|E

25|$|On 12 November, 5,000 {{soldiers}} {{belonging to}} 12th Regular Army were deployed to Swat {{to bolster the}} already 15,000 para-military and police that were already fighting to keep what ground of the district they still held. The Pakistan Army mounted a number of operations to counter the militants and their expanse. However, on November 15, militants advanced from Swat, which was now under their control, into the next district to the east, Shangla. That day Alpuri, which is the district headquarters of Shangla, fell to the Taliban insurgents. As the militant force was coming towards the town the police force deserted without a fight. The military quickly turned the focus of their operations now not to take back Swat <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Shangla. By 17 November, an estimated 100 militants {{were killed in the}} fighting. On November 25, Taliban forces decided to leave Alpuri because of the huge Pakistani infantry forces moving towards the area. The Taliban evacuated Alpuri and took up positions on the mountaintops around the town. Meanwhile, in Swat on 26 November, Pakistani artillery resulted in the death of two top Taliban commanders. With artillery fire and ground forces, the Pakistani Army tried to recapture many strategic hilltops from the Taliban and indeed, they managed to capture some of the hilltops and drove the Taliban back to the Swat district. The fighting for the hilltops left 4 Pakistani soldiers and 45 Taliban forces, led by Mullah Fazlullah, dead. On 27 November, Pakistani forces secured Shangla.|$|E

500|$|When {{darkness}} {{put an end}} to the fighting, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades {{established an}} outpost line and spent the night on the battlefield, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 5th Mounted Brigades withdrew for water and rations at Pelusium Station, where the newly arrived infantry brigades of the 42nd Division were assembling. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade halted at Hill 70, while the Mobile Force had reached the Hod el Bada, [...] south of Romani station. At 19:30, when the New Zealand Mounted Rifle and 5th Mounted Brigades moved from the positions they had won to water and rest at Pelusium, the area was consolidated by infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade, 42nd Division. Brigadier General Girdwood ordered infantry in the 7th and 8th Scottish Rifles Battalions to hold their ground on Wellington Ridge until daylight, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> close contact with the enemy during the night in the hope of capturing large numbers of tired and disorganised soldiers in the morning. Approximately 1,200 unwounded prisoners were captured during the day and sent to the Pelusium railway station.|$|E

[...] He also urged the administration to [...] "assure a divergence of outlook and policy between the Russians and Chinese," [...] which could be accomplished by improving relations with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev who had wanted to distance himself from the Communist Chinese. He wrote, [...] "We should... without deceiving ourselves about Khrushchev's political personality and without nurturing any unreal hopes, be concerned to keep him politically in the running and to encourage the survival in Moscow of the tendencies he personifies". Additionally, he recommended that the United States work toward creating divisions within the Soviet bloc by undermining its power in Eastern Europe and encouraging the independent propensities of satellite governments.|$|E

The instructions continued, [...] "The {{objective of the}} attack by the XX Corps on Z day is the capture of the line of works between the Khelasa–Beersheba road and the Wadi esh Sabe, the capture of the enemy guns between Beersheba and the trenches west of the town, and in co-operation with the cavalry to drive the enemy from the remainder of his defences at Beersheba". However, it is claimed, [...] "West of Beersheba the XX Corps had all its objectives and could without doubt have captured Beersheba itself before the mounted troops." [...] The objective of the infantry divisions was not to capture Beersheba, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the main garrison occupied while the Desert Mounted Corps captured the town. The official British historian stated, [...] "The capture of Beersheba itself was the task of the Desert Mounted Corps, which required the water in the town for its horses". [...] "XX Corps Instructions" [...] stated: [...] "outposts will be placed approximately on the 'Blue Line' (Tracing [...] "A") to cover the consolidation of the position and reorganization of the attacking troops." [...] No units were to go beyond the 'Blue Line' without orders or to capture guns.|$|E
500|$|In a 6 September 1777 letter, Johnson told Thrale to be [...] "punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology {{you know}} is the eye of history". However, the system of Ana allowed Thrale to group items by theme instead of by topics, like [...] "Odd medical Stories", to {{organize}} anecdotes, quotations, and stories. When Henry Thrale died while Thrale was writing Volume Three, the work became a diary for Thrale to discuss her thoughts and feelings after her loss. This volume soon began to describe Thrale's feelings for Gabriel Piozzi. Throughout the Thraliana, Thrale examines how others view her, which reveals her anxieties that she had about how she was perceived. This is especially true when she writes: [...] "Life has been to me nothing but a perpetual Canvass carried on {{in all parts of}} the World - not to make Friends neither - for I have certainly found very few - <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> off Enemies". Thrale initially did not want to write in the sixth volume of the Thraliana, but did so because [...] "Johnson said that Pleasure might one day be made from such Nonsense, so I'll e'en finish this last Volume of Anecdote & store up no more Stuff". However she did not stop journal writing after she finished but continued to write for the remainder of her life.|$|E

[...] Electronic Gaming Monthly's three reviewers gave it a 9, 9.5, and 9 out of ten, one saying: [...] "I'll be surprised if you can find a better game on any system this fall." [...] Newtype USA named Ōkami its Game of the Month for October 2006, heralded the pacing as [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and proclaimed [...] "Ōkami is that rarest of beasts: a game without any obvious flaws.

[...] Eurogamer scored the game 10/10 saying [...] "Right from the start it conjures an atmosphere of being something special, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that level of quality up consistently over 60 hours ensures that this will be a game that will be talked about for years to come". In 2007, Ōkami was named eighteenth best PlayStation 2 game of all time in IGN's feature reflecting on the PlayStation 2's long lifespan.

500|$|In {{aftermath}} of the battle, as the Australians withdrew towards Eora Creek the Japanese pushed over {{the crest of the}} ridge south of the Isurava rest house and then occupied Alola. There they secured a large amount of small arms ammunition and grenades, as well as rations which were eagerly consumed by the troops who were now beginning to feel the effects of hunger {{as a result of an}} already strained supply line. On 28 August, Horii had received orders to secure an advanced position south of the Owen Stanleys, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the majority of his force to the north while the situation around Guadalcanal was resolved. After the fighting around Isurava he pushed only part of his force [...] about 3,500 men [...] forward, and tasked the 41st Infantry Regiment with the pursuit of the Australians. In the days that followed the Australian withdrawal from Isurava, a [...] "week-long fighting withdrawal" [...] took place. Further actions were fought around Templeton's Crossing and Efogi in the early days of September, as the Australian resistance along the track began to stiffen and become more organised. In the aftermath, Potts relieved the exhausted 39th and 53rd Battalions; they were ordered to make their way back to Myola and then later to Port Moresby, while the 2/27th was deployed forward. It joined up with the rest of the 21st Infantry Brigade in time for the fighting around Efogi. The 53rd, whose performance was widely derided by Allied commanders, was amalgamated with the 55th and together with the 39th would later see heavy fighting around Gona and Sanananda.|$|E
500|$|The Third Battle of Gaza {{was never}} {{intended}} to capture the town, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the garrison in place after the capture of Beersheba. Only {{the first line of}} Ottoman trenches had been the objectives of the XXI Corps, which used new infantry tactics, tanks and massed artillery organised in accordance with Western Front standards. Although all objectives had not been won, the operations had forced two regiments of the Ottoman 7th Division reserve to move away from Hareira and Sheria, forward to strengthen the Ottoman defences between Gaza and the sea. According to the British official historian, [...] "The attack on the western defences of Gaza...had fulfilled the Commander-in-Chief's object." [...] The EEF had also inflicted severe losses on the Ottoman defenders; more than one thousand of whom the EEF buried in the captured trenches. The EEF captured twenty-eight officers, 418 soldiers, twenty-nine machine guns and seven trench mortars. During the fighting, the corps infantry had advanced about [...] on a [...] front, and held their gains against repeated Ottoman counterattacks, although the attempt to create a gap for the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade to ride through was not successful. The front line defensive system on the south–west side of Gaza had been captured and the infantry occupied a position from which they could threaten [...] "Ali Muntar {{and the rest of the}} defences in front of the town." [...] The XXI Corps suffered 350 killed, 350 missing and two thousand wounded during this fighting. Many casualties were blamed on loss of direction and crowding in the captured trenches, which were too shallow.|$|E
