5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history {{at the age of}} 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
25|$|Flutie {{entered the}} USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, {{as his first}} two {{professional}} passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, {{for a total of}} 174 yards, while running for 51 yards.|$|E

500|$|All Saladin's {{best efforts}} could not {{dislocate}} the Crusader column, or halt its {{advance in the}} direction of Arsuf. [...] Richard was determined to hold his army together, forcing the enemy to exhaust themselves in repeated charges, with the intention of holding his knights for a concentrated counter-attack at just the right moment. [...] There were risks in this, because the army was not only marching under severe enemy provocation, but the troops were suffering from heat and thirst. [...] Just as serious, the Saracens were killing so many horses that some of Richard's own knights <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> a counter-strike would be possible. Many of the unhorsed knights joined the infantry.|$|E
500|$|On 3 April, {{after days}} of {{difficult}} travel, Nansen privately <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the pole might, after all, be out of reach. Unless the surface improved, their food would not last them to the pole {{and then on to}} Franz Josef Land. [...] The next day they calculated their position at a disappointing 86°3'; Nansen confided in his diary that: [...] "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." [...] After making camp on 7 April Nansen scouted ahead on snowshoes looking for a path forward, but saw only [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon". He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land. Nansen recorded the latitude of their final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees (169.6 nautical miles, or 314km) beyond Greely's previous Farthest North mark.|$|E
500|$|After {{ending his}} playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a {{coaching}} {{job with the}} team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. [...] "When I heard of the hiring of a new assistant, I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the full reason {{is whether or not the}} time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level," [...] he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. [...] "We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. And we now have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|... "We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a {{residential}} side of Manchester, and we didn't like it. My father {{wanted to go}} to get near a friend for business reasons. We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Broncos then {{defeated}} the Cleveland Browns 37–21 in the AFC Championship Game. This {{was the third}} time {{in the last four years}} that both teams faced each other for the AFC Championship, and the previous two resulted in two of the most famous games in NFL Lore: The Drive and The Fumble. In this game, the Broncos seemed to be in complete control at first, building up a 24–7 lead. But Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar rallied his team back with two third-quarter touchdowns, cutting the lead to 24–21 going into the 4th quarter. [...] Some observers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> this game would become known as [...] "The Comeback". [...] However, Elway destroyed any chance of a Browns comeback by leading the Broncos 80 yards and scoring with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Sammy Winder on the first drive of the 4th quarter. Denver then scored field goals on each of their next two drives to put the game away. [...] Elway finished the game with 385 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions, while also leading Denver in rushing with 5 carries for 39 yards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{ending to}} the Cain novella {{called for the}} characters to commit double suicide. Suicide, however, was strictly forbidden at the time by the Hays Production Code {{as a way to}} resolve a plot, so Wilder wrote and filmed a different ending in which Neff goes to the gas chamber while Keyes watches. This scene was shot before the scenes that eventually became the film's familiar ending, and once that final intimate exchange between Neff and Keyes revealed its power to Wilder, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the gas chamber ending was needed at all. [...] "You couldn't have a more meaningful scene between two men", Wilder said. As he would later recount, [...] "The story was between the two guys. I knew it, even though I had already filmed the gas chamber scene... So we just took out the scene in the gas chamber," [...] despite its $150,000 cost to the studio. Removal of the scene, over Chandler's objection, also removed the Hays Office's single biggest remaining objection to the picture, since they regarded it as [...] "unduly gruesome" [...] and predicted that it would never be approved by local and regional censor boards. The footage and sound elements are lost, but production stills of the scene still exist.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
