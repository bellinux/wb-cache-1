Mythology dates back the origin of Aandhikhola to the ancient time of Dwapar Yuga described in Hindu Puranas during the period of King Dasharatha, the father of Lord Ram of Ramayana. During that time, a pious and aged <b>blind</b> <b>couple</b> had a devoted son named Shrawankumar. The old couple wished a pilgrimage before their death and Shrawan Kumar was on journey carrying them on his shoulder to fulfill their desire. On the way in a forest near Himalaya, his parents became very thirsty. He left them in a comfortable tree shade and rushed to a nearby river promising to return soon with water. As he hurriedly plunged his pitcher in the water, it produced a noise like that of a wild animal. King Dasaratha was hunting nearby and happened to hear the sound. The king could shoot his target without seeing the target only with guidance of sound. He assumed the sound to be of a wild beast and shot his arrows in the direction. As he arrived, he saw a young man lying dead with his arrow piercing his chest. He then saw the pitcher and immediately realized his mistake. The guilt-ridden king quietly carried water to the old couple but they demanded to know about their son before drinking it. When he told them about his mistake resulting in their son's death, they began to cry and died in the spot leaving behind a pool of tears which transformed into a small lake. A stream began to flow from this lake. The term 'Aandhi' means 'blind' and 'khola' means 'river' in nepali language. Thus this new river got its name as Aandhikhola referring to tears of Shrawan Kumar's blind parents.|$|R

University of Jyväskylä, Department of Biology of Physical Activity, Master Thesis in Applied Biomechanics. 86 pp. We devised an {{experimental}} protocol {{to test the}} hypothesis that if the performer poses attention on the proprioceptive signals, in the form of awareness of the body in space, this could increase the corticospinal excitability and the overall performance. 10 right-handed volunteers were randomly assigned to either a group performing a skill training blindfolded (BLIND) or in normal (NORM) condition. The intervention included a visuomotor task-related skill training lasting five days. Neurophysiological measurements included input/output relationship (IO Curve) of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), both measured with the transcranial magnetic stimulator, from the right Biceps Brachii muscle. The results showed no significant changes in any of the neurophysiological parameters, either between the groups or within the same group. However, the analysis revealed that in day 1, the BLIND group showed an increase in the corticospinal excitability compared with NORM. There was also a slight decrease in SICI for BLIND, and an increase in SICI for the NORM group. On day 5, there was a slight reduction in the corticospinal excitability for <b>BLIND,</b> <b>coupled</b> with a slight increase in SICI. For the NORM group, on day 1 there was a decrease in the corticospinal excitability, coupled with a decrease in the SICI as well. On day 5 the CSE increased, while the SICI decreased. The performance, expressed as mean error between the trial and the target line, showed that the BLIND group performed better in each day, with a strong significant difference on day 1 (difference between the groups: 3. 07 ± 1. 17, p < 0. 01). On the other hand, the rate of performance improvement was significantly greater for the NORM group, compared with the BLIND group (difference between D 1 and D 5 for the NORM group: 3. 70 ± 1. 59, p < 0. 01). It is concluded that a skill training performed blindfolded is undoubtedly beneficial for the performance, and that a modulation of the corticospinal excitability is indeed in place. Future study will be needed to clarify the exact mechanisms behind this modulation...|$|R

Methods To this end we developed a multistage signal processing methodology comprising <b>blind</b> source separation <b>coupled</b> with a neural network based feature extraction and classification method. Results Changes in the amplitude and phase of brain sources estimates in the VLF band between rest and task were enhanced with increased task difficulty, but remained lower than those experienced in higher frequency bands.

40|$|Purpose: A {{prospective}} study was planned {{to determine the}} relationship between post swim-up acrosome index (AI) evaluation and fertilization outcomes in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) program. Materials and Methods: Infertile couples who have applied to IVF were admitted into this study when the male partner’s sperm concentration was> 20 × 10 6 /mL and motility> 30 %. Pre- and post swim-up semen quality parameters including concentration, motility, sperm morphology and AI were evaluated in a prospective, randomized and <b>blinded</b> fashion. The <b>couples</b> were divided prospectively into 2 groups. In group I (25 couples) 50 000 sperm per oocyte were used for insemination considering post swim-up acrosome index, and in group II (25 couples) 50 000 sperm per oocyte were used for insemination without considering post swim-up acrosome index. Results: Pre- and post swim-up AI were 30. 8 ± 3. 4 and 17. 8 ± 4. 5 in group I, and 31. 4 ± 3. 6 and 16. 3 ± 4. 7 in group II (p> 0. 05) respectively. The significant improvement in morphology and motility after double wash swim-up procedure has been observed. However, double wash swim-up procedure could not eliminate head and especially acrosomal defects which would directly effect fertilization capacity in conventional IVF program. In group I, 85. 3 % of oocytes were fertilized, with a 48 % pregnancy rate; in group II, 71. 0 % of oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate of 20 %. Fertilization and pregnancy rates were significantly different (p < 0. 05) between the two groups. Conclusion: We have concluded {{that it could be}} useful to consider post swim-up AI of sperm inseminated in conventional IVF cycles, which correlates with high fertilization and pregnancy rates...|$|R
