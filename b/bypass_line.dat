5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the plans}} were revised, with new plans {{such as a}} line to Staten Island and a revised line to the Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens <b>Bypass</b> <b>line</b> via the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was first {{proposed}} as {{a branch of the}} still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens <b>Bypass</b> <b>line,</b> a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the Bronx, and other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Phase I's {{flagship}} project was the 63rd Street–Southeast Queens line, which would stretch {{from the existing}} 57th Street subway station in Midtown Manhattan to the existing Laurelton LIRR station in Springfield Gardens. The construction of this line was to be split up into three parts. The first part, Route 131–A, would run from Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan below 63rd Street and the East River to Northern Boulevard. The next part, Route 131–B, the Super–Express <b>Bypass</b> <b>Line,</b> would continue along the LIRR right-of-way to Forest Hills. And finally, Route 131–D, the Southeastern Queens Line, would build {{a branch of the}} Queens Boulevard Line at Briarwood through Downtown Jamaica to Springfield Gardens via the LIRR's Atlantic Branch, with a ramp to eliminate the Jamaica Avenue elevated structure in Downtown Jamaica.|$|E

25|$|On 11 February 2014, SWM/MVG {{announced}} a detailed {{report for the}} construction of new <b>bypass</b> <b>line,</b> a fourth intracity underground line, to be called the U9. The new line will relieve the overburdened U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6 lines, especially the transfer stations at Sendlinger Tor (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6), Central Station (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U4/U5), and Odeonsplatz (U3/U6 and U4/U5), and will shorten the travel time between the Central Station and the Allianz Arena by removing the need to transfer at Marienplatz or Odeonsplatz. MVG is predicting tremendous growth of passenger traffic in the northern section of Munich in the next twenty years and wanted to plan accordingly. The U9 line is projected to carry ten million passengers per year and to cost between 250 and 360 million euros, with an estimated completion date of 2025 if funding were approved. Three proposed booster lines — U10, U11, and U12 — would take advantage of new U9 bypass line; however, these booster lines are still under discussion.|$|E
25|$|In the Bronx, {{the line}} would run along East 138th Street, with a {{cross-platform}} transfer to Lexington Avenue Line trains at Brook Avenue on the IRT Pelham Line, {{which would be}} reconfigured. After that, Second Avenue line trains would use a new express <b>bypass</b> <b>line</b> along East 138th Street, and the former tracks of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway (NYW) near the Bruckner Expressway. In Hunts Point, service would split into two branches. One branch would continue to use former NYW trackage to East 180th Street, {{at which point the}} line would connect to the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. A second branch would connect to the IRT Pelham Line in the vicinity of Whitlock Avenue station, another element from earlier plans. The first branch would take over all service on the Dyre Avenue Line, offering cross-platform transfers to IRT White Plains Road Line trains at East 180th Street station, which would also be reconfigured. The second branch would take over service on the upper portion of the Pelham Line, between Whitlock Avenue and Pelham Bay Park. All stations on the Dyre Avenue and upper Pelham Lines would have platforms shaved back to accommodate larger B Division trains. There were 140,000 daily passengers expected on the Second Avenue line at 64th Street, reducing the number of passengers on the Lexington Avenue Line from 287,000 passengers at 64th Street to 171,000.|$|E
500|$|The station {{opened in}} October 1989 {{with the opening}} of the 63rd Street Line. From its opening until [...] 2001, this was the {{terminal}} of the line, although it was not originally intended as a terminal. The 63rd Street Line was originally part of a plan for a Queens <b>Bypass</b> <b>Line</b> running along the Long Island Rail Road Main Line. However, due to the lack of funds, the line terminated here, with layup tracks going to 29th Street. As a result, the tunnel become known as the [...] "tunnel to nowhere." ...|$|E
50|$|In the Stuttgart area a few <b>bypass</b> <b>lines</b> {{were added}} to relieve the {{pressure}} on the main station at the state capital. These included the Schuster Railway from Kornwestheim to Untertürkheim, completed in 1896, the Rankbach Railway from Böblingen to Renningen, completed between 1914 and 1915, as well as the construction of the shunting yard in Kornwestheim between 1918 and 1920.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{sources of}} errors when calculating plant {{balances}} include process faults such as leaks, unmodeled heat losses, incorrect physical properties or other physical parameters used in equations, and incorrect structure such as unmodeled <b>bypass</b> <b>lines.</b> Other errors include unmodeled plant dynamics such as holdup changes, and other instabilities in plant operations that violate steady state (algebraic) models. Additional dynamic errors arise when measurements and samples are not taken at the same time, especially lab analyses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Cache {{hierarchy}} designs, including bypassing, replacement, and {{the inclusion}} property, have significant performance impact. Recent works on high performance caches {{have shown that}} cache bypassing is an effective technique to enhance the last level cache (LLC) performance. However, commonly used inclusive cache hierarchy cannot benefit from this technique because bypassing inherently breaks the inclusion property. This paper presents a solution to enabling cache bypassing for inclusive caches. We introduce a bypass buffer to an LLC. <b>Bypassed</b> cache <b>lines</b> skip the LLC while their tags are stored in this bypass buffer. When a tag is evicted from the bypass buffer, it invalidates the corresponding cache lines in upper level caches to ensure the inclusion property. Our key insight is that the lifetime of a <b>bypassed</b> <b>line,</b> assuming a well-designed bypassing algorithm, should be short in upper level caches and is most likely dead when its tag is evicted from the bypass buffer. Therefore, a small bypass buffer is sufficient to maintain the inclusion property and to reap most performance benefits of bypassing. Furthermore, the bypass buffer facilitates bypassing algorithms by providing the usage information of <b>bypassed</b> <b>lines.</b> We show that a top performing cache bypassing algorithm, which is originally designed for non-inclusive caches, performs comparably for inclusive caches equipped with our bypass buffer. The usage information collected from the bypass buffer also significantly reduces the cost of hardware implementation compared to the original design...|$|R

2500|$|The {{growth of}} the north shore {{communities}} provided good traffic levels for the railroad, but the increasing congestion of these communities' business districts impeded the railroad's desire to remain competitive with the competing steam railroads for longer-haul passenger business, in particular the Chicago-Milwaukee traffic. [...] The North Shore therefore sought {{to build a new}} <b>bypass</b> <b>line</b> through the Skokie Valley – what was then undeveloped rural land approximately four to five miles west of the lake shore route.|$|E
50|$|A need to {{increase}} capacity for through and west-end traffic led to three new platforms being built in 2006, on land formerly occupied by disused sidings and <b>bypass</b> <b>lines</b> within {{the main part of}} the station. Platform 10 is a through platform at the west end, facing Platform 11. Platforms 1 and 20 are a single long through platform facing Platforms 2 and 19. All are linked by the upgraded north-south overhead walkway linking the Waverley Steps (escalators) to Market Street.|$|R
