25|$|The station claimed grade <b>B</b> <b>coverage</b> in a 35-mile radius: {{north to}} Centreville, west to Orange, south to Ashland and east into rural St. Mary's County, Maryland. It also gained {{carriage}} on the few cable systems within its coverage area: Fredericksburg, Orange, Culpeper, Dale City, Woodbridge, and La Plata, Maryland. At least in Fredericksburg proper, the cable system carried all three NBC outlets but substituted WHFV during network programming.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{reception}} {{problems in}} parts of Central Indiana with its VHF digital signal (including in areas {{on the fringe of}} its Grade <b>B</b> <b>coverage</b> such as Bainbridge and Crawfordsville) that did not occur with stations broadcasting on the UHF band following the transition, WTHR filed a request with the FCC in June 2013 to increase its transmitter power to 77,000 watts, which would exceed the Commission's maximum power limit in effect at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, the Jefferson-Pilot Corporation, then-owner of WJPR, {{proposed}} to merge WVFT's stronger programming inventory onto WJPR's schedule and turn WVFT into a full-time satellite station of WJPR. Family Group readily accepted the offer, and WJPR and WVFT began their joint simulcast later that year, {{at which time}} the stations began collectively branding as [...] "Fox 21/27". The two stations provided a strong combined signal with 60% overlap, providing a clear picture for Fox programming throughout the market. Although channel 21 decently covers Roanoke, its analog signal left much to be desired in the New River Valley (despite having an effective radiated power of 4.1 million watts), where it provided Grade <b>B</b> <b>coverage</b> at best {{in parts of the}} region. Some areas of the New River Valley, along with other rural portions of the market, were among the few regions of the country where cable television service was still not readily available.|$|E

2500|$|WDAZ {{went on the}} air for {{the first}} time on January 29, 1967. For its first 15 years on the air, WDAY-TV had {{significant}} coverage problems in the northern portion of the vast Fargo/Grand Forks market. Channel 6 was required to conform its signal to protect CBC Television station CBWT in Winnipeg, which was also on channel 6. While the other Fargo stations covered the northern portion of the market very well, WDAY-TV only provides grade <b>B</b> <b>coverage</b> to most of Grand Forks and cannot be seen at all in much of the northern part of the market. WDAZ was signed on to fill this coverage gap. (WDAY's coverage problem would become moot with the 2009 digital television transition in the United States and the 2011 transition in Canada, in which WDAY would broadcast its digital signal on channel 21 and CBWT broadcast theirs on channel 27.) It is one of the few stations west of the Mississippi River allowed to use a [...] "W" [...] call sign at sign-on. Most stations west of the Mississippi begin with the K; however, WDAY radio received its call letters before the U.S. Government moved the K-W boundary in 1923 from the state borders between 102 and 104 degrees West longitude (including the North Dakota–Montana border) to the Mississippi River.|$|E
