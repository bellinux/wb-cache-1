5|$|SEN. CLINTON: Well, what Governor Spitzer {{has agreed}} {{to do is to}} have three {{different}} licenses; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes and other kinds of security issues, another which is an ordinary driver's license, and then a special card that identifies the people who would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for the next 18 months.|$|E

Mick McConnell, one of the band's road crew and their guitar technician replaced him as the group's new lead guitarist, this formation recording the next album, Wild Horses – The Nashville Album (1998), in Nashville, Tennessee.

25|$|The 2012–13 season saw a {{more stable}} squad than had been seen by Grimsby Town in recent years, {{with a total of}} 12 players from the {{previous}} season's squad remaining. The previous season's top scorer Liam Hearn suffered an Achilles tendon injury in pre-season, and although he appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to recovery when he came on as a substitute against Stockport County, just three days later he injured his leg in training, and tests showed it was an Achilles tendon rupture and he would be out for several months. However, despite the loss of such an important player, and despite not winning 5 games into the season, Grimsby were top of the table by Christmas, with two crucial loan players Ross Hannah and Scott Neilson breathing new life into the Grimsby team. The turn of the year, however, appeared to be a turning point for Grimsby, with Nathan Pond returning from loan to Fleetwood Town and Scott Neilson signing for league rivals Luton Town. The team appeared to lack the quality they had shown {{towards the end of the}} previous year, and despite not losing until mid-February, a run of 4 consecutive losses in March saw them give up the top spot and ultimately fall away from the title race. Despite this, they reached the FA Trophy final, where they played Wrexham at Wembley Stadium on 24 March 2013. Grimsby went ahead in the second half with 20 minutes left to go, through an Andy Cook strike. However, they conceded a penalty with 9 minutes left and Wrexham equalised. This took the game to extra time, and then penalties, where Grimsby lost the shoot-out 4–1. Grimsby finished the season in good form, with a 9 match unbeaten run, finishing the season with a 3–0 win against Newport County. This led them to finish in 4th place with 83 points. They faced Newport County again straight away in the play-off semi-finals, where they were knocked out by a 1–0 loss in both legs. The managerial duo was broken up on 6 September 2013 due to Rob Scott being suspended and Paul Hurst was placed in sole charge of the team.|$|E

500|$|On 16 April 2014, in {{response}} to earlier reports that the band may be retiring due to Malcolm Young being seriously ill and unable to perform, Brian Johnson commented that AC/DC are not retiring, stating [...] "We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We're {{going to pick up}} guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it." [...] AC/DC subsequently announced in an official statement on their Facebook page that Malcolm Young would be taking a break from the band due to his ill health. It ended: [...] "The band will continue to make music." [...] In June, Johnson announced that AC/DC are [...] "very likely" [...] to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> again before the end of 2014. In July 2014, AC/DC confirmed that they have finished recording their next album and that Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young replaced Malcolm in the studio.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with influences Pennywise, NOFX, and Social Distortion. [...] "The Warped Tour is really more of a traveling-band barbecue," [...] commented DeLonge. [...] "You hang out with the other bands all day, you play your set, and then hang out again." [...] In late 1997 and early 1998, the band would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for nine months straight, only coming home to San Diego {{for days at a time}} before striking out on the next tour. [...] "When we did our longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled DeLonge. [...] "We were all new and in love, and I had to leave. It was just, 'Hey, I'll see you in nine months.' It was really hard." [...] In addition to the hefty touring schedule, the trio grew tired of other commitments, including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of [...] "Dammit".|$|E
500|$|In September 1917, Bojić was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis. Owing {{to the influence of}} his old patron, Ljuba Jovanović-Patak, he was admitted to a military hospital in central Thessaloniki which tended exclusively to Serbian Army officers, where Jovanović's wife often visited him. Bojić continued writing poetry, and as his condition deteriorated, his poems began to take a melancholy tone. Nevertheless, he remained optimistic that he would recover from his illness and see his family again. One month before his death, he sent his fiancée and brother a telegram assuring them that he was [...] "...only slightly ill" [...] and promised they would be reunited. Bojić died of tuberculosis on [...] Even a few hours before his death, he appeared convinced of his survival. According to a fellow patient, Bojić [...] "...died choking in half-sleep from a fit of coughing that destroyed the tissues of his lungs." [...] He was buried at the Zeitenlik military cemetery in Thessaloniki. His family was shocked by the news of his death, particularly his brother and fiancée, who believed him to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to recovery. In 1922, Bojić's remains were exhumed and transferred to Belgrade's New Cemetery, where they were reburied beside those of his parents.|$|E

500|$|Despite some {{moderate}} critical praise {{including a}} glowing review from AllMusic, {{who called the}} album's [...] "impressively surprising" [...] array of sounds [...] "refreshing coming from a band who {{was assumed to be}} generic retro swing", Soul Caddy failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies' accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance and negative audience reactions towards the band's decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled [...] "we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of Zoot Suit Riot...we felt this tension to be something we weren't". Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour's outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, eventually reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. [...] "A lot of it was just fatigue", Perry explained, [...] "We'd <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{for a long time and}} we had no life outside of Cherry Poppin' Daddies. [...] I think everybody was interested in doing other things". The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked [...] "to the curb" [...] after Soul Caddys poor commercial performance.|$|E
