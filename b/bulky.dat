5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, <b>bulky,</b> heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the <b>bulky</b> inductors with <b>bulky</b> and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E

5|$|An {{orangutan}} {{has a large}}, <b>bulky</b> body, a thick neck, very long, strong arms, short, bowed legs, and no tail. It {{is mostly}} covered with long, reddish-brown hair and grey-black skin. Sumatran orangutans have more sparse and lighter-coloured coats. The orangutan has a large head with a prominent mouth area. Though largely hairless, their faces can develop some hair in males, giving them a moustache.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively <b>bulky,</b> complex, vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to oxygen (diradical) {{converts}} this carbene to {{the corresponding}} benzophenone and the diphenylmethane compound is formed {{when it is}} trapped by 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As with the other carbenes this species contains large <b>bulky</b> substituents, namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups, that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of dimerisation to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene.|$|E

5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was <b>bulky</b> {{and they wanted}} {{to make it look like}} tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|Its façade {{was simply}} {{decorated}} by narrow pilasters and niches of saints. A bas relief of the church's secondary patron, San Vicente Ferrer, was prominently {{located on the}} center of the facade. A string of finely cut coral stones, molded into flowers, could be seen on the lower cornice of the facade. Beside the façade was an extension of a <b>bulky</b> belfry.|$|E
5|$|Mapracorat {{is one of}} {{a number}} of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less {{obviously}} steroid-like in structure. Other typical examples of this group are ZK216348 and 55D1E1. The <b>bulky,</b> bicyclic aromatic substituents (R1 and R2) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.|$|E

5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by <b>bulky</b> groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|E
5|$|Porporela {{was built}} in 1873, next to St. John Fortress. The Kase jetty (Kaše Breakwater) {{was built in}} 1485, {{according}} {{to the design of}} Paskoje Miličević, in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south-eastern winds and waves. The breakwater thus shortened the harbour's <b>bulky</b> chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without binder.|$|E

After the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station in 2001, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying <b>bulky</b> items.|$|E

5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. This is especially important where the patient is obese or specialty care transports that require large, <b>bulky</b> equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. There may also be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ's {{technology}} {{derives from}} the Telharmonium, an instrument created in 1897 by Thaddeus Cahill. The telharmonium used revolving electric alternators which generated tones that could be transmitted over wires. The instrument was <b>bulky,</b> because the alternators had to {{be large enough to}} generate high voltage for a loud enough signal. The Hammond organ solved this problem by using an amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and <b>bulky)</b> bones.|$|E

5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as <b>bulky</b> as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bulky</b> and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
