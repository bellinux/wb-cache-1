5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as <b>bait,</b> <b>fish</b> meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Forage {{fish are}} {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> or feeder fish. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> is a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch fish to bait longlines and traps. Forage fish is a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish,</b> by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as bait for other fish. The terms overlap in the sense that most <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> are also forage fish, and vice versa. Feeder fish is a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small fish that are eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fishing</b> is a {{behaviour}} described in only 12 species of birds, seven of which {{belong to the}} family Ardeidae (herons), the remaining five are scattered among four other bird families. This behaviour is defined as having the following characteristics: (1) Objects placed by the bait fisher on the water are buoyant and within a radius at which the fisher can strike at prey. (2) The objects attract or distract the fisherGÇÖs prey, with {{the effect that the}} fisher enhances its chances of prey capture. A review of the literature indicates that bait items are both selected from and placed within the environment to achieve enhanced prey capture success. It is concluded that <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> is a real and distinctive behaviour. The evolutionary route to <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> has most likely been through an association between particular floating objects and the occurrence of fish prey. The repositioning of these floating objects and the collection of objects of similar character would have then been sufficient to achieve the <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> behaviour now seen. <b>Bait</b> <b>fishing</b> falls within a commonly used definition of tool use. However, it is argued that, as with tool use and tool making in general, this does not necessarily imply special cognitive ability. The rare occurrence of <b>bait</b> <b>fishing</b> both within and across species as could be an indication of cognitive constraint; but this remains undemonstrated. Alternatively, this rarity could be explained if fishing is rarely more profitable than alternative foraging tactic...|$|R

25|$|The capture, {{transportation}} {{and culture of}} <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> can spread damaging organisms between ecosystems, endangering them. In 2007, several American states, enacted regulations designed to slow the spread of fish diseases, including viral hemorrhagic septicemia, by <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b> Because {{of the risk of}} transmitting Myxobolus cerebralis (whirling disease), trout and salmon should not be used as bait.|$|E

25|$|Deep ocean: {{which is}} by far the largest part of the Maldivian EEZ. This area is {{inhabited}} by pelagic fish, small schooling forage fish, sometimes called <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> and larger fish who prey on them, such as tuna and shark. By far, the greatest volume of catch in the Maldives comes from this area.|$|E
25|$|A bait ball, or baitball, {{occurs when}} small fish swarm in a tightly packed spherical {{formation}} about a common centre. It is a last-ditch defensive measure adopted by small schooling fish {{when they are}} threatened by predators. Small schooling fish are eaten by many types of predators, {{and for this reason}} they are called <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> or forage fish.|$|E
25|$|Deep sea {{demersal}} fish are usually long and narrow. Many are eels or shaped like eels. This {{may be because}} long bodies have long lateral lines. Lateral lines detect low-frequency sounds, and some {{demersal fish}}es have muscles that drum such sounds to attract mates. Smell is also important, {{as indicated by the}} rapidity with which demersal fish find traps baited with <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E

Among the species most widely pursued are striped bass, bluefish, bluefin tuna, false albacore (little tunny), bonito, tautog, flounder and fluke. The Cape Cod Bay side of the Cape, from Sandwich to Provincetown, has numerous harbors, saltwater creeks, and shoals that hold <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> and attract the larger game fish, such as striped bass, bluefish and bluefin tuna.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish, {{also called}} prey fish or <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed {{near the base}} of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include {{particularly}} fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish also inhabit {{freshwater}} habitats, such as {{lakes and}} rivers, where {{they serve as}} food for larger freshwater predators. Usually smaller than 15 centimetres (6in) in length, these small <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> make {{up most of the}} fish found in lakes and rivers. The minnow family alone, consisting of minnows, chubs, shiners and daces, consists of more than fifty species. Other freshwater forage fish include suckers, killifish, shad, bony fish as well as fish of the sunfish family, excluding black basses and crappie, and smaller species of the carp family. There are also anadromous forage fish, such as eulachon.|$|E

25|$|The {{theater was}} one of several theaters in Wailuku, and was named after a small <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> named the iao. Aside from {{screening}} movies, the theater also hosted live onstage performances. Notable events included appearances by Bob Hope, Betty Hutton, and Frank Sinatra for USO shows during World War II, plus showed such movies as Rio Rita, and the X-rated film Deep Throat (which got the theater owner arrested). In 1953, the Hawaii debut of From Here to Eternity was staged at the Iao. A snack concession was run by Harry Kaya for almost 40 years, from 1930 to the mid-1970s, called Harry's Sweets. The location was just outside the main theater entrance. Local Hawaiian music artists such as Kealiʻi Reichel and Amy Hanaialiʻi Gilliom also gathered experience at the Iao.|$|E
25|$|In fly fishing, {{fish are}} caught by using {{artificial}} flies that are cast with a fly rod and a fly line. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy {{enough to send}} the fly to the target. The main difference between fly fishing and spin or bait fishing is that in fly fishing {{the weight of the}} line carries the hook through the air, whereas in spin and bait fishing the weight of the lure or sinker {{at the end of the}} monofilament or braided line gives casting distance. Artificial flies are of several types; some imitating an insect (either flying or swimming), others a <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> or crustacean, others attractors are known to attract fish although they look like nothing in nature. Flies can be made either to float or sink, and range in size from a few millimeters to 30cm long; most are between 1 and 5cm.|$|E
25|$|The yellowspotted {{trevally}} is {{of moderate}} importance to fisheries throughout its range, so catch statistics are rarely kept for this species specifically. One exception is Saudi Arabia, with the FAO reporting a yearly catch between 128 and 324 tonnes between 2000 and 2004, {{with no apparent}} trends in the catch data. The species is taken by hook and line, gill nets, and various traps. The yellowspotted trevally is of major importance to anglers and spearfishermen in some countries, with the species highly valued in Australia and South Africa. Surveys of recreational catches in the Pilbara region of Western Australia indicate around 5 tonnes of fish are taken every year, with around 3 tonnes kept for consumption or use as <b>bait.</b> <b>Fish</b> are mostly caught from boats using small baits including fish and crab, as well as lures, minnows, metal slugs, soft plastic lures, and even saltwater flies. It is an excellent gamefish, with young fish also considered good table fish, becoming somewhat dry with age. The yellowspotted trevally is also considered {{a good candidate for}} aquaculture in the future.|$|E

500|$|Humans {{introduced}} fish {{into the}} lake in the 1930s for sport fishing, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoliecas). [...] Trout were last released into Castle Lake in 2008 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife but recreational fish stocking has since ceased due to concern for other species [...] (i.e., threatened or endangered). The brook char was also originally stocked but now has become self-sustaining, and reproduces naturally in springs found {{on the eastern side}} of the lake. Golden shiner is a <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> minnow that was likely placed in the lake by anglers who left their remaining bait behind in the lake. The fish feed on zooplankton and insects; the fish are then eaten by predators around the lake, especially osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Other birds in the area include bald eagle (Haliaectus leucoephalus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), wood duck (Aix sponsa), belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon), Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stellere), and sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus).|$|E
