40|$|An {{explanation}} to the M. P. belt deterioration is proposed. It {{takes into account}} the strain of discharge to which the belt is submitted following the combination, first of a too high <b>belt</b> <b>charge</b> density in addition to the machine voltage contribution, second the geometrical configuration of the gradient rods which induces an inhomogeneous field and allows the belt to reach too high voltages not compatible with the particular Paschen curve. This explanation leads to define the concept of <b>belt</b> <b>charge</b> capability. The field configuration critical for a certain charge density also exists in other places. Different simple solutions are proposed to cure this problem and allow the M. P. belt to operate under normal electrical conditions...|$|R

50|$|Windmills first {{appeared}} in Europe during the Middle Ages. The earliest certain reference to a windmill in Europe (assumed to have been of the vertical type) dates from 1185, in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at {{the southern tip of}} the Wold overlooking the Humber estuary.

50|$|In 1957, Christofilos {{suggested}} that entrapment in the Earth's magnetic {{could be used}} deliberately to shape the spread of a nuclear weapon's betas. At first the concept was ignored. However, {{the launch of the}} Explorer I satellite in 1958 led to interesting anomalous readings that were determined to be due to what are now known as the Van Allen radiation <b>belts,</b> <b>charged</b> particles from the Sun that become trapped within the Earth's magnetic field. This led to panic within the defense establishment when some concluded that the Van Allen belts were not due to the Sun's particles, but secret Soviet high-altitude nuclear tests. Several follow-up launches were made to better characterize these belts, and the panic faded.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{instrumentation}} {{would report}} the expected cosmic ray count (approximately thirty counts per second) {{but sometimes it}} would show a peculiar zero counts per second.

Later, after Explorer 3, it was concluded that the original Geiger counter had been overwhelmed ("saturated") by strong radiation coming from a <b>belt</b> of <b>charged</b> particles trapped in space by the Earth's magnetic field.

50|$|Furnaces {{were not}} Wellman's only {{contribution}} to the steel industry. He was also instrumental {{in the development of}} the Hulett unloader, which allowed the unloading of taconite from the iron ore boats of the Great Lakes, particularly on Lake Erie. In addition to improvements on the Hulett unloader, other important inventions include an open hearth <b>charging</b> <b>machine</b> and a hydraulic crane. Following an unsuccessful venture with his half-brother, Wellman later founded the Wellman-Seaver-Morgan Engineering Company in Cleveland, Ohio, which continues under a different name to this day.|$|R

40|$|In the Van de Graaff {{accelerator}} LECH {{the deviation}} {{of the beam}} energy from the desired value is detected by the standard analysing system consisting of the 90 ° bending magnet followed {{by a pair of}} slits. The amplified error signal from that slits is used to correct the high voltage at the terminal. Corrections of the fast component of the voltage instability are made via the corona-triode and for the slow component via adjustment of the <b>belt</b> <b>charging</b> current. In order to determine the maximum gain factors providing the stable operating conditions we have adopted a definite transfer function for the aforementioned two loop stabilizer. Next we have applied this function to the analysis of the stability of the feedback system. Although the calculation was made for parameters of the accelerator LECH, the same method is easily applicable to other Van de Graaff accelerators...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT PID {{controller}} of {{servo control}} system maintains the gap between Electrode and workpiece in Electrical Dis- <b>charge</b> <b>Machining</b> (EDM). Capability of the controller is significant since machining process is a stochastic phenomenon and physical behaviour of the discharge is unpredictable. Therefore, a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller using Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is designed and applied to an EDM servo actuator system {{in order to find}} suitable gain parameters. Simulation results verify the capabilities and effectiveness of the DE algorithm to search the best configuration of PID gain to maintain the electrode position.

50|$|Carnegie Steel {{made major}} {{technological}} innovations in the 1880s, especially {{the installation of}} the open-hearth system at Homestead in 1886. It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for armor plate for the United States Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. In addition, the plant moved increasingly toward the continuous system of production. Carnegie installed vastly improved systems of material-handling, like overhead cranes, hoists, <b>charging</b> <b>machines,</b> and buggies. All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with less skilled workers. In response, the more-skilled union members reacted with a strike designed to protect their historic position.|$|R

LeeRoy Yarbrough ran a limited schedule during the 1971 season as Ford's factory were pulling out of NASCAR production at that time. This would force NASCAR teams using the Ford manufacturer to create vehicles by themselves with their in-house staff. Injuries sustained while practicing for that year's Indianapolis 500 contributed to the limited NASCAR schedule. He managed to shake off those injuries long enough to qualify in seventh place and finish in a lowly 34th place.|$|R
