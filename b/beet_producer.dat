50|$|As {{a result}} of the French {{advances}} in sugar beet production and processing made during the Napoleonic Wars, the beet sugar industry in Europe developed rapidly. A new tax levied in Germany in 1810 prompted the experimentation to increase the sugar content of the beet. This was because the tax assessed the value of the sugar beet crop based on the unprocessed weight of the sugar beet rather than the refined sugar produced from them. By 1812, Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Quéruel, working for the industrialist Benjamin Delessert, devised a process of sugar extraction suitable for industrial application. By 1837, France had become the largest sugar <b>beet</b> <b>producer</b> in the world, a position it continued to hold in the world even into 2010. By 1837, 542 factories in France were producing 35,000 tonnes of sugar. However, by 1880, Germany became the largest sugar beet to sugar producer in the world, since the German factories processed most of the sugar beets grown in eastern France.|$|E

50|$|By the 1850s, {{sugar beet}} {{production}} had reached Russia and Ukraine. This {{was made possible}} by the protection of the sugar beet industry by bounties, or subsidies, paid to <b>beet</b> sugar <b>producers</b> upon the export of their sugar by their respective governments. The protection provided to the sugar beet industry by these bounties caused drastic damage to the cane sugar industry and their grip on the British sugar market. The result was a reduction in the production of cane sugar, molasses and rum until 1915. During World War I, the widespread conflict destroyed large tracts of land that had served as sugar <b>beet</b> <b>producers</b> and repurposed much of the remaining sugar beet land for grain production.

The transmission varies vertically along the supply chain, horizontally among spatially linked markets, or among the markets of substitute products. The relevant point within the sugar industry is how sugar price variations are transmitted downstream {{to the price of}} sugar for consumption or goods containing sugar. Sugar beet processors play a special role in the implementation of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) which directly targets industrial products (sugar and its derivatives) to sustain sugar <b>beet</b> <b>producers.</b> The functioning of sugar CMO has been frequently questioned because of its potential influence on competition and sugar companies’ strategies. It might lead to the creation or strengthening of market power of processing companies {{to the detriment of the}} downstream stages of the supply chain and consumers, thus reducing consumer’s surplus (OECD 2007). Upstream the supply chain, the exertion of market power might theoretically hit <b>beet</b> <b>producers</b> (e.g. in case industrial oligopsony with market power occurs), thus reducing the effectiveness of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) measures on the setting of sugar beet price.

It can be improved by selection using retail beefy yield estimated breeding values, visual selection, cross breeding or myostatin gene markers. Higher yielding cattle have proportionately more muscle and less subcutaneous fat (Perry et al., 1993).

With continued selection for muscling, {{it is important that}} this negative correlation is monitored, as the physiological mechanisms under-pinning reduced adipose tissue and increased beef yield in highly muscled cattle are unclear. One possibility, however, may be via the key regulatory stress hormone adrenaline, which causes mobilisation of adipose triacylglycerol for energy production. Work in obese humans has demonstrated a reduced response to adrenaline in adipose tissue (Jocken and Blaak, 2008), which reduces lipolysis and thus potentiates obesity — the reverse may apply in lean animals. Therefore we hypothesise that selection for muscling will reduce fatness and increase lean meat yield, and increase the adipose tissue response to adrenaline...|$|R

In 1970, all nine processors in operation were invest-owned, however, by the 1980 s three producer-controlled firms had emerged. Today, all nine processors in operation are grower-owned (Reynolds, 2010). Interestingly, not only do these sugar beet processors share a similar class of owners (i. e. sugar beet growers), but these firms also share a common governance structure, known as the new generation cooperative model.

Our model results suggest that the ROW captures the largest share of the benefits (53 % of total welfare increase). The EU sugar industry absorbs the next largest share of the benefits (30 %), with the smallest share (17 %) accruing to seed suppliers and gene developers. Since EU intervention prices are exogenously fixed each year, EU consumers do not take part in the distribution of the gains from the innovation. However, consumers outside the EU necessarily gain due to the depressing effect of the technology on world sugar prices. The latter is costly for the cane growers in the ROW, while <b>beet</b> <b>producers</b> gain. Our results reveal an apparent contradiction. When modern (bio) technologies are introduced in commodity markets subject to obsolete trade policies, the natural flow of domestic benefits from the input industry, via farmers, to consumers is hampered and biased towards the producing sector (input industry, farmers, and processors), leaving domestic consumers unaffected. Remarkably, given the current Common Market Organization for sugar, consumers outside the EU gain while EU citizens continue to subsidize EU sugar production trough high sugar prices, despite the innovation.

It is {{the intention of the}} European Commission that they should not be renewed beyond that date, although this position is currently coming under renewed discussion. Three recent studies (LEI, 2010; European Commission, 2011 a; Nolte et al., 2012) have examined the effects of sugar quota abolition on the EU market and its trade position. These studies suggest that the net importer status of the EU would be maintained, although net imports decrease. However, there exist no studies investigating changes in bilateral trade flows between EU and third countries. This paper analyses the impacts of quota sugar cessation on the bilateral trade flows between the EU and third countries in 2020 against a reference scenario in which quotas remain in force. The study uses the partial equilibrium model CAPRI, which covers 77 countries grouped into 40 trade blocks. It models bilateral trade flows and bilateral trade measures between the various trade blocks. The results show that, with the expiry of EU sugar quotas, total EU sugar imports would be 43 % lower in 2020, while total EU sugar exports would decline by 16 %. Sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly. However, Brazil suffers loss of market share in third countries, notably in Africa, due to trade diversion. The net result is that, despite its strong comparative advantage in the production and marketing of sugar, Brazil suffers a welfare loss of EUR 40 million, whereas most other non-EU sugar-producing countries experience negligible welfare effects or small welfare gains. The largest welfare gain occurs in the EU (+EUR 845 million). JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R

The research has shown that the liquidation of sugar factory did not affect on the municipality economic situation, expressed by objective gauges. The expected increase in unemployment did not take place. People who have lost their jobs have found new employment or availed their right to retire.

Due to the narrowing markets and {{a decrease in}} the demands for sugar all together with the uncertainty and over-production of the processing industry, the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>producers</b> are very defenceless. The special technology of the sugar beet production gives an especial importance to this fact. There is not too much place fo changes for the farmers within the structure of the production costs, which has consequences in terms of both quality and volume. In the European Union, the sugar sector is highly regulated. The accession will lead us to a decades-old and solid state of the sugar production. For all member countries, unique and harmonised prices and export regulations exist. With the accession, the EU countries have the opportunity to target the markets of the newly joining countries, such as Hungary, with their surplus in sugar production. Therefore, it is in their interest to give as low quota as possible to the Hungarian sugar beet production. One key point of the regulations of the sugar production is the quota and its introduction in the production. For this reason and for the functioning CMO. s of the sugar beet sector, it is important to create and maintain an accurate and up-to-date database and the relating institutional background. The statistical and information system should cover - besides the data of the domestic production and processing and the international trade- the monitoring of the foreign markets and the whole of the agribusiness. The effectiveness of the production should improve even if a number of the farmers have to give up beet production. It is in significant the government´s responsibility to ensure these farmers´ safety of existence. By the time of the accession, reaching an average yield of 45 to 55 tons per hectare, the Hungarian sugar beet production will be competitive with the EU farmers. The current technical and agronomical level of the whole sector does not satisfy the EU requirements, however a number of producers are falling into line with the EU level. Another task is to improve the effectiveness of the processing plants that could lead to the elimination of the factories with small capacity. In that case, additional attention should be paid on the sugar beet farmers and alternatives should be offered by the winding up concerns...|$|R
