5|$|Houston {{learned of}} the Goliad {{massacre}} on April 3. Unaware that Secretary of War Rusk was already en route to Groce's with orders from President Burnet to halt the army's retreat and engage the enemy, he relayed the Goliad news <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> to Rusk.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} called before the Supreme Court on March 17, 1862. Attorney General Edward Bates {{announced}} that he was delegating the argument to U.S. Attorney Keasbey. Jackalow's attorney was not present, and, <b>by</b> <b>letter,</b> requested a postponement. No postponement was forthcoming, and Reverdy Johnson volunteered to argue for Jackalow.|$|E
5|$|Busch did {{not remain}} in Frankfurt. Towards {{the end of}} the 1860s he alternated between Wiedensahl and Lüthorst, and Wolfenbüttel where his brother Gustav lived. The {{association}} with Johanna Kessler lasted five years, and after his return to Wiedensahl in 1872 they communicated <b>by</b> <b>letter.</b> This contact was interrupted between 1877 and 1891, after which it was revived with the help of Kessler's daughters.|$|E

5|$|Cominco {{had been}} {{involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the Canadian National Research Council inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July 1941 <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> from Taylor that offered a National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 a pound.|$|E
5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version {{of the country in}} which it was written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> A.|$|E

50|$|He was {{nominated}} Bishop of Killala and Achonry on 24 January 1717 and consecrated on 12 May that year. In 1720 he was translated to Elphin, being nominated on 1 May and appointed <b>by</b> <b>letters</b> patent on 12 May 1720. In 1724 he {{was nominated}} on 17 March to be the Bishop of Derry and appointed <b>by</b> <b>letters</b> patent on 9 April 1724.

5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson's reign {{was not a}} long one. In 1250, {{the chronicle}} records that he was summoned <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> to the Norwegian royal court because Hákon was displeased at how Haraldr Guðrøðarson had wrongfully seized the kingship which was not his by right. The chronicle notes that the Norwegian king {{intended}} that Haraldr Guðrøðarson should never return to Mann, and he was consequently kept from returning to the island-kingdom. Nothing further is heard from him.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the town}} was {{featured}} {{as the title of}} the fourth album Keynsham by the Bonzo Dog Band. The title was chosen in honour of Horace Batchelor, who had been referenced in previous Bonzo Dog Band recordings. In the early 1960s, Batchelor became known through his regular advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for his football pools prediction service. When giving his contact address, he would slowly spell out 'Keynsham' letter <b>by</b> <b>letter,</b> and this became an amusing feature for many young listeners.|$|E
5|$|Knox {{knew that}} the Queen Regent would ask for help from France. So he {{negotiated}} <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> under the assumed name John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast of England {{at the end of}} July, to meet James Croft and Sir Henry Percy at Berwick upon Tweed. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.|$|E

5|$|The initial vigour and {{excitement}} {{he brought to}} the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine <b>by</b> <b>letter,</b> he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E

It lit up the name EDISON letter <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> in sequence when a set of switches were turned on by hand – {{one at a time}} in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at the Crystal Palace in London. The lamp bulbs in this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this case.|$|E
5|$|Writing to Samsu, Nurbaya {{tells him}} that they can never be together. However, after {{surviving}} Meringgih's increasingly violent outbursts, she runs away to Batavia to be with Samsu. They fall in love again. Upon receiving a letter regarding her father's death, Nurbaya hurries back to Padang, where she dies after unwittingly eating a cake poisoned by Meringgih's men on his orders. Receiving news of her death <b>by</b> <b>letter,</b> Samsu seemingly commits suicide.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the Bourbon Restoration, Lafayette lent his support to a number of conspiracies in France and other European countries, all of which came to nothing. He was {{involved}} in the various Charbonnier plots, and agreed to go to the city of Belfort, where there was a garrison of French troops, and assume a major role in the revolutionary government. Warned that the royal government had found out about the conspiracy, he turned back on the road to Belfort, avoiding overt involvement. More successfully, he supported the Greek Revolution beginning in 1821, and <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> attempted to persuade American officials to ally with the Greeks. Louis' government considered arresting both Lafayette and Georges Washington, who was also involved in the Greek efforts, but were wary of the political ramifications if they did. Lafayette remained a member of the restored Chamber of Deputies until 1823, when new plural voting rules helped defeat his bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes incapacitated, then the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms, and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify the lieutenant governor, who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly <b>by</b> <b>letter.</b> The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If the office of the lieutenant governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded <b>by</b> <b>letter,</b> relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E

5|$|In Victoria {{groups of}} {{locomotives}} {{of the same}} design are classed together <b>by</b> <b>letter,</b> in a system introduced in 1886. Initially low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, in a continuous number block which is unique to the class. In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, {{and in some cases}} there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the same class letter. In addition, some classes start the number series with a 0, while others start with a 1.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle {{to search}} with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E
5|$|Special {{procedures}} {{apply to}} legislation {{passed by the}} Tynwald of the Isle of Man. Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified <b>by</b> <b>letter</b> to the governor. After 1765, {{the equivalent of the}} royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.|$|E
