40|$|Solving {{relevant}} biological problems requires answering complex questions. Addressing {{such questions}} traditionally implied {{the design of}} time-consuming experimental procedures {{which most of the}} time are not accessible to average-sized laboratories. The current trend is to move towards a multidisciplinary approach integrating both theoretical knowledge and experimental work. This combination creates a powerful tool for shedding light on biological problems. To illustrate this concept, we present here a descriptive example of where computational methods were shown to be a key aspect in detecting crucial players in an important biological problem: the dimerization of chemokine receptors. Using evolutionary based sequence analysis in combination with structural predictions two CCR 5 residues were selected as important for dimerization and further validated experimentally.

40|$|Motivation: The {{advent of}} {{sequencing}} and structural genomics projects {{has provided a}} dramatic boost {{in the number of}} uncharacterized protein structures and sequences. Consequently, many computational tools have been developed to help elucidate protein function. However, such services are spread throughout the world, often with standalone web pages.

40|$|Here {{we present}} a full {{overview}} of the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP 7) function prediction category. Predictions were submitted for Gene Ontology molecular function terms, Enzyme Commission numbers, and ligand binding site residues. The first two categories were difficult to assess because very little new functional information becomes available after the experiment. The majority of the known Gene Ontology terms and all the Enzyme Commission numbers were available a priori to predictors before the experiment, so prediction for these two categories was not blind. Nevertheless, for Gene Ontology terms {{we were able to}} demonstrate that some groups made better predictions than others. In the binding residue category, the predictors did not know in advance which ligands were bound and therefore blind evaluation was possible, but there were disappointingly few predictions in this category. After CASP 6 and 7 the need to organize a more effective blind function prediction category is obvious, even if it means focusing on binding site prediction as the only category that can be truly assessed in the CASP spirit.

Co-evolution has an {{important}} function {{in the evolution of}} species and it is clearly manifested in certain scenarios such as host–parasite and predator–prey interactions, symbiosis and mutualism. The extrapolation of the concepts and methodologies developed for the study of species co-evolution at the molecular level has prompted the development of a variety of computational methods able to predict protein interactions through the characteristics of co-evolution. Particularly successful have been those methods that predict interactions at the genomic level based on the detection of pairs of protein families with similar evolutionary histories (similarity of phylogenetic trees: mirrortree). Future advances in this field will require {{a better understanding of the}} molecular basis of the co-evolution of protein families. Thus, it will be important to decipher the molecularmechanisms underlying the similarity observed in phylogenetic trees of interacting proteins, distinguishing direct specific molecular interactions from other general functional constraints. In particular, it will be important to separate the effects of physical interactions within protein complexes (‘co-adaptation’) from other forces that, in a less specific way, can also create general patterns of co-evolution.

40|$|Deciphering {{the whole}} network of protein {{interactions}} {{for a given}} proteome (interactome) {{is the goal of}} many experimental and computational efforts in Systems Biology. Separately the prediction of the structure of protein complexes by docking methods is a well-established scientific area. To date, docking programs have not been used to predict interaction partners. We provide a proof of principle for such an approach. Using a set of protein complexes representing known interactors in their unbound form, we show that a standard docking program can distinguish the true interactors from a background of 922 non-redundant potential interactors. We additionally show that true interactions can be distinguished from non-likely interacting proteins within the same structural family. Our approach may be put {{in the context of the}} proposed funnel-energy model; the docking algorithm may not find the native complex, but it distinguishes binding partners because of the higher probability of favourable models compared with a collection of non-binders. The potential exists to develop this proof of principle into new approaches for predicting interaction partners and reconstructing biological networks. © 2011 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Background] The {{environmental}} {{sequencing of}} the Sargasso Sea {{has introduced a}} huge new resource of genomic information. Unlike the protein sequences held in the current searchable databases, the Sargasso Sea sequences originate from a single marine environment and have been sequenced from species that are not easily obtainable by laboratory cultivation. The resource also contains very many fragments of whole protein sequences, {{a side effect of}} the shotgun sequencing method. These sequences form a significant addendum to the current searchable databases but also present us with some intrinsic difficulties. While {{it is important to know}} whether it is possible to assign function to these sequences with the current methods and whether they will increase our capacity to explore sequence space, it is also interesting to know how current bioinformatics techniques will deal with the new sequences in the resource. [Results] The Sargasso Sea sequences seem to introduce a bias that decreases the potential of current methods to propose structure and function for new proteins. In particular the high proportion of sequence fragments in the resource seems to result in poor quality multiple alignments. [Conclusion] These observations suggest that the new sequences should be used with care, especially if the information is to be used in large scale analyses. On a positive note, the results may just spark improvements in computational and experimental methods to take into account the fragments generated by environmental sequencing techniques.

Recoding UGA Sec {{requires}} a complex mechanism, comprising the cis-acting SECIS RNA hairpin in the 3 ′UTR of selenoprotein mRNAs, and trans-acting factors. Among these, the SECIS Binding Protein 2 (SBP 2) {{is central to}} the mechanism. SBP 2 has been so far functionally characterized only in rats and humans. In this work, we report the characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster SBP 2 (dSBP 2). Despite its shorter length, it retained the same selenoprotein synthesis-promoting capabilities as the mammalian counterpart. However, a major difference resides in the SECIS recognition pattern: while human SBP 2 (hSBP 2) binds the distinct form 1 and 2 SECIS RNAs with similar affinities, dSBP 2 exhibits high affinity toward form 2 only. In addition, we report the identification of a K (lysine) -rich domain in all SBP 2 s, essential for SECIS and 60 S ribosomal subunit binding, differing from the well-characterized L 7 Ae RNA-binding domain. Swapping only five amino acids between dSBP 2 and hSBP 2 in the K-rich domain conferred reversed SECIS-binding properties to the proteins, thus unveiling an important sequence for form 1 binding.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{version of}} this article is the complete one and can be found online at: [URL] It has repeatedly been shown that interacting protein families tend to have similar phylogenetic trees. These similarities can be used to predicting the mapping between two families of interacting proteins (i. e. which proteins from one family interact with which members of the other). The correct mapping will be that which maximizes the similarity between the trees. The two families may eventually comprise orthologs and paralogs, if members of the two families are present in more than one organism. This fact can be exploited to restrict the possible mappings, simply by impeding links between proteins of different organisms. We present here an algorithm to predict the mapping between families of interacting proteins which is able to incorporate information regarding orthologues, or any other assignment of proteins to "classes" that may restrict possible mappings. [Results] For the first time in methods for predicting mappings, we have tested this new approach on a large number of interacting protein domains in order to statistically assess its performance. The method accurately predicts around 80 % in the most favourable cases. We also analysed in detail the results of the method for a well defined case of interacting families, the sensor and kinase components of the Ntr-type two-component system, for which up to 98 % of the pairings predicted by the method were correct. [Conclusion] Based on the well established relationship between tree similarity and interactions we developed a method for predicting the mapping between two interacting families using genomic information alone.

40|$|Background: Molecular {{biology is}} {{currently}} facing the challenging task of functionally characterizing the proteome. The {{large number of}} possible protein-protein interactions and complexes, the variety of environmental conditions and cellular states in which these interactions can be reorganized, and the multiple ways in which a protein can influence the function of others, requires the development of experimental and computational approaches to analyze and predict functional associations between proteins {{as part of their}} activity in the interactome. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have studied the possibility of constructing a classifier in order to combine the output of the several protein interaction prediction methods. The AODE (Averaged One-Dependence Estimators) machine learning algorithm is a suitable choice in this case and it provides better results than the individual prediction methods, and it has better performances than other tested alternative methods in this experimental set up. To illustrate the potential use of this new AODE-based Predictor of Protein InterActions (APPIA), when analyzing high-throughput experimental data, we show how it helps to filter the results of published High-Throughput proteomic studies, ranking in a significant way functionally related pairs. Availability: All the predictions of the individual methods and of the combined APPIA predictor, together with the used datasets of functional associations are available at [URL] Conclusions: We propose a strategy that integrates the main current computational techniques used to predict functional associations into a unified classifier system, specifically focusing on the evaluation of poorly characterized protein pairs. We selected the AODE classifier as the appropriate tool to perform this task. AODE is particularly useful to extract valuable information from large unbalanced and heterogeneous data sets. The combination of the information provided by five prediction interaction prediction methods with some simple sequence features in APPIA is useful in establishing reliability values and helpful to prioritize functional interactions that can be further experimentally characterized.

One of the main bottlenecks in the processing of new entries is the evaluation of 'borderline' cases by human curators {{with reference to the}} literature, and better tools for helping both expert and non-expert users quickly identify relevant functional information from text are urgently needed. A text based method for protein classification is presented, which complements the existing sequence and structure-based approaches, especially in cases exhibiting low similarity to existing members and requiring manual intervention. The method {{is based on the assumption}} that textual similarity between sets of documents relating to proteins reflects biological function similarities and can be exploited to make classification decisions. RESULTS: An optimal strategy for the text comparisons was identified by using an established gold standard enzyme dataset. Filtering of the abstracts using a machine learning approach to discriminate sentences containing functional, structural and classification information that are relevant to the protein classification task improved performance. Testing this classification scheme on a dataset of 'borderline' protein domains that lack significant sequence or structure similarity to classified proteins showed that although, as expected, the structural similarity classifiers perform better on average, there is a significant benefit in incorporating text similarity in logistic regression models, indicating significant orthogonality in this additional information. Coverage was significantly increased especially at low error rates, which is important for routine classification tasks: 15. 3 % for the combined structure and text classifier compared to 10 % for the structural classifier alone, at 10 - 3 error rate. Finally when only the highest scoring predictions were used to infer classification, an extra 4. 2 % of correct decisions were made by the combined classifier. CONCLUSION: We have described a simple text based method to classify protein domains that demonstrates an improvement over existing methods. The method is unique in incorporating structural and text based classifiers directly and is particularly useful in cases where inconclusive evidence from sequence or structure similarity requires laborious manual classification.
