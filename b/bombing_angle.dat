5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to dialling in four settings. Two of {{these could be}} set before the mission; the altitude of the target above sea level and the terminal velocity of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on that mission. The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting <b>bombing</b> <b>angle</b> in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and <b>bombing</b> <b>angle</b> (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5000|$|Altitude was set {{by moving}} a lever fore-and-aft against a scale, which rotated the {{foresight}} fore or aft, setting {{one half of}} the sight's <b>bombing</b> <b>angle.</b> Behind the altitude setting was an airspeed scale and a wheel to finely select the airspeed. This moved the backsights fore or aft to account for {{the other half of the}} sight's [...] "range angle". In this respect the Drift Sight was similar to earlier bombsight designs.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, the {{new design}} also removed all of the {{calculation}} system of the bombsight {{in order to make}} it fit on the platform. Instead, the bomb aimer had to use manual slide rule calculators to find the drift and <b>bombing</b> <b>angles,</b> and then set the bombsight to these values. The bombsight was unable to quickly adapt to changes in direction or altitude, and in this case was even slower to calculate such changes. Very few of the Mk. XI designs were produced.|$|R
50|$|The Arlesey <b>Bomb</b> is an <b>angling</b> weight {{developed}} by Richard Walker {{at the lake}} in Arlesey. Walker fished for perch in the lake, and very large perch could {{be caught in the}} deepest water. The Arlesey Bomb was developed to allow him to cast the long distances required. It is tear-shaped, with a loop at the top to attach the line. Its shape makes it aerodynamic to cast, but unlikely to snag on the river or lake bottom. The incorporation of a swivel also prevented the line getting twisted.|$|R
40|$|Question {{has been}} raised about the {{possible}} impact sea state which may have {{on the performance of}} the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Assault Breaching System (JABS) in the very shallow water (VSW) regime (depth up to 40 ft). We investigated the wave effect on underwater bomb trajectory. We will present: (1) development of {{a new version of the}} NPS 6 DOF model with the capability to predict the bomb maneuvering in the water column due to sloping surface, (2) analysis on the underwater bomb trajectory and orientation due to wave propagation, (3) determination of the wave effect on the bomb trajectory, and (4) calculation of the probability distribution function of the bomb position due to various sea-state. For VSW regions, the bottom topography affects the waves dramatically and causes a significant change in surface slope, which changes the <b>bomb</b> impact <b>angle,</b> and then the bomb trajectory. Such effect is still important when application of JABS is to shallow water (SW) and deep water (DW) ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{adjustment}} also automatically moved sights at {{the front}} of the bombsight fore and aft, directly setting the bombsight to calculate the drift of the bombs due to the measured wind. Two sights were used, one for bombing directly upwind, and another for bombing directly downwind. The timing of the drop was set by dialling in the measured air speed, which moved the entire sighting system fore or aft, carrying the two [...] "backsights" [...] along with it (as well as the drift bar mechanism). Setting the altitude moved the foresight, below the backlights, setting the correct <b>bombing</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bombsights are {{sighting}} {{devices that}} are pointed {{in a particular}} direction, or aimed. Although the solution outlined above returns a point in space, simple trigonometry {{can be used to}} convert this point into an angle relative to the ground. The bombsight is then set to indicate that angle. The bombs are dropped when the target passes through the sights. The distance between the aircraft and target at that moment is the range, so this angle {{is often referred to as}} the range angle, although dropping angle, aiming angle, <b>bombing</b> <b>angle</b> and similar terms are often used as well. In practice, some or all of these calculations are carried out using angles and not points in space, skipping the final conversion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main event}} was the [...] "Inaugural Brawl", a no {{disqualification}} ten-man tag team match between Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) and Rhyno (Team WCW/ECW), and Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, The Undertaker, Kane and Chris Jericho (Team WWF). WCW Owner Shane McMahon, ECW Owner Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, ECW General Manager Paul Heyman, and WWF Owner Vince McMahon were at ringside. The Undertaker attacked Page during his entrance, and all wrestlers fought at ringside. The match began with Team WWF having the advantage as Austin dominated Rhyno. Team WCW/ECW gained the advantage after Page performed a hangman to The Undertaker. Team WCW/ECW dominated The Undertaker until he performed a DDT. Team WWF kept the advantage until Booker performed a flapjack to Jericho {{with help from}} D-Von. Jericho fought back, knocking down the Dudley Boyz, and tagged in Angle. Angle fought the Dudley Boyz until Bubba Ray performed a Bubba <b>Bomb.</b> <b>Angle</b> was dominated by Team WCW/ECW until The Undertaker came in illegally, and attacked Page.All wrestlers entered the ring, and fought. The Undertaker fought with Page, and, after performed a chokeslam, they fought into the crowd. Austin was down holding his knee as Booker and Angle were lying in the ring. On the outside, Kane was double-teamed by the Dudley Boyz. Kane eventually fought back, performing a chokeslam to D-Von through the announce table. Bubba Ray and Rhyno then sent Kane through the other announce table with a double suplex. Jericho then sent Rhyno through {{a table with a}} shoulder block from the apron. In the ring, Bubba Ray and Booker double-teamed Angle until Angle fought back, performing a German suplex to Booker, and an Angle Slam to Bubba Ray. Angle attempted to apply the ankle lock on Booker, but Booker kicked him into the referee. Booker then performed a flapjack, and all three were down. Vince got the WWF Championship belt, and attempted to throw it to Angle. Shane took it, and hit Vince with it. Shane failed to hit Angle, and Angle threw both Shane and Bubba Ray out of the ring. Angle performed an Angle Slam on Booker, and applied the ankle lock. After sending the referee back in the ring, Austin turned on Team WWF by performing a Stone Cold Stunner to Angle. Booker then pinned Angle to win the match for Team WCW/ECW. After the match, Austin celebrated with Shane, Stephanie and Heyman.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} impact tests {{was carried out}} with 1 to 4. 5 and 1 to 5. 8 scaled inert AP and MK-bomb models against {{homogeneous}} and layered structures of concrete and sand targets. The subscale tests were performed {{to reduce the number}} of full-scale tests, to check the influence of several test parameters and the validity of scaled test results. The impact tests were carried out in the EMI proving ground impact range. The projectiles were launched from a 100 mm cal. smooth bore gun with sabots fabricated from hard styrofoam and polyethelene. In the test program, the following parameters were varied: type of projectiles, AP 2000 and MK 84 scaled <b>bomb</b> models, the <b>angle</b> of incidence, 0 degree and 30 degree Nato, the target structure, reinforced concrete slab and layered structures of concrete and sand, and the impact velocity from 135 m/s to 240 m/s. The experimental results indicated a good agreement with the full-scale test...|$|R

50|$|Once crews {{had reached}} the target area they would find it marked. The first method of target-marking was the Ablauflinie (final approach) method. It was used only when the target was fully visible. The {{pathfinder}} would mark the area using incendiary <b>bombs</b> at right <b>angles</b> to the approach and six kilometres {{from the edge of}} the planned aiming point. The crews then made a timed bomb-run when level with this (visual) line. The initial waves unloaded incendiaries on the lateral fringes of the target area to supplement the pathfinder flares. If the airspace was semi-over cast or when cloud cover was no greater than 6/10ths, a different tactic was used. Seven alternating white and coloured flares would be released along the approaches. As before, the distance of the line's start point was to be six kilometres from the target area. Each pilot was to use a target marker as their aiming point. The pilot glided to approach and released the bombs via stop-watch; the time of delay was decided at the briefing. This was known as the Leuchtpfad (path of light) method.|$|R
25|$|Sunny soon {{left the}} team and Droz, then known as Puke (Darren Drozdov, a former {{defensive}} end for the Denver Broncos who earned the name Puke when caught vomiting on Monday Night Football), started to accompany them to the ring. At the same time, Paul Ellering returned, but sided with the Disciples of Apocalypse (DOA), whom LOD were feuding with at the time; Ellering and Animal explained on the DVD {{it was hard for}} them to rip on each other on promos. For the second {{time in the history of}} the Road Warriors they participated in a storyline where tension arose between the members, teasing a break up. In this storyline, Hawk was seen by his partner Animal as unfit to wrestle and Puke was tapped to take Hawk's place in the tag team as an official member. The angle played off Hegstrand’s real life alcohol and drug issues, going so far as to faking a suicide jump off the top of the TitanTron. After the <b>angle</b> <b>bombed</b> and both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis voiced their objections to it, the angle was dropped. The Legion of Doom made a very brief return, first on the March 22, 1999 Raw is War by attacking Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco in a backstage skit after the two impersonated LOD in a handicap match against Shane McMahon, on the March 15, 1999 Raw is War. Both LOD entered the pre-WrestleMania battle royal with the last two participants getting a tag team title shot later at WrestleMania XV but both came up short. They would make one final appearance on the March 29, 1999 Raw challenging Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett for the tag team titles but failed them; they left the WWF afterwards.|$|R
