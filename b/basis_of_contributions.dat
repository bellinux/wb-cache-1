40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate quantitatively the turnover of serum triacylglycerol (triglyceride) in the starved rat and to determine whether serum triacylglycerol recycled to liver contributes a significant {{fraction of the total}} hepatic triacylglycerol turnover. Serum was labelled in vitro with [3 H]trioleoylglycerol (glycerol [3 H]trioleate) to provide uniform labelling of all lipoprotein species. By using the curves describing disappearance of isotope from serum and its appearance in liver, rate constants for movement of triacylglycerol out of serum (0. 29 min- 1) and the uptake of serum triacylglycerol by liver (0. 22 min- 1) were calculated. The total rate of movement (flux) of triacylglycerol in these processes, the product of rate constant and serum pool size, was calculated to be 0. 39 and 0. 29 mg/min per 100 g body wt. respectively. A model is postulated for whole-body triacylglycerol metabolism consistent with the present data as well as most observations in the literature. From the model it can be predicted that: (1) the entire turnover of liver triacylglycerol in the starved rat can be accounted for on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> from serum non-esterified fatty acid and serum triacylglycerol; (2) the entire turnover of the serum triacylglycerol pool can be accounted for quantitatively on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> from intestine and liver; (3) the release rate for triacylglycerol from liver should be 0. 34 to 0. 35 mg/min per 100 g body wt.; (4) triacylglycerol synthesized by liver from non-esterified fatty acid of serum and by intestine can account quantitatively for the irreversible disposal rate of triacylglycerol from serum...|$|E

40|$|Aquaculture {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{productions}} and the value of aquaculture is now about to pass the value of capture fisheries. Among the Nordic countries, Norway in particular has been able to create a large aquaculture industry with high growth rates over a number of years. The other Nordic countries have only had limited growth, but have a high unutilised potential. There is a need to identify opportunities and limitations for increased growth with due care for sustainability and environment. This report identifies seven focus areas with special potential for creation of a sustainable, competitive Nordic aquaculture sector. These areas are new feeds, better use and reuse of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon), value adding of by-products, technological and regional development, domestication of new species and reduction of energy consumption. The aquaculture sector with its strengths and weaknesses is described for each of the Nordic countries. The report is compiled on <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> from a Nordic group of experts.

40|$|Climate change poses a {{significant}} threat to almost all humans. The combat {{against it and}} the provision of measures to ameliorate the most dramatic impacts from climate change contribute to the provision of a global public good. Its complexity implies manifold uncertainties from scientific as well as policy-making points of view. Nether do we exactly know how and when climate change will cause damaging impacts nor can we predict future consequences of our actual choices. Preference formation is thereby heavily biased far from perfect. This paper, therefore, discusses social learning as an approach to reduce these uncertainties and to facilitate the policy process by allowing actors to form their preferences on a better knowledge base. It first develops a conceptual approach to the study of social learning phenomena on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> from economics, political science and management studies. Second, this framework will be applied to a case study of one particular social actor in the field of international climate policy, namely the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This scientific assessment body will be analyzed with regard to its learning processes and the implications for the policy process at large. Findings show that moments of crisis as well as the existence of a small network of highly committed individuals in the core functions, functioning communication structures, and the existence of mechanisms for reflection helped the social learning processes to emerge. 1...|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{techniques}} {{were applied to}} the study of dielectric properties of phosphate glasses on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> from permanent and induced dipolar polarization of local structural units interacting with the electrical component of the electromagnetic radiation. The dielectric constant of the selected glass system (100 -x) (50 P(2) O(5) center dot 25 Li(2) O center dot 25 Na(2) O) center dot xFe(2) O(3), where 0 <= x <= 21 is in mol%, was measured using a microwave setup assembled to measure the phase shift of the standing wave pattern produced by the insertion of the sample. It is shown that the Fe 2 + ions contribute effectively to the dielectric constant, as expected from the interactions of the dipoles of the local charge compensation pairs with the microwave radiation. However, there is the possibility of occurrence of some ions Fe 3 +, in general, at low iron content, which reinforces the glass structure and, therefore, decreases the dielectric constant. There is a gradual conversion from Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + as the iron ions increases. This is possibly the reason of the anomaly in the dielectric constant values observed in the results. These assumptions can be checked by results of electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical absorption (OA). The dielectric constant of the glasses studied in this work was found to increase with the temperature in the range of 25 - 330 degrees C. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Although copper is quantitatively {{removed from}} fungal laccase (Polyporus versicolor) by {{extended}} dialysis against {{high concentrations of}} cyanide, we {{have been unable to}} reconstitute the protein by addition of Cu(I) ions. However, two new methods for reversibly removing the type 2 Cu centre have been developed. The visible absorption at 610 nm, which is attributable to type 1 Cu, is unaffected by the procedure, but the absorbance of the type 3 Cu at 330 nm is decreased by 60 +/- 10 %. The decrease is due, at least in part, to partial reduction of the binuclear type 3 centre, although there may be some change in the molar absorptivity of the oxidized chromophore as well. The change in the c. d. spectrum that occurs at approx. 350 nm may be explained in the same way, but it may also reflect the loss of a signal due to the type 2 Cu. Upon removal of the type 2 Cu an absorbance increase appears at approx. 435 nm, and it is assigned to the semi-reduced form of the type 3 pair. In the e. p. r. spectrum of the type 2 -depleted enzyme the type 1 Cu signal exhibits well-resolved ligand hyperfine splitting, which can be simulated on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> from two N and two H nuclei (AH congruent to AN congruent to 25 MHz). The H atoms are assumed to be attached to the beta-carbon of the covalently bonded cysteine ligand. A signal from a semi-reduced form(s) of the type 3 site can also be resolved in the spectrum of the type 2 -depleted enzyme, and {{on the basis of the}} second integral of the e. p. r. spectrum 40 % of the type 3 pairs are believed to be in a partially reduced state. The semi-reduced type 3 site is remarkably stable and is not readily oxidized by H 2 O 2 or IrCl 6 (2 -) or reduced by Fe(CN) 6 (4 -). Intramolecular electron transfer is apparently quite slow in at least some forms of the type 2 -depleted enzyme, and this may explain why the activity is at best 5 % of that of the native enzyme. Full activity returns when type 2 copper is restored...|$|E
40|$|This {{compendium}} contains twenty - nine refereed papers written over {{a period}} of just over forty years between 1963 and 2004. Of the total, twenty - three are full papers and six are short papers. Eighteen of them were published in international journals and eleven appeared in Australian journals. Eighteen are single author papers written by the candidate and in the remaining eleven, authorship is shared with two or more others. In instances where there are multiple authors I have indicated the portion that I claim as my own contribution. To some extent this must necessarily be subjective; joint authors engaged in a common enterprise will usually discuss their work as it proceeds and afterwards it is not always easy to pinpoint exactly who was responsible for what amid the synergy of their interaction. The common thread that binds the papers is engineering electromagnetics and in most instances they directly address topics in either the guided and unguided wave domains, although in three instances the connection is more derivative. During my professional career I have produced a considerable number of limited circulation reports either for use within the agency in which I was employed or as the deliverables in contracts for which the agency had been contracted, {{as well as a number}} of conference papers. Of these two classes I no longer have any accurate record but a number of the papers later formed the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> to the refereed literature. Those offered for examination here are about half that number. I have subdivided the papers over nine sections bound together by some common sub - theme. A brief review is provided by way of introduction to each section and preceding each paper I have added some further comments. In these I have attempted not to simply restate information better accessed by reading the paper itself but to set it in context with other work and to indicate what its contribution to the technology of the time of its writing is seen to have been. This is of some importance in a compendium that spans so long a time. What is state of the art at one time is bedded down technology at some later date or its importance has been eclipsed by the appearance of other radically newer approaches. It is, however, the candidate ' s hope to be judged at least in part on the basis of the significance of the work at the time of its publication. Independently of the category into which I have placed any paper, a general aim that I have tried to carry with me in all my work is as close an appeal to physical principles as possible and not treat problems as solely mathematical exercises. How successful this has been is, of course, for others to judge. However it is only seldom that any real world problem can be solved without simplifying approximations and, particularly where the aim is understanding, simplicity is frequently at least as important as accuracy. Papers that appear in this compendium have been chosen to illustrate these aims. Thesis (D. E.) [...] School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2004...|$|E
