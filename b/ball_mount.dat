5|$|T-26 mod. 1939 in the Parola Tank Museum, (Finland): the Finnish war-time {{modernization}} (Finnish tactical number Ps164–7); a hull from a KhT-133 flame-throwing {{tank with}} a mounted turret from the T-26 mod. 1938/1939 and a <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> for the DT tank machine gun in a hull front armoured plate.|$|E
25|$|M3 TCM-20 – M3/M5 Half-Tracks {{fitted with}} the Israeli TCM-20 {{armament}} turret with two 20mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon fitted to old Maxson turrets. The right hand vision port was often {{replaced with a}} <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> for a machine gun. They proved to be very effective fighting anti-tank missile teams, their cannons would at least keep the teams under cover or suppress them so they could not use their missiles effectively.|$|E
25|$|The Finns modernized their T-26s in 1942–1943. Eight T-26 mod. 1931 tanks {{received}} turrets {{from the}} single-turreted T-26 or BT tanks. Additionally, turrets from irreparable T-26s or BTs of different models were mounted on KhT-26s, KhT-130s and KhT-133s, which had flame-throwing equipment removed. A <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> for the DT tank machine gun was installed {{on some of}} these tanks in the front armoured plate of the underturret box. In addition, some Finnish T-26s had a modified driver's hatch opened to the left as well as a different kit of spare parts tools, and many tanks were equipped with a special rear beam for towing guns and damaged vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|... 1921 Indian Pattern - {{based on}} the 1920 Pattern. Had {{extended}} hull armour to provide extra space and a domed turret with four <b>ball</b> <b>mounts</b> for machine guns.|$|R
500|$|Besides {{the machine}} gun mounted {{coaxially}} to the main gun, there were three [...]30 cal. machine guns in the hull. One was mounted in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> {{in front of the}} bow gunner. The other two were mounted in fixed sponson mounts. The machine guns were fired by the driver; they were aimed by pointing the entire tank at the desired target. Another [...]30 cal machine gun was normally mounted {{on the top of the}} turret for anti-aircraft defense.|$|E
500|$|The driver sat on {{the right}} side of the tank using a [...] {{observation}} port protected by [...] of bulletproof glass and an armoured shutter [...] thick. To his right was a vision slit [...] with a similar thickness of bulletproof glass. The Germans replaced the original three colored lights used by the Czechs to communicate with the driver with an intercom system. The radio operator {{sat on the}} left and had his own [...] observation port with the same protection as the driver's. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull. The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> capable of 30° of traverse, 25° of elevation and depressing up to 10°. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armoured trough. The mount had a spotting telescope, but open sights could be used if the plug at the top of the <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> was removed. If necessary, the driver could lock the mount into position and fire it himself using a Bowden cable. The driver's hatch was exposed to direct fire and could be damaged from the front.|$|E
500|$|T-26 {{with the}} A-43 turret: {{artillery}} T-26 or [...] "tank of fire support" [...] with a turret developed by self-taught inventor N. Dyrenkov at the Experimental Design Office of the Department of Mechanization and Motorization of the RKKA (UMM RKKA). Two types of turrets, {{armed with the}} 76mm regimental gun mod. 1927 and DT tank machine gun in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount,</b> were assembled by the Izhora Factory. They were partially pressed and welded. The first variety was installed on the T-26 mod. 1931 in February 1932 and the second type was used in November 1932 (in the last case, the rear armoured plate of underturret box was made sloping).|$|E
40|$|The nonrepetitive runout (NRRO) {{value of}} {{retainer}} revolution is caused mainly by the diameter differences of <b>balls</b> <b>mounted</b> in a bearing. Additionally, {{when more than}} one ball has diameter difference, the NRRO value of retainer revolution is believed to vary with the location of balls. In this study, the authors theoretically analyzed the NRRO value of retainer revolution considering the diameter differences and location of <b>balls</b> <b>mounted</b> in a bearing. Consequently, it is clarified that the mean value of the retainer revolution component calculated in all locations of balls decreased with increasing number of balls in a rolling bearing...|$|R
50|$|In September 1943 all {{surviving}} Ferdinands were recalled to be modified. 48 of the 50 surviving {{vehicles were}} modified with additional armour, a new commanders cupola (from StuG III) {{and a new}} <b>ball</b> <b>mounted</b> machine gun.|$|R
5000|$|Ball {{transfer}} {{units are}} omnidirectional load-bearing spherical <b>balls</b> <b>mounted</b> inside a restraining fixture. They are identical {{in principle to}} a computer trackball (pointing device). Typically the design involves a single large ball supported by smaller ball bearings.|$|R
500|$|The LT vz. 34 was {{assembled}} from {{a framework}} of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams, to which armor plates were riveted. A [...] firewall separated the engine compartment from the crew. A door allowed access to the engine from the crew compartment. It also had ventilation openings that could be closed. The driver sat {{on the right side}} using a [...] observation port protected by two flaps. The inner flap had an episcope with a 25° field of view. It was connected to the armored outer flap so that opening one closed the other. The outer flap had a [...] slit. To his right was a vision slit [...] protected by [...] of bulletproof glass. The inner flap was padded so that the driver could rest his head on it when driving. The radio operator sat on the left and had his own [...] vision port with [...] of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull. The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> with 30° of traverse. It could elevate 25° and depress 10°. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. The mount had a spotting telescope or open sights could be used if the plug {{at the top of the}} <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> was removed. If necessary the driver could lock the mount into position and fire it himself using a Bowden cable.|$|E

Both weapons could elevate 25° and depress 10°. They both used 1.25x power sights with a 25° field of view. The tank used Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz. 35 heavy machine guns in both ball mounts.|$|E
500|$|The turret ring had a {{diameter}} of [...] The turret had a flat face {{in the center of}} which was mounted the [...] main armament. On the right side was another [...] machine gun in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount.</b> The commander had four episcopes in his cupola and a monocular mirror, 1.3 x 30° periscope which he could extend, once he had removed its armoured cover in his hatch, to give vision while [...] "buttoned-up". As the sole occupant of the turret, the commander was responsible for loading, aiming and firing the main gun and the turret machine gun while simultaneously commanding the tank. The Germans added an extra crewman {{on the right side of}} the turret to load the main gun and to operate the turret machine gun. Some ammunition had to be removed to accommodate him.|$|E
50|$|Internal Security - The {{internal}} security {{model can be}} fitted with an obstacle-clearing blade {{at the front of}} the hull. The lower half of the blade is made of welded steel with web stiffening, and the upper half consists of a pipe framework with a robust wire grille which gives the driver and commander forward observation. The height of the blade can be adjusted hydraulically from the driver's seat and it can also be removed for transport when it is usually stowed at the rear of the hull. The vehicle can be fitted with the same turrets as the reconnaissance model but one cupola has been specifically developed for the {{internal security}} role. This cupola can be rotated through 360° and is infinitely lockable in any required position. At the front of the cupola above each other are two vision blocks with bulletproof glass and <b>ball</b> <b>mounts.</b> The cupola hatch opens to the rear and can be locked at 180°. Two vision blocks with <b>ball</b> <b>mounts</b> and a further 10 vision blocks (in double rows) give improved observation. To the right of the two <b>ball</b> <b>mounts</b> is a flap which is opened to hold a tear gas nozzle. Tear gas mixture is provided from tanks which hold a maximum of 500 litres.|$|R
5000|$|Ob'yekt 765 {{was fitted}} with an active {{location}} system for its eight passengers. It {{was developed in}} the mid-1960s. Its turret was moved {{to the rear of the}} hull. It was also fitted with three additional 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine guns in <b>ball</b> <b>mounts</b> in the middle of the hull. Three prototypes were built.|$|R
50|$|A 1.5 meter (5 foot) {{aluminum}} {{bar supports}} a webcam with a gray foam <b>ball</b> <b>mounted</b> above it. The robot {{is equipped with}} a webcam, speakers, microphone, and a tablet computer with a live feed from Bowman's webcam to help coworkers to communicate with him more naturally. Infrared proximity sensors keep the robot from bumping into walls and cubicles.|$|R
500|$|The turret ring had a {{diameter}} of [...] The turret sides were [...] thick and its roof had a thickness of [...] The turret was manually traversed (3° per rotation of the handle), but the gearing could be disengaged to allow the commander to shoulder the turret around as desired. The turret had a flat face {{in the center of}} which was mounted the [...] main armament. On the right side was another [...] machine gun in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount.</b> The commander had four episcopes in his cupola and a monocular mirror, 1.3 x 35° periscope which he could extend once he removed its armored cover in his hatch for vision while [...] "buttoned-up". This meant that the commander was responsible for loading, aiming and firing the main gun and the turret machine gun while simultaneously commanding the tank.|$|E
500|$|The main {{armament}} was a Škoda ÚV vz. 34 (German designation [...] "KwK 34(t)") {{gun with}} a pepperpot muzzle brake and a prominent armoured recoil cylinder above the barrel. Škoda {{called it the}} A3. It fired a [...] armour-piercing shell at [...] It was credited with penetrating a plate inclined at 30° from the vertical [...] thick at , [...] thick at , [...] thick at , and [...] thick at [...] Kliment and Francev quote penetration of a vertical plate [...] thick at [...] The machine gun's <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> could be coupled to the main gun or used independently. Both weapons could elevate 25° and depress 10°. They both used 2.6x power sights with a 25° field of view. Initially the tank used Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz. 35 machine guns, but these were exchanged for ZB vz. 37s during 1938. This {{was adopted by the}} Germans as the MG 37(t).|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Faculty of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the Military Technical Academy named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky {{developed}} two tank models (TMM-1 and TMM-2) {{based on the}} Vickers 6-Ton tank design but with an American Hercules [...] six-cylinder water-cooled engine, improved front armour (to 15–20mm), and a driver's position on the left side. TMM stands for tank maloy moshchnosti or [...] "tank of low power". The TMM-1 was equipped with transmission details from the native [...] (...) and a <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> for the DT tank machine gun {{in front of the}} hull, whereas the TMM-2 was equipped with an improved gear box, a steering device without clutches and a 37mm Hotchkiss gun in the right turret. Representatives from the main Soviet tank manufacturers together with officials from the RKKA Mobilization Department considered the Hercules engine to be too difficult to produce, and the engine tended to overheat inside the engine compartment. Tests of TMM-1 and TMM-2 prototypes performed in the beginning of 1932 demonstrated no advantage over the Vickers 6-Ton and the T-26 (the TMM-2's maneuverability was found to be even worse).|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred on}} the New York and New Haven Railroad where it crosses a small inlet of Long Island Sound via a swing bridge. The approach from New York is around a sharp curve, {{so there was a}} signal indicating if the bridge was passable by trains: a red <b>ball</b> <b>mounted</b> upon a tall pole.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This 2.5 ton Mercedes-Benz diesel {{truck was}} {{actually}} {{used in the}} filming of the desert chase scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark and is on display near the exit queue of the Disneyland attraction.

5000|$|KV-85 (Object 239) - A KV-1S {{with the}} 85 mm D-5T cannon {{in a new}} turret, with the <b>ball</b> <b>mounted</b> hull machine gun removed and the hole welded shut, 148 of these tanks were {{produced}} {{in the second half}} of 1943 until the spring of 1944; they were a stopgap until the IS tank series entered production.|$|R
2500|$|Late production: Mk V six-pounder. Auxiliary turret and sponson door removed. Browning [...]303 in (7.7 mm) {{machine gun}} fitted in <b>ball</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Type 4 Chi-To was a thirty-ton, {{all-welded}} medium {{tank with}} a maximum armor thickness of [...] on the frontal plates. Manned by a crew of five, it was [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. Main armament was a turret-mounted long-barreled (4.23 m) Type 5 75 mm tank gun capable of being elevated between -6.5 to +20 degrees. An [...] muzzle velocity gave it an armor penetration of 75 millimeters at 1,000 meters. The tank had a Type 97 heavy tank machine gun mounted in the hull and a <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> {{on the side of}} the turret for a second one.|$|E
2500|$|The Tančík vz. 33 was {{assembled}} from {{a framework}} of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams, to which armor plates were riveted. The driver sat {{on the right side}} using a [...] observation port protected by [...] of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter which had a [...] slit. The gunner sat on the left and had a similar vision port half the size of the driver's. His ZB vz. 26 machine gun was mounted in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on the sides and the rear. The driver's machine gun was fixed and he fired it using a Bowden cable; 2,600 rounds were stored for the machine guns.|$|E

2500|$|The OA vz. 30's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} Tatra 6 x 4 T-72 truck chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it was a}} central tube design with {{independently}} sprung rear half-axles which gave good cross-country performance. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had a small vision port for his ZB vz. 26 machine gun. It was mounted in a firing slit directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on both sides. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from a door {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The gunner sat in a small, cylindrical turret with 360° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front and vision slits on both sides and the rear. The turret had another ZB vz. 26 light machine gun in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount.</b> Another machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 3000 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The armor ranged between [...] thick; this was deemed enough to deflect ordinary bullets fired from over [...] distance.|$|E
2500|$|Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk was {{determined}} not to repeat the problems of its earlier Tančík vz. 33 tankette and gave the gunner a turret for better observation and all-around fields of fire for its new AH-IV tankette. It was assembled from a framework of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams, to which armor plates between [...] thick were bolted. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. To his right was a small vision slit. Also to his right, in all models except the Swedish Strv m/37, was a light Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz. 26 or vz. 30 machine gun that was usually locked in place and fired using a Bowden cable. The gunner sat on the left and manned a small turret fitted with a ZB vz. 35 or ZB vz. 37 heavy machine gun in a <b>ball</b> <b>mount.</b> Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. He had a large vision port {{to the right of the}} machine gun mount in the turret and a small vision slit on the left side of the superstructure. 3700 rounds were carried for the two machine guns. No radio was fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The OA vz. 27's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} {{purpose-built}} ladder frame chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it could be}} driven in both directions as it had both forward and rear drivers. Both axles could be driven and steered, but not {{at the same time as}} the reverser lever controlled the direction of travel and which axle was being used so it was not a true four-wheel drive design[...] The forward driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had his own vision port. The rear driver sat on the vehicle's left side. A heavy Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 water-cooled machine gun was mounted in the center of the rear hull with 72° of traverse. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from doors in both sides of the vehicle and a hatch in the turret. The gunner sat in a small, conical turret with 360° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front, vision slits on both sides and an armored searchlight on a swing arm in the rear. The turret had a Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 machine gun in a forward-facing <b>ball</b> <b>mount</b> and two other ball mounts were fitted on the sides of the turret. A ZB vz. 26 light machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 5750 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The body had an internal frame of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams to which [...] armor plates were riveted.|$|E

60|$|Ordering Harry to {{accompany}} him, Captain Ball at once {{took his place}} in his gig and rowed to the flagship. The battle was still raging, and to the practiced eye {{there was no doubt}} that the English fleet was suffering very severely. Captain <b>Ball</b> <b>mounted</b> the quarter-deck, and saluting the admiral reported that the fort with which he was engaged had struck, but that the Cæsar being aground was unable to render any assistance to the general attack.|$|R
5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer hitch. Trailer hitches come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable <b>ball</b> <b>mounts,</b> hitch bike racks, cargo carriers, or other hitch mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar hitches are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch accessories.|$|R
