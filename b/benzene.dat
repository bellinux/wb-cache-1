These particles (SP-CLM) {{were used as}} a packing material for columns in high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Aromatic phosphate esters, chlorosubstituted phenyl-ureas, monosubstituted <b>benzenes,</b> and the o-, m-, and p-isomers of di-substituted <b>benzenes</b> were separated on the columns, using isopropanol and hexane. Alkyl and alkoxy groups in the solute molecules sterically hindered the interaction of these molecules with the solid phase. The retention of the isomers of disubstituted <b>benzenes</b> that possess one electronegative (or dipolar) and one nonpolar substituent increased in the order: o- < m- < p-. In contrast, for all investigated disubstituted <b>benzenes</b> containing two electronegative (or dipolar) substituents, the o-isomer was retained on the 18. 6 -A SP-CLM more strongly than the m- and p-isomers. The chromatographic {{data suggest that the}} strength of the interaction of phenolic groups with the solid phase increased with the acidity of these groups. The o-isomers of phenols that contained an additional electronegative (or dipolar) substituent displayed an exceptionally strong adsorption.

40|$|Movement of {{brominated}} <b>benzenes</b> in {{rats and}} mice was investigated. The concentration of o-dibromobenzene in several tissues and organs reached the highest value within 10 hours of a single oral administration and then decreased rapidly. The accumulation of o-dibromobenzene in tissues and organs was in the descending order of adipose tissue, liver (=pectoral muscle), kidney, brain and blood. A similar tendency was observed in mono-and tribromobenzene administered animals. The concentration of hexabromobenzene following continuous intraperitoneal administration reached the highest value 16. 3 (liver) to 28. 8 days (brain) after the administration.
