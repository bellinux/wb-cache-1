5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is found in}} parts of the Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, {{extending}} as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California. There are occasional records from Monterey Bay, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> there is too cold for the California spiny lobster to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California arrived as a larva during El Niño years.|$|E
5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction. The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K-T boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago, which is {{around the time of}} the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> temperature decreased causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity.|$|E
5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are {{dominated}} by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by {{the nineteenth century and}} was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for {{the tens of thousands of}} geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.|$|E

5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral George Pettengill {{relieved}} Bryant on 4 March 1935 and {{the ship}} participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later. Arizona made a port visit to Balboa, Panama, in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain George A. Alexander relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> leaked into the turret's electrical switchboard and started a small fire that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In Fiscal Year 1936–37, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship {{spent the rest of}} her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|The present plain three-storey brick {{building}} dates from 1837 replacing an earlier one. The machinery {{was driven by}} a 13ft diameter overshot wheel. The mill was operated by an Attlee family (who also ran Parsonage Mill) from 1882 until milling ceased in 1910. The machinery was removed in 1937 {{for use in a}} Sussex mill. During World War II Moss Bros. used the building as a warehouse. It is now a private house, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> channels remain.|$|E

25|$|After six weeks, the Sparrow-Hawk {{reached the}} coast of Massachusetts, and was wrecked at Potanumaquut Harbor Cape Cod. Upon {{reaching}} Cape Cod, the Sparrow-Hawk no longer had fresh water or 'beer'. Captain Johnston was in his cabin, sick and lame with scurvy. At night, the Sparrow-Hawk hit a sand bar <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was smooth and she laid out an anchor. The morning revealed that the caulking between hull planks - Oakum - had been driven out. High winds drove the Sparrow-Hawk over the bar and into the Harbor.

25|$|From July 11 until July 22, the Des Moines Water Works {{treatment}} facility was flooded by the Raccoon River. This {{resulted in the}} plant being powered down, unable to provide running water for that period. During this time the Army National Guard and American Red Cross set up water stations, and the local Anheuser-Busch distributor contributed water in white six packs with their logo on it. Once running water was restored, there was enough pressure for people to bathe and flush toilets, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was not certified potable until July 29. The final usage restrictions were lifted in August.|$|E
25|$|The bathing {{ceremony}} {{takes place}} shortly after death.

As with common funerals today, this takes place as a ceremonial pouring of water by the attendees, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is usually poured over the deceased's feet instead of the hand, as is done for commoners. After the bathing ceremony, the hair is ritually combed, once upwards and once downwards, and the comb is broken.

They locked the town's policemen in the police station cells, and kept many people hostage in the Royal Mail Hotel for three days. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept {{the people in the}} hotel, while Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne robbed the bank. After the bank robberies, the reward was {{increased}} to £2,000 for each man, or the larger amount of £8,000 for the Gang.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, from November to February, {{there are}} light rains called equipatas ("horse hoofs", {{named after the}} sound the rain makes). These rains {{come in from the}} north from the {{southern}} extensions of frontal storms that originate in the northern Pacific Ocean. These end by March or April when the fronts are no longer strong enough to reach this far south. They end even earlier in the extreme south of the state as the storm systems retreat, with the dry season lasting eight or nine months {{in this part of the}} state. In the north these rains support a wide variety of spring annuals and wildflowers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> they supply in the south of the state is still important to help replenish wells.|$|E
25|$|If {{water is}} not allowed to flow in or out of the soil, the stress path is called an {{undrained}} stress path. During undrained shear, if the particles are surrounded by a nearly incompressible fluid such as water, then the density of the particles cannot change without drainage, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pressure and effective stress will change. On the other hand, if the fluids are allowed to freely drain out of the pores, then the pore pressures will remain constant and the test path is called a drained stress path. The soil is free to dilate or contract during shear if the soil is drained. In reality, soil is partially drained, somewhere between the perfectly undrained and drained idealized conditions.|$|E
