5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> start talking about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E
500|$|When {{thinking}} of a band name, someone suggested [...] "corn", but the band rejected that name, so Shaffer had the idea to spell the name with both a [...] "K" [...] instead of a [...] "C", and a backwards [...] "R", so the band's name would appear as [...] "KoЯn". The logo was designed by vocalist Jonathan Davis. Silveria explained, [...] "the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> get established, it makes the name cool." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with 100PercentRock.com, Yamano explained that her process for writing and recording has not changed substantially from the band's early days: [...] "I’m lazy and I don’t start writing songs until we book recording studio , <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> booked the studio, I can write songs quickly with concentration. Then I send my demo to our members and we rehearse. At the recording studio, we start to record from basic tracks then overdub." [...] On this album, {{every member of the}} band also sings a unique song about a food item; Yamano sings [...] "Fortune Cookie", the band's bassist Ritsuko Taneda lends her vocals to [...] "Ramen Rock", and drummer Emi Morimoto can be heard on [...] "Green Tea". The first song was inspired by Yamano fondness for eating a fortune cookie after a meal of Chinese food in America; after learning that the cookies were actually invented in Japan, Yamano decided to pen the song. [...] "Ramen Rock" [...] was inspired by Taneda's habit of eating ramen after every show. Finally, Yamano asked Morimoto to sing [...] "Green Tea" [...] because she is from Kyoto, which is known for its green tea.|$|E
500|$|Wennersten {{contacted}} Sparks when Jasenko Selimovic, {{the head}} of SR Radioteatern, decided that the station would produce {{a number of new}} musicals. She thought Sparks would be suitable for the format: [...] "They are a bit extravagant; they have a larger-than-life quality, and above all, they make music that is colourful enough for it not to feel like you miss a visual component." [...] Sparks were initially somewhat surprised by the invitation to write a musical for Swedish radio, and were hesitant to take on the project. However, after several months of persuasive effort from Wennersten, via e-mail and telephone, they decided to accept the challenge. [...] "We originally thought of it as a side project between albums, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> started working on it, it took on a bigger life," [...] Sparks have said. [...] "As Americans we have almost abandoned radio drama and it was truly exhilarating for us to work in a medium where the imagination of the listener is so integral a part of the work. Aside from our love of Bergman, we have a love of Orson Welles and his use of the medium of radio was something that inspired us in this work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallenda {{describes}} himself as a challenge-driven person. [...] "Don't tell me, 'It can't be done,' because I'll {{find a way to do}} it", he says. [...] "My whole thing", he says, [...] "is I don't want to just break records. I want to set myself apart from any record that's been done before." [...] Wallenda lives by the mantra [...] "Never Give Up". [...] He believes that through hard work, one can achieve anything they desire. [...] "I think [...] what life is about", he remarks. [...] "We all go through challenges. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> get through them, we look back and say look how much our lives have changed by going through that challenge." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{recording}} of Go, the band {{set out on the}} [...] "4 Albums. 2 Nights. 7 Cities" [...] tour, which found the band performing their past discography over two nights. During that time period, they searched for the label to release Go, which was being mixed at the time. Several labels were interested from samples the band sent them. Another plan the band had was to pay entirely for mastering and manufacturing, and to then find a distributor. The band took meetings with various label heads, including with Brett Gurewitz, former Bad Religion guitarist and head of Epitaph Records, where the band was signed from 2003 to 2008. It was clear from the first meeting that the band would return to their [...] "first home," [...] with Pierre noting that, [...] "We had always enjoyed working with [...] and we loved the people there. We were taking meetings, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> were hanging out with Brett, we got right back into the swing of things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mahathir, who {{had never}} been fond of the judiciary, began making heated {{statements}} about it at this time. Mahathir declared, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and we want to give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' ... We know exactly what we want to do, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> do it, it is interpreted in a different way." [...] Mahathir also lambasted [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent" [...] and play to public opinion. Soon after, nine judges sitting on the High Court were reassigned to different divisions; Justice Harun Hashim, who presided over the UMNO case, was transferred from appellate and special powers cases to commercial crimes. However, because the UMNO case was already in progress, his transfer would not take effect until the case closed. Harun later ruled that under the evidence presented, it was clear several UMNO delegates had come from unregistered branches of the party. In line with the law, he declared he was forced to declare UMNO an illegal society, and thereby dismissed the case of the plaintiffs. Mahathir soon formed a new party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO), to replace UMNO. Within a year, the suffix [...] "Baru" [...] was dropped, making it just plain [...] "UMNO".|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, mates," [...] said he, [...] "it's {{lucky you}} have Barbecue {{to think for}} you with this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have the ship.

60|$|Now up to {{this point}} I can speak with {{considerable}} of certainty, having Hiram at my elbow to point out this movement or that; <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> were fronting the Britishers, and the fumes of burning powder assailed my nostrils, I lost all knowledge of what was being done save immediately around me, and there were times, when the fight grew hottest, that I could not {{for the life of me}} have told you what I did or said.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Tony's {{daughter}} Susie {{goes into}} labor and {{gives birth to}} a healthy baby boy she names Joshua. Although Tony is happy to become a grandfather, he remains troubled about an aspect of his past that he had long ago forgotten: the hurtful content of his letter. He writes to Veronica, apologizing to her for what he has done. She receives the letter, and we see her in profile as she reads it. <b>But,</b> <b>once</b> again, <b>we</b> know virtually nothing of Veronica's reaction to the letter or her true feelings.|$|R
60|$|Romola sat nearly {{opposite}} Lillo, {{but she was}} not observing him. Her {{hands were}} crossed on her lap and her eyes were fixed absently on the distant mountains: she was evidently unconscious of anything around her. An eager life had left its marks upon her: the finely-moulded cheek had sunk a little, the golden crown was less massive; but there was a placidity in Romola's face which had never belonged to it in youth. It is <b>but</b> <b>once</b> that <b>we</b> can know our worst sorrows, and Romola had known them while life was new.|$|R

60|$|All {{that day}} till the sun grew low we walked round {{the base of}} the great Ghost Mountain, {{following}} the line of the river. We met no one, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> came to the ruins of a kraal, and in it lay the broken bones of many men, and with the bones rusty assegais and the remains of ox-hide shields, black and white in colour. Now I examined the shields, and knew from their colour that they had been carried in the hands of those soldiers who, years ago, were sent out by Chaka to seek for Umslopogaas, but who had returned no more.|$|E
60|$|And yet, {{with all}} his friends and acquaintances, {{in a way he}} {{remained}} a very lonely man, as those who are a little out of the ordinary often do. In the common groove we rub against the other marbles running down it, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> leap over its edge, then where are we? We cannot wander off into space because of the attraction of the earth that is so near to us, and yet we are alone in the air until with a bump we meet our native ground. Therefore for the most of us the groove is much better. And yet some who leave it have been carried elsewhere, if only for a little while, like St. Paul into the third heaven.|$|E
60|$|But the abundance! There {{was so much}} of it. We {{could not}} work the Snark for the fruit {{that was in the}} way. She was festooned with fruit. The life-boat and launch were packed with it. The awning- guys groaned under their burdens. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>we</b> struck the full trade-wind sea, the disburdening began. At every roll the Snark shook {{overboard}} a bunch or so of bananas and cocoanuts, or a basket of limes. A golden flood of limes washed about in the lee-scuppers. The big baskets of yams burst, and pineapples and pomegranates rolled back and forth. The chickens had got loose and were everywhere, roosting on the awnings, fluttering and squawking out on the jib-boom, and essaying the perilous feat of balancing on the spinnaker-boom. They were wild chickens, accustomed to flight. When attempts were made to catch them, they flew out over the ocean, circled about, and came lack. Sometimes they did not come back. And in the confusion, unobserved, the little sucking pig got loose and slipped overboard.|$|E
