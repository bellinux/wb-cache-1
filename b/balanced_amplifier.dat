40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{complete}} design and analysis of new HMIC 3. 5 - 4. 5 GHz broadband <b>balanced</b> <b>amplifier</b> modules using microstrip technology. Two different modules are designed and analyzed. Each module is implemented in a single substrate. The first module used Lange couplers as power splitters and combiners while the second used branch couplers. The components of the modules are designed using full-scale computer simulation program, performed by the author and named as MSDES, which takes fully into account all the discontinuities included in the microstrip lines; while the modules are analyzed and optimized using APLAC V 7. 61 software. A short and efficient CAD procedure for the broadband amplifier design is introduced. The first step is to design an initial narrowband high-gain microstrip amplifier at a center frequency equal to 4 GHz. The second step is to optimize the initial lengths and widths of the input and output microstrip-matching circuits to get the broadband amplifier over the range 3. 5 - 4. 5 GHz. The analyses of both narrow and broadband amplifiers are introduced in addition to the complete analysis of the designed 3. 5 - 4. 5 broadband <b>balanced</b> <b>amplifier</b> modules.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 39 - 43). Although using balanced amplifiers in modern wireless communication systems has many advantages, the output {{and the noise}} response of the balanced ampli- fiers may vary from the expected value considerably due to the imperfections in the amplifier and the divider/combiner sections. First, we analyze the variation in the total gain of the balanced amplifiers using 2 -way 0 ff power dividers and 90 ff couplers. In this context, mathematical analyses are made and analytical expressions are obtained to compare the two topologies. Analytical expressions show that the uncertainty in the total gain is more if the 90 ff coupler {{is used in the}} balanced structure as opposed to a 2 -way 0 ff power divider for the same return loss/isolation values. Then, we present exact and approximate analytical results for the noise figure and noise parameters of the <b>balanced</b> <b>amplifier</b> in divider topology by using the noise waves. By the help of the noise wave approach, the output noise powers generated by each element in the <b>balanced</b> <b>amplifier</b> are derived. Y-parameters are used to determine the noise waves and the correlation matrix of the divider whereas the noise parameters are used to write the noise waves of the amplifier. Balanced amplifiers suffer in the noise figure performance in comparison to a stand-alone amplifier even with an ideal input divider. The noise parameters degrade further with an imperfect divider. Not only the nonzero return loss and the isolation but also the ohmic loss, amplitude and phase imbalances are considered. Besides, non-zero optimal source impedance affects the noise parameters of the <b>balanced</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Measurement results are also presented as a verification. by Akif Alperen Coşkun. Ph.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 88 - 90. Power amplifiers (PAs) {{have their}} highest efficiency {{when they are}} used at full power (0 dB back-off). For this reason, most PAs are used at 1 dB compression point (P 1 dB), but this point is highly nonlinear. For high linearity, PAs should be used at some back-off value (below the point of 1 dB compression point). In this case the efficiency of PAs decreases drastically. Another issue is that widely used digital modulation techniques produce signals which has a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In modern systems the power is reduced automatically to use spectrum efficiently and to prevent interference and detection. These conditions force new PA designs to have both high linearity and high efficiency from P 1 dB point down to a few dB back-off region. Doherty Amplifier technique uses Class-AB and Class-C amplifiers in parallel, {{and an increase in}} the efficieny especially at back-off regions occurs. By the use of parallel configuration P 1 dB point is improved. In the thesis, the theory of Doherty Configuration is explained, a Doherty Amplifier working at 4. 75 GHz is designed and simulated.

Significant increases are achieved both at P 1 dB point and at the efficiency. Peker, KazımM. S...|$|E

The parameters critical to TMA performance are low NF for reasons of optimizing coverage area, high gain to overcome the cable loss, and high linearity as the TMA must operate reliably in a crowded RF spectrum. Additionally, the TMA is required to present a nonreflective input and output terminations, that is, a return loss (RL) of – 20 dB, and yet exhibits sub- 1 dB NF. LNA designs for TMA service typically rely on the hybrid-coupled <b>balanced</b> <b>amplifier</b> arrangement to satisfy this challenging combination of noise and RL requirements [1].
