40|$|The {{effects of}} {{halothane}} (1. 0 - 1. 5 %) on myocardial contractility, systemic vascular resistance (representing {{the majority of}} impedance to oscillatory flow), and left ventri-cular performance, and the interactions of these functions have been studied in open-chested dogs, artificially ventilated and maintained {{in a state of}} <b>basal</b> <b>narcosis</b> with chloralose and urethane. Halothane reversibly depressed myocardial contractility as estimated by three indices: maximum left ventricular (dP/dt) /IP, maximum left ven-tricular (dP/dt) /PCIP, and maximum aortic acceleration, but produced no significant changes of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or of systemic vascular resistance. Stroke volume fell in proportion to the depression of myocardial contractility at constant heart rates maintained by atrial pacing, though the reduction of stroke volume was greatest when systemic vascular resistance increased slightly. The concept is proposed that, irrespective of minor changes in the peripheral venous bed during halothane anaesthesia, depression of myocardial contractility impairs ventricular emptying rather than ventricular filling. This concept is based on the observation that since peak aortic flow and acceleration are decreased during halothane anaesthesia, the force acting o...|$|E

40|$|Young pigs (large white breed) are {{favourable}} subjects {{on which}} to study the relation between dosage and body weight because they weigh about 1 kgm. at birth and rise to 80 kgm. within 6 months. The range of weight {{is similar to that}} which covers the growth of human beings. The experiments described below were made to determine firstly the susceptibility to a quick-acting barbiturate of new-born pigs and secondly the relation between dosage and body weight. The former point is. of practical in-terest in relation to the use of barbiturates in obstetrics and the latter point is of importance as regards <b>basal</b> <b>narcosis</b> in children. The literature relating to barbiturates is too extensive to per-mit full references, but comprehensive reviews have been com-piled by Lundy (1) and by Levy (2). The following special points are relevant to our experiments. Holck et al. (3) showed that adult male rats were more resistant than female rats to quick-acting barbiturates, but showed no sex difference in response to slow acting barbiturates. No sex difference was found with other animals (dog, cat, rabbit, guinea pig). Tolerance to repeated administration of pentobarbital was noted by Moir (4) and Carmichael and Posey (5). No sex difference was observed in the young pigs and we endeavoured to avoid establishment of tolerance by allowing at least 7 days ’ interval between injections. As regards the relation between dosage and body weight in adult animals Mulinos (6) using amytal on cats found that large animals were more resistant than small ones. Bazett and Erb (7) found the reverse to be true of pentobarbital given to cats an...|$|E
40|$|The {{rise and}} fall of the Opsonine rate in the blood during various general {{anesthesia}} was investigated. 1) The <b>basal</b> <b>narcosis</b> scarsely gave influences upon the Opsonin rate. 2) During the intravenous anesthesia using Penthothal sodium the Opsonin rate fell to the bottom at the second hour of anesthesia. 3) During the endotracheal anesthesia with cyclopropaine the Opsonine rate showed its least value also at the second hour. 4) During the endotracheal anesthesia with ether, the Opsonin rate showed a gradule and marked increase with the progress of anesthesia. 5) During the endotracheal anesthesia using cyclopropaine and nitrous oxide together the Opsonin rate decreased markedly and after hours it showed the least value, then began to increase from the third day after anesthesia and on the 7 th and 14 th days, it recovered to the rate before the anesthesia. 6) During the endotracheal anesthesia using the combination of cyclopropaine, nitrous oxide and ether, the Opsonin rate decreased markedly at the first hour of the anesthesia then considerably increased at the second hour but considerably decreased at the third hour. And it gradually increased from the third day after the anesthesia. 7) During the endotracheal anesthesia using nitrous oxide and ether, it decreased markedly at the first hour of anesthesia, while it showed gradual decrease from second hour to 7 th day after anesthesia. 8) By oxygen inhalation the Opsonin rate showed a slight decrease temporally, but it recovered at the end of inhalation. 9) The influence of various general anesthesia upon the Opsonin rate in blood was independend of the blood coagulating time and the number of the platelets...|$|E
40|$|In this study, it {{is decided}} to throw light on some {{intravenous}} anaesthetic protocols {{to be used}} in female desert goats in Sudan. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide baseline data pertaining to different anaesthetic phases tested and to compare and contrast the different examined protocols. This study was conducted using 64 healthy female desert goats divided randomly into eight groups ofequal size. Ketamine Hcl (KT) (5 %) at dose rate of 4 mg/kg body weight and Thiopentone Sodium (TH) (2. 5 %) at dose rate of 10 mg/kg body weight were used as induction agents injected intravenously in all examined protocols. Diazepam (DI) (0. 5 %) at dose rate of 0. 5 mg/kg body weight, Xylazine (XY) (2 %) at dose rate of 0. 1 mg/kg body weight and Medetomidine (ME) at dose rate of 10 µg/kg body weight were used aspremedications, individually injected intravenously 10 minutes prior to Ketamine Hcl or Thiopentone Sodium (TH) injection. Each of the above mentioned groups of animals were subjected to treatment either with KT or TH with or without one of the above mentioned premedications, so the tested protocols were KT, KT-DI, KT-XY, KT-ME, TH, TH-DI, TH-XY and TH-ME. Respiratory rate, heart rate and rectal temperature were measured before and immediately after injection of premedications and anaesthetics at 10 minutes intervals until full recovery was attainedas monitor, using standard clinical methods. The major reflexes were monitored throughout the course of anaesthesia. The usage of the protocols KT, KT-XY and KT-ME induced significant increase in respiratory rate, while TH-DI and TH-XY exerted significant decrease in respiration. There was significant tachycardia due to injection of TH, TH-DI and TH-XY, and significant bradycardia due to injection of TH-ME. The usage of TH and TH-DI induced significant hyperthermia, while none of the protocols tested harboured significant hypothermia. 16 Thiopentone sodium containing protocols (TH-DI, TH-XY, and TH-ME) were found to have longer duration of anaesthetic phase, when compared with that observed with Ketamine or Thiopentone sodium when used without premedication. The longest duration of <b>basal</b> <b>narcosis</b> was induced with the protocol TH-ME, while KT harboured the shortest one. The protocol KT-ME induced the longest mean period of lateral recumbancy phase and KT-DI exerted the shortest one. The longest mean value of the sternal recumbancy phase in different protocols tested was induced with TH-DI, while the KT-XY harboured the shortest one. The longest mean value of standing phase was noticed with TH-DI, and the shortest one with ME-KT. There was no obviousrelationship between phases of anaesthesia and regained time of selected reflexes tested. There is significant increase in total recovery time (TRT) when premedications were used prior to Ketamine or Thiopentone sodium. Also generally, Thiopentone sodium containing protocols were reported to have significantly longer duration of TRT than Ketamine Hcl containing protocols. Apnoea was observed when Thiopentone sodium containing protocols were used. The longest duration of apnoea was induced with TH-DI, the shortest one was due to injection of TH-XY. This study concludes that each of the eight tested protocols at the prescribed dose rates is safe for use in female desert goats, with variable effects on physiological and anaesthetic parameters...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{about the}} {{isoflurane}} anaesthesia in swine Compared to other animal species, swine show typical defensive behaviour towards {{any kind of}} physical manipulation. Anaesthesia is thus not only indicated for surgical interventions but for diagnostic and therapeutic measures as well. This study evaluates whether inhalational anaesthesia with isoflurane via facemask {{can serve as a}} potential alternative to regular intramuscular or intravenous anaesthesia. Two different apparati are compared: the first one disperses medical oxygen (O 2), the second filtered compartment air (CA), both in conjunction with isoflurane. Animals with a body weight (BW) up to 20 kg receive simply an inhalational anaesthesia, patients weighing more than 20 kg in addition to that an intramuscular pre-medication 10 minutes earlier with ketamine (10 mg/kg BW) and azaperone (2 mg/kg BW). The survey examines 156 normal pigs and 19 statistically non-evaluated miniature pigs. Animals with more than 10 kg BW in particular show vehement physical reactions to the basal anaesthesia. Pre-medicated test animals are immobilized after ten minutes and the anaesthesia can be deepened with isoflurane. Animals receiving pure inhalational anaesthesia show ataxia after 29 to 34 seconds. After 48 to 60 seconds the probands are in prone position and after 65 to 89 seconds in lateral position. The pre-medicated animals on the other hand are significantly slower to show ataxia (after 1, 4 minutes), prone position (after 1, 8 to 1, 9 minutes) and lateral position (4, 3 to 4, 4 minutes). The hypnosis and surgical tolerance stage of anaesthesia are reached significantly faster with isoflurane in CA than with isoflurane in O 2. Test animals with isoflurane/O 2 require an isoflurane-vaporiser position of 2, 24 to 3, 38 Vol% during the whole intervention, those with isoflurane/CA 2, 17 to 2, 88 Vol%. Compared to that, the premedicated animals need significantly less isoflurane with 1, 5 to 2, 38 Vol% (O 2) and 1, 52 to 2, 08 Vol% (CA). Probands with O 2 as carrier gas show a significantly better oxygen saturation (94 - 95 %) than test subjects with CA (78 %). The measured arterial pH value of 7, 27 to 7, 34 indicates a low acidosis; a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 49, 7 to 65, 7 mmHg exceeds the reference values. The partial oxygen pressure is significantly better with O 2 (190, 0 to 266, 2 mmHg) than with CA (57, 4 to 65, 7 mmHg). During the recovery phase, all animals exhibit the reappearance of the claw reflex, the dewclaw reflex, the muscle tension and positive skin sensibility in consecutive order. Somewhat later they raise their heads, get into the prone position and try to rise. Given several more minutes, they manage to stand. Probands receiving pure inhalation anaesthesia are significantly faster (1, 3 to 9, 8 minutes) to reach the waking stage than animals with a combination of ketamine, azaperone and isoflurane (2, 1 to 24, 4 minutes). The average blood pressure during the <b>basal</b> <b>narcosis</b> is 128 / 71 mmHg (systole/diastole) and 130 / 72 mmHg during the maintenance stage. Body weight and premedication apparently play no significant role. Miniature pigs deliver similar results as the premedicated pigs, but need remarkably less isoflurane (1, 10 to 1, 58 Vol%). Conclusion: a pure inhalation anaesthesia with isoflurane in swine can only be recommended for animals with a body weight up to 10 kg (O 2 -apparatus: 2, 24 to 3, 38 Vol% for surgical tolerance, CA-apparatus: 2, 17 to 2, 88 Vol% for surgical tolerance); rapid drifting off and rapid waking are the obvious advantages. A premedication with ketamine (10 mg/kg BW) and azaperone (2 mg/kg BW) reduces the dose of isoflurane significantly (O 2 -apparatus: 1, 5 to 2, 38 Vol%, CA-apparatus: 1, 52 to 2, 08 Vol%). The use of O 2 as carrier gas allows an optimal anaesthesia with optimal O 2 - saturation for every animal weight and size (94 to 95 %). CA as carrier gas can cause hypoxia and acidosis (O 2 -saturation: 78 %, pH: 7, 31 to 7, 33, pCO 2 : 53, 0 to 60, 4 mmHg, pO 2 : 57, 4 to 65, 7 mmHg) during longer interventions. Miniature pigs need considerably less isoflurane, though this cannot result solely from the pre-medication and needs to be examined further...|$|E
