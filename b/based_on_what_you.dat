The paper focuses on the inclusion of picture sequences into generated documents, and on coreference relations between different pictures in a sequence. 1 Introduction Research on Document Generation has started to involve more than language generation alone, focusing not only on putting information into words, but also on putting information into pictures and laying out the words and pictures on a page ([Maybury and Wahlster, 1998]).

The rate of accumulation is for every $5 spent on a reel slot machine (the traditional slot machine), a credit is earned. For every $10 spent on a video poker machine, a credit is earned. Table games (blackjack, poker, baccarat, etc.) are accumulated differently. The rate is based upon length of play, average bet, and type of game. Also, credits may be accumulated through the Total Rewards Visa credit card, issued by Comenity Bank. For every $1 spent, 1 credit is earned.

5000|$|Perceptual-Motor Skills are skills {{learned by}} {{movement}} patterns guided by sensory inputs. There are closed skills and open skills. Closed skills are skills learned such as dance. A ballerina learns a {{specific set of}} moves and doesn’t stray from the exact routine, which is why it is called a closed skill; there is one option. Open skills are skills that require more flexibility in learning such as team sports. A person learning how to play football learns multiple drills, strategies, and practices scrimmages in order to learn how to work in multiple types of environments. Because no football game is the same, and a person can’t know going into a game the exact steps the other team is going to take, open skills are required to become successful. Cognitive skills also are a part of kinesthetic learning, perceptual learning, and skill memories. Some people learn better in an environment that is more hands-on, and this builds their cognitive skills as well. Cognitive skills are skills which require you to solve problems or apply strategies rather than to move your body <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> perceive.

5000|$|December 2016, Klein was {{a return}} guest on The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe {{talking about his}} book His Porn, Her Pain: Confronting America's Porn Panic with Honest Talk about Sex. He {{explained}} that he wrote this book in response to Broadband internet making porn more available - and the accompanying increase in women complaining about their men viewing porn. He also observes {{a new generation of}} stakeholders jumping on the [...] "bandwagon" [...] and being given a seat at the public policy table, even though they know little about sexuality. Host Steven Novella asked Klein if these anti-porn groups are trying to justify their opposition by claiming health issues or are they just confused with the science? Klein said both. People who think masturbation is harmful are falling for pseudoscience. Couples that don't have sex anymore are finding it easier to fight about porn rather than have a meaningful conversation about their lost sexual relationship. [...] "The junk science is there for anyone who wants to use it," [...] he says, noting the common claims that porn leads to various social problems lack evidence to support them. In reality the rates of sexual violence, divorce, teen pregnancy and child molestation are all down since Broadband pornography flooded the country. And the same pattern holds true in countries as diverse from each other as Denmark, Croatia, Japan and Hong Kong. Cara Santa Maria asked if porn leads to unrealistic expectations by men. [...] "Absolutely yes!" [...] Klein answered. [...] "Some people think porn is a documentary, showing real people in real situations... porn is usually unusual bodies, doing unusual things in unusual circumstances." [...] And [...] "Pornography leaves out so much that we value in sex. Kissing, hugging ... whispering... because if you watch people hug, after about 2 seconds it gets real boring." [...] He states that as a consumer product <b>based</b> <b>on</b> fantasy, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> find in it is what people want to see, not necessarily {{what they want to do}} or experience. Both men and woman fantasize about things they would not do even if given the chance. Klein states that he wrote this book to help improve sexual literacy of both adults and minors.|$|R
