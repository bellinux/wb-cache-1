5000|$|<b>Benzotriazole</b> is an {{effective}} corrosion inhibitor for copper and its alloys by preventing undesirable surface reactions. It is known that a passive layer, consisting of a complex between copper and <b>benzotriazole,</b> is formed when copper is immersed in a solution containing <b>benzotriazole.</b> The passive layer is insoluble in aqueous and many organic solutions. There is {{a positive correlation between}} the thickness of the passive layer and the efficiency of preventing corrosion. [...] BTA is used in conservation, notably for the treatment of bronze disease. The exact structure of the copper-BTA complex is controversial and many proposals have been suggested.|$|E

30|$|For {{phenolic}} <b>benzotriazoles,</b> {{assessment of}} the environmental persistence is challenging as standard information, i.e. simulation tests on biodegradation are not available. Thus, the WoE approach was used: overall information resulting from many sources was considered, and individual uncertainties of each source analysed separately. In a second step, all information was aggregated giving an overall picture of persistence to assess the degradability of the phenolic <b>benzotriazoles</b> under consideration although the reliability of individual sources was incomplete.|$|R

However, {{a number of the}} compounds examined by these authors {{do not appear to be}} triazoles, <b>benzotriazoles,</b> or other azo-aromatic compounds.
