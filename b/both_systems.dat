5|$|In 1966, the Oslo Metro opened as {{an upgrade}} of two {{existing}} suburban tramways, the Østensjø- and Lambertseter Lines. By 1970, {{the system was}} supplemented by the Grorud- and Furuset Lines. They only operated to the eastern suburbs. In 1987, the system was expanded to connect to the western network, that remained a suburban tramway with overhead wires, two-car platforms and an inferior signaling system. In 1993, the Sognsvann Line was converted to metro standard, with the Røa Line following two years later. When the order for the MX3000 trains was placed, the Kolsås- and Holmenkoll Lines still used overhead wires, {{and would not be}} able to use the new stock. <b>Both</b> <b>systems</b> were at the time being considered for conversion to light rail systems, that would connect to the Lilleaker- and Ullevål Hageby Line, respectively.|$|E

At the same time, the company wanted to make the trains compatible with the metro so they could operate on <b>both</b> <b>systems.</b> The new stock was considered to be a trial; if it met performance expectations, future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock, after the latter reached the end of its economical life in about 2000.

5|$|The 1865 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season included two landfalling hurricanes, with one that caused over 325deaths. The first storm was reported on May30 by {{ships in the}} western Caribbean. A month later, a storm hit southern Texas, and in late August, a storm paralleled the coastline of the Carolinas. The fourth storm of the season was also the longest-lasting, forming east of the Lesser Antilles before hitting Guadeloupe and eventually moving ashore in Louisiana.

The rings are reddish in color, and their geometrical (0.05) and Bond (0.01–0.02) albedos {{are similar to those of}} the Uranian rings' particles and the inner Neptunian moons.

5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, {{the same is true for}} the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years <b>both</b> <b>systems</b> were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E
