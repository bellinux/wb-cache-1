50|$|The {{diet and}} feeding {{technique}} of the Sabine's gull varies by season and habitat. In the breeding season {{it takes a}} range of freshwater and terrestrial prey on the tundra. This includes insects and probably spiders, aquatic insects and insect larvae, crustaceans, fish and young birds and eggs. Young birds and eggs are taken opportunistically and rarely, but can include <b>black</b> <b>turnstones,</b> lapland longspurs and even the eggs of other Sabine's gulls and geese. Insects and insect larvae taken include terrestrial and aquatic beetles, springtails, craneflies, mosquitos, midges, and flower flies (Syrphidae).|$|R

50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>{{turnstone}}</b> (Arenaria melanocephala) is {{a species}} of small wading bird. It {{is one of two}} species of turnstone in the genus Arenaria the ruddy turnstone (A. interpres) being the other. It is now classified in the sandpiper family, Scolopacidae, but was formerly sometimes placed in the plover family, Charadriidae. It is native to the west coast of North America and breeds only in Alaska.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>turnstone</b> has {{a variety}} of calls, {{especially}} a rattling trill which can be heard throughout the year. This call is higher and less harsh than the similar call of the ruddy turnstone. Other calls include a loud, screeching alarm call and a soft, purring call uttered to young chicks. Displaying males produce a long series of staccato notes in flight as well as chirruping trills on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Birds {{affected}} the community structure of an Oregon rocky shore by preying upon mussels (Mytilus spp.) and limpets (Collisella spp.). The {{impact of such}} predation is potentially great, as mussels are the competitively dominant mid-intertidal space-occupiers, and limpets are important herbivores in this community. Prey selection by birds reflects differences in bill morphology and foraging tactics. For example, Surfbird (Aphriza virgata) uses its stout bill to tug upright, firmly attached prey (e. g. mussels and gooseneck barnacles [Pollicipes polymerus]) from the substrate. The <b>Black</b> <b>Turnstone</b> (Arenaria melanocephala), with its chisel-shaped bill, uses a hammering tactic to eat firmly attached prey that are 1) compressed in shape and can be dislodged, or 2) have protective shells that can be broken by a turnstone bill. In addition, the <b>Black</b> <b>Turnstone</b> employs a push behavior to feed in clumps of algae containing mobile arthropods. Bird exclusion cages tested the effects of bird predation on 1) rates of mussel recolonization in patches (50 x 50 cm clearings), and 2) densities of small-sized limpets (< 10 mm in length) on upper intertidal mudstone benches. Four of six exclusion experiments showed that birds {{had a significant effect}} on mussel recruitment. These experiments suggested that the impact of avian predators had a significant effect on mussel densities when 1) the substrate was relatively smooth, 2) other mortality agents were insignificant, and 3) mussels were of intermediate size (11 - 30 mm long). Another series of exclusion experiments demonstrated that birds decreased densities of limpets 5 - 10 mm long, but not densities of smaller sized limpets. Experiments in which limpets were added to protected and unprotected plots indicated that bird predation varied seasonally; and that emigration, in addition to predation, may be responsible for the general absence of larger limpets on high intertidal mudstone benches...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Between spring 1976 {{and fall}} 1980 we studied the occurrence, abundance, and habitat use of birds over a 2000 -km 2 segment ofthe northcentral Alaska Peninsula. During this period {{observers}} were present 473 days and obtained records for all seasons. A total of 125 species was recorded; 63 % (79 of 125) were water-associated. The breeding avifauna {{was found to}} be a mixture of Panboreal (49 %), North her ican (34 %), and Aleutican (17 %) species. The Aleutican group was dominant in terms of biomass and numbers of individuals during the nonbreeding period. Forty-two species were confirmed breeding in the area and another 19 were suspected of breeding. The majority of birds occurred as migrants; 14 species were considered permanent residents and an additional 20 were winter residents. Our observations extended the known Alaska breeding distribution of American wigeon (Anus urnericana), <b>black</b> <b>turnstone</b> (Arenuriu melanocephalu), northern phalarope (Phuluropus loburus), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), western sandpiper (Culidris mauri), dunlin (C. alpinu), horned puffin (Fraterculu corniculara), tufted puffin (Lundu cirrhura), and orange-crowned warbler (Vermivoru celura). Our observations also extended the known postbreeding range or significantly changed the known status of bar-tailed godwit (Limosu lupponicu), whimbrel (Numenius phueopus), lesser yellowlegs (TringaJavipes), long-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus solopuceus), dunlin (Culidris alpinu), marbled murrelet (Bruchyrumphus marmorurus), American robin (Turdus migrutorius), yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroicu coronuru), and dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemulis). The area is a principal late summer and fall molting and staging area for several species of arctic and subarctic nesting waders and seaducks and emperor geese (Anser cunagica). From late September through mid-October the density of water birds over the entire littoral and nearshore area approached loo 0 birds km- 2.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2000 Patterns {{of species}} assemblages are often {{influenced}} by habitat variables. I used nested subset analysis {{to determine if}} wintering shorebird assemblages at 19 sites on Humboldt Bay have a significantly nested pattern. I then analyzed species diversity, individual species' densities, and species' incidences {{in relation to the}} following habitat characteristics: mudflat width, channelization, standing water, ebb height, and sediment particle size. An additional variable, length of tide-line (analogous to area surveyed) was analyzed for diversity and incidence, and variability of the sediment was added to the diversity analysis as a measure of habitat complexity. I found a significantly nested pattern that was not caused by random sampling. Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana), Spotted Sandpiper (Actitis macularia), and <b>Black</b> <b>Turnstone</b> (Arenaria melanocephala) were species that detracted disproportionately from the nested pattern. These species have specialized habitat requirements suggesting a link between habitat use and nestedness. Diversity was most strongly correlated with tide-line and substrate variability. Standing water, ebb height, sediment particle size, and tide-line were the most frequently occurring variables in the density and incidence models. All species analyzed had significant (P < 0. 1) incidence models. In the two most significant density models yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca and T. flavipes) correlated negatively with ebb height (P = 0. 0026) and Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus) correlated positively with channelization and ebb height (P = 0. 014). Two of the most abundant species, Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) had the poorest correlations with habitat variables. I found that wintering shorebird communities using Humboldt Bay are influenced by physical characteristics of the mudflats. I recommend additional study on the mechanisms that affect shorebird use of sites to aid in protecting Humboldt Bay as an important wintering and migratory stopover site for large numbers of shorebirds...|$|E
