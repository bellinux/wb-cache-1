5|$|Ever 17 {{is set in}} Japan, in the {{underwater}} marine theme park LeMU, 51 meters <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artificial island Insel Null. After an incident, almost half of LeMU is flooded, and {{the path to the}} surface and the communication lines are cut off, trapping the game's characters inside. In addition, LeMU is under large water pressure, limiting time to find a means of escape to 119 hours.|$|E
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend {{the shores of the}} lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

However, the errors are very different between the techniques, and combining them thus allows for correction of some of this noise.|$|E
25|$|The Asian date mussel is {{generally}} found in sheltered mud or other soft substrates up to twenty metres <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. In China and Japan, the native mussel {{is found in}} intertidal zones with densities up to 2500 individuals per square metre. In Australia, the invasive species is found from 0.5 to 4 metres <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water in slightly higher densities.|$|E

25|$|The water cycle, is the {{continuous}} movement of water on, above, and <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various {{places in the}} water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.|$|E

25|$|Unlike their pliosauroid cousins, plesiosauroids (with the {{exception}} of the Polycotylidae) were probably slow swimmers. It is likely that they cruised slowly <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, using their long flexible neck to move their head into position to snap up unwary fish or cephalopods. Their four-flippered swimming adaptation may have given them exceptional maneuverability, so that they could swiftly rotate their bodies as an aid to catching prey.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, {{the lake}} {{is home to a}} mysterious sea creature, known as the Lake Van Monster which is {{believed}} by some to lurk <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake, described as being 30-40 ft long with brown scaly skin and with a elongated reptilian head and flippers, resembling an extinct mosasaurus or basilosaurus. Apart from some amateur photographs and videos, there is no physical evidence to prove its existence.|$|E

25|$|Most {{coral reefs}} exist in shallow waters less than 50 m deep. Some inhabit {{tropical}} continental shelves where cool, nutrient rich upwelling does not occur, such as Great Barrier Reef. Others {{are found in}} the deep ocean surrounding islands or as atolls, such as in the Maldives. The reefs surrounding islands form when islands subside into the ocean, and atolls form when an island subsides <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
25|$|While the numbat has {{relatively}} powerful claws for its size, it is {{not strong}} enough to get at termites inside their concrete-like mounds, and so must wait until the termites are active. It uses a well-developed sense of smell to locate the shallow and unfortified underground galleries that termites construct between the nest and their feeding sites; these are usually only a short distance <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil, and vulnerable to the numbat's digging claws.|$|E
25|$|In {{vascular}} plants, {{the root}} is the organ {{of a plant}} that typically lies <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil. Roots can also be aerial or aerating, that is growing up above the ground or especially above water. Furthermore, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome). Therefore, the root is best defined as the non-leaf, non-nodes bearing parts of the plant's body. However, important internal structural differences between stems and roots exist.|$|E
