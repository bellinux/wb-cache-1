40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Interactions between paralytic {{shellfish}} poison (PSP) {{and components}} of the <b>butter</b> <b>clam</b> (Saxidomus giganteus) were studied to determine which component {{was involved in the}} binding and retention of PSP by the <b>butter</b> <b>clam,</b> and to characterize the nature and strength of the interaction. A simple and accurate assay for PSP in buffer and salt solutions was developed for this study using the Folin-Ciocalteau phenol reagent. Equilibrium dialysis binding experiments with PSP and bovine serum albumin or fibrinogen indicated that proteins did not interact significantly with PSP. Binding experiments with PSP and a <b>butter</b> <b>clam</b> siphon homogenate indicated an apparent electrostatic interaction between PSP and some component of the clam siphon homogenate, which was later identified as melanin. Synthetic and natural clam melanin interacted strongly with PSP, and the interaction was similar in nature to a cation exchange reaction. The interaction between PSP and melanin was rapid, reaching an equilibrium within one hour at 25 °C. The interaction was strongly influenced by pH; maximum binding took place at pH 6. 0 to 8. 0, but at pH 2. 0 to 3. 0 there was essentially no binding. The interaction was reversible and rapid desorption of bound PSP took place at pH 3. 0. The interaction was also affected by the presence of competing cations; tri-, di-, and monovalent cations, in that order of effectiveness, interfered with the binding and caused desorption of bound PSP. The anatomical distribution of melanin in butter clams paralleled the distribution of PSP, and PSP was apparently bound to melanin in toxic <b>butter</b> <b>clam</b> siphons. Butter clams, which retain PSP for longer periods than do other bivalve mollusks, had a higher rnelanin content in the interior walls of their siphons than the other mollusks studied. The close relationship between the distribution of PSP and of melanin in butter clams together with the observed electrostatic interaction between PSP and melanin suggest that melanin may {{play an important role in}} the retention of PSP in butter clams. The reversible nature of the PSP-melanin interaction in the presence of competing cations suggests that polyvalent salt solutions may be used in the detoxification of toxic butter clams...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} ecological approach provides unique {{insights into}} the relationship between humans and clams throughout the Holocene. Combing archaeological and palaeo-fossil records provides a time depth of clam history both with {{and in the absence}} of intensive human predation. These results show that <b>butter</b> <b>clam</b> (Saxidomus gigantea) growth was naturally improving from the early-to-mid Holocene and that humans took advantage of the expanding clam resources. Clam garden construction around 2, 000 BP promoted the sustainability of clams, and despite increased harvesting pressure there is no evidence for resource depression. Since European contact, decline of traditional management practices and increases in industrial activities have resulted in reduced clam growth rates. Growth rates of living clams reflect the stunted growth of post-glacial early Holocene clams, making them the slowest growing clams in the past ~ 10, 000 years. Deeper-time baselines more accurately represent clam population variability throughout time and are useful for modern coastal resource management...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Presentation date: 1981 - 09 - 29 A {{series of}} {{factorial}} experiments were conducted using eyed oyster larvae (Crassostrea gigas) reared at a commercial hatchery in Netarts, Oregon. The {{objectives of the}} study were to obtain the highest percentage of setting larvae and the best survival of the spat. Experiments on the combined effects of temperature and salinity indicated that temperature had a highly significant effect on the setting of Pacific oyster larvae. For temperatures ranging from 15 °- 30 °C, the percentage of larvae setting during a 48 -hour period increased as temperature increased. There {{was no significant difference in}} setting for salinities ranging from 15 - 30 ppt. In one setting experiment with Kumomoto larvae (a different variety of C. gigas), the differences among the sixteen combinations of temperature and salinity were statistically insignificant. Feeding larvae 120, 000 cells per milliliter of the alga Pseudoisochrysis paradoxa did not significantly improve setting during a 48 -hour period, and in one experiment temperature and feeding interacted to the detriment of setting. There was no significant difference in the percentages of attaching larvae when oyster, cockle, or <b>butter</b> <b>clam</b> shells were used as substrates. Dipping oyster or <b>butter</b> <b>clam</b> shells in an aqueous extract of oyster tissue improved setting, but the presence of the extract did not improve setting on razor or littleneck clam shells. Storing eyed larvae at 5 °C for several days before setting them appeared to increase the percentage of attaching larvae. The best temperature for setting stored larvae was 25 °C. Oyster larvae that attached to shell cultch during the setting experiments were held in a tank of raw seawater in the laboratory. After eight to nine months, the percentages of surviving spat were calculated. Survival was poor for larvae set at 15 °C, and there was some evidence of higher mortality among larvae stored for several days before being set. Because of the laboratory conditions, these studies may not have provided a realistic measure of spat survival under natural conditions, and field studies should be carried out to confirm these results...|$|E
50|$|Closer {{examination}} of the middens surrounding major house pits identified middens that were up to 1.3m deep, {{and in some cases}} over 2m deep. Over 67,000 vertebrate specimens, in total, of at least 59 species have been recovered from test pits at the site including bones from birds, fish, shellfish, sea lions, sea otters, seals, porpoises, whales, elk, deer, and beavers. Initial attempts to describe midden composition determined a rough 50:50 split between shells of blue clams and cockles, with <b>butter</b> <b>clams</b> and bent-nosed clams making up the rest. However, future investigations found over 14,000 Dungeness crab fragments in roughly 4m3 of excavated midden sediment. It was determined that Native Americans harvested a large size range of Dungeness crabs, including many juvenile crabs, from the bay. It is suspected crabs were collected along with cockles using a rake-like tool during low tide. It seems all major shellfish species found in the middens could be harvested throughout the course of a tidal cycle.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1971 <b>Butter</b> <b>clams</b> (Saxidomus giganteus) at South and North {{porpoise}} Islands and Pleasant Island, Southeast Alaska, were occasionally {{found to}} accumulate significant amounts (higher than the maximum human tolerance) of paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) at any {{season of the}} year, and to occasionally lose or regain PSP rapidly between two samplings. The fluctuations of toxicity levels were not similar at all stations and no consistent patterns were Observed. The toxicity of only 19 out of 53 samples collected at three high-toxicity stations exceeded the maximum human tolerance level for PSP (1200 MU), and clam samples taken from moderate and low-toxicity stations never exceeded this level. Neither phytoplankton populations nor hydrographic parameters had a consistently significant correlation with toxicity levels; however, fluctuations of phytoplankton numbers demonstrated an inverse relationship with fluctuations of inorganic nutrient concentrations. Dinoflagellate maxima tended to occur at relatively low salinity (22 % - 29 %) and relatively high temperatures (7 °C - 16 °C), whereas the diatom numbers did not significantly correlate with salinity or temperature. The three high-toxicity stations were all within Icy Passage; fluctuations of phytoplankton populations and the hydrographic conditions at these stations were similar, yet the fluctuations of toxicity levels were quite dissimilar. A number of possible sources {{may be responsible for}} the butter-clam toxicity in Southeast Alaska. However, more studies are needed to define the cause of the butter-clam poisoning problem in Southeast Alaska...|$|R
40|$|Studies using oxygen {{isotopes}} (δ 18 O) of mollusk shells {{to determine}} paleotemperature need to assume water δ 18 O values, which could severely influence calculated temperatures. We analyzed aragonitic shells of the <b>Butter</b> <b>Clam,</b> Saxidomus giganteus (DeShayes, 1839), {{to determine the}} reproducibility of the isotopic signal between individuals and to assess how precisely temperature could be calculated given known salinity and temperature. Furthermore, carbon isotopes are also investigated as an environmental proxy. The abundance of well-preserved S. giganteus shells in archeological and geological deposits in northwestern North America makes them a particularly suitable species for paleoclimate studies. Seasonally resolved stable oxygen isotope profiles in three S. giganteus shells collected from the same site in Puget Sound (Washington, USA) were well correlated (0. 77 S. giganteus do not grow during periods of reduced salinity. Despite the excellent reproducibility of δ 18 O between shells, {{and the fact that}} salinity effects were duly considered, calculated temperature still differed from instrumental temperature. Applying different salinity-δ 18 O water relationships to average shell δ 18 O, and considering salinity from the shell collection site and a nearby offshore station resulted in calculated average water temperatures ranging from 1. 7 to 6. 4 °C warmer than measured. Although we could not determine if S. giganteus precipitate their shells in isotopic equilibrium, we believe that the difficulty in predicting temperature arose from not being able to accurately determine δ 18 O of the water at the time of shell precipitation. These data highlight the difficulties inherent to using stable isotope profiles of estuarine biogenic carbonates as environmental proxies...|$|E
40|$|Indigenous {{communities}} have actively managed their environments for millennia using {{a diversity of}} resource use and conservation strategies. Clam gardens, ancient rock-walled intertidal beach terraces, represent one example of an early mariculture technology {{that may have been}} used to improve food security and confer resilience to coupled human-ocean systems. We surveyed a coastal landscape for evidence of past resource use and management to gain insight into ancient resource stewardship practices on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We found that clam gardens are embedded within a diverse portfolio of resource use and management strategies and were likely one component of a larger, complex resource management system. We compared clam diversity, density, recruitment, and biomass in three clam gardens and three unmodified nonwalled beaches. Evidence suggests that butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea) had 1. 96 times the biomass and 2. 44 times the density in clam gardens relative to unmodified beaches. This was due to a reduction in beach slope and thus an increase in the optimal tidal range where clams grow and survive best. The most pronounced differences in <b>butter</b> <b>clam</b> density between nonwalled beaches and clam gardens were found at high tidal elevations {{at the top of the}} beach. Finally, clam recruits (0. 5 - 2 mm in length) tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to nonwalled beaches and may be attributed to the addition of shell hash by ancient people, which remains on the landscape today. As part of a broader social-ecological system, clam garden sites were among several modifications made by humans that collectively may have conferred resilience to past communities by providing reliable and diverse access to food resources...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining food {{production}} while sustaining productive ecosystems {{is among the}} central challenges of our time, yet, {{it has been for}} millennia. Ancient clam gardens, intertidal rock-walled terraces constructed by humans during the late Holocene, are thought to have improved the growing conditions for clams. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the beach slope, intertidal height, and biomass and density of bivalves at replicate clam garden and non-walled clam beaches in British Columbia, Canada. We also quantified the variation in growth and survival rates of littleneck clams (Leukoma staminea) we experimentally transplanted across these two beach types. We found that clam gardens had significantly shallower slopes than non-walled beaches and greater densities of L. staminea and Saxidomus giganteus, particularly at smaller size classes. Overall, clam gardens contained 4 times as many <b>butter</b> <b>clams</b> and over twice as many littleneck clams relative to non-walled beaches. As predicted, this relationship varied as a function of intertidal height, whereby clam density and biomass tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to non-walled beaches at relatively higher intertidal heights. Transplanted juvenile L. staminea grew 1. 7 times faster and smaller size classes were more likely to survive in clam gardens than non-walled beaches, specifically at {{the top and bottom of}} beaches. Consequently, we provide strong evidence that ancient clam gardens likely increased clam productivity by altering the slope of soft-sediment beaches, expanding optimal intertidal clam habitat, thereby enhancing growing conditions for clams. These results reveal how ancient shellfish aquaculture practices may have supported food security strategies in the past and provide insight into tools for the conservation, management, and governance of intertidal seascapes today...|$|R

40|$|Variation in {{terrestrial}} mammalian craniodental morphology and skull {{shape is}} known to constrain feeding performance, which in turn influences dietary habits and ultimately fitness. Otters have evolved two feeding specializations: underwater raptorial capture of prey (mouth-oriented) and capture of prey by hand (hand-oriented), which likely correspond to craniodental morphology and bite performance. However, feeding biomechanics and performance data for otters, aquatic mustelids that consume prey above water, are sparse. The first goal {{of the study was}} to investigate the relationship between feeding morphology and bite performance between two mouth-oriented piscivores (giant river otters and North American river otters) and two hand-oriented invertebrate specialists (sea otters and Asian small-clawed otters) using morphometric approaches. The second goal was to investigate fluctuating asymmetry in the cranium of otters. The third goal was to characterize feeding mechanisms (kinematics and jaw musculature) and role of bite performance in the trophic ecology of sea otters. Mouth-oriented piscivores possessed longer skulls and mandibles, with jaws designed for increased velocity at the expense of bite capability. Hand-oriented possessed more blunt skulls and mandibles designed for increased bite capability. Sea otters displayed a greater degree of fluctuating asymmetry of the skull, which is likely linked to environmental stresses. Bite performance and durophagous feeding behavior in sea otters was characterized in detail in the feeding kinematics. Estimated bite forces of sea otters were large enough to crush all size classes of <b>butter</b> and littleneck <b>clams</b> tested in the lab. However, sea otters are size selective predators and generally choose bivalves of small to medium size. Medium sized <b>butter</b> and littleneck <b>clams</b> required an intermediate breaking force, and are buried at a shallower depth than larger clams. Clams requiring an intermediate breaking force could decrease consumption time, thus overall handling time...|$|R

40|$|This {{final report}} {{is the result}} of {{research}} during the five and one-half year period from September 1948 to March 1954. Throughout the investigation the apparent decline of sport fish was causing sport fishermen great concern. Among other factors, kelp harvesting was blamed for the poor catch of the sportsman. More than a year after the beginning of this investigation, the Kelco Company approached the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California, with the request that the problems of kelp cutting in relation to the fish supply be attacked by the University under a fellowship grant, by unprejudiced research. The Company wanted to determine whether the kelp operations were adversely affect­ing fishing, and if so, how harvesting methods might be altered to prevent this. The first phase of the program was concerned with observation and identification. Thousands of hours were spent above and below the surface observing the organisms in their own environment. Extensive use was made of scuba diving equipment for observations, collection, and placing of equipment. Underwater photography was developed to a point where many observations could be recorded. The second phase of the program was to appraise the effects of kelp harvesting on fish life. Because of the lack of pertinent published data on the ecology of the inshore waters, it was necessary to investigate not only the beds of the main commercial kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), but also many other regions, in order to obtain comparative data. Such areas included bays, rocky areas below the levels where kelp grows, rocky areas with no kelp, the surf zones, sandy areas, and regions outside the West Coast range of Macrocystis. Kelp beds were studied as far north as Monterey and as far south as the San Benito Islands, Baja California. Diving observations in the kelp were made at Monterey, Morro Bay, Goleta, Santa Barbara, Point Dume, Palos Verdes, Newport, Laguna, Dana Point, San Clemente, Del Mar, Solana Beach, La Jolla, Point Loma, Ensenada, Punta San Carlos, Punta Blanca, Punta Santa Rosalia, and numerous other points along the mainland; also at San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Catalina, Coronado, San Martin, and San Benito Islands. Intensive studies of the problem were carried out in Orange and San Diego Counties, with special concentra­tion on the nearby La Jolla kelp beds. One portion of the La Jolla kelp beds was left uncut as a control. Little difference has been noted in the fish life within the bed as contrasted with harvested beds. The kelp itself became more sparse, probably because of reduced light penetration through the heavy canopy that developed tem­porarily. In the 1952 - 53 winter season much of the kelp was de­stroyed by storms. These studies yielded a vast amount of information bearing not only on the kelp problem but also on the life ways of the fishes. As a result of these long and thorough studies, it is concluded that kelp harvesting, as cutrrently practiced, has no seriously detrimental effects on fishing. The various claims as {{to the ways in which}} kelp harvesting was supposed to destroy fish life and to decrease the fish catch were completely investi­gated and found to be in error. Spawning and nursery grounds of fish are not being destroyed. Sufficient cover and food are always available during and after harvesting. The kelp beds are not destroyed by harvesting methods. Harvesters do not frighten sportfish from an area. For several decades California has experienced a tremendous increase in population. Cities have grown where deserts and foothills were the homes of deer, rabbits, ground squirrels, ground owls, doves,and quail. In most places these animals have largely disappeared, and with them the intertidal mollusks — Pismo <b>clams,</b> <b>butter</b> <b>clams,</b> abalone, and many other species. The shore fishes such as corbina and spotfin croaker are less common in the individual fisherman's catch. Over kelp beds where a man might have fished alone a decade or two ago, we may see 50 sport boats with a total of 1000 anglers. Thus, even though the annual catch may be the same as or higher than 10 or 20 years ago, the catch per fisherman is much lower. The kelp industries have arisen indirectly from our social-economic needs for new raw materials to fill new markets. They have become established in our economy and are essential for the production of certain new products. As is typical of modern, young industries, they have conducted research to determine the maximum sustained yield. The industry naturally has no desire to destroy kelp. The sportfishing industry is large and provides recreation, necessary for our nation's health, to thousands of persons. With the addition of thou­sands of newcomers to sportfishing and the reduction of catch per unit of effort, it is not difficult to understand the fishermen's concern over factors supposedly destroying their sport. It is necessary, however, to determine the real reason for the apparent decline of fish before any constructive action can be taken. It may be a problem of overfishing or of natural population fluctuations, but the blame cannot be laid to the kelp harvesting...|$|R
