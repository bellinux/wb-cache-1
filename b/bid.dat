5|$|A BBC {{documentary}} entitled Panorama: Buying the Games, {{aired in}} August 2004, investigated {{the taking of}} bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The documentary claimed {{it was possible to}} bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their <b>bid</b> for the 2012 Summer Games, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoë specifically accused the British prime minister Tony Blair and the London <b>Bid</b> Committee (headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe) of breaking the <b>bid</b> rules. He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews regarding his involvement. The allegation was never fully explored. The Turin <b>bid</b> for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy. A prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, strongly connected with the rival <b>bid</b> of Sion, Switzerland, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation. The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion's <b>bid</b> and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In an {{agent-based}} {{online auction}} system, a <b>bidding</b> agent can automatically place <b>bids</b> {{on behalf of}} a human user according to a user-specified <b>bidding</b> strategy. Current implementations of <b>bidding</b> agents only support a set of simple predefined <b>bidding</b> strategies. In this paper, we introduce a formal <b>bidding</b> strategy model that supports specification of complex <b>bidding</b> strategies for autonomous <b>bidding</b> agents. The formal model is defined as a layered <b>bidding</b> strategy model (LBSM), which can be represented using notations adapted from UML activity diagrams. For real-time and efficient reasoning, the formal model is converted into a rule-based <b>bidding</b> strategy model (RBSM) represented in <b>bidding</b> strategy language (BSL), which can be directly executed by a reasoning module of an autonomous <b>bidding</b> agent. We present an algorithm for converting an LBSM to a rule-based <b>bidding</b> strategy model, and an algorithm to drive the reasoning engine. Finally, we develop a prototype agent-based online auction system using JADE, and demonstrate how layered <b>bidding</b> strategies can be precisely specified, and how our approach may support analysis of impacts on <b>bidding</b> histories by using different <b>bidding</b> strategies in agent-based online auctions.

40|$|In a {{competitive}} electricity market, generation companies design <b>bidding</b> strategies {{to maximize their}} individual profits subject to the constraints imposed by <b>bidding</b> rules. For a generation company, obviously, the optimal <b>bidding</b> strategy and hence the potential of exercising market power may be different if different <b>bidding</b> rules are employed. Hence, a well-designed <b>bidding</b> protocol {{is vital to the}} effective and efficient operation of an electricity market. Based on the widely used stepwise <b>bidding</b> rules, the impacts of different numbers of <b>bidding</b> segments on the <b>bidding</b> strategies of generation companies are investigated. This study is focused on a price-taker generation company in an electricity market. A probabilisic model is used to simulate electricity price in the competitive market environment. With a given number of <b>bidding</b> segments, the optimal <b>bidding</b> strategy for a price-taker generation company is then developed. The effects of risk preferences as well as information asymmetry on the optimal <b>bidding</b> strategy are also examined. With particular references to the impacts of different numbers of <b>bidding</b> segments on the optimal <b>bidding</b> strategy, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and methodology.

40|$|Abstract—Time-shiftable loads play an {{important}} role in creat-ing load flexibility and enhancing demand response and peak-load shaving programs. However, recent studies have suggested that time-shiftable loads may face load synchronization and market instability if they are deployed at high penetrations such that they become price maker. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a new demand <b>bidding</b> framework that recognizes the special characteristics of time-shiftable loads. The <b>bids</b> in this new <b>bidding</b> framework are called extended-time demand <b>bids.</b> They are either extended-time self-schedule <b>bids</b> or extended-time economic <b>bids.</b> The <b>bidding</b> concept, its visualization, and its mathematical representation are presented. Using the <b>bids</b> data in the California energy market, we show that the new <b>bidding</b> structure is beneficial not only to the power system as a whole but also to the consumers that are capable of shifting a portion of their loads. The new <b>bidding</b> structure also increases the market competitiveness due to expanding the competition domain and increasing demand elasticity with temporal dependencies...|$|R
