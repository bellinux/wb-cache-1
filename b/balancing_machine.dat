50|$|A blade <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> {{attempts}} to balance {{a part in}} assembly, so minimal correction is required later on.

50|$|Tires are {{balanced}} in factories and repair shops by two methods: static balancers and dynamic balancers. Tires with high unbalance forces are downgraded or rejected. When tires are fitted to wheels {{at the point}} of sale, they are measured again on a <b>balancing</b> <b>machine,</b> and correction weights are applied to counteract the combined effect of the tire and wheel unbalance. After sale, tires may be rebalanced if driver perceives excessive vibration. Balancing is {{not to be confused with}} wheel alignment.|$|E
50|$|Portable {{balancing}} {{machines are}} used to balance parts that cannot be taken apart {{and put on a}} <b>balancing</b> <b>machine,</b> usually parts that are currently in operation such as turbines, pumps, and motors. Portable balancers come with displacement sensors, such as accelerometers, and a photocell, which are then mounted to the pedestals or enclosure of the running part. Based on the vibrations detected, they calculate the part's unbalance. Many times these devices contain a spectrum analyzer so the part condition can be monitored without the use of a photocell and non-rotational vibration can be analyzed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> is a {{measuring}} tool used for balancing rotating machine parts such as rotors for electric motors, fans, turbines, disc brakes, disc drives, propellers and pumps. The machine usually {{consists of two}} rigid pedestals, with suspension and bearings on top supporting a mounting platform. The unit under test is bolted to the platform and is rotated either with a belt-, air-, or end-drive. As the part is rotated, the vibration in the suspension is detected with sensors and that information is {{used to determine the}} amount of unbalance in the part. Along with phase information, the machine can determine how much and where to add or remove weights to balance the part.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Balance</b> <b>Machine</b> is a newly {{proposed}} natural {{computational model}} {{that consists of}} components resembling physical balances. The model has only one operation, “balancing”, which suffices in principle to perform universal computation. An interesting feature of the <b>balance</b> <b>machine</b> is its bidirectional operation: it can compute “forwards and backwards”, i. e. both a function and its partial inverse can be computed spontaneously using the same machine. Also, the machine exhibits {{a different kind of}} parallelism—a “bilateral parallelism”. The aim of this note is two–fold: To introduce a formalism for computing with balance machines—a convenient notation for representing the mechanical model on paper, and to demonstrate its expressive power by solving two NP–complete problems, namely, Set Partition and Knapsack. 1 Computing without knowing how to count Standard theoretical formalisms and programming languages of mainstream computer science influence us to think of computation mainly in terms of arithmetic/logical operation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the normal}} {{operational}} {{life of a}} turbine, its rotor journal seating surfaces are wearing and therefore, repair operations, including turning and grinding of such surfaces and next rotor balancing on the <b>balancing</b> <b>machines,</b> are carried out. Traditional turbine rotors machining is provided by fixing them through the centers and demands the corresponding large size machine tools and the strategy «machine tool to rotor» is often used. To minimize mobilization and transportation cost, {{the problem of the}} turbine rotor restoration by using centerless grinding technique on the lightweight horizontal <b>balancing</b> <b>machines</b> is resolved. A computer simulation model of such grinding with workpieces located on their machining surfaces is presented. To validate the approaches, a proposed computer simulation was carried out.

50|$|Dynamic {{balance of}} in-line 4's {{requires}} a weight matched set of pistons and con-rods. The con-rods must be matched for rotating {{mass of the}} big end taken to be lower 1/3 of the rod and reciprocating mass of little end taken to be the other 2/3. It {{is not possible to}} install the rods and pistons on the crank in a dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine.</b> Even if it was, any rotating out of balance would be undetectable due to the secondary out balance. All cranks are balanced at manufacture to OEM spec, this is adequate for domestic use. As performance cars are usually stripped of interior and have harder suspension the vibration from the engine becomes less of a consideration so balancing to better than OEM spec is of little worth. If a crank has been re-worked then it needs re-balancing to OEM spec.|$|E
50|$|Static balance can be {{measured}} by a static <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> where the tire is placed in its vertical axis on a non-rotating spindle tool. The spot on the tire with the greatest mass is acted upon by gravity to deflect the tooling downward. The amount of deflection indicates {{the magnitude of the}} unbalance. The angle of the deflection indicates the angular location of the unbalance. In tire manufacturing factories, static balancers operate by use of sensors mounted to the spindle assembly. In tire retail shops, static balancers are usually non-rotating bubble balancers, where the magnitude and angle of the unbalance is observed by looking at the center bubble in an oil-filled glass sighting gauge. While some very small shops which lack specialized machines still do this process, they have been largely replaced in larger shops with machines.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic balance {{describes}} the forces generated by asymmetric mass distribution when the tire is rotated, usually {{at a high}} speed. In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> test wheel, the assembly is accelerated up to a speed of 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces of unbalance are measured by sensors as the tire rotates. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for {{the inner and outer}} planes of the wheel, and compared to the unbalance tolerance (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits). If the tire is not checked, {{it has the potential to}} wobble and perform poorly. In tire retail shops, tire/wheel assemblies are checked on a spin-balancer, which determines the amount and angle of unbalance. Balance weights are then fitted to the outer and inner flanges of the wheel. Dynamic balance is better (it is more comprehensive) than static balance alone, because both couple and static forces are measured and corrected.|$|E

50|$|In soft ground, {{there are}} three main types of TBMs: Earth Pressure <b>Balance</b> <b>Machines</b> (EPB), Slurry Shield (SS) and {{open-face}} type. Both types of closed machines operate like Single Shield TBMs, using thrust cylinders to advance forward by pushing off against concrete segments. Earth Pressure <b>Balance</b> <b>Machines</b> are used in soft ground with less than 7 bar of pressure. The cutter head does not use disc cutters only, but instead an combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide disc cutters, drag picks and/or hard rock disc cutters. The EPB gets its name because it uses the excavated material to balance the pressure at the tunnel face. Pressure is maintained in the cutterhead by controlling the rate of extraction of spoil through the Archimedes screw and the advance rate. Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to increase {{the stability of the}} ground. Additives can also be injected in the cutterhead/extraction screw to ensure that the spoil remains sufficiently cohesive to form a plug in the Archimedes screw to maintain pressure in the cutterhead and restrict water flowing through.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. swing frame) of vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machine’s swing frame. The static unbalance and couple unbalance can be separated effectively by using the new dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> with the new swing frame. The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine.</b> The new dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> can measure static unbalance and couple unbalance directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machines, in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior. The vertical dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> with the new vibration structure can be widely used in the future application...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{at the request of}} the USDOE/AL Dynamic Balancer Project Team to develop a set of representative accident sequences initiated by rapid seizure of the spindle shaft of the Schenck dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> used in the mass properties testing activities in Bay 12 - 60 at the Pantex Plant. This Balancer is used for balancing reentry vehicles. In addition, the study identified potential causes of possible spindle-shaft seizure leading to a rapid deceleration of the rotating assembly. These accident sequences extend to the point that the reentry vehicle either remains in stable condition on the <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> or leaves the machine with some translational and rotational motion. Fault-tree analysis was used to identify possible causes of spindle-shaft seizure, and failure modes and effects analysis identified the results of shearing of different machine components. Cause-consequence diagrams were used to help develop accident sequences resulting from the possible effects of spindle-shaft seizure. To make these accident sequences physically reasonable, the analysts used idealized models of the dynamics of rotating masses. Idealized physical modeling also was used to provide approximate values of accident parameters that lead to branching down different accident progression paths. The exacerbating conditions of <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> over-speed and improper assembly of the fixture to the face plate are also addressed...|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>balancing</b> <b>machine</b> is {{proposed}} which uses a dynamic vibration absorber as a device measuring unbalance. When an unbalanced rotor rotates, centrifugal forces are generated which result in sinusoidal forces being transmitted to the supporting structure. An undamped dynamic vibration absorber {{is attached to the}} structure in the proposed machine. When it is tuned to resonate at the test rotational speed, the structure does not move at all; the auxiliary system vibrates {{in such a way that}} the phase angle between the displacement of auxiliary mass and the sinusoidal force is exactly 180 degrees and that the product of the auxiliary mass and the amplitude of its vibration is equal to the amount of unbalance. Therefore, the motion of the auxiliary mass provides sufficient information for balancing the rotor. The principles and features of the proposed machine are investigated, and experiments are carried out using the developed apparatus.
