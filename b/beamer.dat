5|$|Virginia Tech's {{coaching}} staff drew media attention {{when it was}} announced that Virginia Tech head football coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> was being actively recruited by Clemson to assume that school's vacant head coaching job. <b>Beamer</b> was first contacted about the job during the regular season, and he was mentioned in connection with Clemson's search throughout the final two weeks of the regular season. He also was mentioned as a possibility for South Carolina's vacant head-coaching job. Three days after Virginia Tech was selected for the Music City Bowl, <b>Beamer</b> ended speculation by publicly turning down Clemson and South Carolina. In exchange for publicly rebuffing the offers, Virginia Tech rewarded <b>Beamer</b> with financial additions to his contract and a contract extension through 2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beamer</b> {{himself was}} {{the object of}} some off-field {{controversy}} when Georgia considered offering him its head football coaching job during the days prior to the Sugar Bowl. <b>Beamer</b> denied any interest in the position, and the controversy abated when Georgia hired Glen Mason as its head coach on December 18. Mason later changed his mind, and Georgia hired Jim Donnan instead.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> was ranked third. <b>Beamer</b> had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, <b>Beamer</b> was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Beamer's</b> posthumous daughter, Morgan Kay, {{was born}} January 9, 2002, {{four months after}} <b>Beamer's</b> death. The President and First Lady Laura Bush were among those who sent letters to Morgan upon her birth.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>Beamer's</b> playing career, {{he became}} a {{graduate}} assistant at Georgia Tech under George O'Leary. <b>Beamer's</b> team was scheduled to play against his father in the 2000 Black Coaches Association Classic to open the season, but the game was canceled because of lightning and Georgia Tech refused to reschedule it.|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{coaching}} changes {{came about}} a month after the Orange Bowl. On February 14, the school announced that the son of head coach Frank <b>Beamer,</b> Shane <b>Beamer,</b> had been hired as running backs coach. He replaced Billy Hite, the longest-tenured assistant coach in the country, who took an administrative role with the team. Two days later, Tech replaced 62-year-old linebackers coach Jim Cavanaugh with 35-year-old Cornell Brown. On February 22, Tech announced that offensive coordinator Bryan Stinespring had been removed from play-calling duties and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike O'Cain. Stinespring, who also was the team's associate head coach, was replaced in that capacity by Shane <b>Beamer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both Virginia Tech and Clemson endured {{questions}} about their coaching staffs {{in the weeks and}} months prior to the Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> was interviewed by North Carolina prior to the end of the regular season, and he debated whether or not to accept that school's head football coaching job. On November 27, one week before Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl, <b>Beamer</b> announced that he would not be departing for North Carolina or any other school. <b>Beamer</b> also was considered for the vacant head-coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins, but he also declined that position. Other Virginia Tech football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head-coaching positions. Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle was interviewed for a job at Toledo, but he declined the position. Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster was interviewed for the head-coaching job at Virginia, but he likewise declined the job.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day prior}} to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11.5 points. Despite that advantage, Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> warned his team and {{the public about the}} threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies' chances of winning. Both <b>Beamer</b> and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while <b>Beamer</b> had coached for 16 years. The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time since}} 1999. Ticket sales {{prior to the}} game were sluggish, as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold. In addition, local media coverage of the game was very sparse.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December, Virginia Tech's offensive preparations for the Gator Bowl were disrupted when offensive coordinator Gary Tranquill abruptly quit the team in order to join friend Nick Saban, who had been hired as the head coach at Michigan State. Virginia Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> announced simultaneous with Tranquill's departure that assistant head coach Billy Hite would control the offense during the Gator Bowl. Shortly after the announcement of Tranquill's departure, Virginia Tech announced that former offensive coordinator Ricky Bustle would be returning to the team to fill the position after the Gator Bowl. Though {{he was not able}} to actively coach the team during the Gator Bowl, Bustle offered advice and strategy to <b>Beamer</b> during the weeks before the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of their achievements {{during the regular season}} and during the 2000 Sugar Bowl, multiple players and coaches from each team earned awards and recognition after the conclusion of the game. Tech quarterback Michael Vick, despite leading the losing team in the Sugar Bowl, won an ESPY for college football player of the year on February 14, more than a month after the Sugar Bowl. In addition, Virginia Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> won multiple coach of the year awards, most notably the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, which was presented to <b>Beamer</b> on March 6. One of Beamer's assistant coaches, Bud Foster, was named the top defensive coordinator in Division I-A football by American Football Coach Magazine in its annual award. Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke won the 2000 Heisman Trophy after the conclusion of the 2000 college football season.|$|E

5|$|On Virginia Tech's {{first night}} in New Orleans, redshirt center Keith Short missed the team's 2 a.m. curfew. In response, Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> ushered Short to the local Greyhound bus depot and put the player on a bus {{to his home in}} Richmond. The move was part of Beamer's attempt to keep his players focused on the {{upcoming}} game and not be distracted by the attractions of New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|The No.22 Virginia Tech Hokies {{came into}} the 1993 Independence Bowl with an 8–3 regular-season record that {{included}} wins over Pittsburgh and Virginia. The bowl appearance was the first for head coach Frank <b>Beamer,</b> who had turned the team around after a 2–8–1 season the previous year. Facing the Hokies were the No. 21 Indiana Hoosiers, who were playing in their first bowl game since the 1991 Copper Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Alabama's post-touchdown kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. Stith ran ahead for a five-yard gain on first down, then broke free on second down for a 38-yard run to the Alabama 36-yard line. Once there, Clark threw an {{incomplete}} pass and Ferguson ran for a two-yard gain. On third down, Clark scrambled for a six-yard gain. Facing fourth down, <b>Beamer</b> sent in Graham to attempt a 44-yard field goal. The kick was good, and with 6:41 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech regained the lead, 107.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket a No ball is a penalty against the fielding team, usually {{as a result of}} an illegal {{delivery}} by the bowler. For most cricket games, especially amateur games, the definition of all forms of No ball is from the MCC Laws of Cricket, although youth cricket often has stricter rules on <b>beamers,</b> and international cricket has stricter rules on <b>beamers</b> but laxer rules on bouncers.|$|R

5000|$|During <b>Beamer's</b> {{tenure at}} Virginia Tech, putting {{points on the}} {{scoreboard}} has become a full team effort with the offensive, defensive and special teams units. Often when the team scores one or more non-offensive touchdowns, the style of play is described as [...] "Beamerball". Since <b>Beamer's</b> first season in 1987, a player at every position on the defensive unit has scored at least one touchdown, and 35 different players have scored touchdowns on Virginia Tech's special teams.|$|R
5|$|As {{successful}} as Kansas' offense was, {{it was the}} Jayhawks' special teams (beating Virginia Tech coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> at his own game) that earned them the victory. Kansas blocked one Virginia Tech field goal, and caused Tech kicker Jud Dunlevy to miss another short. Kansas punter Kyle Tucker {{did an excellent job}} pinning Virginia Tech deep in its own end of the field, kicking the ball five times for a total of 250yards, averaging 50yards a punt. His longest punt, a 62-yard kick, was one of three punts that were downed inside Tech's 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's victory {{raised it}} {{to a final}} record of 84, and Virginia Tech's loss brought it also to a final record of 84. Following the loss, the Hokies had a 510 record in bowl games, {{including}} 13 in the Gator Bowl and 45 in bowl games under head coach Frank <b>Beamer.</b> Florida State's victory gave Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden the 322nd win of his career, tying him for second in the overall Division I career wins list with Bear Bryant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following {{the announcement of the}} matchup, ticket sales diverged. By December 12, Cincinnati sold about 9,000 tickets. This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> star in a video asking Hokies fans to buy tickets to the game. Owing to limited demand for tickets, prices in the secondary market plunged.|$|E

5|$|Reamon, who {{had helped}} guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia, helped Michael with his SATs and helped {{him and his family}} choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech. Reamon favored Virginia Tech, where he felt better {{guidance}} was available under Frank <b>Beamer,</b> who promised to redshirt him and provide the freshman needed time to develop. Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech. As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand, Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story.|$|E
5|$|Several coaches {{from each}} team were fired or {{moved on to}} other jobs in the offseason {{following}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl. Virginia Tech co-defensive coordinator Rod Sharpless resigned to become the defensive coordinator at Rutgers University. Tech defensive line coach Todd Grantham was replaced by Charley Wiles after Grantham resigned to take the same job at Michigan State. To prevent Virginia Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> from likewise seeking a different position, the school signed him to a new five-year contract at a salary of more than $148,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down and one yard. After the Tech offense picked up one first down, it was unable to gain another. Facing a fourth down and needing fiveyards for a first down at the Air Force 29-yard line, Tech head coach Frank <b>Beamer</b> elected to try to gain the first down instead of trying a long field goal. Bryan Randall was sacked for a loss of 10yards, however, and the Hokies turned the ball over to Air Force after failing to gain the first down.|$|E
