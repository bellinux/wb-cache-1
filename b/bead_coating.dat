METHODS: Latex <b>bead</b> <b>coating</b> was adjusted to give maximum sensitivity by attending to latex size, MPO to latex ratio for coupling, ratio of diluted serum to MPO-latex, reaction {{time and temperature}} for coupling, and reaction time for agglutination. Inhibition studies were performed using MPO, proteinase 3, bactericidal/permeability increasing protein, and lactoferrin. RESULTS: There was very good correlation between this test and the conventional anti-MPO enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) : 81 % of sera positive in the ELISA were positive by MPO-LSAT. MPO-LSAT results correlated better with IgM anti-MPO than with IgG anti-MPO.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA), chosen as the model protein, was covalently immobilized to the amine latex beads using glutaraldehyde as cross-linker. The adhesion of BSA-coated latex beads to stainless steel was then examined under a well-controlled physico-chemical environment, using a shear stress flow chamber. The shear-induced detachment of beads was analysed by testing three different microbeads/stainless steel systems: bare latex beads, activated latex beads with poly(glutaraldehyde) and BSA-coated latex beads in adhesive contact with stainless steel. The suspending medium used for detachment was representative of seawater in terms of pH and ionic strength. Adhesion was quantified through two complementary parameters: the wall shear stress threshold needed to cause 2 % bead detachment (τW 2 %) and the wall shear stress required to remove 50 % of the initially adhered bead (τW 50 %). Zeta potential measurements, paired with protein quantification, indicated that the coating density was weak. Nevertheless, the BSA-coated latex beads promoted an increased adhesion compared to bare beads, which was demonstrated by higher τW 2 % and τW 50 % values (τW 2 %= 15. 9 ± 8. 1 Pa and 39. 4 ± 10. 7 Pa; τW 50 %= 41. 4 ± 7. 9 and 73. 5 ± 14. 8 Pa for bare and BSA-coated beads, respectively).

Immunochemical measurement of lactoferrin (LF) from specific granules and myeloperoxidas (MPO) from azurophil granules showed that both classes of granule degranulated. Beads with soluble complexes of human anti-pigeon IgG-normal pigeon IgG, prepared from serum of a patient with pigeon breeders disease, induced significantly greater degranulation than did pigeon IgG-coated beads. Up to 40 % of LF in the PMN degranulated during phagocytic challenge and 86 % of that entered the extracellular fluid. Twenty to 30 % of the MPO degranulated, but less than 50 % of that entered the extracellular fluid. The degranulated LF and MPO which remained in the PMN were recovered from phagocytic vacuoles. Beads coated with purified human myeloma proteins (12 different ones, three of each subclass) induced degranulation in the order IgG 3 greater than IgG 1 greater than IgG 2 greater than IgG 4; however, these differences {{were found to be}} a function of the amount of latex ingested. Thus, the amount of degranulation was dependent more on the opsonizing capacity of the immunoglobulins rather than on their intrinsic capacities for inducing degranulation. Degranulation of both LF and MPO {{in response to}} IgG subclasses followed patterns similar to those caused by soluble immune complexes, and IgG 3 coated on beads caused degranulation equal to that caused by human complex-coated beads. Degranulation to IgG 3 and IgG 4 was uninfluenced by fresh compared with heat-inactivated human AB serum. This was true although IgG 3 beads fixed greater than sixfold more complement than did IgG 4 beads. Evidently human IgG subclasses enhance phagocytosis and degranulation of human PMN.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with flows relating to the continuous coating of multiple layers on moving webs using the slide bead process. The lowermost layer is generally known as a carrier layer when the viscosity and flow rate are both small compared with the corresponding properties of the other layers. This study is predominantly experimental in nature and broad in scope as addressing issues relating to an industrial slide coating process used for the manufacture of photographic products and inkjet media. Novel specialist pieces of equipment have been designed and built for visualizing such flows {{as part of this}} work. The studies have been carried out using a pilot coating machine and ancillary flow control facilities currently owned by HARMAN technology Limited. The new techniques enable fresh insight into the interaction between the carrier layer and the surface properties of the substrate, including roughness, surface free energy, electric charge and porosity - an area of investigation that has hitherto been largely ignored. The behaviour of the bead when coating embossed webs showing a "stippled" finish is of particular interest when compared with apparently equally rough substrates of equivalent surface energy. Increasing slide angle is shown to be advantageous to expanding the coating window for difficult substrates. The results show that the widely perceived criteria for a carrier layer needs to be redefined when coating rough surfaces of low surface energy using this process. Charge assisted coating is shown likely to be superior to conventional slide <b>bead</b> <b>coating</b> for minimising waste due to streaks. The studies include the visualisation of flows at the slot exit and on the slide. The methods allow the profile of the interface as well as the free surface to be monitored and give new insight into two major unreported effects limiting the use of a thin low viscosity carrier layer. The scope also extends to the study of waves induced in the surface of wet multi-layer coatings when subjected to the impact of air from an impingement dryer - an area of considerable interest to the coating technologist yet largely ignored by the equipment supplier.

40|$|The {{historical}} design {{approach for}} ensuring survivability in devices that operate at high voltages which would arc in air or that must survive substantial shock loadings employs an encapsulant whose dielectric strength prevents electrical breakdown and whose modulus prevents gross {{movement of the}} embedded components. While mostly successful, this approach presents some significant design challenges: (1) the high thermal expansion of the epoxy leads to large stresses during thermal cycles, (2) degassing of the epoxy before cure and careful encapsulation are essential to eliminate voids that could initiate dielectric breakdown, (3) the internal components are embedded deep within an impenetrable encapsulant and “removable” options have proven somewhat problematic, (4) the filled epoxy encapsulant adds weight. It is {{the intent of this}} study to develop a new design strategy that will eliminate these issues resulting in a cost effective, lighter and more robust component with fewer defects. The new paradigm rests on employing two materials, instead of just one, to achieve the desired effect. First, a thin coating applied to the board will provide both dielectric breakdown protection and/or support for components on boards. Second, a foam encapsulation will provide both bulk rigidity and damping in shock environments. This two-stage approach lessens dielectric requirements of the bulk encapsulant and shifts them to the coating. It also affords greater flexibility in optimizing materials and processing properties to achieve design objectives and enhanced manufacturability. Commercially available coatings have been chosen for the study to span a wide variety of application techniques and performance requirements. A standardized test, ASTM D 149, was conducted on each coating to quantitatively compare dielectric coating strength at both room temp and a severe aging environment. For certain coatings it is proven that the dielectric strength degrades in a humid environment. These coatings were also placed on printed circuit board geometries with and without components and tested extensively using both DC and pulsed AC testing systems developed specifically for this study. In the absence of a coating, i. e., a bare board in an ambient air atmosphere, breakdown occurs at 10 kV or less. For one of the geometries explored in this study, the results have shown that thin coatings of less than 5 mils (. 127 mm) prevent breakdown up to or exceeding the 80 kV or higher for flat wire traces. If, in addition to the thin coating, a <b>bead</b> <b>coating</b> is applied to high voltage electrical components with topographical contours, the breakdown voltage is in the 40 - 60 kV range for component gaps of 0. 05 to 0. 425 in. The use of a polyurethane foam encapsulant results in breakdown voltages of 50 - 70 kV for the same component gaps as long as the gap between components is not small enough to prevent the foam from filling it. Combining a foam and coating as the packaging can increase the breakdown voltage range to 50 - 80 kV for these component gaps. The adhesion strength of the polymer coatings was also characterized in its original state and after aging in a humid environment. In many cases, adhesion strength is known to degrade in humid environments. The adhesion strength of the coatings to the printed circuit board interface is considerably lower than that found for epoxy bonds using epoxy adhesives of equivalent glass transition temperatures. Foam adhesion to the coatings was also characterized. Adhesion between the packaging foam and coatings was found to be either maximized at 249 psi or minimized at 48 psi depending on the coating chosen. Contact angle measurements were made to study wetting ability. Equilibrium contact angles for all coatings on solder mask are reached in less than 3 minutes. The results of this study demonstrate the viability of this novel packaging strategy. Sandia National Lab...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies from}} this {{laboratory}} have utilized latex beads as probes of embryonic migratory pathways. After microinjection into embryos {{at the time}} of neural crest migration, uncoated latex polystyrene beads were found to translocate to ventral sites and to settle in the vicinity of endogenous neural crest derivatives. However, latex <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with fibronectin did not translocate ventrally, but remained associated with cells surrounding the implantation site. Fibronectin is a large glycoprotein with a variety of biological activities and multiple binding domains. Here, the binding activities which might be responsible for immobilization of the fibronectin-coated beads are examined. Latex <b>beads</b> were <b>coated</b> with three types of fragments of the fibronectin molecule representing different functional domains: (i) a 66 -kDa fragment containing collagen-binding activity; (ii) a mixture of 45 - and 32 -kDa fragments containing heparin-binding activity; and (iii) a 120 -kDa fragment containing cell-binding activity. The <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with fibronectin fragments were injected into the newly formed trunk somites of avian embryos. After injection, <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with either the heparin- or the collagen-binding domain translocated ventrally and distributed analogously to uncoated latex beads.

The cell-binding fragment, however, was not as effective as the intact fibronectin molecule in preventing translocation of the beads. The results suggest that the cell-binding domain is primarily responsible for restriction of fibronectin beads from the ventral neural crest pathway. Because intact fibronectin is more effective at immobilizing beads than is the cell-binding fragment, other binding domains of fibronectin, more efficient coating with intact fibronectin, or crosslinking of intact fibronectin molecules may also play some role in immobilization of the beads at the implantation site...|$|R
40|$|In chapter I {{a general}} {{introduction}} {{is given to}} the field of pharmaceutical nanosuspensions and nanocrystals. The reasons for the production of nanoparticles and their benefits are highlighted as well as the different production methods that yield nanoparticles. In general the production of nanosized particles can increase the dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble drugs if the resulting particles are properly stabilized against agglomeration. As nanoparticles are most often produced as suspensions, a drying step is necessary to obtain the more favored solid dosage forms. Chapter II describes the aims and objectives of this project. In short, research was performed to prove the feasibility of fluid bed coating as a drying technique. Experiments were also performed to obtain more information about the stabilization of nanosuspensions before and after drying. Chapter II also gives an overview of the model components used in the project. The feasibility of fluid bed coating of nanosuspensions as a drying technique is the main topic of chapter III. Nanosuspensions containing Naproxen or Cinnarizine were coated on inert sugar cores using a fluid bed coater with Würster insert. The suspensions were prepared using media milling. The influence of the significantly different physicochemical properties of both drugs on the coating process and the dissolution was also assessed. Bead layering of Cinnarizine nanosuspensions stabilized with the surfactant TPGS or the polymer HPMC resulted in a complete dissolution after only 15 minutes. Unmilled Cinnarizine powder that was tested as a reference only dissolved up to 11 % in one hour. Naproxen formulations dissolve 3 times faster than the original unmilled powder also proving the feasibility of the process. Suspensions containing only TPGS as a stabilizer had to be complemented with HPMC to form a proper coating. This proves that the addition of a coating agent (HPMC for example) makes it possible to coat suspensions containing a stabilizer that does not act as a coating agent. A difference could be observed between both drugs in chapter III. Cinnarizine nanocrystals reagglomerate when released from the coating, resulting in a slower dissolution when compared to the original nanosuspension. No agglomeration and no delay could be observed for Naproxen. The difference in performance between both compounds most probably lies in their different physicochemical properties and more specifically in the more hydrophobic crystal surface of Cinnarizine. Careful investigation of the agglomeration data showed that the tendency to reagglomerate could be lowered by adding more surfactant to the coating. The most important characteristic of nanoparticulate systems is the high drug dissolution rate resulting in sufficient bioavailability after oral administration. It is therefore very important to be able to accurately monitor the extremely fast dissolution rate of nanosuspensions. The aim of chapter IV was to evaluate solution calorimetry as a novel approach to measure the dissolution rate of nanosuspensions by recording the temperature change in the dissolution vessel during the dissolution process of the nanocrystals. The feasibility was tested on nanosuspensions containing three different model drugs: Naproxen, Cinnarizine and an investigational API, i. e. "compound A". The dissolution process of all nanosuspensions investigated was completed in about 30 seconds. Because of the fast data acquisition (one data point every second) it is possible to plot the whole dissolution profile. The important drawback of this technique is that it measures the total heat produced or consumed by all processes that occur during the dissolution. Although only the heat of dissolution should be measured, interaction between drug and stabilizer could also be measured or the heat of dilution can influence the measurement. Erroneous conclusions will result if phenomena other than dissolution are not accounted for and this requires stringent controls. However for systems without interference the method proved to be reproducible and accurate. One of the benefits of nanocrystals is their positive effect on the solubility and dissolution rate without alterations to the solid-state. Up to now amorphization of nanocrystals after milling or drying has only rarely been described. The aim for chapter V was to test whether or not amorphization occurs and to identify the cause if amorphous material was found. The results presented in this chapter prove that amorphization can occur in specific cases. This conclusion is based on careful investigation of two different drugs (Naproxen and Cinnarizine) and one polymeric stabilizer (HPMC). Milling is often mentioned as the prime suspect for solid-state alterations (chapter I), however milling proved to be an unlikely cause as the water present in the nanosuspensions acts as a plasticizer that potentially can trigger recrystallization. The origin of the amorphization can instead be found in the interplay between drug and stabilizer after drying. The results obtained prove that if a drug is soluble in the stabilizer in the solid-state an amorphous solid dispersion is formed at the interface. In general those results prove that in depth testing and characterization of the solid state of a dried nanocrystal formulation remains very important as amorphous material could pose stability issues. The testing of nanocrystals using thermal analysis (as is common practice), however proved not to be straightforward. The melting of crystals is also determined {{by the size of the}} crystals and if additionally also the melting point depression due to the presence of stabilizers is not taken into account, the conclusions obtained from the thermal analysis data could be wrong as illustrated in chapter V. In chapter III an alternative drying technique was described but also other drying procedures like spray drying and freeze drying are commonly used (chapter I). However it is currently not known if the stabilizer remains associated with the surface after drying. In chapter VI the association of the stabilizer with the particle surface was studied after drying but also in suspension to find a correlation. The possible association of two common pharmaceutical stabilizers (HPMC 2910 5 mPa. s and PVPK 90) with the surface of Naproxen crystals after drying was studied by evaluating the mixing Tg using modulated differential scanning calorimetry. Dynamic laser scattering was used to study the Naproxen-polymer association in suspension state. It was possible to prove association with the Naproxen surface after drying for both polymers. A difference in behavior between HPMC and PVP was however observed at the liquid-particle interface. In suspension state the HPMC layer continuously increases in thickness when adding more polymer, while in contrast for PVP the surface can become saturated. The conclusion of this chapter is that the behavior in suspension determines the behavior of the stabilizer after drying and it is governed by the physicochemical properties of the polymers. But maybe more important, it also proves that stabilizers remain associated to the surface after drying, which is important for the prevention of reagglomeration on redispersion. In chapter VII the obtained results are all critically discussed in relation to each other and to the relevant literature. The obtained results give a valuable insight in stabilizer behavior and prove the feasibility of <b>bead</b> <b>coating</b> as a drying technique. However in our opinion further research will be needed and the most important challenge in the field of nanosuspensions and nanocrystals lies in the rational selection of the appropriate stabilizer. status: publishe...|$|E

However, <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with a tyrosine-sulfated, sLeX-modified, PSGL- 1 -Fc chimera support slower rolling on P-selectin than <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with sLeX alone, suggesting that sulfation improves rolling adhesion by modulating binding to P-selectin.

We chemically coupled the reducing end of various types of CS to the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine (lipid-derivatized CS, CS-PE) and established an in vitro time-lapse assay to observe the behaviors of growth cones of retinal ganglion cells from embryonic day 6 chick retina on exposure to <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with lipid-derivatized CS (CS-PE beads). Among CS-PEs with different content of the structural units, the <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with E-unit–containing CS-PE [E-unit: GlcAβ 1 - 3 GalNAc(4, 6 -O-disulfate) ] (CSE-PE beads) significantly caused the growth cones to retract and {{to turn away from}} the beads, but the <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with CSA-, CSC- or CSDPE beads did not. Importantly, not all the growth cones retracted equally from the CSE-PE beads, but they showed continuum of the repulsive behaviors; some behaved moderately and others remarkably. The growth cones distinguished different samples of CS: CSE and the others. Moreover, the continuum of the repulsive behaviors suggests that CS might be involved with the fine regulation of growth cones 2 ̆ 7 behavior through its characteristic structure...|$|R
40|$|Fibronectin-rich mesenchymal condensations form {{at sites}} of {{incipient}} chondrogenesis {{in the developing}} vertebrate limb, and in cultures of limb bud mesenchyme. We have used 6 nrn polystyrene latex <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with various substances as probes for adhesive interactions that may mediate the formation of these condensations. <b>Beads</b> <b>coated</b> with heparin, chondroitin sulfate, or poly L-lysine, that were mixed with limb bud mesenchymal cells were centripetally conveyed into fibronectin-rich regions of cell condensation {{over a period of}} several days. <b>Beads</b> <b>coated</b> with dextran sulfate remained uniformly dispersed throughout the cultures during the same period. A monoclonal antibody directed against the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin completely inhibited accumulation of heparin-coated beads at condensing foci, but monoclonal antibodies directed against the collagen- or cell-binding domains of fibronectin were not inhibitory. Accumulation of chondroitin sulfate- or poly L-lysine-coated beads at condensing foci was unaffected by the antibody against the fibronectin amino terminus. Peptides with the sequence arg-gly-asp-ser or gly-arg-gly-asp-ser, which inhibit adhesive interactions mediated by the integrin-binding domain of fibronectin, had no effect on conveyance or accumulation of heparin-coated beads, but the peptide with the sequence gly-arg-gly, a repeated motif in the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain was completely inhibitory. These findings indicate that the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin can, within a tissue microenvironment, interact adhesively with heparin-like components on the surfaces of polystyrene beads, and by implication, on mesenchymal cell...|$|R

40|$|Platelets {{coated with}} quinine- or quinidine-induced {{antibodies}} form rosettes around protein A-Sepharose beads and normal platelets form rosettes about protein A-Sepharose <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with these antibodies. These reactions occurred {{only in the}} presence of sensitizing drug. Platelets also formed rosettes about protein A-Sepharose <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with an anti-PIA 1 antibody, but drug was not required. Formation of rosettes between antibody-coated platelets and protein A-Sepharose was inhibited by F(ab') 2 fragments of goat antibody specific for the Fc portion of human IgG, while rosette formation between antibody-coated protein A-Sepharose and platelets was inhibited by F(ab') 2 fragments directed against the F(ab') 2 portion of the IgG molecule. Since binding of IgG to protein A is known to occur via the Fc region, these findings suggest that binding of drug-induced antibodies to platelets occurs at the Fab domains of the IgG molecule...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCollapsing {{factors are}} {{proteins}} that induce growth cone collapse and paralysis when {{added in a}} soluble form to cultured embryonic neurons. Here we examine the responses of growth cones to localized collapsing signals. Temporal retinal ganglion cell growth cones exposed to a localized collapsing stimulus from nasal retinal ganglion cell axons frequently turn smoothly away from the axons without collapsing. Turning is rare on contact with retinal axons that are unable to induce collapse. In a separate series of experiments, dorsal root ganglion growth cones tend {{to turn away from}} <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with a brain extract enriched for the motility-inhibiting protein collapsin. Many turns are accomplished with filopodial contact alone. Growth cones do not turn away from control <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with heat-inactivated collapsin. These results suggest that inhibitory guidance cues can steer growth cones through a localized inhibition of lamellipodial protrusion...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the capacity of DCs that contain antigen-coated magnetic beads to induce immunity against the nonstructural hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen 5 (NS 5). Splenocytes derived from Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (Flt 3) ligand-pretreated BALB/c mice were incubated with magnetic <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with HCV NS 5, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and/or anti-CD 40; purified; and used for immunization. Cellular immunity was measured using cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) and T-cell proliferation assays, intracellular cytokine staining, and a syngeneic tumor challenge using NS 5 -expressing SP 2 / 0 myeloma cells in vivo. Splenocytes isolated from animals vaccinated with DCs containing <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with NS 5, LPS, and anti-CD 40 secreted elevated levels of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and gamma interferon in the presence of NS 5. The numbers of CD 4 +, IL- 2 -producing cells were increased > 5 -fold in the group immunized with DCs containing <b>beads</b> <b>coated</b> with NS 5, LPS, and anti-CD 40, paralleled by an enhanced splenocyte proliferative response. Immunization promoted antigen-specific CTL activity threefold compared to the level for control mice and significantly reduced the growth of NS 5 -expressing tumor cells in vivo. Thus, strategies that employ NS 5 -coated beads induce cellular immune responses in mice, which correlate well with the natural immune responses that occur in individuals who resolve HCV...|$|R
