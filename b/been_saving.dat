Both revelations upset Santana (Naya Rivera), who has a cheerleading scholarship from the University of Louisville, yet {{wants to be a}} performer like them. Brittany announces that she will not be graduating, and Santana tells her mother, Maribel (Gloria Estefan), that she will stay in Lima. Maribel later gives Santana the money that she had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> for Santana's college education, saying she trusts her to follow her dreams.|$|E

The FBI storms the cult's compound, and arrests Absalom, but Smith is not found. Absalom tells Scully and Doggett that he has <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> abductees that had been left for dead by the aliens. Examining video of the compound raid, Scully, Reyes and Doggett watch Smith step through a doorway and transform into Agent Doggett. Doggett is stunned, and the agents realize that Smith is still in the compound.|$|E

5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Selma {{suffers from}} a {{degenerative}} eye condition {{and because of this}} is losing her vision. She has <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> up to pay for an operation which will prevent her young son from suffering the same fate. To escape the misery of her daily life, Selma takes part in rehearsals for a production of The Sound of Music and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema where together they watch fabulous Hollywood musicals (or more accurately, Selma listens as Cvalda describes them to her, to the annoyance of the other theater patrons, or acts out the dance steps upon Selma's hand using her fingers).|$|E
25|$|In Season 2, Lucas and Keith {{return to}} Tree Hill after Dan {{has a heart}} attack. Lucas tries {{to make up for}} his {{behavior}} with Peyton and Brooke and becomes friends with both of them. He also starts seeing a new girl named Anna Taggaro, but they break up amicably when Anna accepts that she is a lesbian. Lucas realizes that he has romantic feelings for Brooke and begins to focus on building on a relationship with her, even though she is seeing Anna's brother Felix. Lucas discovers that he has inherited Dan's heart condition, but does not tell anyone except Dan. After discovering that Keith's new girlfriend Jules was actually hired by Dan to break Keith's heart, Lucas agrees to move in with Dan if he leaves Keith alone and pays for Lucas's heart medication. This sets Lucas at odds with his mother, as she cannot believe that Lucas would want to live with Dan rather than her. It also causes a new rift between Lucas and Nathan, as Nathan feels that Lucas is replacing him and is bitter about Haley's departure to go on tour singing. Lucas and Karen are reconciled when she learns half of the reason he is staying with Dan, which is to protect Keith. This plan to protect his uncle fails when Jules leaves Keith at the altar and Keith leaves town after discovering that Lucas and Karen knew that she was hired by Dan. Lucas discovers Deb's painkiller addiction and decides to avenge all of Dan's victims. He finds a stash of cash and an incriminating ledger in the attic at Dan's dealership and plans to expose Dan's illegal dealings, but ultimately fails as Dan has also incriminated Deb. Dan then reveals that the whole thing was a set-up to test Lucas's loyalty, which Lucas failed. As a result, he loses Dan's college fund for him (which Dan had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> since Lucas was a baby) and even his heart medication. Nathan also ends his friendship with Lucas after discovering that Lucas had planned to bring Dan down and visited Haley behind his back in an attempt to patch up her and Nathan's marriage. Lucas does, however, kiss Brooke in the season finale and confesses that he wants to be with her, but she still leaves for California to spend the summer with her parents. Ultimately, it is just Lucas and a broken-hearted Peyton (after boyfriend Jake left her) for the summer and the last shot is {{of the two of them}} sharing a meaningful hug on the beach.|$|E

Ray had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> money for some years to make this possible. A duality in the name (Sandesh means both [...] "news" [...] in Bengali and also a sweet popular dessert) set {{the tone of the}} magazine (both educational and entertaining). Ray began to make illustrations for it, as well as to write stories and essays for children. Writing became his major source of income in the years to come.|$|E

Thompson's father assisted the band financially, loaning $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father [...] "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was doing his best {{to make up for lost}} time." [...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD. For the release of the mini album Come On Pilgrim, Thompson adopted the alias [...] "Black Francis", a name inspired by his father: [...] "he had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> that name in case he had another son." ...|$|E

Back home, Stan asks his parents for the money. His father suggests that he use the money he had <b>been</b> <b>saving.</b> Stan pays and is taken into an auditing room where an attendant reads his [...] "thetan levels" [...] using an [...] "E-meter". Stan has such a high reading that the Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles is notified. There, the president of Scientology determines that, because his reading is so high, Stan must be a reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology's founder and prophet.|$|E

500|$|Starting in April, both Specter and Sestak {{launched}} television advertisements {{that were}} particularly critical of each other. Sestak, who had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> {{most of his}} roughly $5 million campaign funds until the final month of the primary race, unveiled a 60-second spot that highlighted his Navy career and described the role his daughter's experience as a brain cancer survivor played in his decision to enter politics. The commercial did not discuss Specter by name but made several implicit references to him, such as Sestak's statements that [...] "too many politicians are concerned about keeping their jobs instead of helping people" [...] and [...] "if we want real change in Washington, we can't keep sending the same career politicians to represent us". Specter launched several commercials, most focusing on his plans to promote job growth. One advertisement, however, focused entirely on attacking Sestak, highlighting not only his voting attendance record [...] labeling him [...] "No Show Joe" [...] but also his Navy service. The commercial stated Sestak was [...] "relieved of duty in the Navy for creating a poor command climate", a reference to Sestak's 2005 transfer from a senior Pentagon planning post to a lesser position, which effectively ended his naval career.|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

2500|$|In 1962, the BBC {{commissioned}} a pilot for a television series of satirical sketches {{based on the}} Establishment Club, {{but it was not}} immediately picked up and Cook went to New York City for a year to perform Beyond The Fringe on Broadway. When he returned, the pilot had been refashioned as That Was the Week That Was and had made a star of David Frost, something Cook resented. The 1960s satire boom {{was coming to an end}} and Cook said: [...] "England was about to sink giggling into the sea". He complained that Frost's success was based on copying Cook's own stage persona and Cook dubbed him [...] "the bubonic plagiarist", and said that his only regret in life, according to Alan Bennett, had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> Frost from drowning. This incident occurred in the summer of 1963, when the rivalry between the two men was at its height. Cook had realised that Frost's potential drowning would have looked deliberate if he had not been rescued.|$|E
2500|$|In {{interviews}} with Charles Rowell and Randall Kenan, Butler credited {{the struggles of}} her working-class mother as an important influence on her writing. Because Butler's mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was {{given the opportunity to}} learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books. She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her hard at work on a story, casually remarked that maybe one day she could become a writer, causing Butler to realize {{that it was possible to}} make a living as an author. A decade later, Mrs. Butler [...] would pay more than a month's rent to have an agent review her daughter's work. She also provided Butler with the money she had <b>been</b> <b>saving</b> for dental work to pay for Butler's scholarship so she could attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, where Butler sold her first two stories.|$|E
