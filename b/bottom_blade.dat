So, the dust coal appearance from there tests was received and burned in the oven of laboratory for the German Institute for Standardization (DIN-Deutsches Institut für Normung) in order to determinate the percentage of quartz in coal dust. Finally conclusions for the approaches of dust coal control during process of mechanical anthracite coal cutting are derived and the highest pemissible level of anthracite coal dust in the workplace may be predicted for the prevention of the anthracosis...|$|E

The study is based on aeroelastic computations using the HAWC 2 aero-servo-elastic code A 2 -bladed 5 MW VAWT rotor is used based on a modified version of the DeepWind rotor For the HAWT simulations the NREL 3 -bladed 5 MW reference wind turbine model is utilized Various DLCs are examined including normal power production, emergency shut down and parked situations, from cut-in to cut-out and extreme wind conditions. The ultimate and 1 Hz equivalent fatigue loads of the blade root and turbine base bottom are extracted and compared in order to give an insight of the load levels between the two concepts. According to the analysis the IEC 61400 - 1 ed. 3 can be used to a large extent with proper interpretation of the DLCs and choice of parameters such as the hub-height. In addition, the design drivers for the VAWT appear to differ from the ones of the HAWT. Normal operation results in the highest tower <b>bottom</b> and <b>blade</b> root loads for the VAWT, where parked under storm situation (DLC 6. 2) and extreme operating gust (DLC 2. 3) are more severe for the HAWT. Turbine base <b>bottom</b> and <b>blade</b> root edgewise fatigue loads are much higher for the VAWT compared to the HAWT. The interpretation and simulation of DLC 6. 2 for the VAWT lead to blade instabilities, while extreme wind shear and extreme wind direction change are not critical in terms of loading of the VAWT structure. Finally, the extreme operating gust wind condition simulations revealed that the emerging loads depend on the combination of the rotor orientation and the time stamp that the frontal passage of gust goes through the rotor plane...|$|R

As results of the measurements, the normal force coefficient in strong wind shear condition decreases compared to those for weak wind shear condition.

The key feature of a VGOT machine is that each blade, instead of rotating around a central vertical axis, slides over rails mounted on a wagon formed by a tubular reticulated structure supported by standard train bogies. The structure should be designed to absorb the efforts in the vertical and traverse directions of the railroad due to the aerodynamic loads, the weight of the components and the centrifugal acceleration along the curved tracks. We show some results for the tip deflection and the tip torsion of the blade, the frontal and lateral angle variations in the <b>blade</b> <b>bottom</b> and the Von Misses tensions of five sample beams, all of them in function of the trajectory-length parameter; and some examples of the deformed configuration of the reticulated structure. innovative concepts; vertical-axis wind turbines; VAWT; VAWT-large machines; wind Darrieus rotors; structural behaviour; numerical simulation; finite element method; FEM; wind power; wind energy; renewable energy. ...|$|R
