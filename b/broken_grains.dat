Methods based on image analysis has been proposed for automated quality assessment by taking into account some of the textural features.

Rice grains are placed randomly on the scanner which neither maintains the uniformity in intensity regions nor the placement strategy is kept ideal thus resulting in false classification of grains. The aim of this research is to propose a method for extracting set of features which can overcome the said issues.

The mechanised thresher was evaluated at various threshing drum speeds (550 rpm, 600 rpm and 650 rpm) and feeding rates (200 kgh– 1, 400 kgh– 1 and 600 kgh– 1). Results showed that threshing was satisfactory at grain moisture content between 16. 9 % w. b. and 18. 0 % w. b. for both rice varieties. Threshing efficiency increased from 94. 6 % to 95. 8 % with {{no significant difference}} observed whereas cleaning efficiency decreased significantly from 84. 2 % to 81. 6 % with increasing feed rate irrespective of rice variety. Again, threshing efficiency increased with increasing drum rotational speed, irrespective of feed rate and rice variety.

Average fuel consumption, physical energy requirement and threshing capacity increased significantly with increasing drum speed and feed rate.

40|$|Abstract:- Parboiling {{is a set}} of {{operations}} needed for the production of a gelatinized product. Scientifically it is a thermal treatment process done on rice and other cereals. Water and heat are two essential elements to transform the natural cereal into “parboiled ” cereal. In rice, it is done to produce gelatinized or parboiled rice. Parboiling, if examined carefully has other scientific benefits beyond easy milling and reducing <b>broken</b> <b>grains.</b> Unfortunately, the technology has received little attention in terms of research as far as food processing or preservation is concern. As part of an ongoing research to assess the extent to which parboiling affect the migration of vitamin B 1, a preliminary survey was conducted between October, 2012 and December, 2012 in the three northern regions of Ghana to elucidate the scientific principles behind the practice and to what extend processors understand these principles. This work also aimed at high lighting the practice so as to encourage people to adapt indigenous technologies which may have more beneficial health effects. Eighty (80) processors in the three northern regions drawn by purposive sampling methods were interviewed using structured and semi structured questionnaires. The results showed that 100 % of the people engaged in parboiling business are women with over 70 % of them having no formal education and therefore are unaware of any effects of parboiling on nutritional elements. It became clear that parboiling increased the flavour and taste of the rice thus making it attractive to eat. However, the respondents only mentioned less <b>broken</b> <b>grains,</b> easy dehusking, ease of cooking, increase quantity, better prices, and parboiling being a norm as some of the reasons why they carry out rice parboiling. From the outcome of this survey it’s recommended more studies be done on the subject to ascertain the nutritional impact of the practice. Also, the processors need to b...|$|E

40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} {{for three}} P-wave attenuation mechanisms in sedimentary rocks {{are given a}} unified theoretical framework. Two of the models concern wave-induced flow due to heterogeneity in the elastic moduli at mesoscopic scales (scales greater than grain sizes but smaller than wavelengths). In the first model, the heterogeneity is due to lithological variations (e. g., mixtures of sands and clays) with a single fluid saturating all the pores. In the second model, a single uniform lithology is saturated in mesoscopic ''patches'' by two immiscible fluids (e. g., air and water). In the third model, the heterogeneity is at ''microscopic'' <b>grain</b> scales (<b>broken</b> <b>grain</b> contacts and/or micro-cracks in the grains) and the associated fluid response corresponds to ''squirt flow''. The model of squirt flow derived here reduces to proper limits {{as any of the}} fluid bulk modulus, crack porosity, and/or frequency is reduced to zero.
