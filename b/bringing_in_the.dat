5|$|In the Robinson Crusoe economy, {{there is}} only one {{individual}} – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility. The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, Man Friday. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of Pareto Efficiency can be analysed by <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> concept of the Edgeworth box.|$|E

The warmblood breeds have been exceptionally good at adapting to changing times, and from their carriage horse beginnings they easily transitioned during the 20th century into a sport horse type. Today's warmblood breeds, although still used for competitive driving, are more often seen competing in show jumping or dressage.|$|E

25|$|Of the 33 {{landing craft}} {{of all types}} lost, {{approximately}} half, 17, were LCAs, along with 1 LCS(M)(Mk I), No. 9.

25|$|Since {{only a small}} {{percentage}} of acts of sexual violence are brought to the attention of the authorities, it is difficult to compile accurate rape statistics. Conviction rates differ by the gender of both the perpetrator and victim. Various studies argue that male-male and female-female prison rape are quite common and may be the least reported form of rape. Furthermore, a large number of rape cases take place when the victims are below the age of consent, <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> issue of child sexual abuse or statutory rape.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{origins of}} the Hebrew New Year {{are connected to the}} beginning of the economic year in the agricultural societies of the ancient Near East. The New Year was the beginning of the cycle of sowing, growth, and harvest, the latter marked by its own set of major agricultural festivals. The Semites in general set the beginning of the new year in autumn, while other ancient civilizations such as the Persians or Greeks chose spring for that purpose, in both cases the primary reason being agricultural – the time of sowing the seed and of <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harvest.|$|E
25|$|People {{also took}} flames from the bonfire {{back to their}} homes. In parts of Scotland, torches of burning fir or turf were carried sunwise around homes and fields to protect them. In some places, people doused their hearth fires on Samhain night. Each family then solemnly re-lit its hearth from the {{communal}} bonfire, thus bonding the community together. The 17th century writer Geoffrey Keating claimed {{that this was an}} ancient tradition, instituted by the druids. Dousing the old fire and <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new may have been a way of banishing evil, which was done at New Year festivals in many countries.|$|E

For {{an hour or so}} until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting some casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The Martini–Henry rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the Royal Artillery forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.|$|E
25|$|Wilkins became vicar of Polebrook, Northamptonshire, in 1666; prebendary of Exeter in 1667; {{and in the}} {{following}} year, prebendary of St Paul's and bishop of Chester. He owed his position as bishop {{to the influence of}} George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham's approach to the religious problem of the day was comprehension, something less than religious tolerance but aimed at least at <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterians among the nonconformists to the Church of England by some peaceful form of negotiation and arrangement. Wilkins too thought along these lines. He had been a sympathetic reader of John Humfrey's 1661 justification of his acceptance of re-ordination by William Piers, having already once been ordained in the Presbyterian style by a classis.|$|E
25|$|Another more vindictive {{motivation}} for <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> indoor soccer side {{was to make}} life {{more difficult for the}} expansion Western Hockey League team, the Edmonton Ice. Pocklington had wanted a WHL franchise in Edmonton for himself, but was never granted one. So when Ed Chynoweth stepped down as WHL commissioner and was promptly granted a franchise in Edmonton, needless to say it rubbed Pocklington the wrong way. As a result, the Ice were not allowed to play at the Pocklington controlled Coliseum, and were instead left to play their games at the somewhat less fan friendly Northlands Agricom. On top of that it was standard practice to schedule Driller games head-to-head with Ice games, and distribute large quantities of complimentary tickets.|$|E
