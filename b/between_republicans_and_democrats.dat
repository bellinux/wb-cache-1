5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus <b>between</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E
5|$|Houston is {{considered}} to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways <b>between</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city's working class and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 62percent of Hispanics (of any race) in the area are declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Civil War, Wisconsin was a Republican state; in fact it is the state that gave birth to the Republican Party, {{although}} ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the Republican coalition. Through {{the first half of the}} 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by Robert La Follette and his sons, originally of the Republican Party, but later of the revived Progressive Party. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance <b>between</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Republican Senator Joe McCarthy was a controversial national figure in the early 1950s. Recent leading Republicans include former Governor Tommy Thompson and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner; prominent Democrats include Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, and Congressman David Obey.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression {{ushered in}} President Franklin Roosevelt and strong control by Democrats and {{historic}} New Deal policies. Roosevelt's election in 1932 marked {{a shift in}} government power towards the executive branch. Numerous New Deal initiatives came from the White House rather than being initiated by Congress. The Democratic Party controlled both houses of Congress for many years. During this time, Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed the Conservative Coalition. Democrats maintained control of Congress during World War II. Congress struggled with efficiency in the postwar era partly by {{reducing the number of}} standing congressional committees. Southern Democrats became a powerful force in many influential committees although political power alternated <b>between</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> during these years. More complex issues required greater specialization and expertise, such as space flight and atomic energy policy. Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited the fear of communism and conducted televised hearings. In 1960, Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy narrowly won the presidency and power shifted again to the Democrats who dominated both houses of Congress until 1994.|$|E

[...] The Senate in the 47th Congress was evenly divided <b>between</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats,</b> with the new vice president, Arthur, holding the tie-breaking vote. [...] After spending the special session of March 1881 in an intra-Republican Party fight over the confirmation of Garfield's cabinet nominees, the Senate went into recess until October. [...] By that time, Garfield had been assassinated and Arthur was president. [...] When the Senate reconvened, the Democrats held the majority briefly, and Bayard was elected president pro tempore on October 10; Republicans regained the majority three days later as Republican latecomers arrived and were sworn in, and David Davis took over the office.|$|E

The larger cities of Saint Paul, Saint Anthony, and Stillwater were {{the domain of the}} Democrats whereas agrarian southern Minnesota was the domain of the Republicans. A single constitution was finally worked out between the two factions though the more powerful Democrats ultimately prevailed on most issues. The resentment between the two parties remained so acrimonious that two separate copies of the constitution had to be used so that members of each party did not have to sign a copy signed by members of the other party. The copies were signed on August 29, 1857 and an election was called on October 13, 1857 to approve the document. [...] 30,055 voters approved the constitution, while 571 rejected it.|$|E

2500|$|The 1957 {{legislative}} session was very unusual. [...] The 1956 election produced a state senate that was evenly divided <b>between</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats,</b> with 15 senators from each party. [...] As a result, the chamber {{was unable to}} elect a president for 11 days. [...] For 288 ballots, the 15 Democratic senators voted for their leader, Walter J. Pearson. [...] The Republicans also voted as a block, alternating their 15 votes between their leader, Warren C. Gill, and three conservative Democrats the Republicans were willing to accept as president. [...] On the 298th ballot, Harry D. Boivin broke ranks with his fellow Democrats and voted for Overhulse instead of Pearson. [...] The entire senate, Republicans and Democrats, followed Boivin’s lead. [...] As a result, Overhulse was unanimously elected President of the Senate, becoming the first Democrat to hold that position in 79 years.|$|E

New state legislatures were writing constitutions, and the social climate was highly volatile, with insurgent attacks against freedmen and Republicans on the rise in numerous areas.

[...] Canby sometimes alienated {{one side or the other}} and often both. Charles W. Ramsdell called Canby [...] "vigorous and firm, but just."

2500|$|The {{election}} of 1904 {{continued to be}} a source of contention <b>between</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b> A Congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the Republican National Committee. In 1908, a month before the general presidential election, Governor Charles N. Haskell of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said that Senators beholden to Standard Oil lobbied Roosevelt, in the summer of 1904, to authorize the leasing of Indian oil lands by Standard Oil subsidiaries. He said Roosevelt overruled his Secretary of Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the Osage lands to the Prairie Oil and Gas Company. The New York Sun made a similar accusation and said that Standard Oil, a refinery who financially benefited from the pipeline, had contributed $150,000 to the Republicans in 1904 after Roosevelt's alleged reversal allowing the pipeline franchise. Roosevelt branded Haskell's allegation as [...] "a lie, pure and simple" [...] and obtained a denial from Shaw that Roosevelt had neither coerced Shaw nor overruled him.|$|E
