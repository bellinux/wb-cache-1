5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly more expensive than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power.

25|$|In general, dogs age in {{a manner}} similar to humans. Their bodies begin to develop {{problems}} that are less common at younger ages, they are more prone to serious or fatal conditions such as cancer, stroke, etc., they <b>become</b> <b>less</b> mobile and may develop joint problems such as arthritis, and in old age often <b>become</b> <b>less</b> physically active. Additionally, they <b>become</b> <b>less</b> able to handle change, including wide climatic or temperature variation, and may develop dietary or skin problems or go deaf. In some cases incontinence may develop and breathing difficulties may appear.|$|R
5|$|After independence, the All India Women's Conference {{continued}} to operate and in 1954 the Indian Communist Party formed its own women's wing {{known as the}} National Federation of Indian Women. However, feminist agendas and movements <b>became</b> <b>less</b> active right after India's 1947 independence, as the nationalist agendas on nation building took precedence over feminist issues.|$|E
5|$|Although cavalry {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{throughout the world}} during the 19th century, horses <b>became</b> <b>less</b> important to warfare after {{the beginning of the}} 20th century. Light cavalry was still seen on the battlefield {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, but formal mounted cavalry began to be phased out for combat during and immediately after World War I, although units that included horses still had military uses well into World War II.|$|E

Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it <b>became</b> <b>less</b> viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By {{the time of the}} closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E
5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti <b>became</b> <b>less</b> popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Connie was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that affected both Mauritius and Réunion in late January2000. On January24, 2000, a tropical disturbance developed well east of Madagascar. Despite moderate wind shear, it gradually strengthened while stalling offshore, and late on January25, was believed to have attained tropical storm status. After turning generally southeast, Connie attained cyclone intensity on January27. Rapid intensification ensued. Shortly after developing a well-defined eye, Connie attained peak intensity at 0000UTC on January28 as an intense tropical cyclone. Thereafter, Connie slowly weakened due to increased wind shear as thunderstorm activity quickly diminished around the eye. After threatening Mauritius, Connie then turned southwest, passing very close to Réunion late on January28. After briefly leveling off in intensity that evening, Connie soon <b>became</b> <b>less</b> organized, and midday on January29, the eye <b>became</b> <b>less</b> defined. The next day, Connie weakened to a severe tropical storm. Despite forecasts of additional weakening, Connie maintained its intensity for most of January31. However, weakening resumed on February1 and the storm transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on February2. Two days later, Connie merged with another low-pressure area.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{questions}} about his income, no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was sincerely devoted to his wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him. His audiences grew smaller during the 1920s as Sunday grew older, religious revivals <b>became</b> <b>less</b> popular, and alternative sources of entertainment appeared. Nevertheless, Sunday continued to preach and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death.|$|E

5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher {{ground in the}} Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment to the surrounding basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions <b>became</b> <b>less</b> arid.|$|E
5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings <b>became</b> <b>less</b> resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|Following peak intensity, Adrian's cloud pattern <b>became</b> <b>less</b> symmetric, its eye became obscured, and its {{convection}} warmed as southeasterly {{wind shear}} increased and the storm passed over ocean temperatures near 77°F (25°C). The storm slowed {{as it passed}} near Socorro Island, all the while the continued unfavorable regime weakened Adrian and stripped it of its all convection. The system was reduced to an exposed swirl of clouds over the open East Pacific by late on June22.|$|E
