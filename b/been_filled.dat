5|$|An 1891 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as a reservoir, {{suggesting}} that the canal had ceased {{to be used as}} a way of transporting goods to and from the complex. By 1902, the canal basin had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in, however exactly when it was filled in is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The basin has <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> with glacial {{deposits}} {{from the}} north and alluvial-pluvial sediments from the south.|$|E

5|$|The Jadovno camp site {{remained}} unexplored {{after the}} war due to {{the depth of the}} gorges where bodies were disposed of and {{the fact that some of}} these had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> with concrete by Yugoslavia's Communist authorities.

5|$|The canal is bounded on {{the south}} and north with a garden, now located {{on the west side}} of the kraton complex of Kamanghungan Kidul and Siti Hinggil Kidul.

5|$|Wheelwright's {{position}} at the church in Hampton had, as expected, <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> during his absence, but he was quickly called by residents of the neighboring town of Salisbury to be their pastor, and on 9 December 1662, when 70 years old, he was installed there. This became Wheelwright's longest pastorate in his varied life, lasting nearly 17 years.|$|E
5|$|By 1959 {{overcrowding}} as {{a result}} of the post-World War II baby boom forced the construction of a third school building. Land was purchased in 1960 at the former site of Hastings Pond, which had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in during construction of Interstate 94 through Saint Paul, and the building was completed at a cost of $3,663,529.78. Johnson High School has been located at the third school building since the fall of 1963.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} of the restoration, {{conducted}} by UkrNIIProektRestavratsiya and headed by Natalia Kosenko, the workers unearthed the whole lower floor, which had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in during Soviet times to strengthen the building's foundation. Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be fully redone. In the courtyard, the restorers placed an artificial lake, fountains, and a miniature garden—all of which had been in Horodecki's original plans.|$|E
5|$|However, {{right after}} Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became {{chairman}} of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, which under Novotny had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> with party loyalists. Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to {{freedom of the press}} when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} events elsewhere {{interacted with}} groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters have <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> with water creating several crater lakes. In some places glacial till and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows {{that form the}} volcanic field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over {{nearly all of the}} volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.|$|E

50|$|The burrows {{produced}} by invertebrate animals can <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> actively or passively.

These roles have <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> by Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and Angra guitarist Kiko Loureiro, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{approximately}} 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons and hotels; many {{were left to}} rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> to create new land. Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} the last edition of Plain Introduction was {{prepared}} and edited posthumously by Edward Miller (1825–1901). The book was edited by George Bell & Sons. It contains 15 plates with the texts of 40 manuscripts in facsimile (the 1st edition had 12 plates with 36 manuscripts). Some facsimiles were replaced. Instead of 2,094 manuscripts, as recorded in the third edition under six classes, no less than 3,791 were recorded in this edition, an increase of 236 beyond the 3,555 of Gregory, without counting the numerous vacant places which had <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> inp.|$|E

5000|$|From 1950 {{the ditch}} of the Stokes Bay Lines <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> because of {{complaints}} from residents of mosquitoes and stagnant water.

The final section to <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>was</b> that from No.3 Battery as far as No. 4 Battery.|$|R
5|$|The tyrannosaurids {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests these niches may have <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This is seen in modern Komodo dragons, where hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. For example, Albertosaurus have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} streaky features, {{some of them}} {{hundreds}} of kilometers in length, {{that appear to be}} caused by windblown particles. Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have <b>been</b> <b>filled</b> in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.|$|E
5|$|With an {{interest}} in art and drawing, Wiesenthal chose to study architecture. His first choice was to attend the Lwów Polytechnic (Polish: Politechnika Lwowska), but he was turned away because the school's Jewish quota had already <b>been</b> <b>filled.</b> He instead enrolled at the Czech Technical University in Prague, where he studied from 1928 until 1932. He was apprenticed as a building engineer through 1934 and 1935, spending most of that period in Odessa. He married Cyla in 1936 {{when he returned to}} Galicia.|$|E
