5|$|Manitoba natural {{communities}} may {{be grouped}} within five ecozones: <b>boreal</b> plains, prairie, taiga shield, <b>boreal</b> shield and Hudson plains. Three of these—taiga shield, <b>boreal</b> shield and Hudson plain—contain part of the <b>Boreal</b> forest of Canada which covers the province's eastern, southeastern, and northern reaches.|$|E
5|$|Countries in <b>boreal</b> climates {{often need}} snow camouflage, either by having {{reversible}} uniforms or simple overgarments. Such simple overgarments {{can be used}} for other terrains too. The Austrian and Israeli armies use solid colour field uniforms, relying on simple overgarments for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra infula {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout <b>boreal,</b> montane and coastal forests in North America. The North American range extends north to Canada and south to Mexico. It {{has also been}} reported from South America, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has {{continued}} to purchase and manage habitat in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations of the American black duck. In addition, the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge has purchased and restored over 1,000 acres of wetlands to provide stopover habitat for over 10,000 American black ducks during fall migration. Also, the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture has been protecting the habitat of the American black duck through habitat restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas. In 2003, a <b>Boreal</b> Forest Conservation Framework was adopted by conservation organizations, industries and First Nations to protect the Canadian <b>boreal</b> forests, including the American black duck's eastern Canadian breeding range.|$|E
5|$|The <b>boreal</b> clade is genetically diverse, {{suggesting}} that grey jays retreated to multiple areas of milder climate during previous ice ages and recolonized {{the region in}} warmer times.|$|E
5|$|The ichthyofauna of {{the park}} is among the richest in Europe with 41 {{freshwater}} and brackish water species of fish, as well as 70 marine fish species. There are nine Ponto-Caspian and five <b>boreal</b> relict species. The Ponto-Caspian dates from the ancient Sarmatian Sea. The <b>boreal</b> dates from the epoch of Quaternary cooling. There are several species restricted to the Black Sea basin (vyrezub, mushroom goby, bighead goby, toad goby, tubenose goby, western tubenose goby and racer goby). The round goby and estuarine perch {{are found in the}} Caspian and Black Sea basins.|$|E
5|$|The {{wetlands}} at {{the headwaters}} of Spring Brook are home to <b>boreal</b> forest trees. These include black spruce, paper birch, and tamarack. Huckleberry, lady's slipper, leather leaf, mountain laurel, pitcher plant, and rhododendron plants inhabit bogs in the area.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria, {{commonly}} known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and <b>boreal</b> regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.|$|E
5|$|Because of its mild climate, many species, {{including}} sub-tropical {{species such}} as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the <b>Boreal</b> Kingdom. The island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|Capella was the {{brightest}} star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close {{to each other in the}} sky and served as <b>boreal</b> pole stars at the time.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country ski marathons—races with {{distances}} {{greater than}} 40 kilometers—have two cup series, the Ski Classics, {{which started in}} 2011, and the Worldloppet. Skiers race in classic or free-style (skating) events, depending on {{the rules of the}} race. Notable ski marathons, include the Vasaloppet in Sweden, Birkebeineren in Norway, the Engadin Skimarathon in Switzerland, the American Birkebeiner, the Tour of Anchorage in Anchorage, Alaska, and the <b>Boreal</b> Loppet, held in Forestville, Quebec, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more similar}} {{is the very}} rare Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. The cap of older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines. The most similar and also the most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a <b>boreal</b> to subalpine species. Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the Northern Hemisphere, found in North America, Europe, Japan, Iran, continental Asia, and the Caucasus. In North America, it has been collected {{as far north as}} the <b>boreal</b> forest of Canada and subarctic and arctic habitats in Labrador, and south to Jalisco, Mexico. It is also found in Australia.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} phytogeography, Croatia {{is a part}} of the <b>Boreal</b> Kingdom and {{is a part of}} Illyrian and Central European {{province}}s of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region. The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius trivialis is a European {{species that}} is similar in {{appearance}} to L.argillaceifolius, and they are often confused for each other. L.trivialis can be distinguished by gills that stain brown when exposed to the latex, and a preference for growing in conifer- and birch-rich <b>boreal</b> and subalpine forests. Variety megacarpus may be confused with L.pallescens, a smaller paler-colored species with latex that stains gills lilac rather than brown.|$|E
5|$|Mackinac Island {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of terrain, including fields, marshes, bogs, coastline, <b>boreal</b> forest, and limestone formations. The environment is legally preserved on the island by the State Historic Park designation. About half of the shoreline and adjacent waters off Mackinac Island, including the harbor (Haldimand Bay) and the southern and western shore from Mission Point to Pointe aux Pins, is protected as part of the Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve, a state marine park.|$|E
5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, <b>boreal</b> chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare <b>boreal</b> toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E
5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern <b>boreal</b> forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert otters are major predators of beavers. A 1994 river otter study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any findings of beaver remains in the scat sampled.|$|E
5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests {{have been}} lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy {{about a quarter of}} the world's {{ice-free}} land with about half of these occurring in the tropics. In temperate and <b>boreal</b> regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|The American Bird Conservancy {{designated}} Whitefish Point a Globally Important Bird Area. Whitefish Point's {{land and}} water features create a natural corridor that funnels thousands of birds during spring and fall migrations, providing unique opportunities for research, education, and conservation programs. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons, merlins, <b>boreal</b> owls, great gray owls, red-throated loons, red-necked grebes, scoters, and jaegers (also known as skuas) {{are just some of}} the birds that can be seen during migration.|$|E
5|$|The airbus bus is {{operated}} by <b>Boreal</b> Transport and takes {{ten minutes to}} the town center. Taxis and car rental is also available at the airport. There are 520 long-term parking spaces at the airport. From Alta to Hammerfest there are both coach and fast ferry services; travel time to Hammerfest is two hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{airport is}} located next to European Road E6. <b>Boreal</b> Transport {{operates}} an airport coach service from Kirkenes {{to the airport}} in connection with all arrivals and departures. The company also serves the airport with coach services from Kirkenes {{to other parts of}} Finnmark. Parking, taxis and car rental is available at the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the <b>boreal</b> owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} species of Leucopholiota, L.lignicola, may be {{distinguished}} from L.decorosa by the following characteristics: free gills in L.lignicola compared with adnexed gills in L.decorosa; L.lignicola tends to grow on the wood of Birch, and preferably in old-growth forests; L.lignicola is restricted to <b>boreal</b> forest, compared to L.decorosa that grows in temperate regions; L.lignicola has a wide distribution throughout northern coniferous forests in Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in {{northern}} temperate and <b>boreal</b> climates, penetrating sometimes into subarctic regions. It has been recorded from North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and is common in North America, where it sometimes grows with aspen (Populus species). The North American distribution extends north into the Yukon and Alaska and south to Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the <b>boreal</b> forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians, where {{regionally}} accessible, {{have been}} found in the river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, as indicated in many of the food habit studies. The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: <b>boreal</b> chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).|$|E
5|$|Being saprobic, P. flammans {{is found}} {{exclusively}} on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of coniferous trees, with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or singly, from summer to autumn. It is a fungus {{with a wide}} geographical distribution in <b>boreal</b> and temperate regions, and may be considered common to rare depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boreal</b> {{forest trees}} such as black spruce, paper birch, and {{tamarack}} inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook. Plants such as mountain laurel, leather leaf, pitcher plant, rhododendron, huckleberry, and lady's slipper inhabit bogs in these wetlands. Old-growth forests containing oak, pine, and hemlock trees are {{also present in}} the Nay Aug Gorge. Upstream of Ridge Row, the stream's riparian buffer is wooded with some rock outcrops. Upstream of Nay Aug, the riparian canopy is mostly intact. Some hemlock trees in the Nay Aug Gorge {{have been affected by}} hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata {{is known}} from temperate, <b>boreal,</b> and alpine or arctic habitats. The fungus is {{widespread}} in Europe, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Scandinavia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The mushroom is also common in northern montane regions of North America. In Asia, the fungus {{has been reported}} in Korea, and in Hokkaido, northern Japan. It is also known from Greenland. A 2009 publication suggested that based on the known evidence, the species' distribution may be circumboreal.|$|E
5|$|Grey jays are {{classified}} as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of <b>boreal</b> and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through anthropogenic climate warming. Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless tundra. A study of a declining population {{at the southern end}} of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the perishable food items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, <b>Boreal</b> Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{has been}} {{recorded}} in several locations around Finland, ranging from the hemiboreal zones {{in the east and}} the south of the country, to <b>boreal</b> areas in the north, and it has also been found in Sweden, close to the Klarälven. At least in North Karelia, Finland, it is relatively common in the right habitats. It is one of over 150 species of Inocybe found in the Nordic countries, and fruit bodies can be encountered between late July and early October.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has four}} {{ecological}} provinces: Prairie Parkland, {{in the southwestern}} and western parts of the state; the Eastern Broadleaf Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional forest between the northern <b>boreal</b> forest and the broadleaf forests to the south. These northern forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota flammans, {{commonly}} known as the yellow pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap, is a basidiomycete agaric mushroom of the genus Pholiota. Its fruit body is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its cap and stem are covered in sharp scales. As it is a saprobic fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the stumps of dead coniferous trees. P.flammans is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in <b>boreal</b> and temperate regions. Its edibility has not been clarified.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for part of its length and a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for {{the other part of}} its length. It is also Class A Wild Trout Waters from the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and <b>boreal</b> forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via the Roaring Brook Corridor has been proposed.|$|E
