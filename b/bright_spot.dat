5|$|In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Giants {{lost their}} first two games before the strike, and their first game upon returning. They won their next three games to even their record at 3–3. Perkins then {{announced}} that he was leaving to take the head coaching job at Alabama after the season, and the team lost the next two games, effectively eliminating them from the playoffs (despite defeating the Eagles in the season finale to go 4–5). Taylor remained a <b>bright</b> <b>spot,</b> repeating as the league's Defensive Player of the Year. Young chose Bill Parcells, the Giants' defensive coordinator, as the team's new head coach.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{bright spots}} in this stretch was Iginla, who {{captured}} the Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies in 2001–02 as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points. Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy, tied with Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk, with 41 goals in 2003–04. Another <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> for the team during this time was defenceman Robyn Regehr who became the youngest nominee ever for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.

5000|$|On 9 December 2015, {{scientists}} {{reported that}} the <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> on Ceres {{may be related to}} a type of salt, particularly a form of brine containing hydrated magnesium sulfate (MgSO4·6H2O); the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia-rich clays.

40|$|The {{observations}} reported herein {{confirm that}} the <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> in high-resolution STM images of adsorbed alkanes and alkanols are predominantly due to the electronic and topographic structure of the molecule, and not predominantly due to the substrate. STM images of a monolayer of 17, 18 -pentatriacontadiene, H 3 C(CH 2) (15) -HC=C=CH(CH 2) (15) CH 3, adsorbed on graphite were obtained to evaluate whether changes in {{the orientation of the}} exposed methylene hydrogen atoms relative to the STM tip produced changes in the observed pattern of <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> in a STM image. STM images of this system showed a pattern of <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> within individual molecules that appears to change {{on either side of the}} allene -C=C=C- functionality. STM images were also obtained for tetradecanol overlayers on graphite and MoS 2 surfaces. The angles and distances observed in the images of tetradecanol on MoS 2 were nearly identical to those measured previously in our laboratories for alkanol and alkane monolayers on graphite despite that fact that the separation between <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> in an STM image of graphite is 2. 46 Angstrom, while the separation between <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> in STM images of MoS 2 is 3. 16 Angstrom...|$|R
5|$|The lone <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> for the Red Sox came in Game 3 at Boston's Fenway Park, in {{what had}} been a much {{anticipated}} pitching match-up of former Red Sox star Roger Clemens, who was now pitching for the Yankees, and Boston ace Pedro Martínez. Martínez struck out twelve and did not allow a run through seven innings of work; Clemens was hit hard, giving up five earned runs and only lasting two innings of a 13–1 Red Sox victory. The Yankees rebounded to win Games 4 and 5, clinching the American League pennant and advancing to the Series, where they swept the Atlanta Braves, (including two 8th-inning comebacks). The loss to Pedro Martínez was the Yankees' only postseason loss, as the team went 11–1.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 2010, {{two days}} {{after the end of the}} 2009–10 season, West Ham {{announced}} the termination of Zola's contract with immediate effect. On 3 June 2010, Avram Grant signed a four-year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a work permit. West Ham's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant's future as manager under serious doubt. A 4–0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> in a disappointing season. West Ham's form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 2–1 defeat at Stoke City.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for their lackluster {{performance}} was repeated injuries to starting quarterback Al Clark, who missed three regular-season games due to injuries. Heading into the Music City Bowl, he was recovering from a rib injury suffered in Tech's final regular-season game. Despite the missed games, Clark completed 72 of 148 passes for 1,050 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and five interceptions for the 1998 season. On the ground, Virginia Tech running backs Lamont Pegues and Shyrone Stith combined for 1,444 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns. Together, they averaged 178 yards per game on the ground. Another <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> on the Virginia Tech offense was kicker Shayne Graham, who was named a first-team All Big East selection.

40|$|A {{combined}} vertical-incidence and wide-angle seismic study provide {{strong evidence}} {{for the presence of}} large deep-water fluid reservoirs in Middle Miocene-age sediments with areal extents of more than 50 km 2 in the Southern Canary Basin. Pronounced seismic <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> at 300 - 800 m below seafloor are well imaged on multichannel reflection seismic sections (MCS) and Ocean-Bottom-Hydrophone (OBH) records, acquired on R/V POSEIDON in 1997 and 1999. Normal incidence reflection coefficients of about - 0. 4, calculated from MCS shot records, indicate strong negative acoustic impedance contrasts. Mud diapirs, observed {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>bright</b> <b>spots,</b> outline vertical sediment migration paths. MCS surveys approaching the deep-water commonly lack sufficient wide-angle reflections. In this study, wide-angle reflections have been imaged on OBH records deployed at the seafloor (3800 m water depth) to constrain the seismic origin of the <b>bright</b> <b>spots.</b> The strong direct water wave, generally masking shallow primary reflections, has successfully be suppressed, enabling the application of semblance based velocity analysis. Results from amplitude-versus-offset analyses and full waveform inversion confirm the presence of a low acoustic impedance zone at the <b>bright</b> <b>spots.</b> However, natural origin of fluids associated with the prominent <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> remain unresolved. Circumstantial evidences such as occurrence of <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> within the hydrate-stabilty-zone and existence of large magma volumes in the lower crust and upper mantle, point towards methane or carbon dioxide-rich fluids trapped in the sedimentary sequence...|$|R
5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was not a good communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare <b>bright</b> <b>spot,</b> passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In {{his rookie}} season, he passed for 3,739yards with 26touchdowns, set five {{different}} NFL rookie records including most touchdown passes in a season, most interceptions (28) in a rookie year, {{and was named}} to the NFL All-Rookie First Team. Manning's first win came against fellow rookie Leaf, 17–12 over the Chargers. Two weeks later, Manning faced off against Steve Young; he threw threetouchdowns, tying a Colts rookie record, but the 49ers kicked a late field goal to win 34–31. In November against the New York Jets, Manning threw for threetouchdowns in a 24–23 win; he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. It was the first game-winning drive of Manning's career, as he threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Marcus Pollard. Manning was certainly a <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> in the 1998 season for the Colts, but he also threw a league high 28 interceptions as the team struggled to a 3–13 record with a defense that gave up more than 27 points per game. The Colts lost many close games, including five games in which they had led by double-digits at some point.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one <b>bright</b> <b>spot</b> was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E

30|$|It {{is to be}} {{commented that}} by {{choosing}} that the Pi 2 disturbance has propagated from the Th D spacecraft location {{for more than two}} wavelengths before reaching the Th E spacecraft location, there must be two corresponding <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> between the Th D and Th E fieldline footprints, which is also observed in the auroral arc structure before ~ 0404 : 00 UT shown in Fig.  1. This is consistent with the proposal that the arc <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> are produced by electrons accelerated by the Pi 2 wave parallel electric field downward into the ionosphere because the azimuthal structure of the Pi 2 parallel electric field between the Th D and Th E spacecraft must have two upward field-aligned pointing region, which can accelerate electrons into the ionosphere to produce the arc <b>bright</b> <b>spots.</b> Thus, the choice of n value can be re-examined by checking the number of observed auroral <b>bright</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract A common {{source of}} error in {{particle}} image velocimetry (PIV) {{is the presence of}} <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> within the images. These <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> are characterized by grayscale intensities much greater than the mean intensity of the image and are typically generated by intense scattering from seed particles. The displace-ment of <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> can dominate the cross-correlation calculation within an interrogation window, and may thereby bias the resulting velocity vector. An efficient and easy-to-implement image-enhancement procedure is described to improve PIV results when <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> are present. The procedure, called Intensity Capping, imposes a user-specified upper limit to the grayscale intensity of the images. The displacement calculation then better represents the displacement of all particles in an interrogation window and the bias due to <b>bright</b> <b>spots</b> is reduced. Four PIV codes and a large set of experimental and simulated images were used to evaluate the performance of Intensity Capping. The results indicate that Intensity Capping can significantly increase the number of valid vectors from experimen-tal image pairs and reduce displacement error in the analysis of simulated images. A comparison with other PIV image-enhancement techniques shows that Inten-sity Capping offers competitive performance, low computational cost, ease of implementation, and min-imal modification to the images. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{symptoms}} of the diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and many other eye diseases are often associated with the <b>bright</b> <b>spots,</b> dark spots, and vascular abnormalities in retinal images, this study proposes a retinopathy image segmentation (system) to extract the <b>bright</b> <b>spots,</b> dark spots, and blood vessels from retinal images. Moreover, since {{a high proportion of}} diabetic patients suffer from the diabetic retinopathy with the most severe one to be the retinal detachment, the retinal image-based tractional retinal detachment diagnosis system is proposed, as well. Two genetic-based parameter detectors are given to provide the most appropriate values for the parameters used by the retinopathy image segmentation system and the tractional retinal detachment diagnosis system. The experimental results illustrate that the retinopathy image segmentation system and the tractional retinal detachment diagnosis system can provide expressive results in segmenting <b>bright</b> <b>spots,</b> dark spots, blood vessels, and in diagnosing tractional retinal detachment.
