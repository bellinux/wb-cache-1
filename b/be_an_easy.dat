5|$|Tom Johnson (born Tom Jackling; c.1750– 21 January 1797) was a bare-knuckle fighter who was {{referred}} to as the Champion of England between 1784 and 1791. His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport. Although a strong man, his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to despatching his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered.|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
25|$|Henry, {{who thought}} it would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> conquest, {{encountered}} fierce resistance. In a clever move of the Spanish, the defenders led by the Captains Cervellón and Machichaco, attacked the French besiegers by surprise and destroyed most of the heavy artillery with which it {{had already begun to}} damage the walls, causing a severe blow to the French army.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Nixon {{arranged}} {{an interview}} with British journalist David Frost {{in the hopes of}} improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.|$|E
25|$|One ambitious noble named Paul, {{who thought}} it would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> thing to take the throne from {{an old man who}} had shown so plainly {{that he did not want}} it, rose in rebellion. He soon learned his mistake. Wamba met him in battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Paul {{expected}} nothing less than to have his head stricken off, but Wamba simply ordered that it should be shaved.|$|E
25|$|In April, as the Allied forces {{advanced}} {{deeper into}} Germany, Kammler ordered the engineering team {{to be moved}} by train into the town of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if {{they were about to}} fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince SS Major Kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so that they would not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target for U.S. bombers.|$|E

25|$|To be effective, a dipper has to {{generate}} a lot of swing {{to make up for}} the variation in movement lost because the ball is not bouncing on the pitch. However, because the batsman usually expects a full toss to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> ball to score off, dippers have huge surprise value and can be extremely difficult to play especially if the bowler is very accurate and manages the yorker rather than a genuine full toss. Chaminda Vaas' bowling to Yuvraj Singh in the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series is a classic example.|$|E
25|$|A rematch between Vic Darchinyan and Nonito Donaire {{took place}} on 9 November 2013. The 37-year-old Darchinyan gave the 30-year-old Donaire a lot more trouble than was expected, as this was {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> bounce-back fight for Donaire who was coming off his first loss in over a decade. Darchinyan fought a smarter fight and confused a sluggish Donaire {{for much of the}} first 8 rounds, but in the 9th round round was dropped and got up to be finished by TKO. At the time of the stoppage, Darchinyan was leading on the scorecards: 78-74, 78-74, and 76-76.|$|E
25|$|Rivero Méndez {{was ordered}} to {{investigate}} the situation in Fajardo. He {{was told that the}} Americans no longer occupied the city and that it would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task to capture the people of Fajardo who had betrayed Spain. Rivero Méndez passed the information to General Ortega who suggested to General Macías take the town with 200 soldiers and an artillery battery. Macías was told to capture Dr. Veve and all those involved in the revolt, including the Americans in the lighthouse, even it meant the destruction of the lighthouse. Macías refused to accept Ortega's plan.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, and with war looming, the Canadian chief of Naval Staff had {{designated}} the three 'Prince' ships as candidates for conversion to armed merchant cruisers, {{for the task}} of convoy escort. During the protracted negotiations for the CN ships, all three vessels had been inspected by the Naval Service and specifications drawn up. It was recognized that the task of converting the fast liners would not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> one. Their hulls and engines were basically sound. Prince Robert, which had had no accidents and had been well maintained, was to present no problems. Her sister ships, on the other hand, were a different story: both were in need of major repairs.|$|E
25|$|As {{related in}} chapter 2, Loki, under {{the service of}} Odin, found out about Freyja's actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the {{necklace}} {{and bring it to}} him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja's bower against her will, this wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task, yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja's bower but found it locked, and that he couldn't enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.|$|E
25|$|In late-June 1995, Ratko Mladić {{made the}} {{decision}} to launch an attack on Srebrenica, which evidence indicates was always part of his long-term strategy. However, the Serbs did not expect Srebrenica to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> conquest. With 100 members of the Greek Volunteer Guard, together with 2,000–3,000 reinforcements and 200–300 members of the Serb Volunteer Guard, the Bosnian Serbs could hardly muster 4,000–5,000 men for the offensives against Srebrenica and Žepa. Of these, it was estimated that only 2,000 would take part in the thrust to capture Srebrenica in July 1995. The Bosniaks, not as well-armed as their opponents, had a military force of 6,000 men within the town, about one-third or one-half of whom were armed. 1,500 of these were professional soldiers and 1,500 were armed militiamen. Also in the town were the 570 lightly-armed peacekeepers of the Dutch battalion (DUTCHBAT).|$|E

25|$|Adama {{turned his}} attentions {{on the only}} major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an {{attractive}} target. It lay between Bornu {{to the north and}} Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Japanese strategy of rapidly gaining ground to control Manchuria, Russian strategy focused on fighting delaying actions to gain time for reinforcements to arrive via the long Trans-Siberian railway, which was incomplete near Irkutsk at the time. On 1 May 1904, the Battle of Yalu River became the first major land battle of the war; Japanese troops stormed a Russian position after crossing the river. The defeat of the Russian Eastern Detachment removed {{the perception that the}} Japanese would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> enemy, that the war would be short, and that Russia would be the overwhelming victor. This was also the first battle in decades to be an Asian victory over a European power and marked Russia's inability to match Japan's military prowess. Japanese troops proceeded to land at several points on the Manchurian coast, and in a series of engagements, drove the Russians back towards Port Arthur. The subsequent battles, including the Battle of Nanshan on 25 May 1904, were marked by heavy Japanese losses largely from attacking entrenched Russian positions.|$|E
25|$|Sent {{by their}} Provincial St.Thomas of Villanova, {{the first group}} of Spanish/Castilian Augustinians arrived in Mexico in 1533 after the subjugation of Aztec Mexico by Hernan Cortez. Melchor de Vargas composed, in 1576, a {{catechism}} in the Mexican Otomi language; Diego Basalenque (d. 1651) and Miguel de Guevara compiled works in the languages of the Matlaltzinkas of Mexico; Manuel Perez translated the Roman Catechism into Aztec in 1723. Monasteries sprang up in the principal places and became the centers of Christianity, art, and civilization. The Patio (Cloister) of the former monastery of St. Augustine, now the post office, at Querétaro, {{is one of the most}} beautiful examples of stone-carving in America. They soon formed multiple priories, including at Guanajuato (pictured) and were later instrumental in establishing the Pontifical and Royal University of Mexico. By 1562 there were nearly 300 Spanish Augustinians in Mexico, and they had established some 50 priories. Their history in Mexico was not to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> one, given the civil strife of events like the Cristero War, periodic anti-clericalism and suppression of the church that was to follow.|$|E

25|$|Their first {{match of}} the tournament was {{scheduled}} to be against Australia themselves at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. However, Australia citing safety concerns refused to play the game and forfeited, giving Sri Lanka a handy 2 points. Their next match against Zimbabwe also in Colombo proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> win for the Lankans with De Silva pounding 91 off 86 balls to lead the chase of 228 in 37 overs. The West Indies then also followed suit handing Sri Lanka a further 2 points for the same reason as the Australians. Sri Lanka then head to Delhi, India to take on an in-form India. Tendulkar blitzed a century before Sanath Jayasuriya provided some fireworks of his own smashing 79 off 76 balls and leading Sri Lanka to a comfortable 6 wicket win chasing 272 for victory. Sri Lanka's final group match was against the lowly Kenya who had upset the West Indies earlier in the tournament. However, Sri Lanka were far from complacent as a ruthless batting display lead them to the highest One Day International Team Score ever scoring 5–398 in their 50 overs. De Silva once again the star this time scoring 145.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Smolensk {{was another}} severe defeat for the Red Army {{in the opening}} phase of Operation Barbarossa. For the first time, the Soviets tried to {{implement}} a coordinated counter-attack against {{a large part of}} the front; although the counter-attack was almost entirely a failure, the increasing resistance showed that the Soviets were not yet defeated and that the Blitzkrieg towards Moscow was not going to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> undertaking. Dissent within the German high command and political leadership was exacerbated. The leaders of the General Staff, Franz Halder and Brauchitsch and commanders like Bock, Hoth and Guderian counselled against dispersing the German armoured units and to concentrate on Moscow. Hitler reiterated the lack of importance of Moscow and of strategic encirclements and ordered a concentration on economic targets such as Ukraine, the Donets Basin and the Caucasus, with more tactical encirclements to weaken the Soviets further. The German offensive effort became more fragmented, leading to the Battle of Kiev and the Battle of Uman. The battles were German victories but costly in time, men and equipment on their approach towards Moscow, allowing the Soviets time to prepare the defenses of the city.|$|E
25|$|Peter May {{required}} several {{operations and}} did not play in the 1960 season, but {{he was expected to}} return and Cowdrey was only made captain of England against South Africa as each game came up, rather than for the whole series. Even so, {{it was the first of}} only two occasions that Cowdrey captained England throughout a Test series. It proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> 3–0 win as the inexperienced Springbok side met a damp English summer and lost the first three Tests by 100 runs, an innings and 73 runs and 8 wickets. In the Third Test the South African captain Jackie McGlew was run out after colliding with an English fielder, the umpires did not allow Cowdrey to call him back and he was widely blamed for not withdrawing the appeal before McGlew left the field. In the Fifth Test England were dismissed for 155, saw South Africa make 479/9 declared and were criticised by Walter Robins, the new Chairman of Selectors. In response Cowdrey made 155 and added 290 for the first wicket with Geoff Pullar (175) to save the match.|$|E
