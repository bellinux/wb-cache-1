5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} {{marketing}} campaigns {{in the early}} 1980s was successful in increasing patronage of the Board's buses, culminating in an improvement of 10.3% being reported in the 1984 Annual Report. This was also a time of increasing economic troubles for the country, typified by a dramatic rise in inflation. Following {{the end of a}} price and wage freeze, inflation again began to rise sharply, prompting the Tramways Union to campaign for an increase in allowances to cover cost-of-living increases for its members. This resulted in a series of 24- and 48-hour strikes from 8 November 1985 when the Board was not agreeable to their demands, to which the Board responded with a lock-out on 3 December. Fifteen days of industrial action followed, at the conclusion of which the striking staff returned to work having failed to secure any concessions from the Board. Some conditions were curtailed, and the liberal approach to various employment matters that workers had enjoyed was replaced by a hard-liner stance. To make up for revenue forgone during the strikes, fares were raised by 33%. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> passengers, and when combined with the loss of goodwill from the recent industrial action, they deserted the buses {{to the extent that the}} Board lost around half of the improvement in its patronage of recent years. With the general economic malaise that followed, patronage of the Board's services never recovered to previous levels.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAnalysis of the Fractal Dimension of the EEG {{appears to}} be a good {{approach}} for the computation of biomarkers for dementia. Several Fractal Dimension algorithms have been used in the EEG analysis of cognitive and sleep disorders. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find an accurate Fractal Dimension algorithm that can be applied to the EEG for computing reliable biomarkers, specifically, for the assessment of dementia. To achieve this, some of the common methods for estimating the Fractal Dimension of the EEG are reviewed and compared using serial EEG recordings of normal and subjects with dementia. Biomarkers computed from the Fractal Dimensions are assessed according to their ability to perform early detection, differential diagnosis of dementia and in identifying effects of channel variations in subjects with dementia. The initial findings have shown that not all Fractal Dimension algorithms are suitable for computation of EEG biomarkers for dementia. Typically, biomarkers obtained from the Zero Set and the Adapted Box algorithms have shown good discriminating power in the early detection and differential diagnosis of dementia. Two channels, namely P 3 and PZ have also been singled out as the most affected channels in dementing subjects. This <b>bodes</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> recent neuroimaging findings which indicate that the posterior cortex is one of the main sites of cortical atrophy in early Alzheimer's Disease...|$|R
40|$|With this work, we aim {{to enrich}} the {{knowledge}} about the {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} in the Czech Republic with empirical evidence on the impact of monetary policy on bank lending. Using a panel of quarterly time series for Czech commercial banks for the period 1996 - 2001, we study the overall effect of monetary policy changes on the growth rate of loans and the characteristics of the supply of loans. The characterization of the credit market's supply side allows us to make inferences on the operativeness of the credit channel (the bank lending channel and the broad credit channel) of the monetary transmission mechanism. We find that changes in monetary policy alter the growth rate of loans with considerably stronger magnitude in the period 1999 - 2001 than in the period 1996 - 1998. From the analysis intended to capture the characteristics of the supply of loans, we conclude that the lending channel was operative in the period 1996 - 1998 : we find cross-sectional differences in the lending reactions to monetary policy shocks due to degree of capitalization and liquidity. For the subsequent period 1999 - 2001, the results also show distributive effects of monetary policy due to bank size and a bank's proportion of classified loans. In the context of steadily decreasing interest rates, this bolsters the supposition of credit rationing and hence that of an operative broad credit channel. At the same time, we find evidence of linear relationships between bank characteristics and the growth rate of loans, and again these relationships change between the two time periods. This <b>bodes</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the changes in the structure and attitude towards lending of the Czech commercial banks. Bank lending channel, broad credit channel, credit rationing, monetary transmission mechanism. ...|$|R

40|$|American U. S. {{crude oil}} prices have dropped {{significantly}} of late down {{to a low of}} less than $ 30 a barrel in early 2016. At the same time price volatility has increased and crude in storage has reached record amounts in the U. S. America. Low oil prices in particular pose quite a challenge for the survival of U. S. America’s tight-oil industry. In this paper we assess the current profitability and future prospects of this industry. The question could be broadly stated as: should producers stop operation immediately or continue in the hope that prices will rise in the medium term? Our assessment is based on a stochastic volatility model with three risk factors, namely the oil spot price, the long-term oil price, and the spot price volatility; we allow for these sources of risk to be correlated and display mean reversion. We then use information from spot and futures West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices to estimate this model. Our aim is to show how the development of the oil price in the future may affect the prospective revenues of firms and hence their operation decisions at present. With the numerical estimates of the model’s parameters we can compute the value of an operating tight-oil field over a certain time horizon. Thus, the present value (PV) of the prospective revenues up to ten years from now is $ 37. 07 /bbl in the base case. Consequently, provided that the cost of producing a barrel of oil is less than $ 37. 07 production from an operating field would make economic sense. Obviously this is just a point estimate. We further perform a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to derive the risk profile of this activity and calculate two standard measures of risk, namely the value at risk (VaR) and the expected shortfall (ES) (for a given confidence level). In this sense, the PV of the prospective revenues will fall below $ 22. 22 /bbl in the worst 5 % of the cases; and the average value across these worst scenarios is $ 19. 77 /bbl. Last we undertake two sensitivity analyses with respect to the spot price and the long-term price. The former is shown to have a stronger impact on the field’s value than the latter. This <b>bodes</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the usual time profile of tight oil production: intense depletion initially, followed by steep decline thereafter...|$|R
