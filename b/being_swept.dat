5|$|Although Bolaven {{struck the}} Ryukyu Islands as a {{powerful}} typhoon, damage was less than expected. Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region. The most significant effects stemmed from heavy rains, amounting to , that caused flash flooding and landslides. One person drowned on Amami Ōshima after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by a swollen river. In mainland Japan, two people drowned after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by rough seas. In South Korea, 19 people {{were killed by the}} storm. Many buildings were damaged and approximately 1.9million homes were left without power. Losses in the country reached ₩420billion (US$374.3million), the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards. Significant damage also took place in North Korea where at least 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing. Additionally, 6,700 homes were destroyed. Offshore, nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern Mexico, accumulating 4.80in (122mm) {{in the southern}} state of Chiapas. In Oaxaca, the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120houses. A mudslide in one village demolished 20homes and killed a child, while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away in a flooded river.|$|E

A journalist went missing in similar circumstances, and was found dead a few days later. In all, Typhoon Shanshan killed 11people and injured over 260 others. Shanshan is also credited with US$4.9million worth of net losses in the third financial quarter for IPC Holdings, Ltd.|$|E
5|$|The League Cup {{was clearly}} not one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> aside {{in the third round}} by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of the}} First Division – Ferguson came under intense scrutiny for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager felt that it was, at the time, an unwanted domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Although Wipha did not {{directly}} impact the Philippines, the outer bands of the storm produced severe flooding in Negros Occidental. The flooding washed out large areas of agricultural land worth PHP10.3million ($211,000USD). Numerous farm to market roads were also damaged or destroyed, costing PHP5million ($103,000USD). The floods also destroyed 13 homes and damaged 31 others. A rare tornado spawned by the storm destroyed four homes and damaged 19 others. A total of 7,640 families were affected by Wipha in the Philippines. The heavy rains caused a landslide which killed one person on September16. Another man drowned in a flood swollen river on September21. Three other people were listed as missing after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away in a river swollen by Wipha.|$|E
5|$|Further north, minor {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Jalisco. Statewide, four people were killed. A 26-year-old man died after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by {{in the village of}} Juanacatlan while a 12-year-old boy drowned after falling in a dam in the municipality of Teocuitatlan de Corona. Another man perished when he drove his car into a ravine in Cuautitlan de Garcia Barragan. Fifteen hundred people were evacuated from their homes. Classes were briefly cancelled in 588schools, leaving over 40,000pupils home. Bridges collapsed in the Jalisco towns of Zacoalco de Torres and Tamazula de Gordiano. The worst-hit areas in the state were the southern and coastal areas of the state, as well as the Guadalajara area, where flooding and landslides occurred in some neighborhoods. Through Jalisco, 56municipalities sustained damage.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains for {{the outer}} bands of Hurricane Beta, amounting up to 3in (76mm), caused {{flooding}} and landslides in Panama. At least 256 people {{were affected by}} the storm and 52 homes were damaged; however, {{the cost of the}} damages is unknown. At least 50hectares (124acres) of rice fields were flooded across the country. One person, a young girl, was killed after the boat she was on sank amid rough seas. Both her parents escaped the sinking ship. Two other people drowned after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by the swollen Chagres River and two others were reported missing.|$|E
60|$|The {{walls of}} the frail teepee, {{flapping}} in the breeze, appeared hardly larger than a kerchief caught upon a bush, and the disheartened collie seemed nervously apprehensive of its <b>being</b> utterly <b>swept</b> away.

5|$|Series 6 {{began on}} 26 September 1998 and {{began with the}} leprechaun Mr Onion being {{temporarily}} written out of the show after supposedly <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> down the plughole in the bath. This was done intentionally as puppeteer John Eccleston was in Australia filming for Farscape for the year {{and would not be}} available. To compensate for Eccleston's absence, a new leprechaun puppet was added called 'Shamrock' (voiced by Rebecca Nagan of Rosie and Jim fame) who made her debut {{at the end of the}} first show as their long lost sister. She then became a regular fixture from the following week and performed alongside Mr Sage for the rest of the series as a replacement to Mr Onion.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage {{was much less}} than initially anticipated. In all, damages from the storm amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in a ditch after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by flood waters.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 NHL lockout, which {{cancelled}} {{the full}} 2004–05 NHL season, forced Kesler {{to spend the}} entire season with the Moose.

Midway through the season, Kesler was named to the PlanetUSA All-Star team for the 2005 AHL All-Star Game where he helped PlanetUSA defeat Team Canada for the first time in five years. Kesler finished third in team scoring with thirty goals and 57 points to be named the Moose's Most Valuable Player. Kesler added an additional nine points in fourteen playoff games as the Moose advanced to the Western Conference finals before <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> by the Chicago Wolves.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than <b>being</b> constantly <b>swept</b> downstream by the water flow.|$|R
25|$|However, the Chinese Exclusion Act, {{which went}} into effect in 1882, caused an abrupt {{decline in the number of}} Chinese who immigrated to New York and the rest of the United States.

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Bonnie produced considerable amounts of rainfall across the Greater Antilles, resulting in light to moderate flooding. In the Dominican Republic, {{hundreds of people}} were displaced, and several bridges collapsed over rushing waters. One person drowned after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by a swollen river in Puerto Rico. Elsewhere, light amounts of rainfall was reported in Haiti, the Bahamas and Florida. Effects were more severe from the remnants of Bonnie, with heavier rain amounts and higher winds reported near the Gulf Coast, especially in Louisiana.

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Sandra produced unseasonably heavy rains across parts of Central America, leading to flooding. In Nicaragua, flooding affected 55homes and destroyed 1, primarily in Managua. A total of 56families required evacuation. Local officials blamed the flooding on trash-clogged drains. Five {{people were injured}} in the Nueva Segovia Department when an ambulance crashed on a foggy, rain-slicked road. A landslide in Cucuyagua, Honduras, destroyed a home killing a 25-day-old baby and injuring four others. In Nueva Esparta, El Salvador, two people drowned after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by the swollen El Amatal River. Flooding in Ozatlán killed one person and inundated homes in Jiquilisco, prompting the evacuation of 14families.|$|E

50|$|However, the Cantonese dialect {{that has}} {{dominated}} Chinatown for decades is <b>being</b> rapidly <b>swept</b> aside by Mandarin, the national language of China and the lingua franca due {{the influx of}} Fuzhou immigrants that often speak Mandarin and as well as {{there are now more}} Mandarin speaking visitors coming to visit the neighborhood.

5|$|The {{presence}} of undigested {{food in the}} stomach and seed pods still {{in the mouth of}} many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure are likely. The maturity of this ingested vegetation places the time of death in autumn rather than in spring, when flowers would be expected. The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them. Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers, perhaps through <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> away by floods. In one location, by the Berelekh River in Yakutia in Siberia, more than 8,000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot, apparently having been swept there by the current.|$|E
5|$|Waves between 5 and 13feet (1.5–4meters) were {{reported}} along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maryland. A weather buoy in Outer Banks, North Carolina reported swells up to 10feet (3meters). One death occurred by drowning in New Jersey. A 37‑year‑old man {{was reported missing}} in New York City and presumed dead after his houseboat capsized in the heavy surf. Another houseboat also capsized, drowning a 58‑year‑old woman. On shore, a large wave swept two fishermen into the sea, where they drowned. Overall, four fatalities occurred {{in the state of}} New York.

5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after <b>being</b> <b>swept</b> overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E
50|$|Dunne {{created some}} of the first {{practical}} and stable aircraft. The majority were unusual in <b>being</b> of tailless <b>swept</b> configuration. Stability was achieved by progressively rolling the leading edge down from root to tip, a feature known as washout. Careful balance of its characteristics allowed the use of only two flight controls. A disadvantage of this was that, without a rudder, crosswind landings were not possible and the approach had to be made into the wind.|$|R
