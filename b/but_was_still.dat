5|$|Later {{analysis}} showed that Jose became more organized two hours before making landfall and was forming an eye, but its winds remained under hurricane strength. The final report suggested that the winds made it up to 60mph (95km/h) and made landfall as such, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> rapidly intensifying before running out of water.|$|E
5|$|Violent crime from 2005 to 2006 {{was mostly}} {{unchanged}} nationwide, but {{increased more than}} 10% in Cleveland. The murder rate dropped 30% in Cleveland, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> far above the national average. Property crime from 2005 to 2006 was virtually unchanged {{across the country and}} in Cleveland, with larceny-theft down by 7% but burglaries up almost 14%.|$|E

5|$|Yousafzai {{had come}} out of her coma by 17 October 2012, was {{responding}} well to treatment, and was said to {{have a good chance of}} fully recovering without any brain damage. Later updates on 20 and 21 October stated that she was stable, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> battling an infection. By 8 November, she was photographed sitting up in bed.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} the film, titled Cars 2, was {{released}} on June 24, 2011. It was directed again by John Lasseter, who was inspired for the film while traveling around the world promoting the first film. In the sequel, Lightning McQueen and Mater head to Japan and Europe {{to compete in the}} World Grand Prix, but Mater becomes sidetracked with international espionage. The film failed to meet or exceed the critical success of its predecessor, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a box office success.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Carpender was {{replaced}} by Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, who ordered the final deactivation of the Mark 6 in all combat commands. Christie abided by the order, commencing on 20 January 1944, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> convinced the Mark 6 had potential. He had Commanders Chester Nimitz, Jr. and James McCallum continue technical studies of the Mark 6 and to develop improvements, but these revised exploders were just as unreliable as the earlier versions.|$|E

5|$|John Playfair {{carried out}} a second survey of Schiehallion in 1811; {{on the basis of}} a rethink of its rock strata, he {{suggested}} a density of 4,560 to , though the then elderly Hutton vigorously defended the original value in an 1821 paper to the Society. Playfair's calculations had raised the density closer towards its modern value, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> too low and significantly poorer than Cavendish's computation of some years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Kirov {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Ordzhonikidze Yard, Leningrad on 22 October 1935. She was {{launched}} on 30 November 1936 and was completed on 26 September 1938. She was commissioned into the Baltic Fleet {{in the autumn of}} 1938, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> being worked on into early 1939. Kirov sailed to Riga on 22 October when the Soviet Union began to occupy Latvia, continuing on to Liepāja the following day.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Rising is a 42-issue American {{comic book}} series created by Terry Moore and {{published}} through Abstract Studios. The first issue {{was released on}} August 3, 2011, to positive reviews. Reviewers sometimes criticized the pace later in the run, but the series won industry awards throughout its publication. Plans for a television adaptation were announced April 17, 2013, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in the scripting stage in 2015.|$|E

5|$|The Dream was {{released}} to mostly positive reception. While the Dream was praised for its solid and robust hardware design, {{the introduction of}} the Android operating system was met with criticism for its lack of certain functionality and third-party software in comparison to more established platforms, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> considered to be innovative due to its open nature, notifications system, and heavy integration with Google's services.|$|E
5|$|The {{all-time record}} between the clubs stood at 3–2 {{in favor of}} Seattle. The Sounders had beaten the Union {{earlier in the year}} during league play, but Philadelphia had {{improved}} since then. By the time of the final, the Union had a 10-game unbeaten streak at home. Seattle had recently lost three of five MLS matches <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> one of the best teams in the league. Seattle was the favorite, with one pundit comparing Philadelphia to perennial underdog Rocky Balboa of the film series Rocky.|$|E
5|$|The hemmema {{replaced}} the galleys {{that had made}} up {{the core of the}} Swedish archipelago fleets until the mid-18th century. Compared to galleys, the hemmema had a deeper draft and was slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for the crew, carried more stores, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns. It could be propelled by either sails or oars <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships, which made it suitable for operations in confined waters.|$|E

5|$|The storyline was {{originally}} slated for the finale {{of the first}} series, but was pushed forward when the producers were pressured to deliver the story to the BBC. Filming took two weeks, around December 2001. After its original broadcast, the episode was viewed by over eight million Britons, a decline of one million from the first episode, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> the strongest performer in its time slot. The episode marked {{the death of a}} main character, Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner), which was met with considerable controversy due to its perceived violence; at 250 complaints, it marked the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002.|$|E
5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah crashing to the canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E

5|$|Although L'Hermite {{achieved}} minor successes against individual British shipping, his {{force was}} too small to have a serious impact on British trade in the region and the promised reinforcements failed to materialise {{in the aftermath of the}} destruction of the Cadiz fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, ten days before L'Hermite sailed although before news of the battle had reached Lorient. In early January 1806, L'Hermite managed to capture a small British naval brig <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> unable to make any significant impact on British trade operations. In the spring of 1806 L'Hermite withdrew across the Atlantic, taking on supplies and effecting repairs in neutral Brazil. During the return journey to France in August 1806, the squadron was caught in a major hurricane and one frigate was severely damaged, limping to a port in the United States for repairs. The rest of the squadron continued on to France, L'Hermite reaching Brest in his flagship Régulus. The other frigate was intercepted by a British blockade squadron on 27 September 1806 and captured in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{performing}} {{well enough}} to maintain {{his place in the}} England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire {{at the end of the}} 1948–49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.|$|E
