40|$|Background: Difficult {{or failed}} {{tracheal}} intubation {{has been identified}} {{as one of the most}} important causes of death or permanent brain damage during anaesthesia. The present study has aimed to compare modified Mallampati score, Upper lip <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> and sternomental distance for predicting difficult intubation in adult patients. Methods: In this study 199 patients aged 18 - 60 years were recruited who were undergoing elective surgeries requiring endotracheal intubation. All patients were evaluated using modified Mallampati score, upper lip <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> and sternomental distance. Laryngoscopy was assessed by an attending anaesthesiologist blinded to the measurements and graded according to Cormack and Lehane's grading system. Specificity, sensitivity, predictive positive value (PPV), predictive negative value (PNV), accuracy and agreement with larygoscopic grading were calculated for each parameter. Results: Specificities for modified Mallampati, upper lip <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> and sternomental distance were 65. 6, 98. 9 and 94 %, respectively. All the tests had a NPV more than 90 %, indicating that, these tests can be good predictors of easy intubation. Sternomental distance showed greatest agreement with laryngoscopic grading (kappa = 0. 536, P< 0. 001) as well as maximum area under the ROC curve (0. 955). Conclusions: The high specificity, NPV, PPV and accuracy of sternomental distance compared to other tests makes it the single best test in predicting difficulty intubation. However, a combination of all three tests was found to be more sensitive and had higher discriminative power compared to any single test alone.

40|$|Aim and Objective of the Study: This {{prospective}} study was undertaken at Christian Medical College and Hospital Vellore, India. In {{this study we}} evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of airway examination tests including: modified Mallampati test (MMT) Thyromental Distance (TMD), ULBT (Upper Lip <b>Bite</b> <b>Test).</b> BMI (Body Mass Index) was also included {{as one of the}} predictors. The tests were evaluated individually and in combination. Methods: Total of 354 patients was recruited. Preoperative airway assessments of patients by Mallampati test, Thyromental Distance measurement, ULBT were done. The BMI was also calculated. The tests were done by the investigator and Laryngoscopic grading done by another experienced Anaesthetist according to modified Cormack and Lehane classification. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values were analyzed for the individual tests and in combination. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 11. 0. Results: The modified Mallampati had the highest sensitivity of 70 % which was statistically significant with a P = 0. 001.

30|$|Dental {{occlusion}} implies {{much more}} than the occlusal contact relationships of the dentitions and refers to a dynamic biomechanical musculoskeletal system (Jokstad 2012). There are millions of possible mandibular placements for occlusion’s intercuspal position (considering the mandible’s placement in all three dimensions of space) and the range of motion is influenced by a high number of factors. The neuromuscular system adapts easily to these factors determining an “engram” (the so-called “muscle memory”), which cannot be interpreted as a simple mechanical abstraction of motion in a single plane (Lerman 2011).

40|$|Forwarding {{comments}} Failure {{to recognize}} a difficult airway before routine induction of anesthesia, can bring in its wage disastrous complications ranging from hypoxic brain damage to death. Several preoperative airway assessment tests exist that help in anticipating difficult airway. The upper lip <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> (ULBT) introduced by Khan et al 3 almost 20 years after Mallampati classification, is perhaps the latest in predicting difficulty in endotracheal intubation. ULBT test is performed according to the following criteria: class I = lower incisors can bite the upper lip above the vermilion line, class II = lower incisors can bite the upper lip below the vermilion line, class III = lower incisors cannot bite the upper lip. Based on its high Se, Sp and NPV obtained in the original study 3, we hypothesized that the ULBT {{could serve as a}} predictor of difficult mask ventilation (DMV). DMV continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality with an increased incidence of almost 5 %. Five preoperative risk factors (age older than 65 yr, body mass index ≥ 26 kg/m 2, presence of a beard, lack of teeth and history of snoring), have been considered to be independently associated with DMV.

After institutional approval and informed consent were obtained, 300 consecutive patients aged 20 – 60 years of ASA physical status I and II, scheduled for elective surgical procedures requiring tracheal intubation and meeting the inclusion criteria, were enrolled in this study. Each patient was evaluated regarding ULBT, HMD, TSD and ML. Laryngoscopy was assessed by an attending anaesthesiologist blinded to the measurements.

30|$|Our results {{demonstrate}} {{that there is}} no evidence that a first (and only) <b>test</b> <b>bite</b> record is the best representation of the subject’s bite action. This is not a minor issue, considering that no protocol suggests performing more than one <b>test</b> <b>bite</b> record, which implies that slightest distortions may be overlooked if only one <b>test</b> <b>bite</b> record is considered. These slightest distortions do not necessarily represent errors in the recording procedures, but dynamic patterns that can manifest in varying degrees depending on multiple factors. In 2001, Sheasby & MacDonald stated that since the nature of the contact between teeth and the bitten substrate can influence the resulting bite mark, it is logical to postulate that the dynamics of the biting action may produce distortions known as “primary distortions”. According to these authors, these distortions are complex, unpredictable, and absolutely dependent and proportional to the degree of movement between the teeth and the bitten substrate (Sheasby and MacDonald 2001). It is extremely interesting to mention that although the authors report that each episode of contact is a unique dynamic event, and that the same dentition can produce bite marks with different forms of appearance (Sheasby and MacDonald 2001), we have not found a <b>test</b> <b>bite</b> protocol that explicitly considers performing more than one single record to control this phenomenon. The results of our research {{demonstrate that}} a first (and only) <b>test</b> <b>bite</b> may be masking slightest distortions that, at the time of the comparative analysis, may increase the chances of producing false positives or false negatives. Although registering the suspect’s incisal edges appears to be a simple protocol, problems can arise when introduced as evidence. Karazulas (1984) reported a case wherein <b>test</b> <b>bites</b> performed by the defense showed a different dental pattern different than the <b>test</b> <b>bites</b> produced by prosecution. The defendant was finally acquitted of the murder, but spent 7 years in prison and endured three trials before being proven innocent and released. Performing at least three <b>test</b> <b>bites</b> would not cause any delays or increased costs (most of the recommended materials are very economical and easy to manipulate), but would allow evaluation and selection of the highest quality sample (according to our results, any of the three registers may be the best representation of the subject’s bite), as well as help detect dynamic patterns of the bite. The latter statement is currently hypothetical -at least in the forensic discipline- but it is extremely attractive to start future lines of research.|$|R

40|$|Background: Unanticipated {{difficult}} {{tracheal intubation}} remains a primary concern of anaesthesiologists and upper lip <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> (ULBT) {{is one of}} the assessments used in predicting difficult intubation. In this study, we aimed to check the utility of lateral neck X-ray measurements in improving the diagnostic value of the ULBT. Methods: In a prospective study conducted from January 2007 until December 2010, we recorded personal and demographic data of 4500 patients who entered the study and subjected them to standard lateral neck radiography. Before the induction of anaesthesia, clinical examination and ULBT results were recorded and during induction of anaesthesia laryngoscopic grading was evaluated and recorded in questionnaires. All the compiled data were analysed by SPSS 14. 0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. Diagnostic value for each test was calculated and compared. Results: Negative predictive values (NPVs) were high in all tests. ULBT had the highest specificity and NPV compared with the other tests. The positive predictive value for all the tests had been low, but marginally high in the ULBT. Conclusion: Although all the tests used had relatively acceptable predictive values, combination of tests appeared to be more predictive. Highest sensitivities were observed with ULBT, mandibulohyoid distance and thyromental distance respectively. Use of radiological parameters may not be suitable as screening tools, but may help in anticipating and preparing for a difficult scenario...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of difficult intubation in patients undergoing general anaesthesia {{is estimated to}} be approximately 1 - 18 % whereas that of failure to intubate is 0. 05 - 0. 35 %. 1, 2, 3 Various methods have been used for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy. Although, upper lip bite {{has been shown to be}} a promising test in its introductory article, repeated validation in various populations is required for any test to be accepted as a routine test. We have compared upper lip <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> (ULBT), modified Mallampati test (MMC) and thyromental distance (TMD) individually and in various combinations to verify which of these predictor tests are significantly associated with difficult glottic exposure. Methods: After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval, 402 ASA I and II adult patients undergoing elective surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation were included. All the three test were performed in all the patients preoperatively and their glottic exposure was recorded by Cormack-Lehane classification during intubation.

40|$|Background: Preoperative airway {{assessment}} {{tests have}} been presented to help in anticipating a difficult airway. We conducted this study to compare five methods in prediction of difficult laryngoscopy: Neck circumference (NC), NC to thyromental distance ratio (NC/TMD), the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD), upper lip <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> (ULBT) and Mallampati test (MMT). These five methods are {{the most commonly used}} ones and have different powers for it. It was not clear which of these methods predicts difficult laryngoscopy better. Materials and Methods: Six hundred consecutive patients participated in this study. NC, NC/TMD and RHTMD were measured, and ULBT and MMT were performed and recorded. The laryngoscopy view was graded according to Cormack and Lehane′s scale (CLS) and difficult laryngoscopy was defined as CLS grades 3 and 4. Accuracy of tests in predicting difficult laryngoscopy was assessed using the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve. Results: The area under the curve in ULBT and RHTMD were significantly larger than that in TMD, NC and MMT. No statistically significant differences were noted between TMD, NC and MMT (all P > 0. 05) (ULBT = RHTMD > NC/TMD > TMD = NC = MMT). RHTMD (> 22. 7 cm) exhibited the highest sensitivity (sensitivity = 64. 77, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 53. 9 - 74. 7) and the most specific test was ULBT (specificity = 99. 41 %, 95 % CI: 98. 3 - 99. 9).

METHODS: The surfaces of the sensor were manufactured in a silicone material that had mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} tough foodstuffs. In two separate series of standardized <b>bite</b> force <b>tests,</b> submaximum force levels were recorded with the sensor and with a strain gaged bite fork. Subjects were assisted in the loading tests with visual feedback instrumentation. Reliability estimates for the bite force sensor were calculated in order to show their reproducibility. Strain gages attached to the prostheses were used to determine the pattern of force distribution during loading <b>tests.</b> The <b>bite</b> force results obtained with the new bite force sensor and with the bite fork were analyzed with ANOVA and Scheffes tests. The strain patterns registered with strain gages were analyzed with F-test. RE-SULTS: The bite force sensor and the bite fork transducer showed no statistically significant differences in respect of intra-individual bite force levels (range 50 - 300 N). The bite forces registered with the new sensor were dependent on the loading position (p< 0. 05), sex (p< 0. 05) and test subject (p< 0. 05). The reliability of the new sensor for sub-maximum bite forces was calculated to be 93 %. Strain gage results showed that the new sensor generated strain patterns of less variance (p< 0. 05) than the bite fork and therefore allowed for higher precision during <b>biting</b> <b>tests.</b> SIGNIFICANCE: The presented instrument has such clinical merits, as to favor its use in experimental clinical studies on the biomechanics of prosthetic appliances...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{can resist}} {{herbivore}} pressure through structural or chemical defence or both. The {{ultimate goal of}} defence against herbivory {{is to reduce the}} amount of damage to biomass, but more specifically to protect against damage to meristematic tissue. The defences employed depend on the type of herbivory experienced, which is contingent on the herbivore and its mouthparts. This investigation was concerned with structural defence presented by spines. This type of defence protects against mammalian herbivores such as browsers. Spiny species do not dominate in low-light deep forest environments. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the constraints on spines as a defence strategy under shaded conditions by assessing the effect of reduced light on spine efficiency. Spine efficiency was defined as the amount of defence afforded the plant given the resources available. Spines require carbon to be built and need to be arranged properly in order to present an adequate defence. Thus two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were proposed: Light limitation reduces the ability of spines to present an adequate defence against browsers due to the architectural strategy employed and/or its influence on carbon gain. The spinescent plant chosen for study was Carissa macrocarpa (Ecklon) A. DC. Light condition of plants was determined using hemispherical photography. Spine efficiency of sun and shade plants was determined using a <b>bite</b> <b>test</b> and was evaluated using architectural and physiological analyses. Architectural analysis involved identifying levels of organisation within the plant across ontogeny and indentifying sun and shade growth strategies. Physiological analysis involved determining carbon gain of sun and shade individuals using gas-exchange measurements, as well as the measurement of biomass allocation by harvesting and oven drying different plant parts. Results showed that biomass allocation patterns of C. macrocarpa did not change in sun and shade but total biomass increased from shade to sunlit conditions. Architectural analysis revealed that in the sun the plant adopted a stout dense structure with high spine efficiency, while in the shade it was more elongated with lower spine efficiency. Therefore C. macrocarpa adapts to the light environment by adopting either the shade or the sun architectural strategy. The way in which this works is that light affects carbon gain, which either increases or decreases biomass and in turn leads the plant to adopt the sun or shade architectural strategy. The architectural strategy affects spine efficiency such that plants in the sun have higher spine efficiency than plants in the shade. Thus, spinescent plants do not do well in light limited environments because they are architecturally constrained to elongate in such conditions. This constraint would put them at higher risk of browser damage than plants in light-sufficient conditions, ultimately decreasing their fitness. If the patterns observed in C. macrocarpa prove to be general, then it helps to explain why spiny plants are more commonly found in open, sunlit environments than in deep shade...|$|E

Numerous restorative materials {{have been used}} to fabricate indirect full-coverage restorations for such teeth. This study aims to evaluate and compare the effect of restorative materials on the stress distribution pattern in a mandibular first molar tooth, under varying loading conditions and to compare the stress distribution pattern in five commonly used indirect restorative materials. Materials and Methods: Five three-dimensional finite element models representing a mandibular first molar tooth restored with crowns of gold, porcelain fused to metal, composite (Artglass), alumina-based zirconia (In-Ceram Zirconia [ICZ]), and double-layered zirconia-based materials (zirconia core veneered with porcelain, Lava) were constructed, using a Finite Element Analysis Software (ANSYS version 10; ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA). Two loading conditions were applied, simulating maximum bite force of 600 N axially and normal masticatory bite force of 225 N axially and nonaxially. Results: Both all-ceramic crowns allowed the least amount of stress distribution to the surrounding tooth structure. In maximum <b>bite</b> force-simulation <b>test,</b> alumina-based all-ceramic crown displayed the highest von Mises stresses (123. 745 MPa). In the masticatory <b>bite</b> force-simulation <b>test,</b> both all-ceramic crowns (122. 503 – 133. 13 MPa) displayed the highest von Mises stresses. Conclusions: ICZ crown displayed the highest peak von Mises stress values under maximum and masticatory bite forces. ICZ and Lava crowns also allowed the least amount of stress distribution to the surrounding tooth structure, which is indicative of a favorable response of the underlying tooth structure to the overlying full-coverage indirect restorative material.

Post exposure prophylaxis is specific anti-rabies immunoglobulin (or antibody)providing passive protection via neutralization and clearance of the Rabies virus. This is the regimen to be followed in the event of any exposure of humans to suspect zoonotic vectors, while immunization, although effective, is predisposed to temporal limitations.|$|R

Increased jamming resistance, improved weather penetration, better {{guidance in}} turn flight, and better power management function in semi-covert mission. The radar can operate in terrain-clearance, terrain-avoidance, air-to-air ranging and cross-scan modes, the latter combining ground-mapping or terrain-avoidance with terrain-following. A terrain storage facility permits the radar {{to have a}} reduced duty cycle, thereby reducing the probability of detection by enemy ESM equipment. There's also the incorporation of built-in <b>test</b> (<b>BITE)</b> provides {{a high degree of}} fault isolation and detection.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCrimean-Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} (CCHF) is a fatal viral disease {{that occurs in}} {{approximately}} 30 countries. It has the most extensive geographic range among the tick-borne viruses that affect human health. Recently, a 6 -year-old boy presented with complaints of fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite. He revealed a history of tick bite in rural Istanbul three days prior to presentation. A hyperemia was detected {{at the site of}} the tick <b>bite.</b> Laboratory <b>tests</b> showed that alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated and that the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were prolonged. Anti-CCHF virus IgM ELISA and a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay for CCHF RNA were both positive. Phylogenetic studies revealed that the virus was a new AP 92 -like CCHF strain, which was named KMAG-Hu- 07 - 01 (accession number EU 057975). This patient could provide important information on the transmission dynamics of CCHF infection...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{reported}} the incidence or prevalence of cracked teeth with pulpal involvement. No {{attempts have been made}} to evaluate the prevalence or clinical predictors for intrapulpal cracks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of intrapulpal cracks in first and second mandibular molars and to determine if clinical findings are predictive for the existence of intrapulpal cracks. First and second mandibular molars (190) requiring non-surgical root canal treatment at the VCU Graduate Endodontic Practice between February 15, 2013 and August 15, 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Teeth were transilluminated, stained, and inspected for intrapulpal cracks using a dental microscope. Data gathered included: demographics, subjective and objective information regarding the chief complaint to include <b>bite</b> stick <b>test,</b> transillumination, probing depths greater than 4 mm, existing restorations, and diagnosis. Chi-square and logistic regression were performed (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The prevalence of intrapulpal cracks in first and second mandibular molars combined was 9...|$|R
