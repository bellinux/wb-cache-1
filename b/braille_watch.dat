50|$|A <b>braille</b> <b>watch</b> is a {{portable}} timepiece {{used by the}} {{blind or visually impaired}} to tell time. It is used by touching the dial and noticing the embossments. Both analog and digital versions are available. The analog versions have a protective glass or crystal cover that is flipped open when time needs to be read and the clock-hands are constructed to not be susceptible to movement at the mere touch of the finger that a blind person uses to observe their positions. In the digital form, the dots (like braille script) keep changing position as time changes. In this case, one must understand the Braille alphabet to read the watch.|$|E

General technology is inclusive of computers, smartphones and cell phones whereas Assistive technology consists of devices developed to help people with vision impairment or other visual disabilities. The Assistive technology comprises everything starting from screen readers for visually impaired people or screen enlargers for low vision PCs, to <b>braille</b> <b>watches</b> and <b>braille</b> printers. In most of the system, prototype has been developed which will ease the routine chores performed by the visually impaired individuals. We will provide most of their prototype details in this paper along with some other scenarios. There is some development in the specified field of reading printed as well as digital text. These technologies help visually impaired people to read normal text {{with the help of}} audio outputs. We will also focus our attention on those aspects which are still in development phase and are facing some critical problems. The primary motive of this technology is precise scanning and text-to-speech transformations in order to achieve efficient output.
