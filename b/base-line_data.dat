In addition, few habitats unaffected by human disturbance remain in Australia, and evaluation of these fauna in these areas is required before further habitat loss occurs. Generally an unknown group of terrestrial predatory invertebrates in Australia, carabids have been the subjects of few ecological studies in this country. This restricts the utility of the Carabidae in environmental or conservation assessment programs in Australia. A study was initiated to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation and to provide <b>base-line</b> phenological <b>data</b> on the carabid fauna occurring in remnant bushland areas within part of the Perth Metropolitan Area, encompassing the Quindalup, Spearwood and Bassendean Dunes Systems, and Ridge Hill Shelf geological landforms of the Swan Coastal Plain. An intensive study, documenting and comparing seasonal occurrence of carabids was also carried out in bushland remnants within the Quindalup Dune System. Pitfall traps from a Western Australian Museum survey and from the author 2 ̆ 7 s fieldwork, accessed 39 sites in 14 remnant areas across the four geological landforms of the Swan Coastal Plain concurrently in 1993 through to 1997. A total of 3049 specimens of 37 species representing 26 genera and 11 subfamilies were collected. The richest geological landform was found to be the Bassendean Dune System with 17 species, followed closely by the Quindalup Dune System (12) and the Ridge Hill Shelf (14 species).

40|$|The ACTH cells form a layer 1 - 8 cells thick, dorsal to the {{prolactin}} {{cells in}} the rostral pars distalis. They react only mildly {{with a variety of}} stains including PAS-lead haematoxylin. Their nuclear diameters vary seasonally in a manner that closely parallels that of the prolactin cells. The relative volumes of the ACTH and prolactin cell zones are remarkably constant in animals of different sizes. It is suggested that the two hormones may act synergistically at various body sites and that this accounts for the related morphological features of the ACTH and prolactin cells. There are no changes in the surface density of the ACTH zone with increasing animal size. Consequently, the ACTH/neurohypophysial border is highly convoluted in large animals. The proximity of the neurohypophysis also influences cell ultrastructure, as small processes, packed with secretory granules are more numerous near the basal lamina separating the adeno- and neurohypophyses. A morphometric analysis of ACTH cells provides <b>base-line</b> ultrastructural <b>data</b> for experimental studies and for comparisons with other teleosts.

The weights of the oviduct/uterus, vagina and the entire tubular organ were consistently higher during the harmattan season (0. 789 ± 0. 07 g, 2. 708 ± 0. 19 g and 3. 455 ± 0. 25 g, respectively) than the hot – dry (0. 591 ± 0. 02 g, 2. 239 ± 0. 13 g and 2. 831 ± 0. 14 g, respectively) and the rainy season (0. 723 ± 0. 04 g, 2. 412 ± 0. 01 g and 3. 148 ± 0. 12 g, respectively). The mean weight and length of the ovary were not significantly different throughout the season, suggesting that the AGR may breed throughout the year. The slight increase in the weight of the tubular organ during the harmattan (November – February) and the rainy (June – October) season suggests that the seasons may be favourable for breeding, probably because of the abundance of food available to the rodents in the wild during the seasons. The decrease in weights of the organs during the hot-dry season (March – May) was, apparently, due to the unfavourable climatic conditions and food scarcity during the season.

DESIGN: Estimates were made of dietary magnesium intake from food frequency records, supplemented by seven-day weighted intake records. The subsequent incidence of ischaemic heart disease events was recorded. The relative odds of an IHD event was related to base-line magnesium intake. SETTING: Data on dietary magnesium intakes are available for 2172 men aged 45 - 59 y in the Caerphilly cohort. These have now been followed for ten years since <b>base-line</b> dietary <b>data</b> were collected, and during this time a total of 269 IHD events occurred. Of these, 96 were acute deaths (ICD 410) and 136 were non-fatal myocardial infarctions. RESULTS: The overall mean dietary intake of magnesium was estimated to be 279 (s. d. 83) mg/day. The daily intake of those men who later experienced any IHD event was 266 (s. d. 84) mg/day and this differs from that in men who experienced no IHD event during this time (281 mg, P 0. 05, and to 0. 9 (s. e. m. 5. 8) mg for acute IHD death. Similarly, when the men are ranked into fifths by their daily Mg intake, 70 of the 434 men with the lowest intakes went on to experience an IHD event, compared with only 41 of the 434 men with the highest Mg intakes.

40|$|Buruli ulcer (BU) infection, {{caused by}} Mycobacterium ulcerans, an {{environmental}} pathogen, is a disfiguring {{disease of the}} skin and occasionally the bones. Although mortality is rare, morbidity is high. All age groups are affected but children less than 17 years-of-age are at highest risk. BU {{has been reported in}} several tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, particularly among poor, rural populations with limited access to basic water, sanitation and health facilities. However, most cases are from West-Africa and Ghana reports about 1, 000 cases annually. Since the mode of transmission for BU is unclear and considering the extent of BU-related morbidity, public health programmes to control BU are very important. This research examined the role of demographic, gender-related and socio-cultural features of BU and how these features affect the quality of timely treatment for BU clinical management and control in Ghana. The research was conducted in the Ga-West and Ga-South municipalities of Ghana. These areas are the fifth most endemic for BU in Ghana, yet they have the highest burden in terms of healed and active lesions. The research had three components. A community study surveyed 504 heads of households, conducted 7 focus group discussions and assessed knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of BU-affected persons in 2005.

The data, collected using a carton oral production task (COPT), were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results showed three important findings that illuminate the relationship between pragmatic development and grammatical competence and lent support to Kasper and Rose's (2003) claim of a universal pragmatic principle. The first finding suggested that basic adult learners possess a previous pragmatic knowledge in their L 1 that allows them to focus on the intended meaning and, in most cases, and to assemble (from the linguistic structures available to them) an utterance that conveys a pragmatic intention and satisfies the communicative demands of a social situation. The second finding revealed that there are two essential conditions to communicate a linguistic action: the knowledge of the relevant linguistic rules and the knowledge of how to use them appropriately and effectively in a specific context. Without an elementary knowledge of the linguistic rules, it is impossible to select the forms to realize a speech act in a target-like manner. The findings further suggested that advanced learners possess the grammatical knowledge to produce an illocutionary act, but they need to learn the specific L 2 pragmatic conventions that enable them to know when to use these grammatical forms and under what circumstances.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) is a large, multicenter {{chemoprevention}} trial {{testing the}} efficacy of the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen for prevention of breast cancer and coronary heart disease in healthy women at high risk of breast cancer. The BCPT evolved from a series of prior studies in early stage breast cancer demonstrating {{the efficacy of}} tamoxifen in the prevention of systemic breast cancer recurrence and in the reduction of contralateral breast cancers. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the methodologic considerations in the collection of health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) data in the BCPT and to present <b>base-line</b> HRQL <b>data</b> on the first 9749 participants. METHODS: An HRQL questionnaire that included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, a symptom checklist, the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item short form (MOS-SF- 36), and the MOS sexual problems questions was completed by participants in the BCPT at base line (prior to random assignment). Medical and demographic information, as well as projected risk of breast cancer, were collected as part of study eligibility. Descriptive and correlational data were examined for these study participants. RESULTS: BCPT participants report high levels of functioning compared with U. S. general population norms but still report an average of 8. 9 distinct symptoms during the past 4 weeks. Depression is less prevalent among the participants than in community samples, which reflects the exclusion of clinically depressed individuals. Sixty-five percent reported being sexually active in the past 6 months, with an age-related decline in sexual activity. Younger women reported fewer sexual problems than older women. There is a strong correlation between the two mental health measures, moderate to weak correlations between HRQL scales and levels of self-reported symptoms, and only weak correlations between measures of breast cancer risk and HRQL scales. The MOS-SF- 36 scores were examined for three consecutive recruitment samples (0 - 6 months, 7 - 12 months, and 13 - 20 months), and the base-line scores were slightly better for the earliest group of participants. CONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates the feasibility of collecting HRQL data in a large, multicenter, chemoprevention trial for women at high risk of breast cancer. The successful integration of HRQL data collection into this clinical trial attests to its value as a safety-monitoring end point and as an explicit and measurable outcome for the entire trial. IMPLICATIONS: HRQL data are important for studies in which healthy populations are involved and in which the potential for decrements in quality of life are real or perceived...|$|R
40|$|Background: Oral {{health care}} {{provision}} for aged-care facility residents remains problematic worldwide, with both institutional and professional barriers preventing regular provision of this service. Purpose: To identify factors affecting the oral {{health status of}} elderly war veterans which {{are different from those}} reported for non-veteran aged-care facility residents. Methods and Materials: A small pilot study of 30 aged-care facility residents was performed at a dedicated rest home and hospital for war veterans in Dunedin, New Zealand. The study included data collection and a clinically-based head, neck and oral examination for each of the participating residents to establish a <b>base-line.</b> Oral health <b>data</b> were then integrated with the general medical notes and recommendations for each resident were given in terms of oral health maintenance with appropriate referrals for treatment needs. A literature review was performed using web-based on-line search engines to compare the oral health needs of these veterans with other non-veteran aged-care facility residents. Results: The oral health status and needs of elderly war veterans are no different to other aged-care facility residents in terms of oral hygiene needs, edentulism, dental caries and periodontal disease. Common medical conditions and medications affect both veteran and non-veteran aged-care facility residents in a similar manner. However, poor oral health status was strongly associated with significant mental illness which may be more prevalent in a veteran population and include depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol abuse. Conclusion: The oral health care needs of a veteran population do not differ greatly from the needs of other non-veteran aged-care facility residents but greater consideration should be given during assessment for possible service-related oral conditions and mental illness issues including PTSD and alcohol abuse.
