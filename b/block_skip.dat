To handle the complex and ill-posed nature of the {{problems}} of audio source separation, the current state-of-the-art approaches employ deep neural networks to obtain instrumental spectra from a mixture. In this study, we propose a novel network architecture that extends the recently developed densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), which has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. To deal with the specific problem of audio source separation, an up-sampling layer, <b>block</b> <b>skip</b> connection and band-dedicated dense blocks are incorporated on top of DenseNet. The proposed approach takes advantage of long contextual information and outperforms state-of-the-art results on SiSEC 2016 competition by a large margin in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio. Moreover, the proposed architecture requires significantly fewer parameters and considerably less training time compared with other methods. Comment: to appear at WASPAA 201...|$|E

40|$|The pattern-based video coding (PVC) outperforms the H. 264 through better {{exploitation}} of block partitioning and partial <b>block</b> <b>skipping.</b> In the PVC scheme the best pattern is determined against the moving regions (MRs) in a macroblock (MB) {{of the current}} frame against the co-located MB in the reference frame; motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC) are carried out using the pattern covered MRs, {{and the rest of}} the regions are treated as skipped areas. The MRs can be due to the object areas and the uncovered background (UCB) areas. Thus, the ME & MC by the pattern for the MRs of the UCB would not be accurate if there is no similar region in the reference frame. As a result no coding gain can be achieved for the UCB. Recently a dynamic background frame termed as the McFIS (the most common frame of a scene) has been generated using Gaussian mixture models for object detection. In this paper we propose a new PVC technique which will use the McFIS as a reference frame to determine the MRs where only object areas will be captured as the MRs. Thus, the proposed technique overcomes the mismatch problem of the UCB for ME&MC. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in comparison with the existing PVC and McFIS-based methods by achieving significant image quality gain.
