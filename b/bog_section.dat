40|$|Pollen {{data are}} well {{established}} for quantitative climate reconstructions over long timescales, including the Holocene and older interglacials. However, anthropogenically induced environmental change in central Europe was strong {{during the last}} 4 ka, challenging quantitative reconstructions of this time period. Here we present quantitative climate reconstructions based on pollen analyses and evaluate them with the peat humification record and the stable carbon isotopes of Sphagnum plant material (delta C- 13 (cellulose)) (.) All analyses were carried out on the same 7. 5 m long, largely ombrotrophic peat <b>bog</b> <b>section</b> from Durres Maar. Three different methods {{were used for the}} quantitative climate reconstructions {{on the basis of the}} pollen data: (1) a probabilistic indicator taxa approach (the 'pdf method'); (2) a modern analogue technique based on pollen taxa from modern surface samples (cMAT); and (3) a modern analogue technique expanded by plant functional types (pMAT). At Durres Maar the peat humification is only affected by peat cutting during the Roman period and the Middle Ages. The stable carbon isotopes are seemingly unaffected by human impact. Thus both proxies provide independent data to evaluate the reconstructions on the basis of pollen data. The quantitative climate reconstructions on the basis of the individual methods are in general relatively similar. Nevertheless, distinct differences between the individual approaches are also apparent, which could be attributed to taxa that reflect human impact on a local to regional scale. While the pdf method appears to be relatively robust to all observed anthropogenically induced vegetation changes, it potentially underestimates climate variability. This method is therefore expected to be independent of local site characteristics and to provide robust quantitative estimates of climatic trends rather than of climatic variability of small amplitude. This is of value for palaeoclimate reconstructions of older interglacials, for which neither multiple sites nor independent climate proxies are available for comparison.

It is a geographically separated section of the Lakeshore that is preserved as a piece of public beach access and an example of the same theme of plant succession as is found in Cowles <b>Bog.</b> This <b>section</b> of the Lakeshore displays most of the successive stages of Indiana Dunes biotic progression, from open beach sands to mature Eastern Black Oak forest. A new (2007) West Beach Succession Trail ( [...] in length) features different stages of plant succession in the beach and inland dunes.|$|R

These two parallel ridges divide the <b>bog</b> in three <b>sections.</b> The northern ridge (Dolman Ridge) used to have farms, which were expropriated in 1958 and subsequently removed, while the southern ridge (Borthwick Ridge) continues to have a few farms on it and provides access to the visitor boardwalk.|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{distributions}} {{in modern}} peat-forming plants were determined and compared to biomarkers {{recovered from a}} ca. 2800 year old peat deposited in a Dutch ombrotrophic <b>bog.</b> The peat <b>section</b> spans a well-constrained shift in local hydrology and vegetation, and potential molecular proxies for plant inputs were directly tested against the macrofossil record. Based on the analyses of modern plants, low-molecular-weight (LMW) n-alkanes (C 23, C 25) and high-molecular-weight n-alkanes (C 33) are proposed as potential biomarkers for Sphagnum and non-Sphagnum inputs, respectively. Consistent with this, in the Bargerveen peat core, LMW n-alkane abundances increase and HMW n-alkane abundances decrease coincident with the shift to Sphagnum dominated peat. Additional potential proxies include the abundances of C 22,-alkanedioic acid and phytenyl phytenoate as Sphagnum indicators and the abundances of the triterpenoids taraxer- 14 -ene and taraxast- 20 -ene as biomarkers for Ericaceae rootlets...|$|R
2500|$|The {{construction}} of the Nenagh to Limerick section was slow and difficult. Work on this section began on 7 December 2006 and was initially due {{to be completed in}} May 2009. The total length of the scheme is , of which [...] was the upgrading of the single carriageway Nenagh bypass. The road opened in three stages. [...] The Nenagh bypass re-opened to motorway standard on 17 December 2009 and the Nenagh to Birdhill section opened on 1 April 2010. Problems were encountered while constructing the road over two <b>sections</b> of deep <b>bog</b> at Annaholty and Drominboy near Birdhill and this delayed the opening of the Birdhill to Limerick section by over a year. Parts of the road collapsed over the two <b>bogs</b> and the <b>sections</b> were rebuilt and opened on 28 September 2010. This scheme was originally to be built as a high-quality dual carriageway (HQDC), but it was re-designated motorway by Statutory Instrument on 17 July 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The Inny, {{which is}} a major {{tributary}} of the River Shannon, flows into and from Lough Derravaragh on its northwest shore. On this side, the lake is wide and shallow and raised bog and cutover bog are found within the immediate surrounding area (cutover bog is bog where some peat has been harvested, leaving remaining peat behind). Lough Derravaragh is shallow and its water is [...] "hard", meaning it is alkaline. There {{is only a small}} area of raised bog on the side, but formerly it comprised a very large bog complex which extended towards the northwest of the lake. Most of this area has now been cutover and large areas have been reclaimed for agriculture. The remaining area of bog has hummock/hollow complexes but no water pools. Conifers have been planted upon the high <b>bog</b> and a <b>section</b> of cutover. Cutover is found dispersed around the high bog areas and there is also a separate small area of old cutover south of this raised bog.|$|R
500|$|In 1961, {{the federal}} {{government}} passed the Western Australian Grants (Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961, known as the Beef Roads Scheme, that encouraged road building in the Kimberley. This had followed on from an earlier federal grant scheme in 1949 {{for the construction of}} a road from Nicholson to Wyndham. The road allowed trucks to efficiently transport cattle to port, rather than the slow cattle drives that could lose stock and take weeks to complete. The 1961 Beef Roads Scheme initially included upgrading the Wyndham to Halls Creek section of Great Northern Highway as one of three projects in the region. One year later the scheme was expanded to include the Broome to Halls Creek section of the highway, and several bridge construction projects. However, the resources allocated to Great Northern Highway were needed to maintain the highway as an unsealed road in a usable condition, rather than to completely seal the roadway. In 1963, work was completed on stabilising a [...] sandy section to prevent vehicles from becoming <b>bogged,</b> a [...] <b>section</b> was realigned to avoid the Fortescue River floodplain, and [...] between Marble Bar and Port Hedland was also realigned to minimise the effects of wet weather.|$|R
5000|$|The A18 Snaefell Mountain Road {{reflects}} typical 19th century {{highway and}} railway construction practices. Built {{over a period}} of time in the Nineteenth century from a number of horse paths, ancient rights of way of the Regiam Viam (Royal Way) [...] (archaic|Bayr-yn-Ree) and a series of pre-existing carting-tracks and incomplete stone mountain paths which traversed mountain land, peat <b>bogs</b> and hillside <b>sections.</b> [...] The Keppel Gate section is situated between the 4th milestone and 5th milestone markers on the A18 Snaefell Mountain Road of the small and larger metal Garrow type of markers from the period of James Garrow as Survey-General of Isle of Man Highways and Roads. The Disafforesting Commission of 1860 [...] allowed for the sale of parcels of land in 1863 for the purpose of building and fencing of new mountain road sections on Crown Common lands partly financed by the land sales and by a financial contribution from the UK Crown Receiver. The new purpose built Keppel Gate section of A18 Snaefell Mountain Road was constructed in the period from 1864 to 1866. This included a new section of road from near the former Cold Clay Methodist Chapel on the C22 Little Mill Road to [...] "O'Donnell's" [...] corner near to Gob-ny- Geay farm creating 'Telegraph Hill.' A further new section of road including a Cutting near to Gob-ny-Geay farm in the parish of Onchan and by-passed the former 'White Lane' creating the new 'Creg-ny-Baa Corner' and the nearby 'Keppel Gate Inn' was built on the site (c 1883). The Ordnance Survey of 1867-8 shows a further section of road built in the period of 1864-66 from the Creg-ny-Baa corner that traversed the steep 'Keppel' or Slieau Ree mountain which dominates this area of the A18 Snaefell Mountain Road [...] to the site of a former Shepherd's Hut near to Kate's Cottage. The new 'Keppel Gate Road' by-passed a section of the former right of way (Creg-ny-Bayr) now part of public footpath to the Windy Corner on the A18 Snaefell Mountain Road. The Crown Commons land at Keppel Gate (known as 'Slieau Lhoost' or the Cairns) of 1,165 acres was purchased from the UK Crown Receiver by the Isle of Man Government for a price of £2,000 in 1933 for the purpose of fencing of the A18 Snaefell Mountain Road and the removal of two mountain gates at Keppel Gate for the 1934 Isle of Man TT races. The remaining Crown Common lands were purchased by the Isle of Man Common Lands Board for the Isle of Man Government in 1947. The tenancy for hill-sheep grazing at Keppel Gate was operated by the Mountain Shepherd G. Rhodes Tate from 1926 including a further grazing tenancy at Beinn-y-Phott mountain and with his wife Gladys Tate occupied Keppel Gate Cottage or 'Tate's Cottage,' now known as 'Kate's Cottage.' ...|$|R
