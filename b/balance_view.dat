30|$|There is a {{major shift}} in {{marketing}} practice: From mass marketing (or transaction marketing) to relationship marketing (RM) [16]. The RM is originally defined as “establishing, developing, enhancing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges” [17]. Although this broad conceptualization of RM keeps <b>balance</b> <b>view</b> on attracting new customers and retaining existing customers, subsequent RM research has been concentrated on the enhancement and retention of existing customers in buyer-seller relationships based on exchange [11]. Nevertheless, recent proposition of S-D logic [1, 2] and writings of [18 - 20] suggested that RM research should address the interactive, co-creative experiences of both existing and potential customers. Furthermore, Vivek, Beatty, and Morgan [11] recognized the importance of incorporating CE with RM and named the perspective as “expanded domain of relationship marketing” (i.e., expanded relationship marketing). The expanded RM interacts as “value configurations” among organizations, organizational networks, and existing and potential customers, driven by interested parties in a value-creation virtual network.|$|E

(cf. A. Kneese(2 ̆ 771)). A real economy is open system {{and there are many}} stocks, and　interchanged goods with outside.

40|$|It {{has long}} been taken for granted that the immune system’s {{capacity}} to protect an individual from infection and disease depends {{on the power of}} the system to distinguish between self and nonself. However, accumulating data have undermined this fundamental concept. Evidence against the self/nonself discrimination model left researchers in need of a new overarching framework able to capture the immune system’s reactivity. Here, I highlight that along with the self/nonself model, another powerful representation of the immune system’s reactivity has been developed in the twentieth century immunology. According to this alternative view, the immune system is not a killer of nonself strangers but a peace-maker helping to establish harmony with the environment. The <b>balance</b> <b>view</b> of the system has never become part of the dominant paradigm. However, it is gaining more and more currency as new research develops. Advances in mucosal immunology confirm that instead of distinguishing between self and foreign the immune system reacts to microbial, chemical and self-induced alterations to produce responses that counterbalance effects of these changes...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a new nonstatistical mathematical approach to modeling marital interaction {{by means of}} nonlinear difference equations. The application made of this modeling process in this article is to generate theory in order to understand J. M. Gottman and R. W. Levenson's (1992) report of the ability of one variable derived from a <b>balance</b> <b>view</b> of marital interaction to predict marital dissolution in a prospective study. Parameters are introduced that reflect uninfluenced husband and wife set points, emotional inertia, and influence function. These parameters are subjected to various examinations of validity with other data that reflect patterns of marital interaction and the cascade toward marital dissolution. Results suggest the hypothesis that unstable marriages are characterized at Time 1 by a mismatch in husband and wife influence functions. The modeling method makes it possible to fit a couple's equations under one set of conditions, then to simulate the couple's interaction under different conditions, and then to conduct experiments to test the validity of these simulations. The method provides a new approach toward the building of theory in family psycholog...|$|E
30|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{determinant}} factors of entrepreneurship intentions of Electronic Technology Education students in Nigerian universities. The study explored the influence of entrepreneurial factors as well as entrepreneurial learning experiences activities on the entrepreneurial intentions of Electronic Technology Education students in the universities. The study adopted a correlational survey research design. The population for the study was 366 Electronic Technology Education undergraduate students. There was no sampling as a result of the manageable size of the population. The students were surveyed by direct contact using questionnaire. They were asked to indicate the entrepreneurship learning experiences activities they were participating in/would participate in as part of their curriculum. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple regressions. The findings show that the more entrepreneurial activities students are engaged in, the less the influence of entrepreneurial factors on their entrepreneurial intentions and this significantly increased entrepreneurial intentions of students who prefer career choice as an entrepreneur. The findings also revealed that there is a positive relationship between gender, age, career choice, parents’ occupation, and entrepreneurial intentions of Electronic Technology Education undergraduate students. It was recommended that Electronic Technology Education undergraduate students should see career options with a <b>balance</b> <b>view</b> in order to understand their abilities before deciding to venture in any electronic business enterprise.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} post-industrial society, {{knowledge}} is recognised {{as a primary}} source of a company 2 ̆ 7 s wealth. However knowledge assets are {{much more difficult to}} identify and measure than are the physical assets with which we are much more familiar. (Boisot 1998) As a company 2 ̆ 7 s innovative capacity may be dependent upon its ability to take advantage of its knowledge assets, {{it is important to be}} able to identify and measure those assets. While large companies can afford extensive knowledge management projects, there is a acute need for a method by which managers in smaller organisations can easily and reliably locate and quantify the components of their knowledge assets in order to maximise their potential for innovation. This paper will begin by definiIlg the concept _of knowled elements [...] within the three functions of the knowledge lite cycle. This cycle will then be in ated into the well-known four modes of knowledge conversion between tacit and explicit knowledge as proposed by Nonaka (1995). The paper will then describe the identification, from the literature, of measurable, knowledge elements that will give a <b>balance</b> <b>view</b> of knowledge assets across the integrated model. It will then dislillSs way by which managers can determine the value of these elements in their companies and compare them with other indicators of innovation...|$|E
40|$|In the United States, {{the issue}} of illegal {{immigration}} has been a long-term debate. Every year, millions of people immigrate to the U. S. to seek better opportunities. Out of 370 {{million people in the}} U. S., 11. 1 million are illegal immigrants. These people have either entered the country illegally, or entered the country legally, but stayed beyond their termination date. Illegal immigrants affect the United States in different areas, such as the economy, work force, public services, and crime rate. Some economists say that we benefit from them by keeping wages of low-skilled workers down. But, there are people who believe that they decrease job opportunities for Americans. Others say that these illegal immigrants use a lot of public services, but do not contribute to our society as much as American citizens. And some say that crime rates are high because of these illegal immigrants. However, these statements may not be true. Our goal is to give a fair and <b>balance</b> <b>view</b> of illegal immigrants, and to provide proper insights to this topic. To collect proper data, we will not be conducting any interviews. Instead, the way we would like to collect information and statistics on illegal immigration is by going to the library and research scholarly sources, such as journals and books, as well as using the Internet to collect information from credible sources...|$|E
40|$|On {{the leading}} edge of {{computer}} applications are decision support systems (DSS) and expert systems (ES). Since these are new applications, there are uncertainties about how they should be designed. Currently, there are two dominant ways to design these systems. One way is favored by business people; the other way is supported by computer science people. The former approach, often associated with the DSS term, is the system analysis and design technique. In the latter approach, more often associated with the ES term, the technique of expert system or artificial intelligence is applied. Today, a strong tendency exists for DSS professionals to adopt the ES design format because of the emergence of advanced ES technologies in the 1980 s. However, the ES approach still has many shortcomings which are substantial obstacles to overcome. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation is to find a combined, improved, and new approach which can be accepted by both business people and computer science people in designing a system. In other words, the intent is to design a decision support system by using expert system (ES) design techniques including: computer searching, computer reasoning, knowledge acquisition, and rule/knowledge representation techniques. ^ The new method incorporates ES design techniques into different phases of the traditional development-life cycle. Seven phases [...] identification phase, conceptualization phase, formalization phase, system design phase, system development phase, testing/evaluation phase, and prototype revision phase [...] are the major components of this new method. ^ A prototype example is given to support this new methodology. The purpose of the prototype example is a navigator-aid system which can help the captain dynamically change courses to meet unfavorable sea situations. Because the sea has many uncertainties and unpredictable variables, such as wind, wave, stream, and visibility, which constitute various combinations affecting the ship 2 ̆ 7 s handling, the captain must make course-changes to offset unfavorable combinations of sea situations to keep crew, ship, and cargo safe. ^ In general, in this paper system design is analyzed from two extremes (business approach and computer science approach) and a <b>balance</b> <b>view</b> (the new approach) is developed between these two. This is the first attempt to combine two different research areas, DSS and ES, to form a new, combined, and improved system design approach. The new method appears to satisfy some of the needs of both sides, and it also creates a new research area. ...|$|E
