25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>if</b> this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>if</b> my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

Then on March 31, music publication Jame World confirmed {{the release of}} a new single on May 18, which was revealed to be [...] "Mint".

The production team for the television series approached Amuro's record label, Dimension Point, to participate in recording a song for the show, which she approved.

Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate.

2500|$|Rodriguez {{made his}} 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 {{on the same}} day MLB {{announced}} he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, {{for his role in the}} Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>if</b> Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that's about it."

40|$|Personal Projects Analysis (B. R. Little, 1983) {{was adapted}} to examine {{relations}} between participants' appraisals of their goal characteristics and orthogonal happiness and meaning factors {{that emerged from}} factor analyses of diverse well-being measures. In two studies with 146 and 179 university students, goal efficacy was associated with happiness and goal integrity was associated with meaning. A new technique for classifying participants according to emergent identity themes is introduced. In both studies, identity-compensatory predictors of happiness were apparent. Agentic participants <b>were</b> <b>happiest</b> <b>if</b> their goals <b>were</b> supported by others, communal participants <b>were</b> <b>happiest</b> <b>if</b> their goals <b>were</b> fun, and hedonistic participants <b>were</b> <b>happiest</b> <b>if</b> their goals <b>were</b> being accomplished. The distinction between happiness and meaning is emphasized, and the tension between efficacy and integrity is discussed. Developmental implications are discussed with reference to results from archival data from a sample of senior managers.
