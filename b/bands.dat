5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, pop-rock largely {{consisted}} of the radio-friendly glam metal <b>bands,</b> who used images derived from the British glam movement with macho lyrics and attitudes, accompanied by hard rock music and heavy metal virtuosic soloing. <b>Bands</b> from this era included many British groups like Def Leppard, as well as heavy metal-influenced American <b>bands</b> Mötley Crüe, Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi and Van Halen.|$|E

5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored <b>bands,</b> {{sometimes}} with adjacent <b>bands</b> of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored <b>bands</b> are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal {{groups such}} as Barnabas and Extol have criticized <b>bands</b> within the {{industry}} {{for a lack of}} innovation and for isolating <b>bands</b> within the industry.

There are not always E clarinet, alto clarinet, and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass clarinet parts in concert band music, but all three are quite common.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century brass <b>bands</b> had a poor {{relationship}} with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came {{hand in hand with}} being a member of a band. This changed {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and as well as becoming more respectable, many <b>bands</b> had actually joined the temperance movement. Two of the more well known brass <b>bands</b> from the Rhondda both started as temperance <b>bands.</b> The more famous, Cory Band from Ton Pentre, started life as Ton Temperance in 1884; while local rivals The Parc and Dare Band were the Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band.|$|E

Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).|$|E
