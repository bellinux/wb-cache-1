However, later, in an interview for the Ukrainian version of the Vogue magazine, Milla stated she doesn't actually consider herself Ukrainian. Expressing her disagreement with several newspapers that presented Jovovich as a [...] "Ukrainian actress", her mother Galina said, [...] "They may say whatever they want.

500|$|Amid {{preparations}} for the coronation, Princess Margaret informed her sister that she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorcé‚ 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them {{to wait for a}} year; in the words of Martin Charteris, [...] "the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> thought – she hoped – given time, the affair would peter out." [...] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession. Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend. In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} pilot, [...] "The Thing You Love Most" [...] was co-written by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Smallville co-executive {{producer}} Greg Beeman served as director. The episode {{focuses on the}} rivalry between Emma and Regina, as each believes they know {{what is best for}} Henry. In an interview with TV Overmind, actress Lana Parrilla explained that viewers would see a [...] "vulnerable" [...] side of Regina/The Evil Queen in this episode. Says Parrilla, [...] "What I’ve been trying to show is not the hatred for Snow White, but where it derives from. It’s not so surfaced. That brings a vulnerability to the character. You’ll see into her history and that exposes her in a very vulnerable way as well." [...] As for Regina's troubled relationship with Henry, Parrilla noted that [...] "she may have a cold heart, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> really, genuinely loves her son. She doesn’t think of him as an adopted son, she thinks of him as her son." ...|$|E

She described it as sad to shoot, as she and Morrison were so invested in the storyline, and explained: [...] "What I hope is conveyed is that you see the child inside Terri. You see the fear." [...] Gilsig commented that viewers had been wondering why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant: [...] "I think people have been asking 'How slow is this guy?!'. But [...] Will finally reflects {{that he is a}} fully evolved human being and puts two and two together." [...] She noted that while Will and Emma [...] "are adorable together", she still believes in Terri and Will as a couple: [...] "I think that she really loves him.

500|$|In November 2012, Fatboy {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with his friend Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright). This was teased by executive producer Lorraine Newman {{when it was announced}} Poppy was to become a full-time character. She said, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment." [...] Digital Spy said of the relationship that [...] "viewers will {{have to wait and see}} who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". It was confirmed that Fatboy would be Poppy's new relationship when they kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Poppy's sister Tansy Meadow Daisy Wood-Davis visits and Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend to help Poppy look good in front of Tansy. Bright said of the relationship: [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> can trust Fatboy. I think the pair of them need love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can quit, boys," [...] he said, {{and turned}} to a man close by. [...] "She must have fallen with the {{shackles}} where the hook can't get hold, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> only about three feet under water." ...|$|R

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling".

She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
6000|$|The father's {{theme was}} touched upon now. [...] "No, poor girl, {{she is in}} bad condition, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> better.

6000|$|... "She'd {{never have}} sent for me, Q., if it wasn't all right," [...] again argued the lady. [...] "She's stiff and hard and proud as piecrust, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> right at bottom." [...] Such was Mrs. Quiverful's verdict about Mrs. Proudie, to which in after times she always adhered. People {{when they get}} their income doubled usually think that those through whose instrumentality this little {{ceremony}} is performed are right at bottom.|$|R
500|$|In a radio {{interview}} with Philadelphia's Power 99FM, Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z spoke in depth {{about the upcoming}} intimate shows and compared her to Michael Jackson stating, [...] "I know that's blasphemy to compare the two because Mike was such an innovator, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> like the second coming. You know, the hard work and dedication that she puts into her shows. It just {{makes you want to}} work harder at your own craft. She's like a machine." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future. De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I {{think it will be a}} lot more fun to play the tension." [...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E

Maybe you don't think you did anything wrong, but then maybe you start getting questioned about it and so forth, and you may perjure yourself. ... Unlike Cunningham, I don't think she set out to violate the law, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was very careless.
