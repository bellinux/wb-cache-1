5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied <b>bacterial</b> <b>transformation</b> systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E

25|$|If, as {{evidence}} indicates, sexual reproduction arose {{very early in}} eukaryotic evolution, the essential features of meiosis may have already been present in the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes. In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in <b>bacterial</b> <b>transformation.</b> For example, recA recombinase, that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in meiotic recombination (see Wikipedia articles RecA, RAD51 and DMC1). Both <b>bacterial</b> <b>transformation</b> and meiosis in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion and DNA damaging conditions. This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active take-up of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see Natural competence) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients’ damaged DNA. If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge {{to the survival of}} early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote to eukaryote transition, and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which <b>bacterial</b> <b>transformation</b> naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen is a {{key element}} in aquatic environments and an {{important}} pond management variable. In aquaculture systems, nitrogen accumulation eventually leads to a deterioration of the system. The interactions between various N-species are complex and difficult to integrate. Modelling can improve our ability to evaluate this complex system. This paper integrates existing knowledge about nitrogen transformations in fish ponds into a model that calculates the amount of various N-compounds in the water column and in the sediment. The model is also used to gain insight into the relative importance of transformation processes between the various N-compounds. The model was divided into three modules: fish, phytoplankton and sediment-water. The fish module is based on physiological and bio-energetic principles. The phytoplankton dynamics module is based on physico-chemical principles of alga growth. The water–sediment module is based on the <b>bacterial</b> <b>transformations</b> and chemical fluxes of N-species across the water–sediment interface. Relationships and parameters were taken from the literature, except for a few parameters that were estimated by fitting model predictions to observed data. The model was implemented in Turbo Pascal (7. 0) using a fixed time step of 1 h and it was calibrated using a set of data from an earthen fish pond stocked with Colossoma macropomum. The validation was performed using data from earthen ponds stocked with Oreochromis niloticus. The difference between the calibrated and validated model was related to the fish species. All concentrations of the various N-species present were simulated well, except the N retained in organic matter in the sediment (average relative error - 0. 34). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the concentrations of inorganic-N compounds, both in the water column and in the sediment, are more affected by changes in specific parameters included in the fish and phytoplankton modules than other forms of nitrogen in the pond. The model works well, except for organic matter accumulation in the sediment.

Further, these studies indicated that the degradation of the OPF dominates the control of DNA release. The retention of DNA bioactivity {{over the course of}} release was demonstrated through <b>bacterial</b> <b>transformations.</b> Subsequent studies characterized the release of plasmid DNA from composites of OPF and cationized gelatin microspheres (CGMS) in vivo, as well as the degradation kinetics of CGMS in these composites. Comparisons between the composite groups and material control groups indicated that the bioavailability of DNA can be extended through release from CGMS encapsulated within OPF, relative to CGMS or DNA solution injection alone, although no difference was observed between the composites and OPF. A related study characterized the release of DNA from the composites of OPF and CGMS in vitro. The results demonstrated that plasmid DNA can be released in a sustained fashion over the course of 49 to 149 days, with the release kinetics depending upon the material composition and the method of DNA loading. Released DNA retained viable structure over the course of release. A final study investigated the release of plasmid DNA encoding an osteogenic protein from composites of OPF and CGMS toward enhancing bone regeneration in a rat calvarial defect model. No enhancement in new bone formation was observed with release of DNA, relative to material controls. However, the reason for the absence of enhancement could not be elucidated in the study.
