Once you've watched it, you have more of a commitment to get the kids off of the steroids. It's not just a business for me. It's a passion of mine."

40|$|After {{conducting}} an extensive analysis {{of both the}} specialised literature and practice and identifying three types of corporate social entrepreneurship in my PhD thesis titled “Corporate social entrepreneurship - the new paradigm of reshaping and rethinking business”, I decided to determine which of the three approaches is mostly suited for the Romanian market. The three types of corporate social entrepreneurship: corporate social entrepreneurship as local development tool, corporate social entrepreneurship as market development tool, and corporate social entrepreneurship as transformational innovation tool were organised as the alternatives of a carefully constructed hierarchy having as criteria: return on investment (which does not necessarily refer to the money that the company invests in the strategy; the term is derived from sustainability and scalability), degree of novelty, pre-entry knowledge and interest in solving the communities’ social problems. The questionnaire constructed based on the hierarchy using analytic hierarchy processes was distributed to experts (<b>business</b> <b>developers)</b> coming from the following industries or sectors: beverages, IT, banking, furniture, and automotive. The research reveals which is the approach {{most likely to be}} employed by Romanian <b>business</b> <b>developers.</b> The results may be inferred to the sum of businesses represented by the expert <b>business</b> <b>developers</b> who were part of the research...|$|R
