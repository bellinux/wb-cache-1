5|$|<b>Billiard</b> <b>balls</b> {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid <b>billiard</b> <b>balls,</b> invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom <b>billiard</b> <b>balls</b> instead of pocket <b>billiard</b> <b>balls.</b> Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E

When a single <b>billiard</b> <b>ball</b> {{arrives at the}} gate through input 0-in or 1-in, it passes through the device {{unobstructed}} and exits via 0-out or 1-out. However, if a 0-in <b>billiard</b> <b>ball</b> arrives simultaneously as a 1-in <b>billiard</b> <b>ball,</b> they collide {{with each other in}} the upper-left-hand corner of the device and redirect each other to collide again in the lower-right-hand corner of the device. One ball then exits via 1-out and the other ball exits via the lower AND-output. Thus, the presence of a ball being emitted from the AND-output is logically consistent with the output of an AND gate that takes the presence of a ball at 0-in and 1-in as inputs.|$|R

An initial description of the situation would be given, with a very precise physical description of the billiard table and balls, as well as initial positions of all the balls. Given a force applied to the cue ball (probably resulting from a player hitting the ball with his or her cue stick), we want to calculate the trajectories, precise motion, and eventual resting places of all the balls with a computer program. A program to simulate this game would consist of several portions, one of which would be responsible for calculating the precise impacts between the <b>billiard</b> <b>balls.</b> This particular example also turns out to be ill conditioned: a small error in any calculation will cause drastic changes in the final position of the <b>billiard</b> <b>balls.</b>|$|E

25|$|Light water {{makes an}} {{excellent}} moderator, the light hydrogen atoms {{are very close}} in mass to a neutron and can absorb {{a lot of energy}} in a single collision (like a collision of two <b>billiard</b> <b>balls).</b> Light hydrogen is also fairly effective at absorbing neutrons, and there will be too few left over to react with the small amount of 235U in natural uranium, preventing criticality. In order to allow criticality, the fuel must be enriched, increasing the amount of 235U to an usable level. In light water reactors, the fuel is typically enriched to between 2% and 5% 235U (the leftover fraction with less 235U is called depleted uranium). Enrichment facilities are expensive to build and operate. They are also a proliferation concern as they can be used to enrich the 235U much further, up to weapons-grade material (90% or more 235U). This can be remedied if the fuel is supplied and reprocessed by an internationally approved supplier.|$|E

A billiard-ball computer consists of a system of synchronized particles (the <b>billiard</b> <b>balls)</b> moving in tracks and guided by a fixed set of obstacles. When the particles collide with each other or with the obstacles, they undergo an elastic collision much as real <b>billiard</b> <b>balls</b> would do. The input to the computer is encoded using {{the presence or absence of}} particles on certain input tracks, and its output is similarly encoded using the presence or absence of particles on output tracks. The tracks themselves may be envisioned as wires, and the particles as being Boolean signals transported on those wires. When a particle hits an obstacle, it reflects from it. This reflection may be interpreted as a change in direction of the wire the particle is following. Two particles on different tracks may collide, forming a logic gate at their collision point.|$|E

During his travels, Adams performed before the Vanderbilts, the Goulds, three U.S. Presidents, the Prince of Wales in London, and the Comte de Paris in Paris. One of the largest matches ever played of any form of billiards took place at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens in 1878. Adams played using his fingers against William Sexton, the reigning cue champion of the world, who used a cue; Adams won the three-day competition in the game of straight rail.|$|E

Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case.
