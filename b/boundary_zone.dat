When the Communist Party eventually took full control of mainland China in 1949, even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution. Many newcomers, especially {{those who had been}} based in the major port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses and shifted their base operations to British Hong Kong. The establishment of a socialist state in China (People's Republic of China) on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland China. In 1951, a <b>boundary</b> <b>zone</b> was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist China.

40|$|Lithological {{boundaries}} {{provide information}} useful for {{activities such as}} mineral and hydrocarbon exploration, water resource surveys, and natural hazard evaluation. Automated detection of lithological boundaries reduces bias inherent in expert interpretation of boundaries and thus improves the reliability of lithological mapping. The Rotation Variant Template Matching (RTM) algorithm was applied to ASTER imagery to detect pre-defined lithological boundaries. Templates incorporating the mineral combinations gypsum-calcite and calcite-illite were designed to detect boundaries between evaporites, marly limestone, and sandstone. The RTM algorithm successfully detected lithological boundaries by rotating the templates over the ASTER imagery. The accuracy of the detected boundaries was spatially assessed using fuzzy set theory. Boundaries from a published geological map and boundaries interpreted from a stereo pair of aerial photos by five experts were used as references for assessing the accuracy. A confidence region unifying spatial errors was defined for the geological map and stereo-pair interpretation to provide <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> from these references. The correspondence between detected boundaries and the <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> of the aerial photo was better than between detected <b>boundaries</b> and <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> of the geological map...|$|R

40|$|Program (ILP), {{provides}} constraints for under-standing continental {{dynamics and}} for quan-tifying seismic hazards in general. To date, the Global Strain Rate Map (GSRM) {{model is a}} nu-merical velocity gradient tensor fi eld solution (i. e., spatial variations of horizontal strain rate tensor components and rotation rates) for the entire Earth surface [Kreemer et al., 2003]. The global model consists of 25 rigid spheri-cal plates and ~ 25, 000 0. 6 ° × 0. 5 ° deformable grid areas within the diffuse plate <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> which lie between these plates (e. g., western North America, central Asia, the Al-pine-Himalaya belt). This model provides {{an estimate of the}} horizontal strain rates, rotation rates, and velocity fields for the diffuse plate <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> as well as an estimate of the motions of the spherical caps. This {{is one of the first}} successful models of its kind that includes the kinematics of plate <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> in the description of global plate kinematics. The vast majority of the data used to obtain this model come from hori-zontal velocity measurements obtained using Global Positioning System (GPS). The latest model (GSRM v. 1. 2) includes 5170 velocities for 4214 sites worldwide (Figure 1). Most geodetic velocities are measured within plate <b>boundary</b> <b>zones.</b> The observed veloci-ties are obtained from 86 different studies; most are published, but also included are online data made available by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) and the U.

40|$|Abstract. A {{significant}} portion of the Earth's surface consists of zones of diffuse deformation. The interior re-gions of these diffuse zones of deformation move at dis-tinctly different velocities from that of adjacent plates, and, because of their complexities, have been ignored in previous no-net-rotation (NNR) models. We have calculated a new NNR model from a continuous veloc-ity field that incorporates both rigid plate motion and velocity gradients within plate <b>boundary</b> <b>zones.</b> When compared with earlier NNR models we find significantly different angular velocities for many plates. Differences between the NNR model presented here and earlier NNR models {{can be attributed to the}} effect of includ-ing velocity gradients in diffuse plate <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> as well as to the actual differences between geodetically derived surface motions and geologic estimates. 1...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{the success}} of plate {{tectonics}} {{can be attributed to the}} near rigidity of tectonic plates and the availability of data that describe the rates and directions of motion across narrow plate boundaries of about 1 to 60 kilometers. Nonetheless, many plate boundaries in both continental and oceanic lithosphere are not narrow but are hundreds to thousands of kilometers wide. Wide plate <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> cover approximately 15 percent of earth's surface area.

40|$|In {{geologic}} {{imaging spectroscopy}} studies, typical end products are often mineral maps. These maps are usually ambiguous {{and form a}} limited method of representing geological information that is potentially contained in spectroscopic images. This situation can be improved by mapping the spatial configuration {{of the effects of}} geological processes instead of the solely individual minerals in a non-spatial context. This so-called process-based mapping opens the way for a truly contextual mapping approach since the spectrally detectable expressions of processes occur in specific spatial arrangements. The contextual approach will solve the ambiguity problem occurring in mineral maps and will facilitate targeting of geologic processes. End products of this approach are not mineral maps but a map of the geological process. A typical geologic process that is suitable for mapping using airborne imaging spectroscopy is submarine hydrothermal fluid circulation. Fluid pathways in fossil hydrothermal systems mark the start, the course, and the end fluid circulation from sites of recharge to sites of discharge. Boundaries between alteration facies along fluid pathways are zones where physico-chemical conditions change and these are required for reconstruction of the affects of hydrothermal processes and fluid pathways. In this paper, we demonstrate that we are able to map the various <b>boundary</b> <b>zones</b> in a fossil hydrothermal system using HyMap hyperspectral imagery in a contextual image processing approach using the RTM algorithm.
