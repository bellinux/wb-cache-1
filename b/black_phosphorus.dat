Electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of the medium and nutrient solutions were determined following standard procedures, as described in USDA and USCC (2001). Bulk density and water holding capacity of the medium were determined according to methods described in Okalebo et al. (2002) and Vengadaramana and Jashothan (2012), respectively. Transplants were sampled (five plants/treatment rep) every 7  days and the following growth parameters measured: leaf chlorophyll content, number of leaves, plant height, root length, stem diameter, shoot dry matter (DM), root DM, and shoot/root ratio. The leaf chlorophyll content was measured using Apogee chlorophyll content meter (Model CCM- 200), plant height and root length (in cm) were measured with a rule, and stem diameter was measured 1  cm above growth medium surface {{with a pair of}} Vernier callipers.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} preparative and {{structural}} studies of silver nitrides are discussed. Ag 3 +xN {{is found to}} adopt a perovskite structure with partially filled A site. For the preparation of such silver nitrides an ammonolysis reaction has been used, and this method has been applied for the synthesis of other noble metal nitrides, such as Pd, Au and Hg nitrides. Attempts for the preparation of ternary nitrides, e. g. silver copper nitride, have also been done, which requires AgCuF 3 as a precursor. AgCuF 3 and its isostructural analogue NaCuF 3 crystallize in a distorted variant of the GdFeO 3 type structure with symmetry. They exhibit interesting magnetic properties, and become typical 1 D antiferromagnets at low temperature, correlated to cooperative Jahn-Teller effect. Cs 2 AgF 4 crystallizes in the K 2 NiF 4 -type structure, and its magnetic and optical properties have been studied. It behaves as a 2 D square-lattice Heisenberg ferromagnet, which is associated with orbital order. CsF has a strong tendency to form fluoride complexes, and includes easily molecules like H 2 O or Br 2. We have studied the possibilities of the inclusion of tetrahedral molecules, e. g. OsO 4 and P 4, into the CsF lattice. From the reaction of CsF with OsO 4 an oxyfluoride, Cs 3 OsO 4 F 3, is formed, which contains [OsO 4 F 2] octahedral units and [Cs 2 F] layers. In contrast, P 4 is not included into the CsF lattice, but transformed into <b>black</b> amorphous <b>phosphorus.</b> In {{the last part of}} my thesis, structural studies have been performed on SiBr 4 (m. p. 278 K), the only tetrahedral EX 4 compound (E = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; X = F, Cl, Br, I) for which no structural data has yet been reported. A full crystal-structure prediction of SiBr 4 by lattice-energy minimizations was done in collaboration with A. Wolf from University Frankfurt am Main. The structures of two polymorphs of SiBr 4, a high temperature phase (Pa- 3) and a low temperature phase (P 21 /c) have been experimentally determined from the refinements of X-ray and synchrotron powder diffraction data as well as single crystal diffraction data. The transition temperature and halogen-halogen interactions of the experimental and calculated structures are discussed.

2500|$|The {{three most}} common arsenic allotropes are {{metallic}} gray, yellow, and black arsenic, with gray {{being the most}} common. Gray arsenic (α-As, space group Rm No. 166) adopts a double-layered structure consisting of many interlocked, ruffled, six-membered rings. Because of weak bonding between the layers, gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low Mohs hardness of 3.5. Nearest and next-nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double-layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 5.73g/cm3. Gray arsenic is a semimetal, but becomes a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.2–1.4eV if amorphized. Gray arsenic {{is also the most}} stable form. Yellow arsenic is soft and waxy, and somewhat similar to tetraphosphorus (...) [...] Both have four atoms arranged in a tetrahedral structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond.

When it is converted to the covalent red phosphorus, the density goes to 2.2-2.4 g/cm3 and melting point to 590 °C, and when white phosphorus is transformed into the (also covalent) <b>black</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> the density becomes 2.69-3.8 g/cm3 and melting temperature ~200 °C.

The supernatant then is centrifuged again at higher speed for another 20 minutes to separate thinner layers of phosphorene (1-7 layers). The precipitate from centrifugation is then redispersed in water and washed several times by deionized water. Phosphorene/water solution is dropped onto silicon with a 280-nm SiO2 surface, where it is further dried under vacuum.
