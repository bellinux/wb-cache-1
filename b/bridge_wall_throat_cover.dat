50|$|Changes {{from the}} {{original}} include the move to polygon-based true 3D computer graphics for track design, and the inclusion of four-player support. Players take control of characters from the Mario universe, who race around a variety of tracks with items that can either harm opponents or aid the user. The move to three-dimensional graphics allowed for track features not possible with the original game's Mode 7 graphics, such as changes in elevation, <b>bridges,</b> <b>walls,</b> and pits. However, the characters and items remained 2D pre-rendered sprites.|$|R
