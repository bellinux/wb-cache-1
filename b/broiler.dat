5|$|The {{introduction}} of the BK <b>Broiler</b> {{was one of the}} most successful product launches in the restaurant industry at the time, encouraging the company look into introducing additional products that would match the success of the <b>Broiler.</b> Furthermore, the success of the product was credited by analysts from Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities as one of the main factors helping Burger King realize a 47% increase in profit margin over the same period in 1989. By 1992, sales of the BK <b>Broiler</b> had slowed to half of what they were at the height of its introduction.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK <b>Broiler,</b> it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK <b>Broiler,</b> the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The BK <b>Broiler</b> was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the company's Sometimes you gotta break the rules campaign designed by the firms of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Saatchi & Saatchi, a campaign that many of Burger King's franchisees derided as ineffectual and unclear in its message. Despite the failure of the advertising campaign, the product went on {{to be one of the}} most successful fast food product launches up to that time.|$|E

40|$|Ascites or {{pulmonary}} hypertension syndrome is a metabolic disorder in <b>broilers.</b> Male <b>broilers</b> {{have a higher}} BW and are therefore expected to be more prone to developing ascites than females. As genetic parameters might {{be affected by the}} ascites incidence, genetic parameters might differ between male and female <b>broilers.</b> The aims of this study were to estimate the heritability for the ratio of right ventricular weight to total ventricular weight (RATIO) and BW in male and female <b>broilers,</b> the genetic correlation between RATIO and BW separately for male and female <b>broilers,</b> and the genetic correlations between BW for ascitic and nonascitic <b>broilers.</b> Data were available from 7, 856 <b>broilers</b> (3, 819 males and 4, 037 females). The <b>broilers</b> in the experiment were kept under a cold temperature regimen and increased CO 2 levels. In this study, we showed that the incidence of ascites is higher in male than in female <b>broilers.</b> Heritability estimates for BW at 7 wk of age were higher for male (0. 22) than for female (0. 17) <b>broilers,</b> and for RATIO heritability, estimates were higher for female (0. 44) than for male (0. 32) <b>broilers.</b> The genetic correlations between RATIO and BW measured at different ages changed from slightly positive at 2 wk of age to moderately negative at 7 wk. The change in genetic correlation was more extreme for male (from 0. 01 to - 0. 62) than for female (from 0. 13 to - 0. 24) <b>broilers.</b> The difference in ascites incidence between male and female <b>broilers</b> is the most likely reason for the difference in genetic correlations. The genetic correlation between BW traits measured in <b>broilers</b> with fluid in the abdomen and without fluid in the abdomen decreased from 0. 91 at 2 wk to 0. 69 at 7 wk. We conclude that under circumstances with ascites, data from male and female <b>broilers</b> should be analyzed separately...|$|R
5|$|The company {{introduced}} its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK <b>Broiler,</b> in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was {{served on a}}n oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK <b>Broiler</b> into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed {{the name of the}} sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new <b>broiler,</b> it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style <b>broiler</b> was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from <b>broiler</b> chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of house type and early feed restriction on performance and fat deposition of unsexed <b>broilers.</b> Four hundreds seven-day old unsexed <b>broilers</b> (Arbor Acres CP 707) were distributed into eight treatment groups. Each treatment group was represented by five replicates of ten <b>broilers</b> each. Two types of house (cage vs litter) and four levels of feeding (ad lib., 75 % ad lib., 50 % ad lib. and 25 % ad lib.) were tested as treatment factors. <b>Broilers</b> were feed-restricted for 6 days from 7 to 13 days of age and thereafter they were fed ad lib. Feed intake of restricted <b>broilers</b> during restriction period was calculated from feed consumed by ad lib. group in the previous day. Results showed that unsexed <b>broilers</b> raised in litter had higher body weight (P< 0. 05), lower abdominal fat and higher triglyceride concentration at 42 days of age (P< 0. 05), and lower liver fat and higher carcass percentage at 56 days of age (P< 0. 05).

5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical <b>broiler</b> chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E

Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E

Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E

5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame <b>broiler,</b> moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in <b>broiler</b> houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E

5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The BK <b>Broiler</b> was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years.

No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and <b>broiler</b> chickens directly to consumers in the north. Also during this time, the State Aid Road Law ushered in a period of highway improvement in which the county would offer road bonds and the state would match. The DSHD would then improve the highway. Most of the highways improved by the DSHD were built as concrete roads, with sharp curves eliminated. The state also took over the last of the private turnpikes and converted them to free roads. In 1926, the state began eliminating several railroad grade crossings and in 1927 the first all-weather secondary roads were constructed, consisting of one concrete lane and one dirt lane in an effort to reduce costs.|$|E

25|$|Arsenic {{is used as}} a feed {{additive}} in poultry and swine production, in particular in the U.S. to increase weight gain, improve feed efficiency, and to prevent disease. An example is roxarsone, which had been used as a <b>broiler</b> starter by about 70% of U.S. <b>broiler</b> growers. The Poison-Free Poultry Act of 2009 proposed to ban the use of roxarsone in industrial swine and poultry production. Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., which produces roxarsone, voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic, a carcinogen, in treated chickens. A successor to Alpharma, Zoetis, continues to sell nitarsone, primarily for use in turkeys.|$|E
40|$|<b>Broilers</b> are {{chickens}} kept commercially under intensive husbandry {{conditions for}} poultry meat production. They grow to a slaughterweight of approximately 2. 2 kg in 6 weeks. <b>Broilers</b> show a pronounced decrease in behavioural activity during their short life. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to gain more insight into the influence of both motivation and ability on behavioural activity in <b>broilers.</b> The distinction between motivation and ability is relevant for the interpretation of behavioural activity in <b>broilers</b> in terms of welfare. <b>Broilers</b> were observed when kept in pens with good facilities and in several ex situ tests where they had to work for food. <b>Broilers</b> showed all normal juvenile chicken behaviours, but the time spent on each behaviour has changed. Many behavioural patterns were shown in a sitting posture instead of in a standing posture. Performance in short physical tasks depended on motivation and physical ability. Hunger and satiety mechanisms have changed compared to layer chickens, but the motivation to work for food still can be manipulated in <b>broilers.</b> <b>Broilers</b> are willing to peck a key many times or to walk long distances to obtain food rewards, but their performance seemed {{to be dependent on}} body weight. Apart from having an abnormal high motivation to eat, <b>broilers</b> are normal biologically functioning animals. Parallel to the effect of overweight on {{the quality of life in}} humans, the abnormal high body weight at a young age has a negative impact on the welfare of <b>broilers.</b> <b>Broilers</b> are restricted to display behaviours for which they are motivated imposed by their high motivation to eat, which is associated with their fast growth and high body weight at young age, or by environmental conditions in which they are usually kept...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Short-term {{acclimation}} to {{high temperatures}} increased resistance of <b>broilers</b> to heat exposure. Two trials {{were conducted to}} determined the effect of acclimation on body temperature (Tb) during heat exposure. <b>Broilers,</b> 46 -days old, were maintained at control or acclimating temperatures for 4 days. The control temperature was a constant 21 C with a 10 C dewpoint, and the acclimating temperature was a diurnal cycle of 24 - 35 - 24 C with a constant 21 C dewpoint. During the 4 th day, <b>broilers</b> of both groups were exposed to temperatures of 41 C and 23 C dewpoint for 210 min. Body temperature was determined {{at the beginning of}} the heat exposure and at 30 -min intervals until the end of the exposure. The Tb of both groups increased throughout heat exposure, but acclimated <b>broilers</b> had significantly lower Tb than control <b>broilers</b> from 90 through 210 min. Acclimated <b>broilers</b> had significantly lower heat stress mortality. The data show that acclimated <b>broiler's</b> Tb rises upon exposure to heat but that acclimation gives the capacity to stabilize Tb above normal Tb. The data also suggest Tb is preferable to mortality as a measure of acclimation in <b>broilers.</b> (Key words: heat stress, temperature, acclimation and mortality...|$|R
