500|$|At one stage, Bradman went 13 {{first-class}} innings {{without a}} century, the longest such spell of his career, prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded his confidence and altered his technique. After three Tests, {{the series was}} one–one and Bradman had scored 133runs in five innings. The Australians travelled to Sheffield and played a warm up game before the Fourth Test. Bradman started slowly and then, [...] "...the old Bradman [...] <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> in the twinkling of an eye, almost". He went on to make 140, with the last 90runs coming in just 45minutes. On {{the opening day of}} the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds), England were out for 200, but Australia slumped to 3/39, losing the third wicket from the last ball of the day. Listed to bat at number five, Bradman would start his innings the next day.|$|E
500|$|The episode saw {{the return}} of several {{characters}} from previous seasons {{and the introduction of}} new characters that had either been mentioned or had some connection to established characters. Joseph Mawle, who was previously cast to play Benjen Stark and was featured in three episodes in the show's first season before disappearing (as he does in the A Song of Ice and Fire series that the show is based on). In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bryan Cogman spoke of the re-introduction of Benjen and Mawle to the show saying [...] "It was great to have Joe Mawle <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> – {{it must have been a}} trip for him to step back into the character after so long – but he's also decidedly not the Benjen of season 1. So that was fun to explore." [...] Mawle had been interviewed in 2013, where he expressed his desire to return to the series.|$|E

In an interview given with Digital Spy, Diederick Santer said: [...] "When Danniella and I first sat down to talk about her return, we discussed a particular storyline with a specific length of contract. These plans haven't changed. Danniella has done brilliantly and I hope that she will be <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> at some point in the future."

[...] Another fundraiser - held for the first time in 2003 - was [...] "Mary Jo's Pancake Breakfast".

2500|$|In July 1999, Colombian {{military}} forces attacked {{the town of}} Puerto Lleras, Colombia where FARC rebels were stationed. Using U.S. supplied aircraft and equipment, and <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> logistical support, Colombian government forces strafed and bombed the town for over 72 hours. In the attack, three civilians were killed, and several others were wounded as the military attacked hospitals, churches, ambulances, and residential areas. FARC rebels were forced to flee the area, and many were killed or wounded. The Colombian government claimed {{that this was a}} significant victory, while human rights groups claimed this as proof that [...] "anti-narcotics" [...] aid, was actually just military aid which was being used to fight a leftist insurgency.|$|R
25|$|Thiệu took a {{cautious}} approach, as did Có and Cang, {{and they were}} pre-empted by Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, an undetected communist double agent, who launched a coup with Phát on a hardline Catholic platform without <b>U.S.</b> <b>backing.</b> <b>With</b> <b>U.S.</b> support against both Khánh and the plotters, Kỳ and Thi put down the coup attempt and then ousted Khánh. This left Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu as the three most prominent members in the new junta. There were claims that Thiệu ordered the military to capture and extrajudicially kill Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, who died in 1965 {{after a series of}} coup attempts between various ARVN officers. Other sources blame Kỳ. During this period, Thiệu became more prominent as other generals fought and defeated one another in coups, which forced several into exile.|$|R
